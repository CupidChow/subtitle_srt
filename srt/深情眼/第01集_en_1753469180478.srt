1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excitingly saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the remaining memories that suddenly burn and scatter

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Assuming there is still if

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The promise will be kept

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that you have my dream

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 16

21
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Yan Meng, actually you don't have to resign

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
From childhood to adulthood

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
This is not the first time you lost to me

24
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
No, in terms of men, you have always been better than me

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
That is, Gou Kai doesn't eat your set

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Jiang Luzhi, I don't mind if you like garbage

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But it's a little unnecessary to come out and disgust people with a piece of garbage

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Pretend to be indifferent if you can't get it

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You are really the same

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's good for you to go back to your hometown

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I am already with Gou Kai

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
It's really not suitable for you to stay in the company

33
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Just this one

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Only men in the mind

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you mean?

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It seems that you don't know yet

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I have introduced all the clients you took away to other companies

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Next time before we get into trouble

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Let's see who the opponent is

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Jiayu, come and help me

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's okay, don't worry about this big box

42
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Take this upstairs

43
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
it is good

44
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Thank you

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Hello

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Sister Yang, me

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Cheng Kai Ran

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Do you have something to do with me?

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I heard that Yan Meng is going back to Ningxue

50
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Why do you still remember this after so many years?

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
He can't come back

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Just called me a few days ago

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Said he bought a house in Jiangbei

54
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
How could he come back?

55
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Come

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Sister Yang

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I won't tell you anything

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yan Meng

60
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Fang Yan

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Why are you back?

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Just now

63
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just now Cheng Kai Ran called me and said

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I don't believe you are coming back

65
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's really endless after so many years

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
How long will you be back this time?

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
How long?

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I quit after staying here for a while

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Cover your shoes, let me use it

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Why did you quit suddenly?

71
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You were beaten

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Who beat you?

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
A man or a woman?

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did you call the police when you went back?

75
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
With your character, you won't suffer any loss

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You won't be a third party, right?

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You suddenly quit and suddenly got beaten

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Let me tell you, as a sister

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I can tolerate you to talk about death once

80
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can talk about thirteen

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
But you can't do that, right?

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Not good

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Fang Yan

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can you be a little confident with me?

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Am I so low standard?

86
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Why don't you say that men are fighting to be a third party for me?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Here, use this

88
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Tell me who it is

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You want to know?

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Tell you

91
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You don't tell me

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You don't love me

93
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't beat me

94
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This is not open

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Go, go, go

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Go to the door

97
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Coming

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nice

100
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Come in

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'll be back in a minute

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You've lost a lot

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Do you know?

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I ordered your favorite

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Nantang crab burger since childhood

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mom, I asked you to get the limited edition

107
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Did you get it?

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I got it in my suitcase

109
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll give it to you later

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nice

111
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Really nice

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Sister, add a dish

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Dr. Gao will be here in a minute

114
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Which Dr. Gao?

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
No one

116
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Just a customer

117
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What do you mean?

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Nothing

119
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
A young man is very good

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Good job

121
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
A doctor

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hot heart

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He just introduced me a big order two days ago

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You're going to be back

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
What's wrong with getting to know a friend more?

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Isn't it a bit too exaggerated?

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I just came back and did this for me

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Sister, you're really

129
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're always thinking about your little business, aren't you?

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm so small in your psychological pattern

131
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm telling you

132
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not in the mood to do this now

133
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
If you force me, I'll leave right away

134
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
No, no, no

135
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Don't talk nonsense

136
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Listen to me

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Meng

138
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The guests will be here in a minute

139
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
We can't be rude

140
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What are you afraid of?

141
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
It's weird

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Our ancestors have been in the snow for several lifetimes

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Look, we three have no children

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Your dad only has you

145
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Such a poisonous Miao Miao

146
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't even dream of it

147
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I was thinking about you going back to Ningcui

148
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Give our family a baby

149
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
OK, let's go

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Go, go, go

151
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Go in

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll be with you

153
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Thank you, congratulations

154
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Mengmeng

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
How about arranging this room?

156
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
This is bought for you by Da Gu Xin

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Meng, let's wash our faces and put on makeup first

158
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Okay, okay, I know

159
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'll be with you

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I see

161
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll wait for you outside

162
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hurry up

163
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Coming

164
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Dr. Gao, welcome

165
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Dr. Gao, welcome

166
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come, come, come

167
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Please come in

168
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Mengmeng

169
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Come, Dr. Gao is here

170
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Dr. Gao, welcome

171
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Hello

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Please come in

173
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Dr. Gao

174
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Come, come, come

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Go, go, go, go

176
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Go, go

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Qiao Er, Dr. Gao is so sensible

178
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
You come and take so much stuff

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Come, sit, sit, sit

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Sit

181
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Mengmeng

182
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
OK, I know

183
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The girl just came back

184
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Dr. Gao

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dr. Gao

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Which department are you in?

187
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm in the bone department

188
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It's tiring to be in the bone department

189
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I used to be in the department of X-ray

190
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They just took me back

191
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Do you want some bananas?

192
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come, some bananas

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll have one too

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No, no, no

195
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'll have one, I'll have one

196
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'll have one

197
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll have one

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll have one

199
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'll have one

200
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'll have one

201
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll have one

202
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What are you doing?

203
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Coming

204
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Take your time

205
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
OK, thank you

206
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Mengmeng, the dinner is ready

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Coming, coming

208
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Almost, almost

209
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Handsome guy, do me a favor

210
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'll pour it for you

211
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's OK

212
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Thank you

213
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
My clothes are dirty

214
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You look so ugly

215
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You're quite strong

216
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Mengmeng, come on

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come on

218
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Come on

219
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why is there a barbecue stall here?

220
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Is it Xie Bao?

221
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Nan Nan moved away long ago

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Several shops have been changed here

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Do you know where it is?

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
How can I know?

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
OK, thank you

226
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You're so rude

227
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Dr. Gao is waiting for you

228
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Come back soon

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sending Yan An to the hospital

230
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll be there soon

231
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You take good care of Dr. Gao

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'll treat him next time

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Xiai Du

234
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Where is Yan Yan now?

235
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
He's not in or in

236
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
No one can act like that

237
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
They want to use the extra money

238
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Get out

239
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Get out

240
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
shady

241
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
What?

242
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I'm checking the fee.

243
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,120
You can't even scan your QR code.

244
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,240
You're still too shy to pay?

245
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,840
You're in love if you have no money.

246
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm not paying. I'm busy.

247
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,560
Bye.

248
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,360
We meet again.

249
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,840
You want WeChat?

250
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,120
No.

251
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,560
I'm looking for this Xie Bao.

252
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,120
But I can't scan your QR code.

253
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,560
I moved out.

254
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,120
Is it far?

255
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,560
It's quite far.

256
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,240
Are you going back?

257
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,520
Burn me a fire.

258
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,920
Okay.

259
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,880
Am I going to sleep?

260
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:19,800
That exactly,

261
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,480
got it.

262
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,600
Be careful.

263
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,680
Let me clean this for you.

264
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,240
Here.

265
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,960
Okay.

266
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,580
Up those yhte

267
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,820
without using my vehicle

268
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:38,920
thank you

269
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:40,280
Nothing

270
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,660
Boss, haha

271
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,140
Coming

272
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,800
Coming

273
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,800
Thank Department

274
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,760
Don't be nervous

275
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,320
Okay

276
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:53,400
Zhenyu comes back

277
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:55,580
Luckily it's you today

278
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,760
Jing nuit is not here

279
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:57,440
Come in and get it

280
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,560
Hello

281
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,240
I just read your message

282
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
The crab tube we ate when we were kids

283
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,720
It seems that the business is not very good

284
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,600
Changed place

285
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,360
Where is the unit

286
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,680
I'll ask you tomorrow

287
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,520
No need, I found it

288
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,800
How did you find it

289
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,360
For a brother

290
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,320
Brother

291
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,520
Yan Yu

292
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Why are you so confident about Zhen Sheng's brother

293
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,760
By the way

294
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,520
If I ask you

295
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,840
Just say you broke your bones

296
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,760
Why did I break my bones again

297
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,840
From childhood to adulthood

298
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:40,360
I have been in your mouth for many times

299
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,200
Does grandma think I can live

300
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,560
It's all because of me

301
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,880
Thank you, thank you

302
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,680
Bye bye

303
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:55,600
Mom

304
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,360
Don't touch me

305
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,480
Hello, can I talk to your WeChat

306
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,280
I'm here

307
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,280
I dropped it.

308
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
Stop.

309
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,840
Come here.

310
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,480
What's wrong?

311
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,280
You're still up?

312
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,960
Watch out for your eyes.

313
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,800
I'll have to buy you a eye cream.

314
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
What's going on?

315
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,760
I was just...

316
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,440
I was just talking to him about some business.

317
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,800
I asked him to help me sell some other health products.

318
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,080
You can't stand me trying so hard, can you?

319
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
I just wanted to introduce you to someone reliable.

320
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,200
Mom.

321
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,280
Mom.

322
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,120
Our Ye family never loses their fans.

323
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,440
If someone comes,

324
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,680
you'll have to run away.

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,680
Mom.

326
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,800
Where do you think you're going?

327
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,600
Can we cut to the chase?

328
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,120
I was so tired from flying all day.

329
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:12,920
I have to go back to my old house to sleep.

330
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
Mengmeng.

331
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,880
Your grandma moved in with your aunt.

332
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,280
Why are you going back to your old house?

333
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,280
Can you live in a house that's been out of service for years?

334
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,200
Are you afraid that Dr. Gao will come to you in a few days?

335
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,520
No, I really don't think it's appropriate.

336
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,200
Didn't I tell you before?

337
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,200
I like people younger than me.

338
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,560
Younger?

339
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,680
What?

340
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,720
After you get married,

341
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,600
you'll have to split the house with me.

342
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,200
Mom, I can't stand that.

343
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,080
Shut up, you idiot.

344
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,080
Go to sleep.

345
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,280
Boss, what do you think?

346
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,880
How old are you looking for someone younger than you?

347
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,360
This thing is not standard.

348
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,640
I don't think it's too young.

349
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,200
I don't think it's too old.

350
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
You...

351
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,200
Oh, right.

352
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,200
I remembered that Ya'an is still in the hospital.

353
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,600
Didn't she break her leg and break her bone?

354
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,600
I have to send her some laundry.

355
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,600
Come back.

356
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,600
I called their house at night.

357
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:06,200
They didn't say anything.

358
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm so angry.

359
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,200
Don't be angry.

360
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,200
I...

361
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
What is this? Who is it?

362
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Fang Ya'an.

363
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
She broke her bone.

364
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,200
What's wrong with you?

365
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Ye Meng.

366
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Ye Meng, you're such a mouthless.

367
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,200
Look at my feet.

368
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,200
What did the doctor say?

369
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,200
You have to keep it anyway.

370
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,200
Ye Meng?

371
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,200
You're Ye's granddaughter, right?

372
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Meng Meng.

373
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
Yes.

374
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
And Ye Meng.

375
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
You moved out of that old house.

376
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,200
It's been six or seven years.

377
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,200
I haven't seen you.

378
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
Grandmother?

379
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Yes.

380
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Yes, I haven't seen you for many years.

381
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
You're so beautiful.

382
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Okay.

383
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Let me introduce you.

384
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
This is my grandson, Li Ba Dou.

385
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Say hello to your sister.

386
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
She's your neighbor.

387
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
When she came to Ning Shui,

388
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
you had already gone to Jiangbei.

389
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,200
You haven't seen her.

390
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Say hello to her.

391
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Hello.

392
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Don't say hello.

393
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,200
She's just a dumb mouth.

394
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,200
She's so stupid.

395
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
You can't even say a word.

396
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
It's okay.

397
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
Grandmother.

398
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,200
What did you do to your leg?

399
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
I just fixed it in the flowerpot two days ago.

400
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
It fell by accident.

401
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
You should have paid attention.

402
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,200
Let's talk.

403
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
Come here.

404
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,200
What?

405
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
You haven't noticed such a handsome younger brother?

406
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Just like that.

407
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
You call it just like that?

408
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
You have a high taste.

409
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
You're tired, right?

410
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I like a good boy.

411
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Ba Dou.

412
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I want to buy some wine.

413
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I can't afford it.

414
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,200
Let Xiao Xiao buy it.

415
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,200
Xiao Xiao can afford it.

416
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
Why should she buy it?

417
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Aren't you two in a relationship of boyfriend and girlfriend?

418
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
By the way,

419
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
aren't you celebrating your birthday in two days?

420
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
You can buy it as a birthday gift.

421
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
I just got together with her

422
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
and asked her for a birthday gift.

423
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,200
Do you think it's appropriate?

424
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,200
If you don't like her, just tell me.

425
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
I'll introduce another one to you.

426
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
Right.

427
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Aunt Liu's granddaughter is very good.

428
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,200
She has a house and a car.

429
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
She doesn't need a financial support.

430
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
You can pay her.

431
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
She has to give you 300,000 yuan.

432
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,200
How about this?

433
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Just sell me.

434
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
You can decide how much money to sell.

435
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,200
You can have the money after selling.

436
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
Then you can take this money

437
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
to eat, drink, play, travel around the world.

438
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I'll go to be someone's son-in-law.

439
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
Take care of everyone.

440
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Are you satisfied?

441
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,200
Get out.

442
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
Wan Wan.

443
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
Go to see your grandma.

444
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,200
I'll call Fei.

445
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
And put on your earphones.

446
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,200
This is the hospital's public.

447
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,200
What should I insert?

448
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I can insert it, right?

449
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,200
You're really handsome and pretty tall.

450
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I'm tall. You can call me.

451
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,200
You're handsome. Look at you.

452
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,200
I'll show you.

453
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,200
I'll show you.

454
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,200
I'm so upset.

455
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,200
You're not angry.

456
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
Sister.

457
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,200
Your brother is really Li Ba Dou?

458
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,200
That's a small name.

459
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Don't look at him now.

460
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,200
My grandma told me

461
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
he was black and thin when he was young.

462
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,200
Like a little Ba Dou.

463
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,200
We've been calling him until now.

464
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
His real name is Li Jing Yu.

465
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
Jing is a ge family.

466
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,200
A gold rain is the rain on the island.

467
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,200
I'm his cousin.

468
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,200
Sister.

469
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,200
I just heard from grandma.

470
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,200
His girlfriend is Xiao Jiang, right?

471
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Why doesn't she come?

472
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,200
She works in Jiangbei.

473
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
She doesn't have time.

474
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
I like her.

475
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,200
She's pretty and has a good annual income.

476
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Her surname is Jiang, right?

477
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Is she a local?

478
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,200
Yes.

479
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
She's also from Ni Sui.

480
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
She's not Jiang Lu Zhi, right?

481
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,200
Yes.

482
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
You know her?

483
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Isn't she amazing?

484
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,200
I heard that her salary has doubled recently.

485
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,200
She seems to jump to a service consulting company

486
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,200
to be a project manager.

487
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Service consulting company?

488
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Yes, that's the name.

489
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Isn't that your company?

490
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Thank you, sister.

491
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,200
It's okay.

492
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,200
Let's play.

493
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
You quit this time because of Jiang Lu Zhi, right?

494
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,200
Yes.

495
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
He came to our company empty-handed

496
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,200
and took my project.

497
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
I worked hard with my team

498
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,200
and got clients for half a year.

499
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
I gave it to him directly.

500
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
You're so embarrassed that Jiang Lu Zhi

501
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
hit you on your face?

502
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,200
Don't let me see that woman.

503
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,200
Don't worry.

504
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,200
She's worse than me.

505
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,200
You're a loser!

506
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
You're a loser!

507
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
Jiang Lu Zhi, you're a loser!

508
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
How dare you hit me?

509
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,200
What are you looking at?

510
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,200
You're going to dig my eyes out.

511
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,200
You're so annoying.

512
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,200
Shut up.

513
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,200
Fine.

514
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Don't be so loud.

515
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,200
I won.

516
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
I'll give you a thumbs-up.

517
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I knew you wouldn't get bullied.

518
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,200
Thank you.

519
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,080
I'm sorry.

520
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,160
Wenwen,

521
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,680
don't rush about the contract.

522
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,560
I'll go ask Mr. Gou.

523
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,920
Is Mr. Gou here?

524
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:02,800
He's here.

525
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,080
Are you afraid of it itching, Mr. Gou?

526
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,040
No.

527
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,040
Are you afraid of it itching?

528
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,440
Aren't you afraid of it itching?

529
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

530
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,000
May I help you?

531
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Hello, Ms. Lu.

532
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,120
Let me introduce you.

533
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,640
Ye Meng.

534
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,960
Mr. Jiang.

535
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,480
You two must have known each other before.

536
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,960
We know each other.

537
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,320
It's been a long time.

538
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,360
Lu Zhi

539
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,560
officially joined our company today.

540
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
He will be in charge of the project

541
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,120
you're working on.

542
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,920
What do you mean?

543
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,120
Our team worked hard on this project for half a year

544
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,040
and you gave it to him?

545
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,720
I'm not doing it for you.

546
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm doing it for you.

547
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,720
Lu Zhi may be more compatible

548
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,040
with the client.

549
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,760
That's how you communicate, right?

550
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,160
Okay.

551
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,600
You guys continue.

552
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,560
I'll bother you.

553
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,000
Brother.

554
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,880
Is your girlfriend Jiang Lu Zhi?

555
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,240
What's wrong?

556
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,280
She has another boyfriend

557
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,960
in Jiangbei.

558
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:19,680
So?

559
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,880
So she betrayed him.

560
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,120
Are you telling me this

561
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,120
to repay me

562
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,320
or are you having a grudge against her?

563
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:37,800
Let me guess.

564
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,640
She

565
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,120
has been with you before?

566
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,520
You may not know me well

567
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,520
since you just met me.

568
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,040
I'm actually a trashy person.

569
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,680
I want to be popular

570
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,200
but I don't need to have a good reputation.

571
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:58,960
Brother, you're not only sick

572
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,320
but also have bad eyes.

573
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,560
I can't stand men who I like.

574
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,160
I'll get it done for you.

575
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,120
Where did you go?

576
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,960
Xiao Fei.

577
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,920
When that brother came back just now,

578
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,840
he looked so ugly.

579
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,560
Did you do something to him?

580
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,600
I didn't do anything.

581
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,840
Why do you miss me so much?

582
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,520
I'm just a little girl.

583
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,480
I'm not a girl.

584
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,600
I know you.

585
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,680
What do you know about me?

586
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,480
I don't know.

587
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:53,160
Alright.

588
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,360
What about tomorrow's home training?

589
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,360
I'll send him.

590
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,400
Don't worry.

591
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,440
My mom is at home.

592
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,240
Go back now.

593
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,640
I'm leaving.

594
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,440
Go to bed early.

595
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,520
It can also lead to sleep and pus.

596
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:17,800
Wait.

597
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,120
Are your teeth tangy too, brother?

598
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm not sure.

599
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
I don't know.

600
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
I'm not sure.

601
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,200
Then guess.

602
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
My four pockets.

603
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,200
Which pocket has sugar?

604
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,200
I'll give you the answer.

605
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
You're lying.

606
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,200
There must be no sugar in both of them.

607
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,200
I obviously saw that you took it out from your clothes pocket.

608
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
I'm not lying.

609
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,200
I have sugar in all four pockets.

610
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,200
You guess.

611
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,200
Then I'll choose this one.

612
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
There's really sugar.

613
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,200
Brother, you're the richest person I've ever seen.

614
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,200
There's sugar in all four pockets.

615
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
I don't even have a pocket.

616
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,200
I'm lying.

617
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
This is the last piece of sugar.

618
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Remember to brush your teeth after eating.

619
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,200
Otherwise, these teeth will be removed tomorrow.

620
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,200
Brother, which ward do you live in?

621
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
Can I play with you?

622
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I think you're cool.

623
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,200
Your clothes are all black.

624
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
It's like...

625
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,200
The crybaby in the movie, The Emperor's messenger.

626
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
You're trying to trick me into eating my sugar, aren't you?

627
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,200
I don't have to come every day to see your mood.

628
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,200
Fine.

629
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I'll go first.

630
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
Otherwise, mom will say I'm disobedient again.

631
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
Goodbye, Emperor's messenger.

632
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I heard that my sister has a boyfriend in Jiangbei.

633
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,200
Do you owe me an explanation?

634
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,200
I'll buy you some more fruit.

635
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Okay.

636
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,200
Milk.

637
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Okay.

638
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Bye.

639
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
I'm sorry.

640
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I'll go in first.

641
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Okay.

642
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I'll go in first.

643
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,200
Okay.

644
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
Bye.

645
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,200
Bye.

646
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,200
Bye.

647
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,200
Bye.

648
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,200
Bye.

649
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Bye.

650
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,200
Bye.

651
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,200
Bye.

652
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,200
Bye.

653
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,200
Sorry, our machine is broken today.

654
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Let me calculate it.

655
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
Okay.

656
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Nineteen.

657
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Forty.

658
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Fifty-eight.

659
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
Fifty-five.

660
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
One hundred and seventy-eight.

661
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,200
Yes, yes, yes.

662
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,200
That's the number.

663
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,200
It's not bad to calculate it.

664
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
Thank you.

665
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,200
Be careful.

666
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Here.

667
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,200
Sixty-eight.

668
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Wait a minute.

669
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,200
I didn't expect to be a social worker for so many years.

670
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
I came here to be your bull.

671
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,200
I'm under your curse.

672
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
Shouldn't you serve me?

673
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,200
Sorry, sorry.

674
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,200
What is it?

675
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,200
I won't eat it now.

676
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,200
I have something to ask you.

677
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
Did Chen Kaishen find you recently?

678
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
No.

679
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,200
That's okay.

680
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
Don't go out recently.

681
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,200
Let's talk when I'm discharged.

682
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
Sister.

683
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Grandma.

684
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,200
Don't touch it.

685
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,200
You know that doctor?

686
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,200
I always see you.

687
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,200
You know Li Baidong?

688
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,200
I'm afraid that Chen Jianglu is my boyfriend.

689
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,200
I'll pass all the people he has.

690
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,200
Don't worry.

691
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,200
You're right.

692
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,200
Ex-boyfriend.

693
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,200
It's okay.

694
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Who kicked him?

695
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Just act.

696
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,200
Just act here.

697
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
What did you do?

698
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,200
Don't you have a number in your heart?

699
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,200
What did I do?

700
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,200
You're not a man who cares about the business.

701
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,200
You're moved by Li Jinyu

702
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,200
just because he's Chen Jianglu's boyfriend.

703
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
How do you know they broke up?

704
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,200
Last night,

705
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,200
because of the breakup,

706
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,200
Grandma Tao lost Li Jinyu overnight.

707
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
I think

708
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
it has nothing to do with Li Jinyu.

709
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,200
You shouldn't go.

710
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
It's okay.

711
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
What's that?

712
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
I'm helping him.

713
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,200
He should thank me.

714
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
Okay.

715
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,200
I'm the one who's responsible.

716
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,200
I'll apologize to him.

717
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
Okay.

718
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Poor brother.

719
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Let me help you.

720
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,200
What are you rushing?

721
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
I'm coming.

722
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,200
Okay.

723
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,200
I'll go out.

724
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,200
Sister.

725
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
I want to ask

726
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
where your brother works.

727
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Cheers.

728
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Cheers.

729
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Welcome to the city hall.

730
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,200
What are you going to sing tonight?

731
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,200
I'm not sure.

732
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,200
Brother,

733
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
come out for a while.

734
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,200
I have something to tell you.

735
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,200
I'm sorry.

736
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
I'm sorry.

737
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
I'm sorry.

738
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
I'm sorry.

739
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I'm sorry.

740
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I'm sorry.

741
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Brother, come out for a while.

742
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,200
I have something to tell you.

743
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I'm sorry.

744
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
What's up?

745
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,200
Actually, I...

746
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,200
You answer it first.

747
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Hello.

748
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I just saw the WeChat message you sent.

749
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
I'm sorry, Jie Yu.

750
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Congratulations.

751
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
I'll explain the details when I get back.

752
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,200
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I know.

754
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Is there anything else?

755
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
I'm sorry.

756
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
I've been busy these days.

757
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I didn't inform you at the first time.

758
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,200
But you're hiding this from me.

759
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
Are you satisfied?

760
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,200
Don't bother me.

761
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
No, brother, don't do this.

762
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,200
I know it's hard to eat.

763
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,200
I'm sorry.

764
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,200
I'm sorry.

765
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,200
I'm sorry.

766
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
Why didn't it work?

767
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,200
Did a woman just come out?

768
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I didn't see it.

769
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,200
Did a woman just go in?

770
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,200
This is a female side.

771
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
You said...

772
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,200
Brother, this is a male side.

773
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,200
You go this way.

774
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,200
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

775
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,200
Brother, brother, brother, come out.

776
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,200
You're loose.

777
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Brother, I know you're in there.

778
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Come out quickly.

779
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,200
You get out of my way.

780
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,200
Brother, brother, brother.

781
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
Brother, brother, brother.

782
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
Is there a woman inside?

783
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Calm down.

784
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,200
What are you doing?

785
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Don't blame me.

786
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
I didn't tell the boss.

787
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
I'm the boss here.

788
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Who's going to take you?

789
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
What kind of boss are you?

790
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,200
I'll tell you this.

791
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Every day, ten customers come here and say they're the boss.

792
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Go out quickly.

793
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
What are you doing?

794
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Get out of the way.

795
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,200
I know you're in there.

796
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,200
Come out quickly.

797
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Do you need help?

798
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Isn't this obvious?

799
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,200
Thank you.

800
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,200
Call me brother.

801
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,200
I don't like people calling me brother.

802
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,200
Do you think I can't help it?

803
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,200
Do you have to ask me to pay attention to my brother?

804
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,200
Take your hands off.

805
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,200
What are you still standing there for?

806
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Hurry up.

807
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Come on.

808
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Come on.

809
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Try harder.

810
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,200
Move up a little bit.

811
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,200
Go to the window and have a look.

812
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,200
Put me down.

813
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
There's someone outside.

814
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Lao Zhao, who did this?

815
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Come on.

816
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,200
Captain Wang.

817
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,200
You're so rude.

818
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,200
You're so rude.

819
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,200
Hurry up.

820
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Don't move.

821
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,200
Hurry up.

822
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Come here.

823
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Ye Bo.

824
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Ye Bo, come out quickly.

825
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

826
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
What boyfriend?

827
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,200
Hurry up and think of a way.

828
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Take off your clothes.

829
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,200
What are you doing?

830
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Take off your coat and shoes.

831
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Wear mine.

832
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
Take off your clothes.

833
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Ye Bo, you're so rude.

834
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
How can you be so rude?

835
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Ye Bo.

836
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Ye Bo.

837
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
Ye Bo.

838
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
Sit down.

839
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200
Ye Bo.

840
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,200
Sit down.

841
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Ye Bo.

842
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,200
Sit down.

843
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,200
Sit down.

844
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,200
Sit down.

845
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,200
Sit down.

846
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Sit down.

847
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,200
Sit down.

848
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,200
Sit down.

849
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Sit down.

850
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
I'll be serious later.

851
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,200
Lao Zheng.

852
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Why are you so noisy?

853
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Get in.

854
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,200
I know.

855
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Let me go.

856
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Let me go.

857
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Who wants to get into trouble?

858
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,200
I tell you,

859
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
I'm the boss here.

860
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,200
I went in to see if there was a friend of mine

861
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,160
Go to the toilet.

862
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,720
No matter what,

863
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,320
go back and drink.

864
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,160
He's really our boss.

865
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,880
Let's go.

866
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,280
And you.

867
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,080
Tomorrow, you'll get your pay.

868
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,240
Don't let anyone see you.

869
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,080
Get out!

870
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,040
Ye Miao!

871
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,240
Ye Miao!

872
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,200
What's wrong, Kai?

873
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,640
What are you doing here?

874
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,160
What do you think?

875
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,600
Can you stop doing this in my store?

876
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,400
A woman came in just now.

877
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,320
Did you see that?

878
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,600
I didn't notice.

879
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,960
I was paying attention to the inside.

880
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,160
Who knows what's going on outside?

881
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,320
I shouted so loudly.

882
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,400
Didn't you hear it?

883
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,200
No.

884
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,320
What's the name of the other half

885
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,320
inside you?

886
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,960
I don't know. I haven't asked.

887
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:38,600
You don't know?

888
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,800
You're so poor.

889
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,680
Let me see.

890
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,840
Where's the dress?

891
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,600
Let me see.

892
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,200
Is she the girl I knew before?

893
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:45,840
Okay?

894
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,400
Let me see.

895
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,080
You really don't wear clothes?

896
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,600
Sorry.

897
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,840
Sorry, Miss.

898
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,480
You're so bold.

899
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,960
Enough, Kai.

900
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,640
Save me some face.

901
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,440
I'm so shameless.

902
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,560
I'll be shot if I'm shot.

903
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,880
She's a girl.

904
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,160
How can she live in the town?

905
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,840
Right?

906
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,480
Where can she hide?

907
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,600
What are you doing?

908
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:15,680
Excuse me.

909
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,440
Why are you shooting?

910
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,240
Why are you shooting so loudly?

911
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:23,320
Stop it.

912
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,440
She's gone.

913
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:36,480
Thank you.

914
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,760
Can you help me take off my clothes?

915
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,960
Until when?

916
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,040
Until the first day of school.

917
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,440
Until when?

918
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,840
Since the first day of school.

919
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:58,160
You're getting on the wrong track too early.

920
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,120
Try to enroll.

921
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,160
At the middle of the school year.

922
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,120
Get a promotion.

923
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,160
Of course.

924
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:10,000
You buy some

925
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,960
at the sales講ham whole.

926
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,400
The silence of love

927
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:51,080
is actually more sad than anyone else.

928
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,680
Though I have so much to say,

929
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,440
I won't turn back and just walk.

930
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,120
I can't control no more.

931
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:11,640
I don't want to explain.

932
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,240
I don't want to say anything that hurts.

933
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:21,560
I don't want to make you sad.

934
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,080
Mr.älti

935
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,200
You

936
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,200
You

937
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,840
You

938
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:59,560
You

939
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:05,400
I hear that you are an invalid

940
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:10,860
My heart is torn in martyr

941
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Where should I go?

942
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:19,860
How should I avoid

943
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:25,860
those memories about you?

944
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:36,860
I'm so deep in love that I can't get rid of you

945
00:44:36,860 --> 00:44:42,860
I'm silent and look back at the flowers

946
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:49,860
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading

947
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:59,860
I pretend to be firm but I'm still obsessed with the origin

948
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:07,860
The most perfect lies, they all deceive themselves

949
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:13,860
If we just let go, we will lose our connection

950
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:24,860
Why is it that in the moment of tears, my heart still yearns?

951
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:34,860
I'm silent and look back at the flowers
