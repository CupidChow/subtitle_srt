1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excitingly saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, I forget

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You touch me

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if it has never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember which one has my dream

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Grandma, look at the camera and work harder

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Come on, one, two, three, up

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Ok ok ok

22
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Row

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Old lady's review, love love love

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Love

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Old lady's walk, love love love

26
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Love

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Old lady goes to the toilet, love love love

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No need to take pictures

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Old lady eats bananas, love love love

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Love

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Old lady plays with the little ones, love love love

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Love

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Where are you? Send me a location

34
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
There is a reward

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Almost there

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm scared to death

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why are you so fast?

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Of course, you have to be faster to get the reward

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
OK, go pick it up

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Three plus one, five is still ok

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
What is the lucky star? Why are you shy?

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'm so scared

43
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm scared

44
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm scared

45
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm scared

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm scared

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'm scared

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'm scared

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm scared

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm scared

51
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm scared

52
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I sold the egg

53
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll go and buy an egg

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
What do you mean?

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I sold the egg

56
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I thought you were in love

57
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
So you don't need a sister

58
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I am a meat, meat, meat

59
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
A drink

60
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Who didn't let you eat

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Say, my face is not handsome

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Is she pretty enough or not?

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,240
She can't even get a good shot

64
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,680
when she's in such a good mood.

65
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,240
Yeah.

66
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,480
You're in such a good shape.

67
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,120
Why are you wearing a sportswear?

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,120
It's comfortable.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,720
Come here.

70
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,760
Come here.

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,160
I'm telling you, I'm experienced.

72
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,680
Come here.

73
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,800
Listen, I'm telling you.

74
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,400
I...

75
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,560
You're married and you're a widow.

76
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,960
How do you know that?

77
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,720
You...

78
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:48,360
You're a beautiful woman.

79
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,160
I think you...

80
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,960
It's none of your business.

81
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
Just listen to me.

82
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,640
I promise

83
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,600
Li Jin Yu will be a man tonight.

84
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,320
And I'm not satisfied with your outfit today.

85
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,800
Come here. I'll find you a new one.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,200
You're wearing a nice outfit.

87
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,120
It's none of your business.

88
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't have a brother.

89
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,960
You're wearing a suger-like outfit.

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,480
And you're wearing it for me.

91
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,320
You're working.

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,600
You're so naughty.

93
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,120
I have to make it to market.

94
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,400
These days, I spend much money buying stuff.

95
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
According to the sales旅遊DIO,

96
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,240
we've been operating for half a year.

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,220
We've been able to use great price interest.

98
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,320
It's my side-by-side experience,

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,760
but пров albeit taking in more.

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,840
omb of goods for us.

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,960
In the last ten months,

102
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,600
we will increase our yells

103
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Hello, everyone.

104
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,600
This is...

105
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
This is my agent, Wang.

106
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,600
I'm leaving.

107
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Okay, take care.

108
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Hello, I'll help you pack.

109
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,600
How much is it?

110
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,600
It's 2.99 yuan in total. Thank you.

111
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,600
Are you all ready?

112
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,600
Okay, I'm holding it.

113
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,600
Miss Sheng, it's ready.

114
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,600
Are you nervous?

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,600
A little.

116
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
It's okay.

117
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
Okay, thank you.

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,600
Okay, thank you.

119
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Okay, thank you.

120
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,600
Okay, thank you.

121
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Okay.

122
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,600
Is it nearby?

123
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,600
It's nearby.

124
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,600
In five minutes.

125
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Okay.

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,600
Hello, I'll send you the location right now.

127
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,600
Come here.

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Okay.

129
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,600
Why are you so late?

130
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
You're not cold at all.

131
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,600
It's okay.

132
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Why are you looking for me?

133
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I just saw Xiao Man.

134
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
She went in with two men.

135
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
It's her agent.

136
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,600
She's got a camera in her hand.

137
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,600
She's probably going to shoot.

138
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
You've been standing here for so long

139
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,600
just to tell me this.

140
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,600
She probably

141
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
doesn't care about her star dream.

142
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I thought you were going to tell me again.

143
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,600
No.

144
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,600
They're holding this bag in their hands.

145
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
It's a underwear inside.

146
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
Man Man, this is the costume for today's shoot.

147
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,600
Thank you, brother.

148
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,600
Thank you.

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Brother,

150
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
aren't we shooting an advertisement?

151
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,600
Isn't this an advertisement?

152
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,600
Brother, I'm sorry.

153
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,600
I probably can't shoot this kind of thing.

154
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,600
Aren't you wasting your time?

155
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,600
Old Li,

156
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,600
it must be hard for a little girl

157
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,600
to shoot something like this for the first time.

158
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,600
Come on, sit down.

159
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Sit down.

160
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,600
Look,

161
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
you've paid the training fee.

162
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,600
This part is your net loan.

163
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
The interest is so high.

164
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
There's another part.

165
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,600
The company thinks you have potential

166
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,600
and support.

167
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
The company helped you post a part.

168
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,600
The rest of the part

169
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,600
is not agreed

170
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,600
to shoot an advertisement to pay.

171
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,600
Isn't it?

172
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Besides,

173
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,600
now Man Man

174
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
is not all

175
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,600
a lot of advertising.

176
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Even the big stars are shooting.

177
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,600
You have to work in this industry.

178
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
The professional professionalism

179
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
of the company

180
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
must be there.

181
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,600
In a big way,

182
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
this is to get off the ground.

183
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Isn't it?

184
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,600
Man Man,

185
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,600
if you really don't want to shoot,

186
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
you can relax.

187
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
We won't force you.

188
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
But you have to think about it.

189
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
You paid so much money before,

190
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
and you still ran to the net loan.

191
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
And the training fee,

192
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
we definitely won't return it.

193
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
You've paid so much.

194
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Now you're just one step away from your dream.

195
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,600
Are you willing to give up?

196
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I'm willing to give up.

197
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,600
I'm willing to give up.

198
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I'm willing to give up.

199
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,600
I'm willing to give up.

200
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I'm willing to give up.

201
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,600
I'm willing to give up.

202
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I'm willing to give up.

203
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm willing to give up.

204
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,600
I'm willing to give up.

205
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm willing to give up.

206
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
I'm willing to give up.

207
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,600
I'm willing to give up.

208
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,600
I'm willing to give up.

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,600
I'm willing to give up.

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
I'm willing to give up.

211
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,600
I'm willing to give up.

212
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I'm willing to give up.

213
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm willing to give up.

214
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I'm willing to give up.

215
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,600
I'm willing to give up.

216
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
I'm willing to give up.

217
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,600
I'm willing to give up.

218
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,600
I'm willing to give up.

219
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I'm willing to give up.

220
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Brother.

221
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,600
You really want to live here forever?

222
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,600
Yes.

223
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,600
Isn't this pretty good?

224
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Good?

225
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,600
In such a small place,

226
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
what can you do?

227
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,600
I don't miss you.

228
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I want to go to big cities and see.

229
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
I want to be alone for a while.

230
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I want to go to big cities and see.

231
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
You can go.

232
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
I want to be alone for a while.

233
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,600
Brother.

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Do you really want to stay here forever?

235
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,600
Yes.

236
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,280
Look, the world outside is so bustling.

237
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,880
There must be something I want to find.

238
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:02,520
leg

239
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:20,880
Mom!

240
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
My business card.

241
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,380
for your

242
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:37,500
But honestly..

243
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,440
I'm afraid that my baby

244
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,380
will be like that

245
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,960
When would you identifier

246
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,040
will go,

247
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,520
someone

248
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
I didn't order takeout.

249
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Open the door.

250
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,520
I didn't order takeout.

251
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,520
What are you doing?

252
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
Man Man.

253
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
What are you doing?

254
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,520
What are you doing?

255
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,520
Let me go.

256
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Let me go.

257
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,520
How are you?

258
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,520
I want to go to the big city.

259
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
The world outside is so prosperous.

260
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
There must be something I want to find.

261
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
I've already seen it for you.

262
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,520
Nothing is different.

263
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,520
That's because you don't want to go see it at all.

264
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,520
You were born there.

265
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
You got everything you wanted.

266
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,520
Of course you don't want to go.

267
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,520
How about we go to the big city together?

268
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,520
We can take care of each other.

269
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,520
No.

270
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
It's okay.

271
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,520
One day, I'll go by myself.

272
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
Man Man.

273
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
Drink some water.

274
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,520
I've already told your brother.

275
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,520
He's not going to drink it.

276
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,520
He's not going to drink it.

277
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,520
He's not going to drink it.

278
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
He's not going to drink it.

279
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,520
I've already told your brother.

280
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:47,520
Sleep here tonight.

281
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:48,520
Okay?

282
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,520
Okay.

283
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,520
Don't cry.

284
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,520
Your brother has already got the money for the fraud.

285
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,520
Those two people were also caught.

286
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
And those photos.

287
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,520
Your brother has taken care of them.

288
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
I'll go.

289
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,520
Do you want to hear the story of me in Jiangbei?

290
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
I almost didn't tell your brother about it.

291
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,520
It's embarrassing to say it.

292
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
It's more embarrassing than you are now.

293
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,520
My family thought I was doing well in Jiangbei.

294
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,520
But actually, everyone who started a business in Jiangbei is almost the same.

295
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,520
For a house.

296
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
I worked day and night.

297
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,520
Work overtime.

298
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,520
Drink hard.

299
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
Sometimes I even have to be taken advantage of.

300
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,520
But even if this happens.

301
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,520
I don't dare to resign for my bonus.

302
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
Because I'm still a little short.

303
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
I always thought I could get it out.

304
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Until Jiang Lu Zhi appeared.

305
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,520
It's your brother's ex-girlfriend.

306
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
He seduced my boss.

307
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,520
He got a job in my company.

308
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,520
He took my project.

309
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,520
But I can't admit it.

310
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,520
I resigned.

311
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,520
Then you just let it go?

312
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,520
Of course I can't just let it go.

313
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,520
I messed up the project.

314
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Jiang Lu Zhi waited for me at the boss's office.

315
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
He planned to laugh at me.

316
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,520
And he deleted my face.

317
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,520
Then I fought with him.

318
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,520
Delete his face.

319
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,520
Throw away his wig.

320
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
And then gave him a foot.

321
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
It's a bad thing.

322
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,520
Sister Yan Wang, you're really bitter.

323
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,520
But you didn't see.

324
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I cried on my way back to Ning Cui.

325
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Many years of hope has been lost.

326
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,520
Many years of hard work has been lost.

327
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,520
I can only go back to Ning Cui.

328
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,520
I was in the same mood as you are now.

329
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
But look at me now.

330
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,520
I'm not sitting here.

331
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
I'm not a good person.

332
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,520
I'm not sitting here.

333
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,520
I even met your brother.

334
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,520
You will think what I did at that time.

335
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,520
It's so stupid.

336
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
Of course not.

337
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,520
That's fine.

338
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
We want to leave the town.

339
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
But to pursue our dreams in a bigger city.

340
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
There is nothing wrong.

341
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,520
It's all wrong.

342
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Those bad people who use us.

343
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
I even think this happened today.

344
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
It's not a bad thing.

345
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:56,520
But this world is teaching you to grow up.

346
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Okay.

347
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Don't be sad because of these unworthy people.

348
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Okay?

349
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,520
Actually, I'm sad for myself.

350
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,520
You have been to Jiangbei.

351
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,520
Have realized your dreams.

352
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Even if you're not here now.

353
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,520
As long as you are willing.

354
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,520
You can start over at any time.

355
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
But I'm different.

356
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,520
I've been living in Ningxue since I was born.

357
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
This time I thought I could finally

358
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,520
cross my dream and make it to the end.

359
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
And then?

360
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,520
I really feel stupid.

361
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,520
But I really don't want to hide here like my brother.

362
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Maybe an ordinary person like me.

363
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
Is not worthy of my dream.

364
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Who?

365
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,520
It's me.

366
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,520
Who?

367
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,520
You finally want to call me.

368
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
I miss you so much.

369
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,520
Who is so excited tonight?

370
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,520
Sa Beitian.

371
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
A person who has been betrayed.

372
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Why is he so excited?

373
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
I...

374
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
I'm sorry.

375
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,520
I'm sorry.

376
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
I'm sorry.

377
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Hello.

378
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,520
Where are you?

379
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,520
I'm going to play with you.

380
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,520
I'm still in Ningxue.

381
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,520
I want you to do me a favor.

382
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,520
Do you know any good music school?

383
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,520
My cousin wants to learn.

384
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,520
OK. It's a small thing.

385
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,520
I have it.

386
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,520
When will you come back?

387
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,520
I'm not going back.

388
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Why don't you come back?

389
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Do you have a girlfriend over there?

390
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,520
You really have a girlfriend?

391
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,520
Yes.

392
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
You really have a girlfriend?

393
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,520
Who? Where?

394
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Don't ask.

395
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,520
This Sa Beitian.

396
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
He really has a girlfriend.

397
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
Who is so restless at night?

398
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,520
The company's money is not free.

399
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,520
Waste.

400
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
Pretending to be poor.

401
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,520
So poor.

402
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,520
How is it?

403
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,520
He is much better.

404
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,520
He asked me to tell you not to worry about him.

405
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Thank you today.

406
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,520
I'm sorry.

407
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,520
I'm sorry.

408
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,520
I'm sorry.

409
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,520
I'm sorry.

410
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,520
I'm sorry.

411
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,520
I'm sorry.

412
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
I'm sorry.

413
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
I'm sorry.

414
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,520
I'm sorry.

415
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,520
How do you thank me?

416
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,520
How do you want me to thank you?

417
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,520
What are you doing?

418
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,520
Mosaic code.

419
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,520
Focus.

420
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:13,520
OK.

421
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,520
W.

422
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,520
X.

423
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,520
M.

424
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,520
L.

425
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,520
B.

426
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,520
W.

427
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:27,520
X.

428
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,520
I want to scold the boss.

429
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,520
OK.

430
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,520
That boss is really very good.

431
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm listening.

432
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,520
What boss?

433
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
I mean us.

434
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,520
Us.

435
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,520
About us two.

436
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,520
Yes.

437
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,520
Then I have to guess.

438
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,520
I think it's a good idea.

439
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:41,520
I think it's a good idea.

440
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,520
I think it's a good idea.

441
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Let me see.

442
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,520
W.

443
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
I

444
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
bought a new one.

445
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,520
A bag.

446
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,520
What bag?

447
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
It's not soft.

448
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,520
Didn't you grow up in the outside world?

449
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,520
You...

450
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,520
I found it out in the afternoon.

451
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,520
I found it out.

452
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,520
I was thinking about it.

453
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,520
No hurry.

454
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I'm afraid you'll be late for the cleaning.

455
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,520
It's not good.

456
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,520
Then you

457
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,520
have prepared what you should have prepared.

458
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,520
When did you prepare it?

459
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,520
That's the time

460
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,520
after so many weeks.

461
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,520
I really thought you were clear-minded.

462
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,520
It's my fault to give you this kind of feeling.

463
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,520
Wait.

464
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,520
Wait for me.

465
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,520
Hurry up.

466
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
What's wrong with you?

467
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm fine.

468
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,520
Come on.

469
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
Drink some sugar water.

470
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,520
Thank you.

471
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
I'm hungry.

472
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,520
Why do you have this?

473
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,520
I bought it for Mai.

474
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,520
She has a bad relationship with her family.

475
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,520
Sometimes she hides here.

476
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,520
Hides here?

477
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,520
Where does she live?

478
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
She lives with you.

479
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,520
What are you thinking about?

480
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,520
She has a room with her grandma.

481
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,520
A room with her grandma?

482
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,520
Why is the stuff here?

483
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
She always throws things around.

484
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
I put it away.

485
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,520
Really?

486
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,520
I swear.

487
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
I didn't lie to you.

488
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:12,520
How about I throw away all these things later?

489
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:13,520
No.

490
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,520
Keep it for me.

491
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,520
Does it still hurt?

492
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,520
My feet are cold.

493
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
How is it?

494
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,520
Do you feel better?

495
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,520
No.

496
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
It hurts.

497
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,520
What should we do?

498
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,520
Let me check.

499
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,520
What's wrong?

500
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,520
Stop checking.

501
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,520
I feel bad.

502
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
You feel bad?

503
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Why is it always missing this?

504
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,520
It's either missing that or this.

505
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,520
What's the big deal?

506
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,520
There's still a long way to go.

507
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,520
Don't worry.

508
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,520
I'm anxious.

509
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Can you make it up to me?

510
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
How?

511
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
Kiss me.

512
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,520
Do you feel better?

513
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
I feel better.

514
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,520
Do you feel better?

515
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,520
I feel 60% better.

516
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,520
Why are you so absent-minded?

517
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
Be happy.

518
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,520
Go and clean the trash on the floor.

519
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Clean the melon seeds on the table.

520
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,520
The melon seeds will be here soon.

521
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,520
Why are you here?

522
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,520
Mai, why are you hiding?

523
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,520
Get up.

524
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,520
Come out.

525
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
I have to go to work.

526
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,520
Come here.

527
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,520
Come on, give me a hand.

528
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Grandma Duan.

529
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,520
Grandma Duan is standing up.

530
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,520
It's a miracle.

531
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,520
Stand up.

532
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,520
Take it.

533
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,520
Take it.

534
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Grandma.

535
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,520
Are you a fool?

536
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
You want to be a star.

537
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,520
You don't have to be jealous.

538
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,520
Right?

539
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,520
This card.

540
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
This is what grandma invested for you.

541
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,520
I'm the investor.

542
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,520
What you lack now is a professional teacher.

543
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
I'll sing for you.

544
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,520
Scream.

545
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
Come here.

546
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,520
This card is not enough.

547
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,520
I'll sell the house and invest for you.

548
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,520
No, grandma.

549
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:45,520
Listen.

550
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,520
I'll sell the house.

551
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,520
I'll support you forever.

552
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,520
Mai.

553
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,520
Your brother found you a music training institution in Jiangbei.

554
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
You can report it when you're sure.

555
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:57,520
Thank you.

556
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,520
You always want to play my guitar.

557
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,520
Take it back and practice.

558
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
Don't embarrass me after school.

559
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,520
Really?

560
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,520
Grandma, I'm sorry.

561
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,520
I know I was wrong.

562
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
Why are you crying?

563
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,520
Crying is not your fault.

564
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,520
Enough.

565
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,520
It's not your fault.

566
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,520
You want to be a singer.

567
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
If you keep crying, your voice will be gone sooner or later.

568
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,520
Right.

569
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
I've decided.

570
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,520
I'll never give up my dream.

571
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
But I won't realize it for now.

572
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Because I want to complete a small goal step by step.

573
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
Right.

574
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,520
What small goal?

575
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,520
I want to be the stage root of the Treasure Room.

576
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,520
I want to squeeze Li Jingyu.

577
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
I thought it was something.

578
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,520
I promise you.

579
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,520
I'll open a solo concert for you tonight.

580
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,520
I'll sing a solo concert for you.

581
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Did you get it?

582
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Really?

583
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,520
Here.

584
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,520
Come on.

585
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Come on.

586
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,520
Don't miss it.

587
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,520
Welcome.

588
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:10,520
Our solo concert.

589
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:12,520
Bring your friends to have a beer.

590
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
Bring your friends to have a drink.

591
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,520
Right.

592
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,520
Welcome.

593
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,520
Come on.

594
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,520
Come on.

595
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:19,520
Come on.

596
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,520
Open the concert.

597
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,520
Qiao Manman has a big dream.

598
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,520
She will perform all over the country.

599
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
So as a group of friends,

600
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
we hope you can support Qiao Manman

601
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,520
to give every dream a stage.

602
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Right.

603
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,520
It's not easy to have a dream.

604
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,520
Right.

605
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
Thank you.

606
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,520
Let's have a drink.

607
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,520
Let's have a drink.

608
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,520
Come on.

609
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
Come on.

610
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,520
Come on.

611
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,520
Welcome.

612
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,520
Come on.

613
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,520
Come on.

614
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Look.

615
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
I can't drink a little today.

616
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,520
No.

617
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,520
I want to ask...

618
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:55,520
Why is there no one here?

619
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,520
Brother.

620
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,520
This is a bar.

621
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,520
You can come here if you want.

622
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,520
I knew it.

623
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,520
I changed the restaurant.

624
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,520
Right.

625
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:07,520
Come on.

626
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,520
Come on.

627
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Welcome.

628
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,520
Welcome.

629
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,520
You are Qiao Manman.

630
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,520
Li Bixiu.

631
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,520
Don't miss it.

632
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,520
The brightest star of the world,

633
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,520
Qiao Manman.

634
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,520
Tonight, everyone will be here.

635
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,520
Do you feel like

636
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
the most outstanding kid in the village

637
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
will make his debut?

638
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,520
You are good at metaphorical.

639
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,520
How is it?

640
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,520
You said you didn't want to enter here.

641
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,520
Now?

642
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,520
Do you want to come in?

643
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,520
I don't hate it.

644
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,520
I like it here.

645
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,520
Welcome.

646
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,520
I haven't had this feeling for a long time.

647
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,520
It's warm.

648
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:06,520
Where to sit?

649
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Sit here.

650
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,520
Thank you.

651
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,520
Be careful.

652
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Be careful.

653
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
There are so many people here.

654
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,520
Manman must be very popular.

655
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I tell you.

656
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
You have to be in the mood later.

657
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,520
We have to get high.

658
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Don't worry.

659
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,520
I have prepared the seats.

660
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Get high.

661
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Can you drink?

662
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,520
I can.

663
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,520
But you should drink less.

664
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
You two are fat.

665
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Xiao Gu.

666
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Why are you here?

667
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,520
Come on.

668
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
Come on.

669
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
This is good.

670
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,520
What?

671
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,520
Grandma.

672
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,520
Xiao Gu.

673
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,520
Xiao Gu.

674
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,520
Yes, I am Xiao Gu.

675
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Manman.

676
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
Come on.

677
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,520
Manman.

678
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,520
Manman.

679
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,520
Manman.

680
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Manman.

681
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:55,520
Manman.

682
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Come on.

683
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Manman is brave.

684
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,520
Manman is brave.

685
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:05,520
Where did you get this word?

686
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I made it up for him.

687
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,520
This is English.

688
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Manman.

689
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Come on.

690
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520

Manman.

692
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
First of all, thank you all for coming to see my performance tonight.

693
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:20,520
Next, I will bring you a song about love.

694
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Thank you.

695
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Manman.

696
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,520
It looks good.

697
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,520
So handsome.

698
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
He is so good.

699
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,520
He is so good.

700
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Very good.

701
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:55,520
Manman.

702
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,440
What should we do?

703
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,640
What are you annoying about?

704
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,480
What? We can't hear you.

705
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,520
Easy, Man Man will just shake extending.

706
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,660
Mom, Mom, Man pie!

707
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,260
Man pie!

708
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,940
Sweet sweeping

709
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:05,940
Mom, is it normal grades?

710
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,920
Originally it is, but until now I've slept

711
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,680
now it seems no need

712
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,220
Aren't you tired of thisjek?

713
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,520
Don't you believe that you cannot win a round?

714
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,740
What are you doing?

715
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:27,240
Hey, you

716
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,620

I'm sorry.

720
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,280
I'm really sorry.

721
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:47,720
Sorry.

722
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:49,040
You're coming again.

723
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,120
Sorry.

724
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,920
He's really good.

725
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:51,440
He just learned it.

726
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,240
He doesn't know where he's going.

727
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:52,800
I'm sorry.

728
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,480
He just learned it.

729
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,360
He sang it so badly.

730
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,600
I've never heard it so badly.

731
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,680
He just learned it.

732
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:57,720
Grandma.

733
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,000
What are you talking about?

734
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,840
You don't understand?

735
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,360
Shut up.

736
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,000
That's rock music.

737
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,120
Don't be angry.

738
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,320
You're a little harsh.

739
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:05,920
I'm sorry.

740
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,000
I'm sorry, bro.

741
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,760
I'll drive the car.

742
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,440
I'll drive the car.

743
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,400
He didn't say anything wrong.

744
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:09,920
Okay.

745
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:10,880
Don't be angry.

746
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,680
Don't be angry, grandma.

747
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,200
Mai.

748
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,520
You sang well.

749
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,960
You can study it

750
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,360
after you go to school.

751
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,040
I'll give that card to grandma later.

752
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:27,960
I'll keep it for you.

753
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:29,800
I'm leaving.

754
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,880
Go.

755
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,760
Go back, Qingchong.

756
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,760
Don't stay in the cold.

757
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,160
Give me the card when you come back.

758
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm leaving, too.

759
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
It's okay, Mai.

760
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,080
It's good.

761
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,160
Mai.

762
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,480
You're so great.

763
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,720
You're so rock.

764
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,640
I want to take a picture with you.

765
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:53,360
Come on.

766
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,640
Boss.

767
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,160
You have a good taste.

768
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,680
Call me if you have a show in the future.

769
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,360
Of course.

770
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,880
Yo.

771
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,400
Yo.

772
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,200
Yeah.

773
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:01,800
Yo.

774
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Yo.

775
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,640
Yo.

776
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,160
Yeah.

777
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,880
Yo.

778
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,720
Yo.

779
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
Sorry.

780
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,520
Ah.

781
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,360
I'm tired.

782
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,800
Let's destroy it.

783
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,280
I'm happy today.

784
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm happy, too.

785
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,760
Thank you, Ye Meng.

786
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,640
Are you happy today?

787
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,480
Of course.

788
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,960
I haven't been so happy for a long time.

789
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,680
Me, too.

790
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,320
Don't worry.

791
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:13,040
You're the most beautiful girl in the world.

792
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,440
Take a famous photo and send it back to myThis is yourida yield

793
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,800
in the ages of 15 to 50.

794
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,760
Here is on our page.

795
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,240
Alright.

796
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,300
I love you!

797
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,120
Love you, too!

798
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:38,860
Why why?

799
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,680
Love you deeply!

800
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:52,480
Why?

801
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,700
Good morning, boyfriend!

802
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,360
Today the weather is great!

803
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,560
What are you doing?

804
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,640
I am fine.

805
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,600
If there is nothing else,

806
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,720
take a picture of me!

807
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,280
Come on.

808
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,520
Hurry up.

809
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:11,880
Here I am.

810
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,200
You look so down in the morning.

811
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,440
Take a picture of me.

812
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,240
Come on.

813
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:21,120
No.

814
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,600
Take a picture of me

815
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,160
as if I'm just passing by.

816
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,600
I'll take a picture of you as I walk.

817
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,120
Okay?

818
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,120
Sure. No problem.

819
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,800
One, two, three.

820
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,480
One, two, three.

821
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,880
Done.

822
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,640
Take your hand off.

823
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,600
What's wrong?

824
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Look at the picture you took.

825
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,040
I'm just like this in your eyes.

826
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,280
My head is this big,

827
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,720
and my body is this small.

828
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,080
Isn't it pretty good?

829
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,480
What's good about it?

830
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,920
Let me show you the evidence.

831
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,880
Look.

832
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,240
See?

833
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,480
See the love in the picture?

834
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,640
See the atmosphere?

835
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,520
See the angle?

836
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,440
You're a boy, you're tall.

837
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,440
I'm a girl, I'm a little short.

838
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,240
So,

839
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,920
when you take pictures,

840
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,920
you have to squat a little.

841
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,120
And your phone has to be a little bit higher.

842
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,920
My legs can be longer.

843
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,360
This is a must-have skill

844
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,920
for a boyfriend who goes on a trip.

845
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,120
You're not single now.

846
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,480
It seems that the doctor is quite smart.

847
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,920
He's a little bit more clever.

848
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,720
It seems that the doctor is quite smart.

849
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,520
What doctor?

850
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,120
That old Dr. Gao.

851
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,720
Didn't he take the picture for you?

852
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,120
Old Dr. Gao.

853
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,920
Sometimes I really

854
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,920
care about this old Dr. Gao.

855
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,520
Not only do you have to be rejected for your confession,

856
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:45,520
but also be used as a partner by someone like you.

857
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,520
Eat, fly, and be jealous.

858
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,520
What does that mean?

859
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,920
Ye Mang.

860
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,120
I'll see you out.

861
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,720
No need. I can go back by myself.

862
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,920
I know

863
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:01,920
you don't like me now.

864
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:03,520
But I believe

865
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,120
that people's feelings are flowing.

866
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,320
Do I still have a chance?

867
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Dr. Gao,

868
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,320
thank you for liking me.

869
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,120
But I have someone I like.

870
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:19,120
So you rejected him that day

871
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,120
because of me.

872
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,920
Stop laughing.

873
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,120
Stop laughing.

874
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,520
You can't even keep your mouth shut.

875
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,720
Why are you so proud?

876
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:28,120
Who laughed? I didn't.

877
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,120
The police of Nanhu.

878
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,720
Who are you talking about?

879
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:32,720
I'm talking about you.

880
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,120
But speaking of that,

881
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:36,920
do you think

882
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,920
this yard is too rough now?

883
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,520
Let me show you

884
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,120
the yard I collected when I was in Jiangbei.

885
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:44,320
Look.

886
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:45,920
Is it good?

887
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:50,920
Li Yuanjing.

888
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,320
I'm not good at planting flowers.

889
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,320
So I'll leave the yard

890
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,120
to you.

891
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,720
Li Yuanjing thinks you're just average.

892
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,120
And it's too difficult.

893
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:03,520
I'm begging you.

894
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,520
You're the only talent in our family.

895
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,720
I really think you're good at everything.

896
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:08,520
I'll leave the yard to you.

897
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,120
It will be very beautiful.

898
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:10,720
Stop it.

899
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
I can do it.

900
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,520
Then do you need to

901
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,920
make up for me?

902
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,520
What are you doing?

903
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,120
You're talking to me like a dog.

904
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,320
What are you two doing?

905
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,520
I can see everything.

906
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,920
I didn't do anything.

907
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,520
Why are you here?

908
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:32,120
I asked everyone to come.

909
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,320
Today is a good day.

910
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,520
I want all the villagers

911
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,320
to know our good news.

912
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,320
Your family has a oven.

913
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,920
Come, teacher.

914
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,320
I have bought you проблем mug.

915
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,120
Come.

916
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,120
You are my noon function to Mush Etude.

917
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,040
I saved your Lei Hua 120 from Tan dynasty.

918
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,320
You?

919
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,320
Who did you answer when you were talking aboutración?

920
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:12,720
I didn't answer.

921
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:14,120
I'm the master ofVoice.

922
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,120
If foundation came to me,

923
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:21,720
I wouldn't have seen this dynamic flow of yours.

924
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:27,720
The love that was raised in my heart

925
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,120
Enveloped my thoughts

926
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,720
Where should I go?

927
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:40,720
How should I avoid

928
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,720
Those memories about you

929
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,720
I was so deep in thought, but I was so obsessed

930
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I can't stop

931
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,720
I was silent

932
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:03,720
The flowers are in the back

933
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,720
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

934
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:14,720
I pretended to be determined

935
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,720
But I'm still obsessed

936
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
The most perfect lie

937
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:27,720
Deceives yourself

938
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,720
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

939
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:36,720
Why is this?

940
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:39,720
The moment of tears

941
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:44,720
The heart is still longing

942
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,720
The most perfect lie

943
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:58,720
Deceives yourself

944
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:03,720
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

945
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,720
Why is this?
