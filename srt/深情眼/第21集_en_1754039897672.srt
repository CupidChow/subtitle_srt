00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath is gradually missing at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that you have my dream

The Long Ballad

Episode 2

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I just fainted

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I think it's because I didn't pay much attention to the blood pressure

19
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I see you all are nervous

20
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay, but can you not be nervous?

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why are you so important?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
When the baby comes, I'll tell him I'm going out of the hospital

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Okay

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
My legs are broken and I've been lying down for two nights

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm so tired, I'm not going to lie down

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
No one asked you to continue lying down

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
You can get up and keep hugging him

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Don't think I dare not

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm going out of the hospital now

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
See who dares to stop me

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Grandma, stop it

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's late, don't you feel tired?

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Grandma

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I'm dizzy

35
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Sit down

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Slowly

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What did the doctor say?

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
He said I was dead for a few days, right?

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What did the doctor say?

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Stop acting

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
You are my grandson

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know you are happy or sad when you see me

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know my own body

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I came here to hide it from you

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You knew it

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't put this face on me

49
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
When I'm really gone, you can put it on me

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I can't see it anyway

51
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You two go, I'm going to sleep

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm going to sleep

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you out? It's cold outside

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why are you sitting outside alone?

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Okay

56
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Li Jinyu

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can discuss with me anytime

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You don't have to be stubborn with me

59
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm fine

60
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
What do you think now?

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I don't know

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Actually

63
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't have much impression on grandma when I was a kid

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't know her

65
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I knew she was an old lady with a bad temper

66
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Until my dad died

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I hadn't driven up the mountain

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I wouldn't have met that car

69
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Don't touch me

70
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Dad

71
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I can't forgive myself

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm like a hero

73
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Suddenly appeared in my life

74
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I took a 17-hour train

75
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It was so windy

76
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I drove from Ningsui to Jiangbei

77
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Just to bring me back from Li Linbai's hands

78
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
If it wasn't for him

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I would have died in Jiangbei

80
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But I was so ignorant at that time

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I didn't trust anyone

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I was in a mode of getting along with him

83
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I just didn't talk

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He was like a cannonball behind me

85
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
So I was more silent

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Can you imagine that scene?

87
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I can imagine

88
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Grandma thought she bought a cannonball

89
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
She hugged me and came back

90
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I didn't expect she was a cannonball

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You were not used to it at that time

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Not only not used to it

93
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I also hate it

94
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The neighbors were so rude

95
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Grandma's temper was so bad

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was thinking

97
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I would be driven away by him soon

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Until one day I found

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
He was really packing my things

100
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
So I left on the second day

101
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't want to be abandoned again

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Why are you following me?

103
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
No one wants me

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I can't raise you

105
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
A'Dou

106
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
That was the second time I saw someone

107
00:08:39,000 --> 00:09:03,300
show such a

108
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I also brought that dog back

109
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Then I knew

110
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
He packed my things

111
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Because he found a village

112
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
He wanted to give me another house in the yard

113
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
He wanted me to have a home

114
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So I would never have nowhere to go

115
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Is that dog safe?

116
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I hope you are safe

117
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He loves you

118
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
A woman with such a great appearance

119
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
She used to chase me upstairs

120
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
with a chicken and cat blanket

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
But now she can only stay in the hospital

122
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I don't want to be abandoned

123
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't want to be abandoned

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yimeng

125
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I can't accept it

126
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
If he really leaves

127
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I really won't have a family

128
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Jinyu, you still have me

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I will always be with you

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I will always be with you

131
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
A'Dou, I want to eat chicken and milk tea

132
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Mom

133
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Mom, what are you doing here?

134
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I heard you were sick

135
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I came to see you

136
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You are here to see me, right?

137
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Wait

138
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Mom, I have no other meaning

139
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I heard you were sick

140
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I found you the best medical team in Jiangbei

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
If you want

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will pick you up this afternoon

143
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You don't have to worry about money

144
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
No need, I have medical insurance

145
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I have everything you have

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I don't know why you are here

147
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Go

148
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
He is not your grandson

149
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
He is an outsider

150
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
What?

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He is not an outsider

152
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
He is my most beloved grandson

153
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are an outsider

154
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Your dear grandson is Zhou Feng

155
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Not Li Jinyu

156
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Zhou Feng has been sick for a long time

157
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You are a grandma

158
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Have you come to see him?

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Have you cared about him?

160
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Don't forget how your son died

161
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
How my husband died

162
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
My son's death has nothing to do with A'Dou

163
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
It's your decision

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's none of your business

165
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Go

166
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Go

167
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I warn you

168
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Don't hurt him again

169
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I will never let you go

170
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When your dear grandson Zhou Feng gets better

171
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I will bring him to see you

172
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I will bring him to see you

173
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Guanmei

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Mr. Li

175
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
This old lady is so bold

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When did you suffer this grievance?

177
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I think you didn't

178
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
It's none of your business

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
to talk about our family

180
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
She is my grandma

181
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My husband's mother

182
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Zhou Feng's grandmother

183
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If you have time

184
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Do more business

185
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Prepare for the opening of the Hainan Port

186
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I know, Mr. Li

187
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I will go now

188
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Hello

189
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Brother, where are you?

190
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't come to see grandma

191
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
OK, I know

192
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
OK, just an uncle

193
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's just an operation

194
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
What are you afraid of?

195
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't give me any conservative treatment

196
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
No

197
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
How can that work?

198
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
You don't even think about

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
how old you are now

200
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
When did I ever be cowardly?

201
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Waiting for death in a passive way

202
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's better to bet

203
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
It's not a loss to bet

204
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I decided

205
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I will tell him when A'Dou comes

206
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
A'Dou is the most reasonable

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
This is not

208
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
You are old

209
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
You have to take the risk to do this operation

210
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What if

211
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
OK, let's do the operation

212
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I said right

213
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
My grandson understands me best

214
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Jin Yu

215
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Your grandma is naughty

216
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You are also naughty

217
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
What if the operation fails?

218
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
What will you do?

219
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Yes, it's really naughty

220
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Go

221
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Old lady, you have to think about it

222
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Go, go, go

223
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Jin Yu, persuade grandma

224
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Wait for me

225
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
OK, take a break

226
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I have a decision

227
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Before the operation

228
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
You two go to a place with me

229
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Even if the operation can't be done

230
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I have no regrets

231
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
What are you talking about?

232
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Grandma, you will be fine

233
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I have a decision

234
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Before the operation

235
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You two go to a place with me

236
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
OK

237
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Hurry up

238
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Grandma, take it easy

239
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Grandma

240
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
OK, OK

241
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Hurry up

242
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You too

243
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm so dizzy

244
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Grandma

245
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Coming

246
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Grandma, take it easy

247
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Grandma

248
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm back

249
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
for the first time

250
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Grandma is so loyal

251
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Open the door

252
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
OK

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Put the things away

254
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'll take you two to work

255
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
I'm back

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Grandma

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Hurry up

258
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You are so strong

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm so strong

260
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You are so strong

261
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
You are so good

262
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
You are a master

263
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
You two are so strong

264
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You have long legs

265
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You lack exercise

266
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Hurry up

267
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
This way

268
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I didn't expect you to be so far away

269
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Hurry up

270
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Be careful

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Come on

272
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
OK, I see

273
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
Madam

274
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
What are you writing?

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
So ugly

276
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
Li Jingyu

277
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Girls have secrets

278
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Don't be so nosy

279
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
OK

280
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
You are right

281
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Girls have secrets

282
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
You can guess it

283
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
OK

284
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Grandma has secrets

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
OK

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Ba Dou

287
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You should be gentle

288
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll tell you

289
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
This tea

290
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
has seasons

291
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
and vitality

292
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Don't look at the little seed

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It seems that it can't stand the winter

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
When the spring flowers bloom

295
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
the seed will bloom

296
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Grandma

297
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Say, brother

298
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Come on

299
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Come on

300
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Grandma

301
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
We must come back together

302
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
in the spring

303
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
to see if there is any seed

304
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Come on, grandma

305
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Count

306
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
OK

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Count

308
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
OK

309
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
You take it

310
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Count me

311
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
OK

312
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Hurry up

313
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Come on

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll plant some new flowers

315
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
in the garden

316
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
OK

317
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Hurry up

318
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Don't be so nosy

319
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
OK

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Enough

321
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Enough

322
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Grandma

323
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
We three are enough

324
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
to make a pot of tea

325
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
I'll show you

326
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
my cooking skills

327
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
I've known it since I was a kid

328
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
OK

329
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
I'll show you

330
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
my cooking skills

331
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
to make you

332
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
delicious food

333
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I ate when I was a kid

334
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
Let's go

335
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Go back to the room now

336
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
No

337
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Go on

338
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You didn't escape, did you?

339
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Grandma

340
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Grandma

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I'm tired

342
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Hurry up

343
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Are you tired?

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Take more

345
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
OK

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I'll start to plant the new flowers

347
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
OK

348
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Show me

349
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll go to have a rest

350
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'll go to have a rest

351
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Show me

352
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
That's how it is

353
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
It's a dish

354
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
This is

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Where? Let me do it

356
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
You can do it

357
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I can do it

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
You're good

359
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Then tell me how to plant it

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Take the water and plant it

361
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Plant it in the pot of coffee

362
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I can do it

363
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Stop talking

364
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
I'll be done when grandma hears it

365
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
OK

366
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
If you keep sunning

367
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
it will turn into a black potato

368
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
No

369
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's white

370
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
It's white

371
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
You're lying

372
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
It's white

373
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
It's white

374
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Hurry up

375
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Be careful

376
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Grandma

377
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You can't rest

378
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Come on

379
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Look

380
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
She

381
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
She must have searched it online

382
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,000
You can do it

383
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Your grandma ate it when she was a kid

384
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I just told you two

385
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
Grandma will search it online

386
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
OK

387
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
BaZhao

388
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Put the pot on

389
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Be careful

390
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Mom, pour oil

391
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
OK

392
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Come on

393
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Be careful

394
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
BaZhao, cut this

395
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Here you cut

396
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Thin

397
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
OK

398
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
OK

399
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Be careful

400
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Here

401
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Mom

402
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Try it

403
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Grandma, you eat first

404
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
See if it's your childhood taste

405
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I want to try it

406
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Come on

407
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Like this

408
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
It's delicious

409
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll try one

410
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Come on

411
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll give you one

412
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Then you eat this

413
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
This is so big

414
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
So big

415
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
How is it?

416
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
So big

417
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Generally

418
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
It seems that your childhood taste

419
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
It's the same

420
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
The taste is not good

421
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Otherwise I'll give you some more

422
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
How about the taste when I was a kid?

423
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Li Jianyu, what are you talking about?

424
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What's your childhood taste?

425
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I think grandma's childhood taste

426
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Is the best

427
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
How delicious is this food?

428
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Do you think it's delicious?

429
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Wait

430
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Wait for us to eat

431
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And clean up

432
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Yes

433
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Let's have a mixed double

434
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I'll see what he does

435
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Yes

436
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Are you going to murder your own husband?

437
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Grandma

438
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
You

439
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
How much do you care

440
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
No, no, no

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Did you hear me?

442
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Wrong, wrong, wrong

443
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
OK, taste it

444
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
It's delicious, isn't it?

445
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Come on

446
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Feed me

447
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
Come on

448
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Delicious

449
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Eat more

450
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Feed

451
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Mom, you eat too

452
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Come on

453
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Eat more

454
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Why don't you eat?

455
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Come on, open your mouth

456
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
I eat

457
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Isn't it delicious?

458
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
You like to eat

459
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
Give me

460
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
OK, come on

461
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
This is not hot

462
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'm hungry

463
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
What is this place?

464
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Why is there no signal?

465
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So hungry

466
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,000
What is this?

467
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
What are you doing here so late at night?

468
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm so scared

469
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
You scared me

470
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Why don't you come out

471
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
when you can't sleep at night?

472
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I've been out today

473
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Please show me

474
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Can't sleep

475
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
Go on

476
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
What are you doing?

477
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
I didn't do anything

478
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,640
What are you doing?

479
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,920
I didn't do anything

480
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,120
You ordered takeout

481
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,160
Are you hungry?

482
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,120
Yes

483
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,600
I found that

484
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,680
childhood memories

485
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,280
are not good

486
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,160
You are right

487
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,040
I can lie down

488
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,360
and my stomach is empty

489
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,320
But

490
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,160
how is the order outside?

491
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:04,880
No signal

492
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,680
My phone is broken

493
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,640
No, I don't have signal either

494
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,280
Stand here

495
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,560
How can it work?

496
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,840
It still doesn't work

497
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,880
Come on, sit here

498
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,280
There is signal

499
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,800
Hurry up, what do you want to eat?

500
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,440
Fried chicken

501
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,960
Fried chicken

502
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,440
Five

503
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,000
Five is too much

504
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,800
No, I can't

505
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,840
No, no

506
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,200
No, no

507
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,160
Only barbecue, okay?

508
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,120
Okay

509
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,000
And skewers

510
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,800
Skewers

511
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,920
Fried chicken, no skewers

512
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,880
Only barbecue

513
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:29,760
I'll change your chicken wings

514
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,040
Okay

515
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,240
What are you doing?

516
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,040
Do you still remember

517
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,240
childhood memories?

518
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:45,600
Yes

519
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
Mom said she was hungry

520
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,240
Grandma, you are so mean

521
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,240
No, no, are you hungry?

522
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,720
No, I'm out for a walk

523
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,840
She wants to order takeout

524
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,120
No, she is hungry

525
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,640
Yes, I'm hungry

526
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,840
Yes, I'm hungry

527
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,560
Admit it

528
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,920
Yes, yes, grandma

529
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:06,640
I'm hungry

530
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,240
I'm really starving

531
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,360
Can you help me get something to eat?

532
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,000
Grandma is not

533
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,520
What did grandma come out for?

534
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,480
Six rounds, right?

535
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,200
You are not hungry

536
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,400
You are not hungry, right?

537
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,800
No

538
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,240
I'm hungry, I'm starving

539
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,120
Can you get me something to eat?

540
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:17,680
What do you want to eat?

541
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,520
No, grilled fish, grilled sweet potatoes

542
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,240
And milk tea

543
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,600
No, grandma, aren't you hungry?

544
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:22,480
What do I eat?

545
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:22,880
I don't eat

546
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,680
I don't like those

547
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,400
Eat something else

548
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,520
I'm afraid you two can't finish it

549
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,400
Waste it

550
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,280
I'll order some

551
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
Grandma

552
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,600
Okay, you two wait for me

553
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,440
Dadou, thank you

554
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,480
Not enough, not enough

555
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,520
Is that how you betray me?

556
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,680
Look how handsome Dadou is

557
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,160
Go, go, go, go, go

558
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
So cute

559
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,800
Really

560
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,360
Why haven't you two eaten yet?

561
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,360
Waiting for you

562
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,240
Why are you waiting for me?

563
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,240
Come on, taste my milk tea

564
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,760
Husband, thank you

565
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,120
Now you know to call me husband

566
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,520
Together

567
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,320
Together

568
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:05,920
I really don't eat

569
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,280
I eat too much for dinner

570
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:09,520
It's cold

571
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,200
I'll add a quilt for you

572
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
I'll go and help you

573
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,520
But I still have some

574
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,880
Thank you, husband

575
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,760
Thank you, husband

576
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,960
Come on, come on, come on

577
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,920
Teacher

578
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:48,800
Thank you,

579
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Okay.

580
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:05,920
Today,

581
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,720
I was almost killed by him.

582
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,120
He thought I was dead.

583
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,520
He ran away alone.

584
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,520
His father used to say

585
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,320
he was smart

586
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,720
and he wanted me to kill him.

587
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,120
But he is my grandson.

588
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,720
This is his home.

589
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,520
He likes that dog.

590
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,720
Let's call him Ping An.

591
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:43,120
Let's wish him a safe and sound life.

592
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,120
When I was a kid,

593
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,120
my grandma raised me.

594
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,120
We lived on the tea hill.

595
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,120
I was just a little kid.

596
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:06,520
I followed my grandma to the hill every day.

597
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,320
She told me

598
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,920
tea has four seasons.

599
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,520
It has all seasons.

600
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,320
Just like people.

601
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:21,120
But the next day,

602
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,720
my grandma passed away.

603
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,720
I was just a kid.

604
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,320
I didn't expect

605
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,720
my grandma would leave me.

606
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,120
Time passed.

607
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,320
It was my turn to love him.

608
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,720
Luckily,

609
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,320
I could say goodbye to him.

610
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,520
It's funny.

611
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,920
I was pretending to be tough.

612
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,920
I was actually scared.

613
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,920
I couldn't sleep at night.

614
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:08,920
I cried quietly.

615
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,920
But I couldn't let my dad

616
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,920
see that I was scared.

617
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I was so scared.

618
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,520
And my son was so poor.

619
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,920
I had no reason to worry about him.

620
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,520
It's said that the disaster lasts only 6,000 years.

621
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,520
Is it too late for me to do something bad?

622
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,520
I also wish to live for a lifetime.

623
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,720
I hope to see my dad get married in a dream.

624
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,920
I dreamed of their wedding last night.

625
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,920
I'm so happy.

626
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,920
As long as dad is happy,

627
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:14,920
I'm relieved.

628
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
I'm so happy.

629
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,920
I'm so happy.

630
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,920
I'm so happy.

631
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,920
I'm so happy.

632
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,920
I'm so happy.

633
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,920
I'm so happy.

634
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,920
I'm so happy.

635
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,920
I'm so happy.

636
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,920
I'm so happy.

637
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,920
I'm so happy.

638
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
I'm so happy.

639
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm so happy.

640
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
I'm so happy.

641
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,920
I'm so happy.

642
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,920
I'm so happy.

643
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,920
I'm so happy.

644
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
Grandma, are you sleeping?

645
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
Hi, Granny.

646
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,920
You're not asleep?

647
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,920
Come in.

648
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Grandma, I want to sleep with you today

649
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,920
Okay

650
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,920
I didn't tell you before

651
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
I like you very much

652
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Whether you killed Jiangbei

653
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,920
and brought Li Jingyu out of her mother's arms

654
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,920
or the courage and free spirit you have now

655
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,920
I think you are very cool

656
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
Courage is not the only thing you need

657
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
You need courage to live

658
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
Right?

659
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
I am old enough

660
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,920
to live

661
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,920
I can't let go of this

662
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,920
Please

663
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:09,920
This is nonsense

664
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,920
I'm sorry

665
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,920
I shouldn't have told you this

666
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,920
I'm sorry

667
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
It's okay

668
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:17,920
Sleep

669
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:19,920
Sleep

670
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,920
Sleep, sleep

671
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:22,920
Sleep

672
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:33,920
I'll put the sweater on you

673
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Sleep on the quilt

674
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
Dad, I'm going to bed

675
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,920
I'm going to bed

676
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,920
I'm going to bed

677
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,920
Are you sick?

678
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,920
I'm not cold

679
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Sleep

680
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,920
Sleep

681
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,920
Everything will go smoothly

682
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,920
One, two, three

683
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:18,920
Do you have flowers?

684
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,920
Yes, yes, yes

685
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,920
Don't hold hands

686
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,920
Come on

687
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Let me take a close-up

688
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:23,920
One more

689
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:24,920
One more

690
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:25,920
Take a close-up

691
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,920
Come on, one, two, three

692
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:28,920
Show this flower

693
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
One, two, three

694
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,920
This flower, this flower

695
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Look, look

696
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,920
You can take a good picture

697
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Okay

698
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,920
Make this face more beautiful

699
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,920
I'm thin enough

700
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
Still thin

701
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,920
Make it better

702
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I know

703
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,920
Keep it for me

704
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:43,920
Make my face more beautiful

705
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Make it better

706
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,920
Who did you send a message to this early morning?

707
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
I'm going to sue Mengmeng

708
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,920
Come on, come on

709
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:55,920
Let me tell you

710
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,920
Say it

711
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,920
I'm going to hold a wedding for Ye Meng

712
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,920
Why this expression?

713
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Isn't this your biggest wish?

714
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Yes

715
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
Do you look at my diary?

716
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,920
You can peek at my phone

717
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,920
I don't need to peek at your diary

718
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,920
Elegant

719
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,920
I'm so happy

720
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Enough

721
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,920
I accidentally saw it

722
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
Not on purpose

723
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:37,920
Besides

724
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Your diary

725
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,920
It's so ugly

726
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,920
I'm so lazy to read it

727
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:46,760
What do you think?

728
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,320
I'll go back to Ningcui

729
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,200
and arrange the scene.

730
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,880
You and her

731
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:52,680
can stay here for another day.

732
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,040
Don't let her know that you're here.

733
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,440
What are you two doing?

734
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,360
You're so slow.

735
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,640
Have you fixed it?

736
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,840
Yes.

737
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,960
Keep it.

738
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,720
I'm telling grandma

739
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,080
that something happened to the company.

740
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,360
We might have to go back in advance.

741
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,160
Mengmeng and I won't go back with you, right?

742
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
Yes, I'll stay here with grandma.

743
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,360
You're so mean.

744
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,240
Then you can go.

745
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:15,720
Okay.

746
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,720
You can go alone.

747
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,240
Go. Go. Go over there.

748
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:19,720
Okay.

749
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,520
Take care of grandma.

750
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:21,720
Got it.

751
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,200
Don't worry.

752
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,680
Hurry up.

753
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,960
Coming. Coming.

754
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,280
Here.

755
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,560
Baby, don't worry.

756
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:32,440
You and Mengmeng

757
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,240
are so slow.

758
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,520
We've been preparing for this.

759
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,080
Come on.

760
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:35,640
Qi,

761
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,480
I want to hang up.

762
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,280
Mom,

763
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,320
you can't fix it.

764
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,120
It's mine.

765
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:41,880
It's not fixed, right?

766
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,280
Okay?

767
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,240
Okay. Okay.

768
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,280
I'm telling you.

769
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,960
Marriage?

770
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,080
It's so sudden.

771
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,000
I'm just renovating.

772
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,960
I'll ask the staff

773
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,400
to report to you tonight.

774
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,600
Don't worry.

775
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,400
It's reliable.

776
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,000
Well,

777
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,680
is Ya'en your maid?

778
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:58,840
Why are you so talkative?

779
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,120
I've prepared everything for you.

780
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,800
I'll ask Jiayu to be your head.

781
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,840
Brother, don't worry.

782
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,120
I'll take care of Si Yi.

783
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:04,840
Keep the gun.

784
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:11,640
What are you doing?

785
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,080
Grandma,

786
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,160
how long will it take?

787
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:19,320
It's been a long time.

788
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,360
Li Ba should come to pick it up.

789
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,880
I just want to call him.

790
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,480
Why would he come?

791
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,760
Come on.

792
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,360
Why would you call him?

793
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
Come on.

794
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,320
It's okay.

795
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,720
I'll tell you

796
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,000
the story I told you when I was a kid.

797
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,560
I didn't know it was a bright day.

798
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,640
So I came here.

799
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,080
I'm familiar with this building.

800
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,200
Let me tell you.

801
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,560
I'm good at it.

802
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,920
I'll go home at noon.

803
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,520
I don't even want to

804
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,560
bring my dad here.

805
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,960
But my legs are sore.

806
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:54,920
My legs hurt.

807
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,720
Grandma.

808
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,760
Your long legs

809
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:00,920
are so good.

810
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:01,960
Come on.

811
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,800
Your legs are good now.

812
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,840
When you were in the hospital,

813
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:05,640
you had a bad leg.

814
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,800
I helped you to cover it up every day.

815
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
Now you're so kind.

816
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,480
What do you mean?

817
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,560
I'm about to be in the coffin.

818
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,600
I can't bear it.

819
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,360
Don't talk nonsense.

820
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,080
Let's go.

821
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:22,600
Say it.

822
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,120
It's done.

823
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,160
I'll wait for you two.

824
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,440
Stop bragging.

825
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,760
Okay.

826
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,440
My legs are sore.

827
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,680
Your legs are sore?

828
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,080
I'm hanging up.

829
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:37,880
Let's go.

830
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,680
Be careful.

831
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:40,920
Let's go.

832
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:41,960
What's wrong?

833
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,680
You just got a back injury.

834
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,720
You're so naughty.

835
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,360
Be careful.

836
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,080
Be careful.

837
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:58,840
Come on.

838
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,480
Take the box.

839
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,240
Be quick.

840
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,880
Grandma is so weird.

841
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,160
She's so happy.

842
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,360
Why are you in such a hurry?

843
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,280
You've been at home for two days.

844
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:10,840
You're bored.

845
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,240
Come back.

846
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,760
I'll cook something delicious.

847
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,240
Okay.

848
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,040
Thank you.

849
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,440
Let's go.

850
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:15,560
Let's go.

851
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,360
Come on.

852
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,480
Put it there.

853
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,680
Put the flowers there.

854
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,680
Put it there.

855
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,960
When did you get so many flowers?

856
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
The wedding is coming.

857
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:26,840
Welcome.

858
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,760
Happy New Year.

859
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,480
Happy New Year.

860
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:58,280
How is it?

861
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:58,840
Do you like it?

862
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:00,680
Is it

863
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,040
the same as the yard

864
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:02,840
in your imagination?

865
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,400
Yes.

866
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,120
You

867
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,440
took the initiative to come to me.

868
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
Let me

869
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,040
take the last step.

870
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:25,080
What are you talking about?

871
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,520
Let's talk about it later.

872
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,120
Our bride is going to do her hair.

873
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,400
It won't be good if she misses the wedding.

874
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,760
What do you mean by doing her hair?

875
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,400
I'll do it later.

876
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,280
I'll do it later.

877
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,000
Come on.

878
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,200
Change your wedding dress.

879
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,920
Come on.

880
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,480
Let's go.

881
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,200
I'll tell you.

882
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:36,760
Let's go.

883
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,520
You're the leading role today.

884
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,160
Yes.

885
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,600
Let me help you to put on makeup.

886
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,400
I'll shave it.

887
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,520
Don't shave it.

888
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,280
Today is your grandson's

889
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,240
happy day.

890
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:45,960
Let's go.

891
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,000
Let's go.

892
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,040
Mengmeng told me

893
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,720
to use this

894
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,440
after the lipstick.

895
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,360
It's called lip color.

896
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:56,840
And then...

897
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,880
Don't laugh.

898
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,080
I can't do it.

899
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,360
It's going to be a mess.

900
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,280
Good.

901
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,760
Okay.

902
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,160
Okay.

903
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:09,800
Look.

904
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,280
So beautiful.

905
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,720
Is this my mom?

906
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,280
Of course it's you.

907
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,120
Are you dizzy?

908
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,680
I'm really dizzy.

909
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,840
I've never painted in my life.

910
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,360
Really.

911
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,720
Let me tell you.

912
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,240
I used to

913
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,920
look down on you.

914
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,200
Actually,

915
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,080
let me tell you.

916
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,520
I'm telling you.

917
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:36,680
I've seen you before.

918
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:38,360
The most energetic old lady.

919
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:38,840
Yes.

920
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,000
You're beautiful without makeup.

921
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,360
Look at you.

922
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:45,400
You're even more beautiful.

923
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,520
You're a beauty.

924
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,480
Meilan.

925
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,960
You're the first time

926
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,400
to praise me

927
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,920
for the sun's rays.

928
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,720
There's a little conflict

929
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,240
between us.

930
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:57,960
I'm the only one who's standing here.

931
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,160
You're the only one.

932
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,360
You're not finished yet.

933
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:00,840
Okay.

934
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,720
Okay.

935
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,160
Let's not talk about the past.

936
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:03,720
No.

937
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,640
Guess what?

938
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,840
I'm thinking.

939
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,920
We're relatives now.

940
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,600
We'd better break the wall.

941
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,080
It's good if we can break it.

942
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:14,520
Okay.

943
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:15,720
I agree.

944
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:16,280
I agree.

945
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,520
Listen.

946
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,280
Don't talk about the past.

947
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,720
No.

948
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,200
By the way,

949
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,000
I brought you something.

950
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,480
What?

951
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,240
Look.

952
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,320
Mengmeng's parents.

953
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,160
Look who's here.

954
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,520
Mengmeng.

955
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:40,920
This is her photo

956
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,280
in her three-month-old.

957
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:43,640
Look at her.

958
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,200
Look at her.

959
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,440
She's so beautiful.

960
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,000
Look.

961
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,640
Look.

962
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,000
She's about to graduate from primary school.

963
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,360
What a pity.

964
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,480
My father

965
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,160
doesn't like to take photos.

966
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,760
I don't have any memories

967
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:56,120
of him.

968
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,400
I feel sorry for him.

969
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,440
Don't worry.

970
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,280
I'll take care of it.

971
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,400
I'll take photos

972
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,600
behind their back

973
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,400
every day.

974
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:04,760
I'll give you all the photos.

975
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,440
Make a big

976
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,400
movie for us.

977
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:07,880
Okay.

978
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:08,920
They'll pay for it.

979
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:09,880
Okay?

980
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,080
You're so smart.

981
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:11,800
Look at her.

982
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:12,680
Doesn't she look like me?

983
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,320
Yes.

984
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:14,120
She looks like you.

985
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:14,840
Look at her.

986
00:43:14,840 --> 00:43:16,120
She's Yuan.

987
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,400
What's her name?

988
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,600
It's Beilei.

989
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:20,040
Look.

990
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,000
Look at her.

991
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,000
Look at me.

992
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,040
Doesn't she look like me?

993
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,600
Look at her.

994
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:29,720
See?

995
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:32,920
She's so beautiful.

996
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:35,560
A kid?

997
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,200
Yes?

998
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,000
Then take good care of her.

999
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:37,880
She'll be fine.

1000
00:43:37,880 --> 00:43:39,880
You

1001
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,880
You

1002
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,880
When I see you

1003
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,880
When I think of you

1004
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:05,880
When I hear any news of you

1005
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:11,880
The face that is reflected in the heart

1006
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,880
Encloses my thoughts

1007
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
Go

1008
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,880
Where to go

1009
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:23,880
How to avoid

1010
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:29,880
Those memories about you

1011
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,880
I am so addicted to you

1012
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,880
Can't stop

1013
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,880
I am silent

1014
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,880
Put the flowers in the back

1015
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:54,880
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

1016
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:58,880
I pretend to be determined

1017
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:03,880
But still in the distance

1018
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,880
The most perfect lie

1019
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,880
Deceive yourself

1020
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:18,880
If you love, let go, let us lose the relationship

1021
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,880
Why is this the moment of tears

1022
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:48,820
The heart is still

1023
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,880
You
