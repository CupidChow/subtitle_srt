1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are sparkling

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Exciting, saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You touch me

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The one who still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if it has never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is still a if

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The promise will be kept

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that you have my dream

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 15

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I've done what I promised you

22
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Where's the surveillance video?

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Give me the Hailangang project

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll delete the surveillance video immediately

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't be so stubborn

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't say it so harshly

27
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
As a son, I want to be filial to you

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I didn't do anything wrong, right?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Don't pretend to be strange in front of me

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Didn't you want to revenge me when you came back this time?

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
That's right

32
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Actually you know me

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Since you know, why are you still arguing with me?

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're not bad at such a small project

35
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
As long as you promise me

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I will delete the surveillance video immediately

37
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And Wang Xing's video

38
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll delete it immediately

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And the disappearance of Wang Xingsheng

40
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I won't mention it

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll do it

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
OK, I promise you

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But Wang Xingsheng's matter

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
That's it

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You know how I do things

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't kill me

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't worry

48
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Dad

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I just want to get back what I deserve

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I didn't have to

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I don't want to be too embarrassed

52
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
After all, we are both

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
We still have to be a family of blind dates

54
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'll leave if there's nothing else, Mr. Li

55
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
See you tonight

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Mr. Wang

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Don't worry about the bad things in Hailan

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Someone wants to help us

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Welcome

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I'll see you in a while

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Welcome

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
They're all inside

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Come on

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Come on

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Welcome

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
They're all inside

67
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Sha Baityan

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I miss you so much

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're finally back

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're so cold-hearted

71
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You haven't come back for so many years

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
OK

73
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Enough

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't know what I thought

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What did I do to you?

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Come on, drink

77
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What are you doing?

78
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Brother came back and I drank

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Don't you have a brother

80
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
So many years

81
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Did I send you a message?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What are you talking about?

83
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You are the three swordsmen of Jiangbei

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The three swordsmen are still there

85
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I thought I was already replaced

86
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
indeed

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I changed it early

88
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Ye Meng

89
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Come over and get to know each other

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Introduce

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Ye Meng

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Our company's face-to-face

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Not only does he look good

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
He's also very capable

95
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Ye Meng

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Sha Baityan, Li Jinyu

97
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I mentioned it to you before

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Gou Kai's hair

99
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I love to cut my hair

100
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
This is my hair

101
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Look, as long as it's straight

102
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's already very good

103
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
We've met before

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm the one who's blind

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I didn't see

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Mr. Li was so good

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It's really a secret

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't see it

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Everyone is here

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Mr. Li

111
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Mr. Li

112
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Our Jinyu

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's rare

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Now I know how to care for people

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I took the initiative to put pressure on me

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
So our family is in a state of shock

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Sometimes I think

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I sent him abroad when I was very young

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I feel very guilty

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I was afraid he would get sick

121
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I didn't expect

122
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Not only is he good

123
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
He's good and filial

124
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'm a mother

125
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'm really proud of you

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now

127
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm really happy to have you guys

128
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Come on, let's have a drink

129
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes, we're brothers forever

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Ye Meng

131
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Come on

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
To celebrate our success

133
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Cheers

134
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
OK, you guys talk first

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll go over there and say hello

136
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
it is good

137
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Drink less

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Mr. Li is so filial

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
It's really rare

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Don't give me credit

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't blame me

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
But if you're interested in me

143
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
We can talk while drinking

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Ye Meng can't drink

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'll drink for her

146
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Why should you drink for her?

147
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What identity?

148
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Isn't she married?

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's fake news

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
My own employee

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can I not know

152
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Go to the bathroom

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This Gou Kai is really poor

154
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I was following him last time

155
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Didn't you see it?

156
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Like Ye Meng, chasing her

157
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Are you angry?

158
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Isn't it obvious that I'm angry?

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Did I tell you I have a family affair?

160
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can you have some sense?

161
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I always say family affairs

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Can you take it out and see it?

163
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Can I have a look?

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Didn't you fall in love?

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Where?

166
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
In Sweden

167
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
That's the same place as Ye Meng's husband

168
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Do you know who his husband is?

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No, you're fine

170
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why do you always stare at my husband?

171
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You actually like my husband, right?

172
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
What are you talking about?

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm not concerned about you

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I know

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Who?

176
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
It's me

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Ok

178
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm going to the bathroom now, Mr. Gou

179
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Can i

180
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Yes

181
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you

182
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Where are you going?

183
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The man is also there, okay?

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Funny

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Don't do it

186
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
What's wrong with each one of them?

187
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'm going to the bathroom now, okay?

188
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm going to the bathroom now, okay?

189
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I'm going to the bathroom now, okay?

190
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'm going to the bathroom now, okay?

191
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
What are you doing?

192
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Step aside

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Who do you want me to step aside?

194
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Pretending not to know me in the daytime

195
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What are you doing now?

196
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
what

197
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Are you afraid of the dog?

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
That's right

199
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm afraid of the dog

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
But you are more afraid of me

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Isn't it?

202
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
The wine here is not bad

203
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Do you want to bring a bottle to your mother?

204
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Mr. Li

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
This is a call car

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'll take you back

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
No need

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Actually, I have a lawyer friend

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I asked about Wang Xingcheng

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'll tell you on the way

211
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'll send Miss Ye back

212
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
After all, everyone drank

213
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm a thief

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Safety first

215
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
No need

216
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You are a fake

217
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
How can I bother you?

218
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I'm a car owner of Mr. Gou

219
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'm a car owner of Mr. Gou

220
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I'm a car owner of Mr. Gou

221
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm a car owner of Mr. Gou

222
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I'm a car owner of Mr. Gou

223
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'm a car owner of Mr. Gou

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'll go back when I'm with Mr. Gou

225
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I found it myself

226
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Who doesn't have a driver?

227
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Let's go

228
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Then I'll go back with you

229
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Go by yourself

230
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
You

231
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Why are you leaving?

232
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Why don't we go together?

233
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Good

234
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Mr. Shao

235
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
This

236
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I live a little far from home

237
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
It's okay

238
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Don't mind

239
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Li Junyu is usually like this

240
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I heard from Taimijiao

241
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Li Junyu's girlfriend is also your age

242
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Do you know each other?

243
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I know

244
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You don't know

245
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You should stay away from her

246
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
She is not a cheap lamp abroad

247
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Mixed with a group of bad boys

248
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Smoking, fighting, drinking, everything

249
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
It's wild and wild

250
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Everyone drinks and is not spicy

251
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Wild and wild

252
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You saw it just now

253
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
In front of Li Lingbai

254
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Make a good boy

255
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
The whole person is fake

256
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Mr. Li's life abroad

257
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's really wonderful

258
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You are so interested in her

259
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Can you not be so sensitive

260
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Isn't it what you want to say about Wang Xingsheng?

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You tell me who your husband is

262
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'll tell you about Wang Xingsheng

263
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm really curious

264
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
What are you curious about?

265
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Just a small town old man

266
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No advantages

267
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No, what are you painting?

268
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Are you talking about Wang Xingsheng?

269
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I'm not getting off the car

270
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Someone is following us

271
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Handsome

272
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Handsome

273
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Wang Xingsheng has a murder case

274
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's like illegal

275
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Intimidation

276
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
He was still in Ningcui

277
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Take a piece of land

278
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But soon because of the financial chain

279
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Lack of training

280
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Later acquired by Hanhai Group

281
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Become the current Hailangang

282
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
When was the time of the crime?

283
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
August 2016

284
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
August 2016

285
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
You know what I do

286
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Don't kill me

287
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Can't get rid of them

288
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
My mother died in July 2016

289
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
After Wang Xingsheng's employment

290
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In fact, after half a year

291
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Hanhai Group took over the project

292
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
This time is too coincidental

293
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You are suspecting auntie's suicide

294
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Related to Wang Xingsheng's fraud case

295
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes, that's right

296
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm not going to let you go

297
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm not going to let you go

298
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I'm not going to let you go

299
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm not going to let you go

300
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Yes, that's right

301
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Change the plan and go back first

302
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What's going on?

303
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm afraid that Goukai will go back to the hotel with me

304
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So follow me

305
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm here for my wife

306
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Don't follow me

307
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm here to find my wife

308
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll be here

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'll be here

310
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Don't you want to stay here

311
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm here

312
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm here

313
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm here

314
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm here

315
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm here

316
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm here

317
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'll call the police.

318
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
I'm your husband.

319
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,600
I'm not illegal.

320
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,640
Okay.

321
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:31,520
Let's get a divorce.

322
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,000
What do you mean?

323
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
What do you mean?

324
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,720
I'm back with Li Lin Bai.

325
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,560
I came back to Li Lin Bai

326
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,400
to investigate it clearly

327
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,840
and give you an explanation.

328
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,520
You don't know Li Lin Bai.

329
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:55,400
He's not as easy to deal with as you think.

330
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,080
He's always doing things in his own way.

331
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
I guess he's already taking action.

332
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,560
So,

333
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,920
can you leave Mr. Wang's case

334
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,880
to me?

335
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,440
I don't want you to be in danger.

336
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,280
Listen.

337
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,280
As long as it's about my mom,

338
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,720
I'll find out everything.

339
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,080
Why do I feel that

340
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,920
you're so unfamiliar now?

341
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,000
Li Jun Yi.

342
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,600
I'm really tired.

343
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,160
I don't want to spend any time

344
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,480
guessing which words are true.

345
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm going to bed.

346
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,000
Li Meng.

347
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,680
Help me carry this INTERCOM for the test.

348
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,200
What's the difference?

349
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,240
lene d'état and

350
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
the instantaneousímpoint Brazilian-languageíd

351
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,320
Thank you so much.

352
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,880
Are you the director of Netflix?

353
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,560
That's me.

354
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,200
You work for R기에 News.

355
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,760
Fine by me now.

356
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,920
Àm ST!?

357
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,120
Being shot down!

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,240
You better get up.

359
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,240
The lies

360
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,240
lie to us.

361
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,240
If we can't let go,

362
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,240
we'll lose our relationship.

363
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,240
Why

364
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,240
do my tears

365
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,240
still fall?

366
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,240
My mom's suicide case

367
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,240
is a witness.

368
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,240
But she hasn't

369
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,240
confessed to me.

370
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,240
I suspect that my mom's death

371
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,240
has something to do with Lin Lingbai.

372
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,240
Oh my god.

373
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,240
You mean

374
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
Li Jinyu is a hidden rich man.

375
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,240
And his mom's death

376
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,240
has something to do with your mom.

377
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,240
And now you two

378
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,240
are husband and wife.

379
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
I thought you didn't know

380
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,240
how to deal with this case.

381
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
I didn't think

382
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,240
it was so high-spirited.

383
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,240
I don't know

384
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Li Jinyu at all.

385
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,240
I even suspect that

386
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,240
he is his twin.

387
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
What are you going to do now?

388
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,240
Time is up.

389
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
Divorce.

390
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,240
I tell you.

391
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Divorce

392
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
is not as simple as you think.

393
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,240
I've been sorting out

394
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,240
the money transfer

395
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,240
and the flow of the expenditure these days.

396
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,240
I'm so confused.

397
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Forget it.

398
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,240
I don't complain about it.

399
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Go to bed.

400
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
I have to open the store early tomorrow.

401
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,240
Good night.

402
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,240
Yang Yang.

403
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,240
Yang Yang.

404
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,240
You're here.

405
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,240
I have a friend

406
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
who is going to celebrate his birthday.

407
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,240
I want to buy him

408
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
a gift in your store.

409
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,240
Help me pick one.

410
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Sure.

411
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,240
How old is your friend?

412
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,240
Almost the same as me.

413
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
What style of clothes

414
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,240
does he like to wear?

415
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,240
A lively and cute one.

416
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
He likes the kind of

417
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,240
a colorful blue.

418
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,240
How about this?

419
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Can you wear it with him?

420
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,240
Sure.

421
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
Okay, then.

422
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
Okay.

423
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Okay.

424
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
I'll go to the bathroom.

425
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
Okay.

426
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I'll go to the bathroom.

427
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
Okay.

428
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Okay.

429
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
How much is it?

430
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
I'll transfer it to you via WeChat.

431
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
No need.

432
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,240
It's on your boss.

433
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
That's not good.

434
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:19,240
Brother Kai will scold me later.

435
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I can just tell him.

436
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,240
Okay.

437
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,240
My sister is so nice to me.

438
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,240
Why are you being so polite to me?

439
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,240
Why are you free

440
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
to come to my store today?

441
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
Your boss let you out.

442
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
We've been very free recently.

443
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,240
Brother Kai is very self-reliant.

444
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,240
He doesn't care about me.

445
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,240
What's wrong with him?

446
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,240
I'm angry when you mention this.

447
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,240
Recently, someone deliberately

448
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,240
made a bad comment

449
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,240
on our store on the platform.

450
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
It made our store...

451
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,240
Our business is getting worse.

452
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,240
Then,

453
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,240
did your boss offend someone?

454
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,240
I'm not sure about that.

455
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,240
Sister,

456
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,240
don't tell him that I told him.

457
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,240
I won't tell him.

458
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I won't.

459
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Okay.

460
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
I'll go now.

461
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Okay.

462
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,240
Bye.

463
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,240
Bye.

464
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,240
Who offended him?

465
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,240
Oh, no.

466
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
What's wrong with you?

467
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,240
Why are you here?

468
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,240
Why didn't you open the store today?

469
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
Are you hiding something from me?

470
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,240
I'm not hiding anything from you.

471
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,240
Sister Yang,

472
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
I don't want to live in the spring.

473
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,240
What's this?

474
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,240
It's a book.

475
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,240
I bought it for you.

476
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,240
I'm not interested in it.

477
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I'm just a bookworm.

478
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,240
I'm not interested in it.

479
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
I'm just a bookworm.

480
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
I'm just a bookworm.

481
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
I'm just a bookworm.

482
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,240
I'm just a bookworm.

483
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
I'm just a bookworm.

484
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
What's this?

485
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,240
Recently,

486
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,240
the store's business is not good.

487
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,240
I'm telling you,

488
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,240
it's a good deal.

489
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,240
It's full of sales.

490
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,240
It's like this when it comes to business.

491
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
It's a cat and a dog.

492
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,240
It can't always be good.

493
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
Chen Jian did it, right?

494
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,240
Which big mouth told you that?

495
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
No one told me.

496
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,240
I can't read it myself.

497
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,240
The business in my store is bad.

498
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,240
It has nothing to do with its bad quality.

499
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,240
This bastard.

500
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I broke a bucket of oil and gas.

501
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,240
I broke a bucket of oil and gas.

502
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
It's a good deal.

503
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,240
You broke a bucket of oil and gas?

504
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,240
Yes.

505
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Are you okay?

506
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,240
I'm fine.

507
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
I lost some money.

508
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Let me do it in the future.

509
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,240
No.

510
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
You don't have to worry about me.

511
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
I'll be fine in a few days.

512
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,240
Kai Kai.

513
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,240
Let's not contact each other in the future.

514
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,240
The grudges between me and Chen Jian

515
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
shouldn't have been involved with you.

516
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,240
I'm not afraid of being involved.

517
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
But the rumors are hard to explain.

518
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
You can't even make it clear.

519
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,240
I'm afraid that others will misunderstand us.

520
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
I'm not afraid of rumors.

521
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,240
I went to you because I like Jia Yu very much.

522
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,240
I'm very close to Jia Yu.

523
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,240
You can't say something weird because of others.

524
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,240
You don't let me go to you.

525
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,240
I'm not here for business.

526
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,240
You don't let me go to my good friend.

527
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Why are you crying?

528
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
Dad.

529
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:55,240
Don't cry.

530
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,240
Anyway, we don't see each other often.

531
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Can you send WeChat messages when you're alone?

532
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,240
I can't.

533
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,240
You don't let me go to you.

534
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,240
What's wrong with you?

535
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,240
I can't.

536
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Mai Mai.

537
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Your brother is crying.

538
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,240
Go to him.

539
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
I'm sorry.

540
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,240
I'm not as strong as you.

541
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,240
I really can't get over it.

542
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
Go.

543
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Why are you here?

544
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:48,240
Mr. Gou seems to be unhappy to see me.

545
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,240
How could it be?

546
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:52,240
But you should be on your way to the new project.

547
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,240
Why are you back suddenly?

548
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,240
How can I find Mr. Gou to talk to me if I don't come back?

549
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Mr. Gou.

550
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,240
You transferred me without thinking.

551
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Then you transferred Ye Meng to replace him.

552
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
What do you mean?

553
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,240
Didn't you promise me to wait for the opening of Hailangang

554
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
and let me go back to you?

555
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
I made a mistake.

556
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:13,240
I'll transfer you back after you finish the new project.

557
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,240
Still lying?

558
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
What do you think of me?

559
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,240
You must be very proud.

560
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
If you misunderstood what I said before,

561
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
I apologize to you.

562
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,240
But we're just friends.

563
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
That's all.

564
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,240
So you've been using me as a gun from the beginning.

565
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,240
You hooked me up and gave me the project.

566
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
It's just to suppress Ye Meng.

567
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
Now Ye Meng is back.

568
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,240
I don't have any value left.

569
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,240
You want to kick me away, right?

570
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
I hooked you up.

571
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:49,240
You should be the one who hooked me up.

572
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
And the project was originally Ye Meng's.

573
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
I just transferred you back temporarily.

574
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
Now Ye Meng is back.

575
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
I have to return it to him.

576
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
Am I right?

577
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
You're so shameless.

578
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,240
Don't you know that Ye Meng is married?

579
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
I know.

580
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,240
Listen to me.

581
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
I won't play with you.

582
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Now I'm going to kick you out.

583
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,240
You like Ye Meng, right?

584
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Then I hope you'll like him forever.

585
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
I'm waiting for your final ending.

586
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Thank you. Please wait a moment.

587
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,240
I'm sorry for leaving suddenly.

588
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,240
I still have a lot of work to do.

589
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,240
I have to hand it over to you.

590
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,240
It's okay.

591
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,240
Don't blame yourself.

592
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,240
Although it's quite sudden.

593
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
You're not good at it.

594
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,240
I'll quit too.

595
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,240
What's your plan next?

596
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,240
I'll be a good friend.

597
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
I'll be a good friend.

598
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,240
What's your plan next?

599
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I haven't decided yet.

600
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,240
I'll take a break at my hometown.

601
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
Thank you.

602
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
It's good.

603
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,240
I heard that the head of the Hailangang project is changing people.

604
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,240
Will it change the team?

605
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,240
No, no.

606
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Don't worry.

607
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,240
They're all our own people.

608
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
The person in charge is the son of Mr. Li of Hanhai Group.

609
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
We're all brothers.

610
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
I'm an iron man.

611
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,240
How can I remember Mr. Li's son?

612
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,240
He just went to elementary school.

613
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
It's not Li Zhuo Feng.

614
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
It's Li Jin Yu.

615
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Which Li Jin Yu?

616
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,240
It's hard to write the name.

617
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,240
Ge Jin's Jin.

618
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,240
The rain on the island.

619
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,240
I'm a college roommate.

620
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I was in Ning Sui before.

621
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
You know him?

622
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,240
I don't know him.

623
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
I'm a little familiar with him.

624
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
How can you know him?

625
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,240
I want to ask you something.

626
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,240
You've been in Ning Sui for so long.

627
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Have you seen Ye Meng's husband?

628
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,240
What's he doing?

629
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,240
What does he look like?

630
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,240
He's mysterious.

631
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I haven't seen him.

632
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,240
I have something to do.

633
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,240
I'm leaving.

634
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Talk to you next time.

635
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
What are you doing?

636
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,240
Who is my husband?

637
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
Mr. Gong.

638
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,240
Meng.

639
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,240
I'm familiar with the person in charge of business in Hainan Port.

640
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,240
Relax.

641
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,240
Don't be nervous.

642
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,240
Okay.

643
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
I'm leaving.

644
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
Li Jin Yu.

645
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,240
Everyone.

646
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,240
I'm here to inform you.

647
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
From now on,

648
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
I'm in charge of Hainan Port.

649
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
We're all old friends.

650
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
I don't care about the past.

651
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm not going to

652
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,240
deal with the customs.

653
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,240
I've formed my own team.

654
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
As for the person in charge of the project,

655
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,240
I'll be in charge.

656
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Mr. Gong.

657
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,240
Long time no see.

658
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Mr. Li.

659
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Our team

660
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,240
signed the contract

661
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
after the group's evaluation.

662
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
You said you wouldn't cooperate.

663
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,240
Are you kidding?

664
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Of course not.

665
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I'm in charge of Hainan Port.

666
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,240
I have the right to change people.

667
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Really?

668
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,240
The contract clearly states that

669
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
when there is no major failure

670
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,240
or mistake,

671
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
the party can't cancel the contract.

672
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
I've seen your new

673
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
contract-making plan.

674
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
We think it's not qualified.

675
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:38,240
Is this reason sufficient?

676
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,240
Of course.

677
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,240
You can

678
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,240
not cooperate with us for any reason.

679
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
But we can choose not to accept it.

680
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,240
Contract is a contract

681
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
between the parties.

682
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
If you don't respect the spirit of the contract,

683
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,240
we'll file a lawsuit.

684
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Okay.

685
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Do you think you can win the lawsuit?

686
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
It doesn't matter.

687
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Hainan Port is about to be a marketing company.

688
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
If we sue

689
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
and make any bad comments,

690
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
we'll have to postpone the marketing.

691
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
I heard that

692
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
Hainan Group values this project very much.

693
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
Do you want to see this result?

694
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,240
The team can not change.

695
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
We can redo the plan.

696
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Ms. Li.

697
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Okay.

698
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,240
The new plan will be handed out next week.

699
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
If you can't do it,

700
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
you don't have to force yourself.

701
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,240
You shouldn't leave.

702
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Wang Jian, remember.

703
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
No problem.

704
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,240
Don't worry about the shops

705
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,240
that will be built in Hainan Port.

706
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,240
I'll leave it to the new operator,

707
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
Mr. Song.

708
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
The opening of the shop is very tight.

709
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,240
We don't have time to go around.

710
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
We can only work hard

711
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
and make up for the loss.

712
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Is there any problem?

713
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
Mr. Gao.

714
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Is there anything else?

715
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Let's get back to work.

716
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
Ms. Li.

717
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Please don't stop me from working next time.

718
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
Don't forget our agreement.

719
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,240
You're really a man who relies on clothes and horses.

720
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
You're hiding something better.

721
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,240
What do you want from me?

722
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
Let's talk about Ye Meng.

723
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
It seems that

724
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,240
you two are not married yet.

725
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Including your best friend,

726
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Gou Kai and Taimi.

727
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
And you.

728
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,240
Don't think about it.

729
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
Ye Meng and I

730
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
are already divorcing.

731
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,240
Divorce suddenly?

732
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
I just joined the company.

733
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I need a relationship

734
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
that can make me stable.

735
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,240
Ye Meng and I are not suitable.

736
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
Good acting.

737
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
You're really good at acting.

738
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
Do you have to divorce fakely

739
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,240
to protect Ye Meng?

740
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,240
I'm not going to divorce.

741
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
I'm not going to divorce fakely.

742
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:16,240
I know what Ye Meng is doing.

743
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
What do you want?

744
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,240
I want you to change Gou Kai's team.

745
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Let me be the person in charge of the public relations of the Hailangang project.

746
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Otherwise,

747
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
I don't know if Ms. Li Lingbai

748
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
knows that you two are married.

749
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
What will be the reaction?

750
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
Mr. Chen, please come in.

751
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Mr. Li, Mr. Chen is here.

752
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
This way.

753
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
Help me get that contract back.

754
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
Okay, Mr. Li.

755
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
Wait.

756
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Why did you ask me to Ye Meng's company?

757
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,240
Where is she?

758
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,240
She went out for lunch.

759
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Why are you here?

760
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
You're sitting on her chair.

761
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
This is my company.

762
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Please sit down.

763
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
Mr. Li, your file.

764
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Wait.

765
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
What's your name?

766
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,240
Mr. Li.

767
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,240
Mr. Li?

768
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,240
Is this an actor?

769
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
You two are...

770
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,240
Mr. Li, what does your friend mean?

771
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
It's okay.

772
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
You can go out and do your work.

773
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
Okay, Mr. Li.

774
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Is he so trustworthy?

775
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,240
He's a good actor.

776
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
Really, bro.

777
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Come on.

778
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Take a look.

779
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,240
I'm going to let you manage

780
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,240
the shops in Hailangang.

781
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,240
The legal representative of Hailangang, Li Jingyu.

782
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,240
You're good at making props.

783
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Mr. Li.

784
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
It's really you.

785
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,240
No.

786
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,240
Why did you go to Jiangbei for a few days

787
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,240
and come back to be the general manager of Hailangang?

788
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Han Haiqi's boss is my mom.

789
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,240
Then,

790
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,240
what do you think about the business management rights?

791
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
Give it to me.

792
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,240
I was thinking,

793
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,240
you have experience in managing the jewelry.

794
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,240
It's better to hand it over to you than to others.

795
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,240
Your reason is too unethical.

796
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
I don't believe it.

797
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,240
You tell me the truth.

798
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,240
Otherwise, no matter how much money you give,

799
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,240
I won't help you with anything.

800
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Ye Meng is going to divorce me.

801
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,240
Why?

802
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
My mom may have something to do with

803
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
the case of her mother's suicide.

804
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:03,240
I don't want her to investigate this case.

805
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,240
I'm not not going to help you with this.

806
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm not not going to help you.

807
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
But this is a little...

808
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
You should tell Ye Meng.

809
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,240
Don't let this affect your two marriages.

810
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I'm afraid that

811
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
my mom will do something to Ye Meng

812
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,240
after she knows that Ye Meng is investigating this case.

813
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,240
You know Mr. Wang's disappearance before, right?

814
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,240
It may have something to do with my mom.

815
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,240
My mom's eyes are all over the company.

816
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,240
I want you to help me investigate it together.

817
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
But you can't let anyone know.

818
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,240
If it's for Faya to know,

819
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:36,240
if I help you and not help Ye Meng,

820
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
we both have to be removed from the job.

821
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Really.

822
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
We're not the same.

823
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
We're not the same.

824
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
No matter how bad you are,

825
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
you're just a step behind.

826
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,240
What you said is reasonable.

827
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Mr. Li.

828
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,240
But back to the point,

829
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,240
you have to think about

830
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,240
how to coax your Ye Meng.

831
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
It's not a small matter.

832
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
As for what you said,

833
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
I know.

834
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
I'm leaving.

835
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Mr. Li.

836
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
Is this countable?

837
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Of course.

838
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,240
I saw you when we were interviewing.

839
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
We're brothers.

840
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,240
I'll send you a message.

841
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,240
Okay.

842
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
Let's go.

843
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,240
See you.

844
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,240
What?

845
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Li Jingyu became the current Jiang Luzhi

846
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,240
after accepting his first job at Hailang.

847
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Yes.

848
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I didn't expect that he'd do things so recklessly.

849
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
But it doesn't make sense.

850
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,240
What did he think of?

851
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,240
I think what's strange is that

852
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Jiang Luzhi didn't reveal

853
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,640
about my relationship with Li Jingyu.

854
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,800
I guess she and Li Jingyu

855
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,160
have some kind of cooperation.

856
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,640
By the way, about Kai Kai,

857
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Li Jingyu handed the shop in Hailangang

858
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,400
to Kai Kai.

859
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,600
Kai Kai?

860
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,560
What is Li Jingyu

861
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,560
going to do?

862
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,720
She is holding a case

863
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,240
against my mom.

864
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:21,520
By the way,

865
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,960
help me investigate Kai Kai

866
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,640
and see what they are up to.

867
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,520
Okay.

868
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,240
Kai Kai can't hide anything.

869
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,280
Leave it to me.

870
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,640
Call me if you need anything.

871
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:33,160
Okay.

872
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:33,800
Bye.

873
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,280
Mom, what's wrong with Kai Kai?

874
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,400
He is fine.

875
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,280
He is fine.

876
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,480
Go to bed.

877
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,520
The food is so delicious today.

878
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,720
I feel like I'm going to gain weight.

879
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,200
Go to the police station after dinner.

880
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,040
Okay.

881
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,240
Meng,

882
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,880
this is the tenth edition of our revamp.

883
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:01,800
Take a look.

884
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,240
Is there anything else to be improved?

885
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:29,920
Yan Meng.

886
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,320
This is my house. Your house is over there.

887
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,080
Wait a minute.

888
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:37,680
Is there anything?

889
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,240
Why don't you go in?

890
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,560
Hello, brother. What's wrong?

891
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,360
Well, it's okay.

892
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,920
I just want to tell you something.

893
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,840
I had a fight with your sister-in-law.

894
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,680
What?

895
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,760
But you must not tell grandma.

896
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,000
And don't let them come to my house tonight.

897
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,000
Don't worry.

898
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,040
I'm the strictest.

899
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,320
I will never tell anyone.

900
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Hello, grandma.

901
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,240
My brother had a fight with Sister Yan Meng.

902
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,600
This time, he was so angry.

903
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,120
What?

904
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,560
Really. He just called me.

905
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:32,080
He cried so...

906
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,600
He cried so hard.

907
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,680
What should I do, grandma?

908
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:35,320
Who is it?

909
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:39,680
Hello.

910
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,200
Why are you calling me?

911
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,640
Your granddaughter had a fight with my granddaughter.

912
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,200
And she insisted on getting divorced.

913
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:47,160
What?

914
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,480
That's not okay.

915
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:52,720
Had a fight?

916
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:54,720
No.

917
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,120
How could it be?

918
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,040
We are fine.

919
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,000
I just joined the company.

920
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,280
I just want to talk to Mr. Ye

921
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,000
about my study and study.

922
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,680
Grandma,

923
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,080
why are you here?

924
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,920
To deliver chicken soup.

925
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:14,760
Let's go.

926
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,600
Let's go in.

927
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,120
Ji Cheng.

928
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,120
Open the door.

929
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:17,720
Come on.

930
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,560
Be careful, grandma.

931
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,180

You

00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,620
I feel I'll

944
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,620
I thought of you

945
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,620
I heard any news about you

946
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:09,620
The love that was reflected in my heart

947
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,620
Captured my thoughts

948
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:19,620
Where to go

949
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,620
How to avoid

950
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:28,620
Those memories about you

951
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:39,620
I want to be far away, but I can't get you out of my mind

952
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:43,620
I'm silent

953
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:46,620
Put the flowers in the back

954
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:52,620
Maybe sadness will stop spreading

955
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:57,620
Pretend to be firm

956
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:02,620
But still in the distance

957
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:08,620
The most perfect lie

958
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:11,620
Deceive yourself

959
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:17,620
If love is letting go, let us lose the connection

960
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:23,620
Why is this moment of tears

961
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Heart still yearns

962
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:50,620
I want to be far away, but I can't get you out of my mind
