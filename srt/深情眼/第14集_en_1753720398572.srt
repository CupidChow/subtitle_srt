00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excitingly saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, I forget

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
If I have that me who still loves you

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if it has never changed

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that you have my dream

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Love by Hypnotic

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Big brother, we found the couple who cheated you last time.

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
They are in Jiangbei now. Do you dare to do it?

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What to do?

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Do it day and night

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Now it's all in the society

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You didn't teach me last time

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Where did you get it?

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Big brother

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Hello, Mr. Qian

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm going to drink in the daytime

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll tell you the truth

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He likes to hit people with a bottle

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't be nervous this time

33
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
We are here to apologize to you

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Apologize?

35
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You don't have to apologize to me

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
In theory, I should thank you two

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If you didn't send me in in time

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You sent me in without any effort

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let me accept the wedding gift of the law

41
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I may not be as good as I want

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I made a big mistake

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your couple is my benefactor

44
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You are talking about identity

45
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We are really here to apologize

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Last time it was a misunderstanding

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
We didn't expect it to be so big

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
By the way, this is my friend

49
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I bought the best old class

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You try

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And we are here today

52
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
We have business to talk to you

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Business?

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Sit down

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Look at me now

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Just a business

57
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Besides, we are not familiar

58
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
How can we talk about business?

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Don't get me wrong

60
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
My wife is interested in this paper in your hand

61
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't even think about it

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I won't sell it

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We don't want to buy it

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I just want to know

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The seller information of your paper

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You are so good at it

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Keep it secret

68
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I forgot

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother

70
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Can you help me think about it?

71
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
We can help you

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you think I'm that kind of

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
A man who is open to money

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I can't stand it

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I didn't take the money

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Sorry

77
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Think about it again

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
No

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm not familiar with that brother

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I've met him several times

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
His name is Wang Xing

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wang Xingsheng

83
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Yes, Wang Xingsheng

84
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you have a photo?

85
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes, I have a photo

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Think about it

87
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Wang Xingsheng

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's him

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I'm sorry

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I am also introduced by a friend

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
As for where he is now

92
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I really don't know

93
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Can I call you and ask?

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Come

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hello, Mr. Zhang

97
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Fat man

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I want to ask you something

99
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are the one who sold me last time

100
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Where is the Wang Xingsheng and Wang boss?

101
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Do you know?

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I went in

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I didn't contact him after I went in

104
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Why did he go in?

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I don't know

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
OK, OK, OK

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Goodbye

108
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Hello, Fat man

109
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Fat man

110
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I want to ask you something

111
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The Wang Xingsheng and Wang boss who sold me last time

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Where is the Wang boss?

113
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I want to make some goods with him

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Yinghe Hotel, right?

115
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay, okay, okay

116
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I see

117
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Yinghe Hotel

118
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
The current Yinghe Hotel is cool

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, yes, yes

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Thank you

121
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No, no

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Have some tea before you go

123
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Boss Wang

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Someone was looking for you

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I told them

126
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, yes, yes

127
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
They are there now

128
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I don't know what's going on

130
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
OK

131
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Yinghe Hotel should be here

132
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes, it is

133
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But nearby

134
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Besides Yinghe Hotel

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There is a small hotel called Yinghe Hotel

136
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
But it's very well-designed

137
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Well, you go there

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll keep an eye on it

139
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
OK

140
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Call you later

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Hello

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Please check which room Mr. Wang is in

143
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
We can't

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Reveal the information of the guests

145
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm his colleague

146
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I'll send him the contract in a hurry

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Then you can register here first, okay?

148
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Thank you

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is this okay?

150
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
OK, I'll check it for you

151
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
OK

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Please

153
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Sir, can you hurry up?

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
OK, I'll try

155
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I'm done

156
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Wang Qingxiao

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I sent you a location

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
And you'll be there soon

159
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I found Mr. Wang

160
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Mingxiao, I sent you a location

161
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Can you come and help me?

162
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
OK, thank you

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Wang

164
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Long time no see

165
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What's up?

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I can't come to you

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I've been out for so long

168
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You've been avoiding me

169
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
So many years

170
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I've been afraid of meeting my old friend

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
It's not good to meet your old friend after so many years

172
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
By the way

173
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I remember your husband and Ning Zui

174
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It seems that something happened here

175
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You called me here

176
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Just to talk about this

177
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Let's not talk about this

178
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Talk about it?

179
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You used to have me to take Ning Zui's land

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
And told me that you could give me all the land

181
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
So I collected money from everywhere

182
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I called in the money

183
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You gave me a sugarcane

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
But after that

185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You took over my project

186
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Now Hainan Port business is getting bigger

187
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You also made a lot of money

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Is it appropriate for you to give me that?

189
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You can take the money

190
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
We have a deal

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I changed my mind

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
There is no rule

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
When you called me

194
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
You liked that I didn't break the rule

195
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
All these years

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I've done so many things for you

197
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll take your money?

198
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm not afraid

199
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll take your money?

200
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Is it your bad evidence?

201
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Ning Zui

202
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Hello

203
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Hello

204
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'm home

205
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How come it's here?

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What's wrong with Goukai?

207
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What's the relationship with Goukai?

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Isn't this Goukai's club?

209
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
This is Goukai club

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,200
Do you know the password?

211
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,720
I don't know.

212
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,640
Hurry up.

213
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,840
Where is he?

214
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,240
What are you looking for in the yellow tent?

215
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,040
What's wrong?

216
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,680
I just saw Wang Xing Sheng.

217
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,720
Wang Xing Sheng?

218
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,160
Here?

219
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,680
Yes.

220
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,400
Wait.

221
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,160
How does he know the password?

222
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,960
It's been a long time.

223
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,760
Why is he here?

224
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,640
I don't know.

225
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,800
I saw a car just now.

226
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,920
Is he in the car?

227
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,520
There's a safe.

228
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,320
Check the safe.

229
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,160
Why is the computer off?

230
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,840
Check it.

231
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,520
The password is fine.

232
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,880
What's going on?

233
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,760
The box is hot.

234
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,720
Someone touched it.

235
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,320
I don't know.

236
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,240
I just saw it.

237
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,240
I don't know.

238
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I don't know.

239
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,240
I don't know.

240
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
I don't know.

241
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't know.

242
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I don't know.

243
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,240
I don't know.

244
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,480
Did you see anyone else?

245
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,400
I was watching the door.

246
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,080
I saw a car.

247
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:22,400
There's a back door.

248
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Check the back door.

249
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,080
Okay.

250
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,800
I'm sorry to have you here.

251
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,160
We lost something.

252
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:47,960
The monitor is broken.

253
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:48,800
We lost everything.

254
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,400
It's okay.

255
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,040
Take a look.

256
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:50,760
Thank you.

257
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,080
Isn't this...

258
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,320
Isn't this Sa Baidian?

259
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,760
Sa Baidian?

260
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,920
Did the monitor get deleted by Sa Baidian?

261
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,440
We took it with our students.

262
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,960
Does Sa Baidian look handsome?

263
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,320
They seem to be on good terms.

264
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,160
Why did they break up?

265
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,240
Because of a World Memory Saving Competition.

266
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,240
Both of them have prepared

267
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,840
several lessons for this competition.

268
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,720
But Li Junyu

269
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,880
suddenly quit the competition the day before.

270
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,480
So the competition was lost.

271
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,880
Everyone was badly scolded.

272
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,240
Then they broke up.

273
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,040
After that, Li Junyu left.

274
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,320
He never came back.

275
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,040
Why did he leave Jiangbei?

276
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,640
I don't know.

277
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,560
I and Gou Kaicai are because of his mother.

278
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,880
Don't think his mother is the chairman of Hanhai Group.

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
I don't think she's his son.

280
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
Stop.

281
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,720
Hello.

282
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,000
Is Li Lingbai this person?

283
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,000
He just drove out.

284
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
It's Li Lingbai.

285
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,600
Why did Li Lingbai come here?

286
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,840
Is he here to see his son or his mother?

287
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,880
If he's here to see his son,

288
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,240
why did they leave separately?

289
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,080
If he's here to see Meng Xingcheng,

290
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,400
Hanhai Group will also leave.

291
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:24,600
Then why did Sa Baidian come here?

292
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
It's so chaotic.

293
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,880
I'll call him and ask.

294
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,920
You didn't answer.

295
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,360
You left,

296
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,800
now it's so chaotic.

297
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,160
You took the responsibility?

298
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:13,000
How much money do you want this time?

299
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,240
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,800
You're not staying at Ning Cui.

301
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
Why are you here?

302
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,600
To see your play.

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
What play?

304
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,640
You should ask yourself.

305
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,240
You haven't driven

306
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,520
your own car for years.

307
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,600
It's rare that you drive your own car today.

308
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,160
You must have an important friend.

309
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,360
You're still the same.

310
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,720
You always speak in a fast and distant way.

311
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,160
Don't say it so harshly.

312
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,640
I'm concerned about you.

313
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,560
But you're still thinking about the past.

314
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,000
Your friends from eight or nine years ago

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,280
are still in touch.

316
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,600
It's not like you.

317
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
What do you want to say?

318
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,120
There was a case of a woman

319
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,400
committing suicide in Jiumen Ridge.

320
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,080
Do you remember?

321
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
I happened to drive by that day

322
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,400
and saw two people arguing in the car.

323
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,880
But I didn't see the man's face clearly.

324
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,480
Later, I heard

325
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,320
that a woman committed suicide in Jiumen Ridge.

326
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,720
I told the police

327
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,280
the picture I saw

328
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,680
and the license plate of the car.

329
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:32,640
But the next day,

330
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,680
you suddenly came to question me.

331
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,880
With your current mental state,

332
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
you dare to be a witness.

333
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,200
Can you take some responsibility?

334
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,760
I'm sure

335
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,720
I saw the license plate.

336
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,920
Yes.

337
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,040
That license plate

338
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,680
belongs to my business partner,

339
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,520
Wang Xingsheng.

340
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,240
But at that time,

341
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,280
I was talking to him in Chenghuailu.

342
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,440
How could he be in Jiumen Ridge?

343
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,560
Impossible.

344
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,480
I remember it clearly.

345
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,000
You must have taken too many pills.

346
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,400
Your memory is in a mess.

347
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,720
Li Jingyu,

348
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,480
isn't it enough to kill your father?

349
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,280
You still want to ruin my business.

350
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,720
Do you still have this family?

351
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,640
I really thought I had a wrong memory.

352
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,920
I found the police wanted to turn the tide that day.

353
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,600
But at that time,

354
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,920
the police had already

355
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,000
solved this case

356
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,680
and committed suicide.

357
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,120
So I didn't think much later.

358
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
But today,

359
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,600
seeing you two together,

360
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,240
I suddenly remembered

361
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,960
that there were many things

362
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,000
that didn't go well.

363
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,560
On the day of the incident on the 15th,

364
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,080
you came back from a business trip this afternoon

365
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,080
and landed in Jiangbei.

366
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,400
At that time,

367
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,960
Chenghuailu should have

368
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,480
stopped traffic because of the storm.

369
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,640
Then how did your partner

370
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,480
appear in Chenghuailu?

371
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
This matter...

372
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Just investigate it.

373
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,760
It has nothing to do with us.

374
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,560
Don't rush to leave, Miss Li.

375
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
But

376
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,640
the play hasn't finished yet.

377
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,600
Aren't you afraid that I'll take your scar

378
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,520
and count it as bad evidence?

379
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,440
If something really goes wrong,

380
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,720
you won't think that I'm a good witness.

381
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,240
At that time,

382
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,040
I'll tell you everything

383
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,800
one by one.

384
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,160
You know the consequences.

385
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,960
Actually, there's no need

386
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,640
for us to be like this.

387
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,880
You know me best

388
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,640
and know what I want.

389
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,720
Give me what I want.

390
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,240
Don't bother me again.

391
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,840
I know that you're a good person.

392
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,040
You won't owe me anything.

393
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,080
If I give this to you,

394
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I'll give it to you.

395
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
Give it to the police.

396
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Give it to them.

397
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,880
Who said I wanted to give it to the police?

398
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,520
But if I give it to the board of directors

399
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,720
or to the media,

400
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,520
Wang Xingsheng

401
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:16,760
just got in

402
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
and you took over

403
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,320
the project of Hailangang.

404
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:22,560
After many years,

405
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,960
Wang Xingsheng came out

406
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,960
and had no idea.

407
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,560
He had no way to get money from you.

408
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,560
Then he disappeared.

409
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,960
What do you think people will think?

410
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,760
Will they accept Shen Wa?

411
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,920
Do you think

412
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,960
you can beat Shen Wa?

413
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,960
Li Jinyu,

414
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,800
what do you want to do?

415
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:56,760
Sir,

416
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,320
we followed Wang Xingsheng's car

417
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,520
and disappeared in Hanhai Group.

418
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
We really can't find out about this.

419
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,160
Hanhai Group is too deep.

420
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,480
If we want to find out,

421
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,040
we may have to think from the inside.

422
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,560
I thought Mr. Li would bring me

423
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,560
to the office of the general manager of Hanhai Group.

424
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,560
With such a large sum of money,

425
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,360
the company will have to go through the process.

426
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,560
How about

427
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,360
staying here for a few days?

428
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,880
You're kidding me?

429
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,640
How could I be kidding you?

430
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
It's not a small sum.

431
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
I really don't have that much cash.

432
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,520
Okay.

433
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,480
I'll give you another day.

434
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,960
What are you doing?

435
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,760
You don't follow the rules.

436
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:53,560
Then you can't go to the office.

437
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,160
Let's just play.

438
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,760
Let me remind you.

439
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,440
If I can't get out,

440
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,920
all your evidence is outside.

441
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,600
Think it over.

442
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:10,640
Okay.

443
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,400
Have a good rest.

444
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,640
Take care of him for me.

445
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,400
Li Linbai, you're too much.

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,560
Don't touch me.

447
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,120
Sir.

448
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,360
Don't touch me. I can do it myself.

449
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:21,960
Sir.

450
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,040
Ye Matao

451
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,160
Have you had your dinner?

452
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,160
I have no mood for dinner.

453
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,000
I called for you the whole afternoon voicemail.

454
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,400
But you didn't pick up a single call.

455
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,400
What happened?

456
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,920
The phone is running out of power.

457
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,160
Oh.

458
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,000
I went around the area around the hotel today.

459
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,360
There's nothing to say.

460
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,280
What about you?

461
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,120
Have you seen Wang Xing Sheng?

462
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,880
No.

463
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,120
I went to a club with him.

464
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,040
Then he disappeared.

465
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,240
since we had our own production so we had to work really hard.

466
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,820
Plugentic team,

467
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,080
there is noat

468
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,020
We have already drank a lot.

469
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,160
We lost weight.

470
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,300
So when we had special

471
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:33,160
andbag like that,

472
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,460
we are the wounds on the head.

473
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,400
At that time,

474
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,840
I wanted to look at our team

475
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,940
And I always wanted to have a group

476
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,680
Have a group

477
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:47,080
You're on it.

478
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,200
There's Gou Kai.

479
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,160
Did you know each other?

480
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,520
I knew Gou Kai when I was little.

481
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,960
Tan Mingxiao is my college roommate.

482
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,760
Why haven't I heard you say it?

483
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,680
I thought

484
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,880
I might never have a chance to talk to them again.

485
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,880
So I never mentioned it to you.

486
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,280
Well,

487
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm sorry.

488
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,840
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

489
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,080
I didn't go to the Galaxy Hotel today.

490
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,600
I met Li Linbai.

491
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,200
I'm sorry.

492
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,120
It seems that you and your mother

493
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,680
are not that bad.

494
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,040
That's right.

495
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,000
After all, you are a family.

496
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,640
Actually, I...

497
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,160
I booked a flight ticket to Ningsui.

498
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,240
What about Wang Xingcheng?

499
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,640
I'm not going to investigate.

500
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,680
I can't see him anyway.

501
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,720
It's a waste of time.

502
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,260
I can't see through the

503
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:54,520
toppings I decide not to use.

504
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,960
There is something I'm boatshitting.

505
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,480
I'll return their

506
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,600
apple as aisson on your mercy.

507
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,760
But you're in love.

508
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:13,280
Butterfly..

509
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm so busy.

510
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,120
I'm sorry.

511
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,120
I'm sorry.

512
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,120
I'm sorry.

513
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
I'm sorry.

514
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
I'm sorry.

515
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
I'm sorry.

516
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
I'm sorry.

517
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,120
I'm sorry.

518
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,120
I'm sorry.

519
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,120
I'm sorry.

520
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
I'm sorry.

521
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I'm sorry.

522
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I'm sorry.

523
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,120
I'm sorry.

524
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
I'm sorry.

525
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,120
I'm sorry.

526
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
I'm sorry.

527
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,120
I'm sorry.

528
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm sorry.

529
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
I'm sorry.

530
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I'm sorry.

531
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
I'm sorry.

532
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,120
I'm sorry.

533
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,120
I'm sorry.

534
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm sorry.

536
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
I'm sorry.

537
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,120
I'm sorry.

538
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I'm sorry.

539
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,880
I'm sorry.

540
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,040
I'm sorry.

541
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,480
I'm sorry.

542
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm sorry.

543
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,880
grips

544
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,240
I'm sorry.

545
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,560
I'm sorry, wait.

546
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,320
Won't it be too long?

547
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,360
You bring it up.

548
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,800
Take your time.

549
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,440
The point of this envelop is for the need and value.

550
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,040
I didn't bring it up.

551
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,720
Just leave it.

552
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,320
Dear daughter-in-law.

553
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
You're back.

554
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:21,960
Dad,

555
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,440
go home.

556
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,160
I've made you

557
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,000
a lot of delicious food.

558
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,520
Okay?

559
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:27,000
Come on.

560
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:29,920
Dear,

561
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,160
come with me.

562
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,080
Okay.

563
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,800
I'll go and have a taste.

564
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,640
Let's see if my granddaughter

565
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,280
can eat well

566
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,040
if the food Allen prepared days.

567
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,840
The chef?

568
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,360
What do you mean?

569
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,000
Get out!

570
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Where is it?

571
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,240
Keep talking!

572
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,280
Grandma, eat it.

573
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
It's getting cold.

574
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,280
Xu Minglan, don't be so polite.

575
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
We'll be a family from now on, right?

576
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
Come on.

577
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,280
Mom.

578
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Eat meat.

579
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,280
Add some meat.

580
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,280
Eat more.

581
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
I'm really not polite.

582
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
I'm not used to

583
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:42,280
these big fish and meat.

584
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Xu Hua,

585
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,280
I'm not talking about you.

586
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:49,280
You should change your

587
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:52,280
unhealthy eating habits.

588
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,280
I don't know how to read and read.

589
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,280
They said that

590
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,280
young people nowadays

591
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,280
are over-nutritional

592
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,280
and eat too much.

593
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:08,280
You should eat more healthy food.

594
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,280
I haven't raised pigs for years.

595
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
How can I raise them?

596
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,280
Right?

597
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,280
I haven't raised them for years.

598
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
Listen to me.

599
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
I raised them.

600
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,280
Why are they so skinny?

601
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
They're so skinny.

602
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,280
Look, I raised them.

603
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
Stand up and show them.

604
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,280
They're so white and tall.

605
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
I raised them.

606
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Why are you standing up?

607
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
Sit down.

608
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:35,280
Mengmeng can't eat these.

609
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
I'm fine.

610
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,280
I can eat them.

611
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,280
You can eat them, right?

612
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,280
You're used to them, right?

613
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,280
Listen to me.

614
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,280
You little brat.

615
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,280
No wonder people say

616
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,280
that a married daughter

617
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,280
is like a broken glass.

618
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,280
You haven't married yet.

619
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,280
You're just like your mother-in-law.

620
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
Grandma,

621
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
don't worry.

622
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,280
I will eat balanced food

623
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,280
and take care of my health.

624
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,280
I like to listen to

625
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,280
my grandchild.

626
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,280
By the way, Mengmeng,

627
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,280
how's the thing in Jiangbei going?

628
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,280
It's going well.

629
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,280
It's going well, right?

630
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,280
I have to say something.

631
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
We should prepare for the wedding,

632
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,280
right?

633
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,280
I've prepared the wedding dress for you.

634
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,280
I've chosen it.

635
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,280
The mermaid in the TV.

636
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,280
The wedding dress.

637
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,280
I've been waiting for it for a long time.

638
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
It's a legend.

639
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,280
My granddaughter-in-law

640
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,280
is the most beautiful daughter-in-law in the world.

641
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,280
She's so beautiful.

642
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,280
I'm telling you the truth.

643
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,280
Enough.

644
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:43,280
What do you mean?

645
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
When you chose the wedding dress,

646
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,280
why didn't you discuss it with me?

647
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,280
Why should I discuss it with you?

648
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm the one who should discuss it with you.

649
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,280
I'm going to have a Chinese-style wedding for them.

650
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,280
The cheongsam is customized.

651
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,280
Chinese-style weddings have been old-fashioned.

652
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,280
What's popular now is Western-style.

653
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,280
It's elegant and generous.

654
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,280
What's wrong?

655
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
What's wrong?

656
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,280
What's wrong?

657
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,280
Why did you throw up?

658
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,280
I threw up.

659
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,280
It's okay.

660
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,280
Why are you so disgusting?

661
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,280
I feel a little uncomfortable.

662
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,280
Dad.

663
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,280
How long has it been?

664
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,280
It's okay.

665
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
I just ate something a little fast.

666
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,280
So I don't feel very hungry.

667
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
So handsome.

668
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
Xu Huan.

669
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
We have to get married quickly.

670
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
Otherwise, I'll order the cheongsam for him.

671
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,280
I'm afraid it's not enough.

672
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
No.

673
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,280
Then my beautiful girl

674
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,280
will have to pay extra.

675
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,280
Welcome.

676
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,280
What can I do for you?

677
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
You are Fang Xiao'an, right?

678
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,280
I am.

679
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,280
Chen Jian is your husband, right?

680
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
Come on, call him out.

681
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
I don't know this person.

682
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,280
You got it wrong.

683
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:18,280
Don't be nervous, beautiful girl.

684
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,280
We don't hit people.

685
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
Your husband owes us money.

686
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,280
It's a low price to pay off the debt.

687
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
Right?

688
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
You two haven't divorced yet.

689
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,280
We checked this thing clearly before coming here.

690
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,280
Call him back quickly.

691
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
Solve the problem.

692
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
This person is gone.

693
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,280
I really can't contact him.

694
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,280
Stop acting.

695
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,280
Is it interesting?

696
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Hurry up.

697
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
Sorry.

698
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
The number you dialed is not available.

699
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,280
Sorry.

700
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Okay.

701
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,280
It's okay.

702
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I can wait here.

703
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:00,280
I have time.

704
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
Chen Jian.

705
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,280
Chen Jian, stop hiding.

706
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,280
The medical records are here.

707
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,280
Come here.

708
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,280
And, you bastard.

709
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
Don't worry about the wedding.

710
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,280
Take care of Mengmeng.

711
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
Right.

712
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,280
Grandma will do it.

713
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,280
I'll do it.

714
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,280
You should do it.

715
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,280
I have something to do.

716
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,280
I'm getting married.

717
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,280
You should listen to me.

718
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
Grandma.

719
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
Something happened to my friend's house.

720
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,280
I'm leaving.

721
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,280
I'll go with you.

722
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,280
You don't have to go.

723
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
Mengmeng, you love to eat sour and sweet.

724
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:44,280
Tell grandma.

725
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Kaka, something happened to Yang's house.

726
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,280
Come here quickly.

727
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,280
Sorry, brother.

728
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,280
I'm late.

729
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,280
I'm really sorry.

730
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,280
Brother.

731
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
I've been paying you since childhood.

732
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
I didn't say I wouldn't pay you back.

733
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,280
You're in his shop.

734
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,280
Is it inappropriate?

735
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:04,280
Chen Jian.

736
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:06,280
I don't care what you did outside.

737
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,280
You bastard.

738
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
Take them all out.

739
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,280
Don't get in my way.

740
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
If you don't play disappear,

741
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,280
we won't find it here.

742
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,280
Yes.

743
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Brother, can you do this?

744
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,280
Or you go back first.

745
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,280
I'll find a way to make it up to you.

746
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,280
How do you plan to make it up?

747
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
My wife and children are all in the shop.

748
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,280
I can't run away.

749
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
We'll figure something out.

750
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
We'll figure something out.

751
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
If it doesn't work,

752
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:32,280
we'll make the house first.

753
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,280
Or we'll make up for your interest.

754
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,280
Is that okay?

755
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,280
As soon as possible.

756
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
Don't force us to come again.

757
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
Sure.

758
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
It's too troublesome.

759
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Slow down, brother.

760
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
You really

761
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,280
have a new view of me.

762
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,280
I just said that I've been

763
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,280
struggling with some problems.

764
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,280
Honey, you have to help me.

765
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Give me the rent.

766
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
Let's get the loan first.

767
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
Let's get through this.

768
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
Are you talking about human words?

769
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,280
You don't have money, you buy a new car.

770
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,280
You don't have money, you learn to do business.

771
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,280
It's just a business.

772
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,280
It's a business.

773
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,280
I don't have this.

774
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,280
Others don't believe me.

775
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,280
I don't cooperate with me.

776
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
An,

777
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,280
we're husband and wife, right?

778
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
You can't see death without seeing...

779
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
Stop.

780
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,280
Who's your husband and wife?

781
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,280
You didn't come when we were doing the divorce.

782
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,280
And then you disappeared.

783
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,280
Today, you met me

784
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
and asked me to pay you back.

785
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Do you have humanity?

786
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
I'm telling you, Chen Jian.

787
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
This marriage,

788
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,280
you have to divorce it even if you don't.

789
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:46,280
You pay your own debt.

790
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Fang Ya'en,

791
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,280
you have to make me pay you back, right?

792
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,280
Then I have to remind you.

793
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:56,280
The debt I owe you

794
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,280
is the debt of husband and wife.

795
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,280
You have half of it.

796
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,280
What are you doing, Chen Jian?

797
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,280
Chen Jian!

798
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
Stop!

799
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,280
Fang Ya'en!

800
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Fang Ya'en!

801
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Open the door!

802
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I'm telling you, Chen Jian.

803
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
If you touch my property,

804
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,280
I'll kill you.

805
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I don't do business without money.

806
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,280
I'm just in a hurry.

807
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,280
This house is my money.

808
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,280
I just want to fight a war.

809
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,280
Fang Ya'en,

810
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,280
open the door.

811
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,280
Let's sit down

812
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,280
and have a good talk, okay?

813
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
Open the door!

814
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Fang Ya'en!

815
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,280
Open the door!

816
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Fang Ya'en!

817
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:43,280
Chen Jian, are you crazy?

818
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
I'm telling you.

819
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,280
What do you want?

820
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
I'm telling you.

821
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,280
Stop!

822
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,280
Give it back to me!

823
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,280
Give it back to me!

824
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,280
Give it back to me!

825
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,280
Give it back to me!

826
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,280
What are you doing, Chen Jian?

827
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,280
You stole my license!

828
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,280
You're crazy, Chen Jian!

829
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
You hit me!

830
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
You hit me to hurt me.

831
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I'll let you go to the hospital.

832
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
It's none of your business.

833
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
It's none of my business.

834
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,280
Don't let anyone go today.

835
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,280
I'll call the police right away.

836
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,280
Move!

837
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
Give it back to me!

838
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Stop!

839
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,280
Changran!

840
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Stop!

841
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Okay, okay.

842
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,280
Stop fighting.

843
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Open the door!

844
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,280
Hello, Kaikei.

845
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
I want to go to the bathroom.

846
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
You shouldn't have stopped me just now.

847
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
I should have kicked him more.

848
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,280
And then?

849
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
Did you break it

850
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,280
and stew the oranges with it?

851
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,280
He deserves it.

852
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,280
You don't have to be with him.

853
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
Anyway,

854
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,280
I'm glad you're okay.

855
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,280
Kaikei,

856
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
go pick up Jiayu.

857
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
The house is so messy.

858
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
You stay with him, okay?

859
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,280
Okay.

860
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,280
Leave it to me.

861
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Ye Meng.

862
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:23,280
Are you okay?

863
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,280
I'm fine.

864
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,280
I'll take you home then.

865
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,280
No need.

866
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,280
We'll take a taxi.

867
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Jingyu,

868
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,280
please go with Kaikei

869
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,280
to pick up Jiayu for me.

870
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,280
You can take him out

871
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
to play or have a meal.

872
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
I don't want him to know

873
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,280
that something happened at home.

874
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,280
Okay, no problem.

875
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:53,280
I'm leaving.

876
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,280
Let's go.

877
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,280
You.

878
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:26,280
I saw you.

879
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,280
I thought of you.

880
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:35,280
I heard about you.

881
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:42,280
The love that was reflected in my heart

882
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:47,280
occupied my mind.

883
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:52,280
Where should I go?

884
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:56,280
How should I avoid

885
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:02,280
those memories about you?

886
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,280
I was so mad at you

887
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,280
that I couldn't get rid of you.

888
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:19,280
I couldn't get rid of you.

889
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,280
I was silent

890
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,280
and put the flowers in the back garden.

891
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,280
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading.

892
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,280
I pretended to be determined

893
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,280
but I'm still obsessed with you.

894
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,280
The most perfect lies

895
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,280
lie to themselves.

896
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,280
If we can let go of love,

897
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:56,280
let's lose our relationship.

898
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:59,280
Why is it that

899
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,280
my heart still yearns

900
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,280
for you?

901
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,280
The End
