00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excitingly saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, I forget

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the remaining memories that suddenly burn and scatter

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the road of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is still if

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This promise will be kept

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

20
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Love by Hypnotic

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll do it. You take a break.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You take a break.

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Now you come here to pretend to be a good father.

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Why didn't you answer the phone call this noon?

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Is it on the unremitting dinner table?

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I know you blame me.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm not a good father or a good husband.

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But speaking of dinner table, wine table,

30
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Because I want to go.

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I go to drink with my grandson, play horse fart.

32
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I went to the hospital several times myself.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I said for me?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Jiayu's interest class, Xia Ling, she has a trip.

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How much?

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
The company's staff.

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't dare to go to the eight sister.

38
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I let you take it alone.

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, you don't have to tell me this.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tomorrow we will sign the agreement.

41
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I don't have to.

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I just want Jiayu.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Do you have to go to this step?

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Did I have to go to this step?

45
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If we really get divorced,

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The child becomes a child of the parents.

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Is her classmate laughing at her?

48
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Sick, the school has an activity.

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Others are parents, they are all here.

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Be quiet.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Is she alone?

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Aren't you disappointed?

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
There are so many people in the town.

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You let her be on these discussions for a lifetime, right?

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You still know these?

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I know it's meaningless to tell you this now.

57
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But think about it.

58
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
In this world, except me,

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Which man can love her so much?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You can consider it for the child.

61
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You make a complete marriage for the child.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Divorce is not a hot thing in your head.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Look.

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The wedding result is out.

65
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Do you want the doctor to take a look?

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Thank you.

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I'll just take care of this as a father.

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you, kak.

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I brought Jia Yu to the hospital today.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How much did you just spend?

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'll transfer it to you.

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Not much, no need.

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Don't.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You are not Jia Yu's friend.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
My son's money doesn't need you to give it.

76
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
How much do I transfer to you?

77
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I said no need.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your business should be busy.

79
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I think you're okay.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Don't always run away from our house.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's not appropriate for others to see it.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What nonsense are you talking about, Chen Jian?

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Don't mind him, kak.

84
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Thank you.

85
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Then I'll go first.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Call me if you need anything.

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Okay.

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Hurry back.

89
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
He's pretending to be a good person.

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
He's kind enough to send Jia Yu here.

91
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
What does he have to do with it?

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Mom.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Son.

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You're awake.

95
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Slow down.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
How are you feeling?

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Are you sad?

98
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Why is dad here?

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
He's sick because of you.

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He must be worried about you.

101
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Why isn't he here?

102
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Chen Jian, you're playing with the disappear again?

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How many times have you done it?

104
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Can you do it?

105
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Can you?

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How is Jia Yu?

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Is he feeling better?

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He went to school in a hurry.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Because Jia Yu is soft-hearted,

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
he doesn't want to divorce.

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Sometimes, I really look down on myself.

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I know that Chen Jian can't be changed.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The fake doctors in the hospital are all fake.

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
But I just want Jia Yu to have a complete family.

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Will it be better?

116
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
After all, his real parents are by his side.

117
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
He is healthy and can grow up well.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
My marriage has been ruined.

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I don't want my child to pay for my marriage.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Ya'an.

121
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I know you love Jia Yu.

122
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But I want you to love yourself more.

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Jia Yu is so sensible.

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Seeing you stay with a man like that for him,

125
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
is more painful than being single.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay.

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Let's not talk about my bad things.

128
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Think about Li Jin Yu and you.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You can't just stand there with him.

130
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What else can I do?

131
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I asked him to marry me.

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I tried to coax him.

133
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
But he always does this.

134
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What happened?

135
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He never thought about the future.

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
But I shouldn't blame him.

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't think about it.

138
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
But seeing him being so ugly,

139
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I feel so bad.

140
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
It's normal to feel bad.

141
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
If you don't react at all,

142
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
then you should cry for Li Jin Yu.

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
But I care about him too much.

144
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Although I'm the one who is in the top position,

145
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I have the right to be the leader.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
But I'm totally controlled by his emotions.

147
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
When we fight,

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I will turn the tables like an 18-year-old girl.

149
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I don't care who cares more.

150
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're not like this when you were 18.

151
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You're more shallow than I thought.

152
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ye Meng went to see his former boss?

153
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The one named Gou...

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You know him?

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
He met me at the friend zone.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I asked why you were absent-minded that day.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You even left me there.

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
So you two had a fight?

159
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Ye Meng has a good taste.

160
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You defeated me.

161
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I think it's just a cup of coffee.

162
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Nothing else. Don't worry.

163
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
He wants to go back to Jiangbei with her.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
He said he wanted to investigate his mother.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can't stop him.

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You can't fight with him because of this.

167
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why?

168
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I was a little angry at first.

169
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
But we didn't fight because of this.

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Why?

171
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
He always thinks I don't want to fight with him.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
But how do I prove it?

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
By saying it.

174
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The more I say,

175
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
the more I want to kidnap him.

176
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You think it's for his own good if you don't say it?

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't stand people like you.

178
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I won't say it.

179
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I have no place to say it.

180
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You have a chance to say it.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It depends on whether you can catch him.

182
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
How can I catch him?

183
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Tell me.

184
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Just say it.

185
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I'm afraid you won't dare.

186
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I dare not.

187
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
See if I dare.

188
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Because I also did it wrongly.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This will only change when he's not here.

190
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You!

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,720
Seems

192
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,000
if you dare to say it,

193
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,200
he will come for you hurt.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I won't hide from you.

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Don't come after him.

196
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Okay?

197
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You, follow me.

198
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What is the matter, Mr. Jiang?

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I just want to go out.

200
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Will it affect her family?

201
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,760
It's not guilty.

202
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
How can you be so confident?

203
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,240
You're in a bad mood. Don't be angry with me.

204
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,840
Cheers.

205
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,240
Come on.

206
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,160
Don't drink too much.

207
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,240
You're drunk.

208
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:09,960
Look at you.

209
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,240
You're drunk.

210
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:11,880
Okay, okay, okay.

211
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:12,480
Drink it.

212
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,280
What's wrong?

213
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:16,720
Cheers.

214
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,400
Cheers.

215
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,120
What's that?

216
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,760
You've been sending me

217
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,640
a message all the time.

218
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,480
What do you mean?

219
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,400
You want to break up with me?

220
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,560
You really want to break up with me?

221
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,320
Yes.

222
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,480
If he doesn't send you a message,

223
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,480
can't you send him a message?

224
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,080
I don't want to send him a message.

225
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,520
What's wrong?

226
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,200
I won't send him a message.

227
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,120
Why not?

228
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,960
Women never give in.

229
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,320
You.

230
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,960
You can't care about these things in love.

231
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,760
You know?

232
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,840
The more you care about it,

233
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,040
the more it means you care about it.

234
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
You send him a message.

235
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:49,800
I'll send him a message.

236
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,600
Go ahead.

237
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,120
Look at you.

238
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,080
Hurry up.

239
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,840
Send him a message.

240
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,560
What should I send him?

241
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,360
What should I send him?

242
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
What should I send him?

243
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,520
Send him a message.

244
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,360
Ye Meng is drunk.

245
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,400
Hurry up.

246
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,720
Ye Meng is drunk.

247
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,280
He's worried about you.

248
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,160
Right?

249
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,880
It's dangerous.

250
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:05,720
He's childish.

251
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,160
Hurry up.

252
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,560
Okay, okay, okay.

253
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,360
It's dangerous.

254
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:19,920
Sorry.

255
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,280
Is it so hard to send three words?

256
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,080
I can't read the phone.

257
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,360
You're embarrassed to say that to me.

258
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,200
How about this?

259
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
Let's exchange.

260
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,120
You send him a message.

261
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,960
I'll send him a message.

262
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,480
You help me think of a

263
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,920
content that has a thought

264
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,000
and is not boring.

265
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,520
And it won't be disturbed

266
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,280
by him.

267
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,000
Think about it.

268
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:48,800
What?

269
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:55,800
Ye Meng is drunk.

270
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,760
He has to go home.

271
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm in a hurry to pick up Jiayu.

272
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,400
You go back and watch him.

273
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,160
You...

274
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,040
You're gone.

275
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,000
What should I do?

276
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,080
I care about the key.

277
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,080
I'll pretend to be you.

278
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,520
Why do you take my phone again?

279
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,160
Boss.

280
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
Let me think of one for you.

281
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Actually, I'm good at literature.

282
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,600
Is there a good literature in our store?

283
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,840
Women know women best.

284
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,280
That's it.

285
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,000
Okay, think about it.

286
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,680
No need to thank you, boss.

287
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,080
You'll pay me when you get it.

288
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,680
I have to.

289
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,120
Is Jiayu ready?

290
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,560
Have you done the divorce procedure?

291
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,720
Not yet.

292
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,520
Don't ask.

293
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,720
I...

294
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,600
Why is it in the room?

295
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,240
Is it over?

296
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:20,320
Pete Vice President Wang Miss Zhao

297
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,040
Ye Meng.

298
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,920
Who's the girl you wanna meet up with?

299
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,680
Wen Qing.

300
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,760
Ring the bell then.

301
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,560
Let's go.

302
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:17,800
I'll go.

303
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,440
Pour me a glass of water.

304
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,720
No need.

305
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,720
You didn't want to

306
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,760
stay away from me all day, did you?

307
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,560
Now you pretend to care about me.

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
How much did you drink?

309
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,560
I'm unhappy.

310
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:47,120
Can't I drink some more?

311
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,920
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,920
I was too harsh that day.

313
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,600
Can you drink some more?

314
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,840
No.

315
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,400
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,720
I'm going to Jiangbei tomorrow.

317
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,560
Can we stop fighting?

318
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,760
Have a good rest.

319
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,000
Why don't you go back to your room?

320
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,480
Come on.

321
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,600
Did you go to Ye Meng?

322
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,240
He was drunk.

323
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,600
Did you fight?

324
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,080
No.

325
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,840
Then you know

326
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,280
Ye Meng is going to Jiangbei.

327
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,520
Are you upset?

328
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,880
Look at Nuannuan.

329
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,400
Don't interrupt me.

330
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,480
He's going to Jiangbei.

331
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,560
He's not not coming back.

332
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,200
Don't make a scene in this room.

333
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,800
If you don't want him to leave

334
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,720
and you're afraid he won't come back,

335
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,040
just tell him.

336
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,440
Or you can go with him.

337
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,080
Li Lingbai is in Jiangbei.

338
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,560
I can't go back.

339
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,320
I know your bad things.

340
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,560
But Ye Meng doesn't know.

341
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:43,440
From his perspective,

342
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,840
he thinks it's ridiculous.

343
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,080
He just makes a guess.

344
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,200
Why are you so sensitive?

345
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:50,560
Why do you all think

346
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,040
it's Jiangbei's problem?

347
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,440
It's not.

348
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,680
I'm just angry at myself.

349
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
I used to be a German.

350
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,560
I never thought about the future.

351
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,040
Now,

352
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,960
I feel regret for the first time.

353
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,040
Why didn't I insist on it?

354
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,560
It's to make him graduate from college

355
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,240
and have a decent job

356
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
to give him a stable future.

357
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,160
And

358
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,080
he can't be trapped in New Sea forever.

359
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,360
Regret?

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,960
What can you give to the future?

361
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,760
You men are all talking nonsense.

362
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,040
You think you're right.

363
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,680
If you don't ask him,

364
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,320
how do you know what he thinks?

365
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,600
I don't dare to ask.

366
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm afraid that if I do,

367
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,440
I'll be abandoned like your novel.

368
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,520
You have to believe Meng.

369
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:52,040
She's not that woman.

370
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,440
You're not like the novel.

371
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,760
You can't change your attitude.

372
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:09,600
I know.

374
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:11,560
Oh, my.

375
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,040
I don't need it.

376
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,360
Don't move.

377
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,160
Wake up.

378
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,240
Go to bed early.

379
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,560
Don't stay up late.

380
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,200
Don't worry.

381
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:30,760
Here.

382
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,200
Relax.

383
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,200
You go ahead.

384
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,920
Don't be afraid.

385
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,880
It's not interesting at all.

386
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:57,840
Hello?

387
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,240
I'm sending flowers.

388
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,720
When you get the goods,

389
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,880
just leave them at the door.

390
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,680
I don't want them.

391
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,120
If you can't return them,

392
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,080
just throw them away.

393
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,840
I said I only send cloths.

394
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,560
Did you have a fight?

395
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,160
No. Nothing.

396
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,760
Then why are you so anxious?

397
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,120
Why do you have to leave?

398
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,320
I'm not not coming back.

399
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,600
When will you come back?

400
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,280
Can you promise me?

401
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,680
You're her neighbor.

402
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,760
Don't you waste such good flowers?

403
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:44,880
Do you want it?

404
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:46,400
Let's move it together.

405
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,960
I said I only send cloths.

406
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,440
You promise.

407
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,960
Because I'm not good at planting flowers.

408
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,680
So I have to leave

409
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,800
this yard to you.

410
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:03,840
Good night.

411
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,480
I really understand

412
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,960
Li's feeling now.

413
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,280
I remember

414
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,160
when I sent you to

415
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,080
Jiangbei University,

416
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,880
I thought you would come back

417
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,720
after four years.

418
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,880
But who would think

419
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,960
it's ten years since you left.

420
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,320
Didn't you dislike Li before?

421
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,880
Now you're talking for him.

422
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,040
It's because he's handsome.

423
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,320
The most important thing is you like him.

424
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,520
Otherwise, how can I

425
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,800
look at others with my eyes?

426
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,040
Come on. Eat it.

427
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,480
That's bad.

428
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,480
In case he doesn't like me that much.

429
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,000
Okay, I'm not eating. I'm leaving.

430
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,680
You didn't eat a bite.

431
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,760
You...

432
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,000
Here, eat it.

433
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,000
All right, THAT'S it.

434
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,360
Yi pinned.

435
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,080
Actually, I was

436
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,200
going to tell you

437
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,760
that was not my intention.

438
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,880
I was going to tell you

439
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:26,400
that I didn't like

440
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,480
Later, you showed up.

441
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,240
I was thinking

442
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,760
that it wasn't as bad as I thought.

443
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,640
Until I was at your house today,

444
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,360
I suddenly realized that

445
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,360
I had killed everyone in the whole night.

446
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:50,760
I only took you

447
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,240
into my world

448
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,160
and locked you up.

449
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,440
But your world

450
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
shouldn't be like this.

451
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,760
That night by the sea,

452
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,200
I was afraid that you would come to me.

453
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:10,240
Because I know

454
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,480
that I will definitely fall in love with you.

455
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,720
No accident.

456
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,680
Sorry,

457
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:30,920
I'll wait for you outside.

458
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
All right, our train is coming.

459
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,200
Where?

460
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:40,400
Within two ?

461
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,040
But,

462
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,360
it's just getting LOXOPHAMPфίGade with only 3 massages.

463
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,280
All right,

464
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,520
I'll wait over there by the side road.

465
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
What you should do is to stay away from him.

466
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,720
Because he will only

467
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,640
drag you into the darkness.

468
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,160
Li Junyu.

469
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,600
Happy New Year.

470
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,440
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,920
Happy New Year.

472
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,160
Happy New Year.

473
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,000
Happy New Year.

474
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,600
Happy New Year.

475
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,040
When you stand beside me,

476
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,880
you won't feel the rush to do this.

477
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,000
I'll lit agreeing with you.

478
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
You'd better not bother me.

479
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,440
But I like someone.

480
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,440
It won't change.

481
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
What do you mean?

482
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,440
I know you.

483
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
Li Jinyu

484
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,440
Li Jinyu

485
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Li Jinyu

486
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,440
Why are you back?

487
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
What are you doing here?

488
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,440
I thought you'd be back in half a month.

489
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,440
It was warm and sunny.

490
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
I could see your wish in my dream.

491
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,440
I don't know if you'll like it.

492
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,440
Look.

493
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,440
Is it good?

494
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,440
Li Yuanjing

495
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,440
But I think at least you're not angry at that time.

496
00:29:54,440 --> 00:30:00,440
It should be the look of your home in your dream.

497
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
At least for the sake of the flowers.

498
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,440
Li Jinyu

499
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,440
Will you marry me?

500
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,440
No.

501
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:19,440
Ya'an told me that marriage is a bet.

502
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,440
Do you want to bet with me?

503
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,440
What's your reaction?

504
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,440
Are you just playing with me?

505
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,440
I know I'm not rational and a little messy.

506
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,440
But I...

507
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,440
I'm sorry.

508
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,440
I didn't prepare the ring.

509
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,440
I can only use the flowers for the time being.

510
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,440
But I think the proposal is still for the boys.

511
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,440
I'm not playing with you.

512
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
I really like you.

513
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,440
Ye Mang

514
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,440
What do you think?

515
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
I think you're a little bit weird.

516
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
Can you marry me?

517
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,440
I'm willing to.

518
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
Congratulations.

519
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Thank you.

520
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
I'm going to the bathroom.

521
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,440
Hello.

522
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
Hello. What do you mean?

523
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,440
You want to withdraw?

524
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,440
No.

525
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,440
I'm very nervous.

526
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
What's going on between you two?

527
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,440
It's like a TV drama.

528
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
Yesterday, we were going to split.

529
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
Today, we're going to break up.

530
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,440
It's a big reversal.

531
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,440
No, it's Li Jinyu.

532
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
I'm sorry.

533
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:01,440
I'm sorry.

534
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,440
I'm sorry.

535
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,440
I'm sorry.

536
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,440
I'm sorry.

537
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,440
I'm sorry.

538
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
I'm sorry.

539
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,440
I'm sorry.

540
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,440
I'm sorry.

541
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,440
I'm sorry.

542
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,440
I'm sorry.

543
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,440
It's not Li Jinyu.

544
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,440
I'm trying to help you block the knife.

545
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,440
What's going on?

546
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I don't understand.

547
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,440
Don't say you can't figure it out.

548
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,440
I can't figure it out myself.

549
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I feel half of me is impulsive.

550
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,440
The other half is just feeling it.

551
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,440
Today I saw him at my house.

552
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
When he was making me a wall.

553
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
I just feel like it's that kind of

554
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,440
It's a feeling of repulsion.

555
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,440
It's a feeling of falling.

556
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,440
The previous conflicts and conflicts.

557
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
I don't think it's important anymore.

558
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Okay, okay.

559
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,440
You two are crazy.

560
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
You two are crazy.

561
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,440
Crazy together.

562
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Are you still going to Jiangbei?

563
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,440
I have to go.

564
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,440
Tomorrow morning at six thirty.

565
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
Does he know?

566
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,440
I don't know what to say.

567
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,440
Anyway, I'm going to get a license now.

568
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
What can I do if I'm angry?

569
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Just coax me.

570
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,440
Okay, okay, okay.

571
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,440
At least we can have a new wedding night.

572
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
Then you coax me well tonight.

573
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm so nervous now.

574
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,440
I won't tell you yet.

575
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,440
I'll adjust it again.

576
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,440
Don't be nervous.

577
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440
Bye.

578
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
Bye.

579
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,440
It's our turn.

580
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,440
don't worry

581
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Ge.

582
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,440
What are you doing?

583
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,440
It depends on you.

584
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,440
Quite different.

585
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:53,440
Go to Group Who.

586
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,440
What?

587
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
Don't use a knife.

588
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Don't think I can let it go easily.

589
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Do beautiful.

590
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
I told you.

591
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
You look a little nervous.

592
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
I'm not that nervous.

593
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,440
Let's go.

594
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,440
Come on, please announce the two new members.

595
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
Who is the one who is getting married?

596
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,440
One, two, three.

597
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,440
The one who is getting married is...

598
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,440
is...

599
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,440
The one who is getting married is...

600
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,440
We are willing to be husband and wife.

601
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
From now on, we will face...

602
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,440
We will face all kinds of challenges in life together.

603
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,440
Whether it's a smooth or a difficult situation.

604
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,440
We will all share the same boat.

605
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,440
We will share the same dry and bitter.

606
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
We will be together for life.

607
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,440
Announcement.

608
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,440
Li Xianyu.

609
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Ye Meng.

610
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Congratulations.

611
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,440
Come on, please look here.

612
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,440
Here, drink something hot to warm up.

613
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
What are you laughing at?

614
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm laughing at you.

615
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,440
Look, isn't this a good shot?

616
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,440
When I first met you,

617
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,440
I thought you were a pirate.

618
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,440
There are a lot of female cadets around you.

619
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
Do you want WeChat?

620
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,440
It was you who was the pirate.

621
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
You just got your brother done in a few days.

622
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,440
It's not completely done.

623
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,440
There's one more thing I haven't done.

624
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
What do you think?

625
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,440
How to command a high position in the practical industry?

626
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Cancel it and assistants will get the job well.

627
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
Once they are in here,

628
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,440
we never know where they will work.

629
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,440
They can still go abroad after they DRBS I mean.

630
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,880
Did they come to tell you?

631
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,040
Okay, you know it.

632
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,960
Let's go.

633
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,040
Before they come here,

634
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,160
let's go.

635
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
Or we'll have an IP later.

636
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:48,960
Wait.

637
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,080
After all, it's a big wedding.

638
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,520
It's not appropriate to leave like this.

639
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,560
Wait for me.

640
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,240
I'll talk to them when I get there.

641
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,800
You're so great.

642
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,880
I believe it.

643
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,440
You're so good at acting.

644
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,720
You're so good.

645
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:06,320
Grandma,

646
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,080
we're finally getting married.

647
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,120
Grandma.

648
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,960
Grandma,

649
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll try my best

650
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,160
to take care of Ye Meng.

651
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,320
Don't worry.

652
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,040
I think it's nothing.

653
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,160
The child is good at acting.

654
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,040
It depends on whether Ye Meng likes it or not.

655
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:35,280
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

656
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,800
Bye.

657
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,760
It's so touching.

658
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,320
It's so touching.

659
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,120
We're so happy.

660
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:53,680
We're finally getting married.

661
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,920
Cheers.

662
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,320
How is it?

663
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,880
It's okay.

664
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
It's just that

665
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,920
they're quite different

666
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,960
from what I thought.

667
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,440
Different?

668
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,480
Why?

669
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,840
It's good.

670
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:20,560
Let's go.

671
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,760
Good.

672
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
Let's shake hands.

673
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,080
Let me help you.

674
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,920
Are you happy, Yu?

675
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,040
Yes.

676
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,800
Why haven't you come to play with me recently?

677
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,720
I'm a little busy recently.

678
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:23,280
It'll be fine after some time.

679
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,120
I thought you were the same as me.

680
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,400
You're also worried about my mom and dad.

681
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,760
My mom and dad?

682
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,040
My mom and dad.

683
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,880
They don't plan to divorce again.

684
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:37,880
Jiayu.

685
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:41,200
I know you're a very sensible kid.

686
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:45,880
But I hope you're happy at this stage.

687
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,000
Don't let the adults affect you.

688
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,240
My mom did it for me.

689
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,000
But I don't need them at all.

690
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,880
It's like they pretend nothing happened in front of me.

691
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,280
I have to play with them.

692
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,680
I'm so tired.

693
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,160
But I won't just leave him.

694
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,040
Well...

695
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,280
When you feel tired or not happy,

696
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,720
just call me whenever you're tired.

697
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,560
When you need me,

698
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,240
tell me when you need me.

699
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,800
Don't let them affect your growing-ups!

700
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,120
Just be happy and happy everyday.

701
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,840
All right?

702
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,400
One more round.

703
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,040
Okay.

704
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:23,840
Go.

705
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,840
I hope Yu He will be happy forever.

706
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,240
When are you going to fly tomorrow?

707
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,240
I will be here at 6.30 tomorrow morning.

708
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,240
Don't be mad at me.

709
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,440
Li Ji Yu,

710
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
today is our first day of marriage.

711
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,240
You can't be mad at me, right?

712
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,040
You don't want to be upset?

713
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,440
No.

714
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,840
Hey,

715
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,840
tell me,

716
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,440
are you shy?

717
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,240
We are already husband and wife.

718
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,040
From the beginning to now,

719
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
have you been thinking about that kind of sister?

720
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:45,040
You got it wrong so many times.

721
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,440
You like her first,

722
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,440
then you like her.

723
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,040
Great Hu,

724
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,640
since you became the bridegroom,

725
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,840
can you be my wife and entrust me

726
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,320
to live on

727
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:36,640
because of her?

728
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,040
What,

729
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,640
what are you saying?

730
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I am silent and not saying anything,

731
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,840
I am putting the flowers in the back of my mouth.

732
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Maybe it will make the sadness no longer spread.

733
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,840
I am pretending to be determined,

734
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,840
but I am still in the distance,

735
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,840
obsessed with you.

736
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,840
I am drunk,

737
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,840
but I am still in the distance,

738
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,840
obsessed with you.

739
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,840
I am still in the distance,

740
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,840
obsessed with you.

741
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I am still in the distance,

742
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:49,840
obsessed with you.

743
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:51,840
I am still in the distance,

744
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:55,840
the most perfect lies,

745
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,840
deceive ourselves.

746
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
If we love, let go,

747
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,840
let us lose the connection.

748
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:07,840
Why is this?

749
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,840
The moment I cry,

750
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,840
my heart still yearns.

751
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:23,840
I am still in the distance,

752
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,840
obsessed with you.

753
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,840
I am still in the distance,

754
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:29,840
obsessed with you.

755
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,840
I am still in the distance,

756
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,840
obsessed with you.

757
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,840
I am still in the distance,

758
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:37,840
obsessed with you.
