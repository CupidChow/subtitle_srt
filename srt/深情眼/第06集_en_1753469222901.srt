YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If the world can return to the road of farewell

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Unable to hide the promise

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have everything

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise to be kept

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that every song has my dream

16
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You really rejected him

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
You rejected him

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I beg you two

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Can't you two be together if you like it?

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Don't pull it anymore

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I want to be with him

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But if he is touched, I can't do it

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't know what I'm teaching

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I was active in chasing before

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Now he is active

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm blaming myself

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Love is one thing after another

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I really see you for the first time

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
So confident in love

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I just want to hear his answer

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
You are too sly

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hurry up, Xiao Wang, you cut a knife

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Hurry up, I've sent it to you

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can't reach it

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You hurry up, send more

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll let you know when I'm done

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Come on, I can't reach it

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Chen Xiang is back

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What Chen Xiang?

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Chen Xiang saved your mother

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
He saved you from being fired

42
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
And he saved your mother

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Chen Xiang?

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
He is not the one who is sick

45
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's Li Zhuofeng

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Your grandson

47
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
But he is fine now

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Gu Suyi is very successful

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Don't worry

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't worry about him

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I worry about you

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What are you talking about?

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You are not my grandson

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What do you mean?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You want to escape responsibility

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You don't want to be my grandson

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Why does it sound so bad?

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I tell you

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You must support me

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If you don't support me, I won't be able to get married

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't worry

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will support you

63
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You have white hair

64
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Hurry up, sit down

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Look at your face

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
It's like a white paper

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are alone in Jiangbei

68
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
No one is protecting you

69
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are wronged

70
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You are wronged

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Aunt Ye came to me

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Aunt Ye is so nice

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Such a nice girl

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You should cherish her

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I want to try

76
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Do you think it's ok?

77
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Yes

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I will try it now

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You have white hair

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
No one wants you

81
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Once you lose your beauty

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Hurry up

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
One cut

84
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I am coming

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Hi

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Your water pipe is old

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I didn't fix it last time

88
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So

89
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I have asked someone to fix it when you went to Jiangbei

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Ok

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Well

92
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I am going to fix the yard

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Think about it

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Li Wenting

95
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Ok

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Li Wenting, thank you

97
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I will help you

98
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Thank you

99
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Thank you

100
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Thank you

101
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What?

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Lin Jingyu

103
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Do you know there is a dog shit on that part?

104
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Really?

105
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why didn't you tell me?

106
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Look

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
You didn't see it

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You have dog shit on your nose

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What should we do?

110
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I can wipe it by myself

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Don't be so insensitive

112
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Where is my hand?

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Your hand

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I will wipe it for you

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I lied to you

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I didn't have dog shit at that time

117
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You are so boring

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What's wrong?

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's bees

120
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't be afraid

121
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You fly away

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I am so scared

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I didn't expect you to be so fierce

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You are afraid of bees?

125
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Girls are afraid of bugs

126
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I will give you a hand

127
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Again

128
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What's wrong?

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I am not kidding you

130
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I didn't lie to you

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You are so good at it

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You are so bad at it

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You are so bad at it

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Stop it

135
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will

136
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Stop it

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Stop it

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Stop it

139
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's wrong?

140
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Miss Tian

141
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Miss Tian

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Pack your bags

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I am here

144
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I am here

145
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Jiang Mei is here, right?

146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Help me

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Help me

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Li Jin, you are not a fighter

150
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are defeated

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Sir, can you help me?

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We can do it together

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I can't help you

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You can help me

155
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Ok

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Which one is ours?

157
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
These are ours

158
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Can you move it?

159
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Yes

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Please

161
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Can you move it?

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hurry up

163
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I have a bill

164
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Ok

165
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Give it to me

166
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Thank you

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Help me

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I need to wash my hands

169
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's getting cold

170
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,160
Where's the screw?

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120
rosary

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
One is a gift

173
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:56,760
Ð¾ Solitary

174
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,760
I think my ex-boss sent it to me when he asked me to pack it.

175
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,360
Your ex-boss sent you a camera?

176
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,760
What do you mean?

177
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,760
It's a photo of our team building.

178
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,240
Only you two are in the team building?

179
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,160
You're so good at reading.

180
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,160
Look, there are so many...

181
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
Look, there are so many...

182
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Then, we'll stick close to each other.

183
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes, yes, wait a minute.

184
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Look, there are so many people here.

185
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How can there be only two of us in the team building?

186
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It seems that your ex-boss wants to have a dream with you.

187
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Let him have a dream.

188
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Li Junyi, if you're jealous,

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
will you wait until you become my boyfriend?

190
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm jealous.

191
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,600
I'm not jealous.

192
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,600
I'm not jealous.

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,600
You're not jealous.

194
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
I'm not jealous.

195
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,600
I'm not jealous.

196
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,600
What do you mean?

197
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,600
You can't say it.

198
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
You can't say it.

199
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Then, I'll go.

200
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,600
I'll go.

201
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,600
Let's go.

202
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,080
You can do whatever you want

203
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,040
We need to build it together

204
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,440
Can you be more considerate?

205
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,600
I'm not your boyfriend

206
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,040
What's there to build?

207
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,600
You care about me

208
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,560
Why don't you say something

209
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,680
about my boyfriend?

210
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,720
This is a sunflower seed

211
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
It's pretty

212
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,360
Boss

213
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,160
A sunflower seed

214
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,280
and this

215
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:47,920
This

216
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,000
30 yuan in total

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You can pay me first

218
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,800
Thank you

219
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,360
Here

220
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,520
Wait a minute

221
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,480
I've paid

222
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,320
Which one?

223
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:58,920
This

224
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,200
I'm a five-star guest

225
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,280
I may not live for long

226
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,240
I need to trouble Li Yuanding

227
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,200
to take care of me and help me

228
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,240
Do you want to raise the salary?

229
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
Yes

230
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,480
If you want to maintain

231
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,000
the money relationship

232
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,160
I'll say it again

233
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,880
I've packed the seeds, flowers, fertilizer and fertilizer

234
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,240
If you do well

235
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,520
can you serve the meal?

236
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,800
Here, take it

237
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,520
I'm afraid I can't serve the meal

238
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,880
But the roadside stall is fine

239
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:31,440
What's this?

240
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
It's cute

241
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,480
Let's go

242
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,320
Okay

243
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,720
Ten yuan

244
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,880
Thank you

245
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,960
Li Junyu

246
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,760
Take this home

247
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,360
I have something to do

248
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:49,960
What's wrong?

249
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,160
I'm meeting a friend

250
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,440
Amazing

251
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,560
The one I love

252
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,040
What's the matter?

253
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,360
I want to sleep

254
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,560
Right

255
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,400
Come

256
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,120
Good night

257
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,320
Pretty

258
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,200
Li Junyu

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,040
Ready!

260
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,120
I'm sorry

261
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,400
I was in a hurry.

262
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,440
You must be tired.

263
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
Can you plant the rest tomorrow?

264
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,640
I can plant the seeds tomorrow,

265
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,520
but I have to plant the seedlings today.

266
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,080
What happened just now?

267
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,040
Nothing.

268
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,600
I'm tired today.

269
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,360
Can you plant them tomorrow?

270
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,920
Okay.

271
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,800
I'll go back first.

272
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,840
Okay.

273
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,840
I was nervous when I was in the finals.

274
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,240
Finals?

275
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,320
You're so confident?

276
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,360
Not bad.

277
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,840
Just like you said,

278
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,160
it's just a game.

279
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,200
Relax.

280
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,880
The cake is sweet,

281
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,120
and the birthday is beautiful.

282
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,040
I just hope it can be bigger.

283
00:15:45,120 --> 00:16:12,280
shi shi

284
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,120
I'm going to meet a familiar person.

285
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:15,840
Come in.

286
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,660
You can hand me the pens.

287
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,200
I also need the money.

288
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,220
Thank you.

289
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,300
It may be very convenient for you.

290
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:22,920
Of course.

291
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,960
Sure.

292
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,640
See you.

293
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,580
Thank you.

294
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,020
Take care.

295
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,440
Sure.

296
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Something's gonna happen.

297
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,320
As long as the room is real,

298
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,880
who can tell

299
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,520
whether Ming Download or Ming Country is modern?

300
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,520
What do you think?

301
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,040
Okay, that's just it.

302
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,680
I have something on.

303
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,000
Come on

304
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,360
Come on

305
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,800
Come on

306
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,760
Brother

307
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,760
I was reading the question outside

308
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,400
I thought I was wrong

309
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,000
You called her?

310
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,520
What are you talking about?

311
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,840
I introduced you a client before

312
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,680
You forgot it

313
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,240
What?

314
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,920
You look familiar

315
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,560
Mengmeng

316
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,040
Mengmeng

317
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,880
It's so hot in this room

318
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,600
You do look familiar

319
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,360
You look familiar

320
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,200
Let me give you a drink

321
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
It's been a long time

322
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,600
I wish you a successful business

323
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,760
Thank you

324
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
When did you come back?

325
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
What's the business in Jiangbei?

326
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Not bad

327
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
Come on, cheers

328
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,120
Brother

329
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,600
This ring looks so good

330
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,880
Why don't you want to take me with you?

331
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,960
What?

332
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Mengmeng, right?

333
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,320
You have a good taste

334
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,000
This

335
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,320
You took it with you

336
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,080
entÃ£o

337
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,040
That car is a TF vÃ¥ra

338
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I asked the police

339
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,560
I know

340
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,920
Come on, I'll drink it

341
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,400
Brother, I need some money

342
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,600
Okay, no problem

343
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:51,840
Come on, ===

344
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Brother, come on, porridge

345
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,040
Have something to drink

346
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,200
Come on, finish it

347
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,040
Please

348
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,640
Finish it

349
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,440
Drink it up. Don't be shy.

350
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
That's right.

351
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,720
That's right.

352
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,320
What are you doing?

353
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,840
Didn't you tell me to go to work?

354
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,320
Is this what you call going to work?

355
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,000
Go home.

356
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Get out of here.

357
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,560
What are you doing?

358
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,800
Go home. I'll tell you later.

359
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,160
How did you promise me when we got married?

360
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,280
You said you'd be honest with me every day.

361
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,560
Is this what you promised me?

362
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
I'm not going to tell you.

363
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,040
Honey, what are you thinking about?

364
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,440
That's my brother.

365
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,240
Go home first. I'll tell you later.

366
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,440
What brother?

367
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,040
Go.

368
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,480
Stop.

369
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,680
At first,

370
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,680
I thought it was a man dancing.

371
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,480
Now he's acting like a poor man.

372
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,000
He's pretty good.

373
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,560
You misunderstood.

374
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,560
I went out to explain to him.

375
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,200
I'll explain it to him right away.

376
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:01,800
Stop.

377
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,000
This is the first time I've ever been fooled by Ning Zeyi.

378
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
You can leave without saying it clearly.

379
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,880
I'm coming.

380
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,840
What are you doing?

381
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,440
Go.

382
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,560
This way.

383
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
It's them.

384
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Stop.

385
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,200
Don't move.

386
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Over there.

387
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,080
Stop.

388
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,080
Don't move.

389
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,080
Hurry up.

390
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,080
Stop.

391
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
Don't run.

392
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Are you leaving?

393
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,200
Why are you here?

394
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,360
I saw you dressed like this at night.

395
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,920
Who knows who you're going to see?

396
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,680
I went with company leader's lead.

397
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,840
When I saw you wearing an umbrella,

398
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,480
People said you're really a pervert.

399
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,280
Give it back, I tell you.

400
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,640
How many times have I told you not to do this?

401
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,120
I really don't want to do this.

402
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Don't eat.

403
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
Does your brother save you or not?

404
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,000
Why was he so honest?

405
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,760
Then why did he cover you and searching?

406
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,680
This is a kind of Movement Education ë³´ì¬ì£¼ï¿½ million coach.

407
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
is my mom's

408
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,680
Let's go back first

409
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,440
Stop!

410
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,240
Stop!

411
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:12,640
Stop!

412
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,480
You run so fast

413
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:26,640
Run!

414
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,760
Run!

415
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,920
Brother Wu, you really misunderstood

416
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,840
Let me explain to you

417
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,080
Enough!

418
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,480
Let's talk about it later

419
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,360
My ears hurt

420
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,760
Don't come over

421
00:23:58,760 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll chase you

422
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,160
Stop!

423
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,000
I'll kill you

424
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,080
Stop!

425
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,600
Stop!

426
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,920
I think who wants to do it?

427
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,880
Why is he here?

428
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,800
I think

429
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,960
Don't you know this is a place?

430
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:17,880
You're hurt

431
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm fine

432
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,400
I'm fine

433
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm fine

434
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,720
I'm fine

435
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,360
I'm fine

436
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,960
I'm fine

437
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:23,640
I'm fine

438
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,400
I'm fine

439
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,080
I'm fine

440
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,720
I'm fine

441
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,400
I'm fine

442
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm fine

443
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,800
I'm fine

444
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,560
Where did you get it?

445
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,320
Don't worry about me

446
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,360
In Ningcui

447
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,080
It's illegal to break the law

448
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,480
Bye bye

449
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,000
Bye bye

450
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,880
Bye bye

451
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,160
It's them, the police

452
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,400
Come with me

453
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,480
Go go go

454
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,120
How come you

455
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,000
Hi

456
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,840
Sure

457
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
Mr. Those are the old people

458
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,480
They're leaving

459
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,240
Can you ask them

460
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:17,640
Can you wait

461
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,200
Can you wait

462
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,300
Take my leave

463
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,000
They only know

464
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,600
They know

465
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,740
Master Zhen wants to see you

466
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,000
They're all your friends

467
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,440
college friends

468
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,080
And then

469
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,960
You're sensible.

470
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,320
You know how to call the police

471
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,160
and ask for help.

472
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,760
Actually, I have to thank you

473
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,800
for what happened tonight.

474
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,880
That fat man

475
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,280
is indeed suspicious.

476
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,480
As for the ring

477
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,800
your mother left behind,

478
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,000
it was bought through

479
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,360
a normal transaction channel.

480
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,320
As for the seller,

481
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,280
he doesn't know it very well.

482
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,240
He only remembers that person's surname, Wang.

483
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,760
I don't know what you're investigating.

484
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,280
But if you have any questions,

485
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,240
remember to ask the police.

486
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,400
Civilization and society are respected.

487
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,120
Did you hear that?

488
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,280
Yes.

489
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,080
Thank you, officer Shen.

490
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:58,880
All right.

491
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,560
Go back.

492
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,720
Thank you.

493
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,640
You're welcome, officer Shen.

494
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,440
Let me see.

495
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,080
Go to the hospital.

496
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,160
You have to deal with this.

497
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:07,880
No need.

498
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,960
I just broke the bottle.

499
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,600
The police just said

500
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,240
that the ring was bought through a normal transaction channel.

501
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,800
If you want to find someone,

502
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
you'll have to trouble yourself.

503
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,440
I'll find someone.

504
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,960
Let me find someone.

505
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,120
I know a lot of people.

506
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,520
No need.

507
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,120
I'll deal with it myself.

508
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,520
Thank you for today.

509
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,080
It's my duty.

510
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,360
I think it's time.

511
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,240
Let's go have lunch.

512
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,400
Let's have a midnight snack.

513
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,200
Let's go.

514
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,000
You have to deal with this.

515
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,720
I'm fine.

516
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,360
Here.

517
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:40,280
I bought a band-aid.

518
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,120
I'm fine.

519
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:41,720
No need.

520
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,480
No.

521
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,280
You have to put it on.

522
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,120
I'm fine.

523
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:05,760
No need.

524
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,400
No.

525
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,360
You have to put it on.

526
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't move.

527
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:16,880
Does it hurt?

528
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:17,600
Here.

529
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,240
No.

530
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,240
Here.

531
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,800
It's fine.

532
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,920
Put it on Yan Meng.

533
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,560
Okay.

534
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:29,760
Try this tofu.

535
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,360
It's grown.

536
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,680
Try it.

537
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,320
This is your favorite

538
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,000
iron plate tofu.

539
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,480
It tastes the same.

540
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
It's delicious.

541
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,000
But it's a memory of my childhood.

542
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,800
Do you feel touched?

543
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:43,840
Yes.

544
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,200
If I didn't arrive on time today,

545
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,400
it would be your turn to eat your tofu.

546
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,640
If I didn't arrive on time,

547
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,160
you two wouldn't even have the tofu.

548
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,200
If you don't like tofu,

549
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,600
you can try this fermented wine.

550
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,720
It's very sweet and delicious.

551
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,840
But if you don't like sweet,

552
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,800
you can give it to Kai Kai.

553
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,760
Kai Kai likes sweet.

554
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,520
Why should he not like it?

555
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,320
Give it to me.

556
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,360
I'm not a trash can.

557
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,480
I'll eat it.

558
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,360
Just give it to me.

559
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,120
I ordered

560
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,360
your favorite food

561
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,520
when you were in school.

562
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,120
Kai Kai.

563
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,400
Thank you for today.

564
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,400
But I hope you

565
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,200
won't get involved in this.

566
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,480
I won't.

567
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:28,760
He can do it.

568
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,800
You're different.

569
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,080
How are we different?

570
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,800
We've known each other for almost ten years.

571
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,320
How long have you known each other?

572
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,120
Here.

573
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:37,800
Here.

574
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,320
These are all our memories.

575
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,320
Look carefully.

576
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,600
No one is allowed to bully Kai Kai in the future.

577
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:44,520
This is not important.

578
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,320
Ye Meng wrote it.

579
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,440
Chen Kai Ran, be quiet.

580
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,360
Don't shout.

581
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,680
Can't you calm down?

582
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,000
How can I calm down?

583
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,320
You'll be a burden to him.

584
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,200
You're so close to him.

585
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I'll give you chopsticks.

586
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,000
You'll give him all.

587
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Do you know

588
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,400
what we've been through?

589
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
I was bullied by someone.

590
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,000
I was bullied by someone.

591
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,240
I was beaten like a dog.

592
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,080
He rushed over.

593
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,320
He protected me with his life.

594
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,320
Do you know that?

595
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,160
When did it happen?

596
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,280
Why can't I remember?

597
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,560
Why is my photo album with you?

598
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,600
The first day after your senior year

599
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,800
of the National Day.

600
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,040
I was blocked in the back alley of the school.

601
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,600
You rushed over to protect me.

602
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,760
If you hadn't saved me that day,

603
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,960
I would have been beaten to death.

604
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,480
After that,

605
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,800
you started to hate me and hate me.

606
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I can understand.

607
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,480
I look for you every day

608
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,960
just to see you more.

609
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,960
Why can't I remember this?

610
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,040
Your senior year.

611
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,040
October 8th that year.

612
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,160
I was in the first place.

613
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,360
October 8th?

614
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:07,760
That's not me.

615
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,880
That's Fang Ya'an.

616
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,680
Ye Meng.

617
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,840
Even if you want to break up with me,

618
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,720
don't make fun of this time.

619
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:24,840
That's not me.

620
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,240
I remember that day.

621
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,440
I forgot to bring it.

622
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,600
Call me Director Luo.

623
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,440
Where's your school card?

624
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,120
Oh no, I didn't bring my school card.

625
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,680
It was bought by him.

626
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,360
How about this?

627
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,440
I'll go in first.

628
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,560
Then you wait for me at the back wall of the school.

629
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,760
I'll give you my school card.

630
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:44,920
Which class?

631
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,680
Go ahead.

632
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,000
What's your name?

633
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,720
Hurry up.

634
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
It's time to ring the bell.

635
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,560
I'm sorry.

636
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,320
I'm sorry.

637
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,000
I'm sorry.

638
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:54,800
I'm sorry.

639
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm sorry.

640
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,920
I'm so sorry.

641
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,640
I'm so sorry.

642
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,440
I'm sorry.

643
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,600
Let's go.

644
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,240
Let's go.

645
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,760
Let's go.

646
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,920
Are you running?

647
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,120
I'm not running.

648
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,560
Let's run for a while.

649
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,800
I'm not running.

650
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,880
Fight, I'm not running.

651
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,080
Not running.

652
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,600
Go, fight.

653
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,440
Will you stop running?

654
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,840
I won't.

655
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,040
Run!

656
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:26,600
What are you doing?

657
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,240
Stop!

658
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,720
Stop!

659
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,720
Stop!

660
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Yanlong

661
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,160
You want to be the leader, right?

662
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,400
Yes

663
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,240
My son is on the scene

664
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,280
Our school will enhance the education

665
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,880
You can tell me

666
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,560
Who let him?

667
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,560
Don't worry

668
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,520
You are not

669
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,320
No

670
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,160
You hit him

671
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,360
No, no

672
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,640
The school can't hit him

673
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,080
My son is in the hospital

674
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,720
Don't worry

675
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,880
The one who was hit is my son

676
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,680
We have a meeting at school

677
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,680
I will give my son an explanation

678
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,760
I tell you

679
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,320
You must tell me today

680
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:13,960
OK, OK

681
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,800
Or I will beat you

682
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,520
I tell you

683
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,200
When Xiao Huihui was injured and went to the hospital

684
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:17,720
She was still young

685
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,680
Her mother ran to the school

686
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,040
and made a scene

687
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,400
It was a big deal

688
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,760
Yan An had to quit school

689
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,160
At that time

690
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,200
Yan An left Ningcui

691
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
to work in other places

692
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,880
You have been around me all these years

693
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,720
Because

694
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,560
You think I saved you, right?

695
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,960
This is for you

696
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,360
Time's up

697
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,280
You can run quite often

698

You guys should just get some rest

719
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,080
I'm here and need a bit rest

720
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:29,960
Mou support

721
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,120
It seems like most people don't either

722
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,320
For me

723
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,240
Thousands of sweet love starts a day

724
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,160
No one is paying attention

725
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,040
Yes

726
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,240
It is just a short while

727
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,380
You can't tell.

728
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,060
Go aside!

729
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,660
Don't move.

730
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,440
That little kid was injured and was admitted to the hospital.

731
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,840
His mother went to the school and caused a scene.

732
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,640
It was a big deal. Yan An had to drop out of school.

733
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,240
Mom, the tissue is gone.

734
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,240
It's gone.

735
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
Come here.

736
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,040
My face is really okay. Please go home.

737
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,840
I can't. Look, I have to disinfect.

738
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,040
Or else, your skin would be ruined.

739
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,840
How can you say that so quickly?

740
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,440
I'm begging you.

741
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,440
Wait a minute.

742
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
Sit down first.

743
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,240
It's quite detailed. There's also a medicine box

744
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,240
Are you still thinking about

745
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,480
the case of Fang An and Zheng An Ran?

746
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:09,520
Yes

747
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,680
I'm thinking about how great it would be if we could go back to the past

748
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,920
There wouldn't be that Wu Long, Ya'an and Kai Kai

749
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
would be different from now on

750
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,440
What's wrong?

751
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
I miss my mom

752
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,840
Here

753
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,560
Give me your hand

754
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,880
Here

755
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,720
Do you know?

756
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,600
I have a memory book

757
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,000
My mom gave it to me

758
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,200
I can only keep it

759
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,480
The money stored inside

760
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,160
is different for each amount

761
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,920
But each amount has its own back

762
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
When I'm not happy with my mom

763
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,600
I buy a cake

764
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,920
When I go to college with my mom

765
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,480
I buy a pair of high heels

766
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,440
for my boyfriend's date

767
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,080
When I work

768
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,640
I buy a baby

769
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,920
Your mom loves you so much

770
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,000
How could it be?

771
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,080
Yes

772
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,000
So I'm also very strange

773
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,240
I have a memory book

774
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:19,520
I have a memory book

775
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
I bought a house in Jiangning a while ago

776
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,160
My grandma and her friends wanted to help me with the payment

777
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,200
so they told me that the paper was lost

778
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,800
But my mom loved that paper

779
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,640
when she was alive

780
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,480
It's not lost at all

781
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,720
The one you brought for the boss today?

782
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,520
Two days before my mom committed suicide

783
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,600
I saw a man looking for her

784
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,640
I thought the man was in the car

785
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,560
But it wasn't

786
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,440
But

787
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,880
at least we have new clues today

788
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,920
We can dig down the paper

789
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,840
We will find something

790
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,200
If you have such a situation next time

791
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,960
remember to call me

792
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,440
You look down on me

793
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,960
If you don't come today

794
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,080
I can handle it

795
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,000
It seems I'm not a good person

796
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,120
I'm lying

797
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,440
I'm afraid of death

798
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,400
Li Jinyu

799
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,680
You're not a bad person

800
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,880
It's good to have you

801
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,320
I take this for you

802
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:11,840
Thank you

803
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:34,720
Does it hurt?

804
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:36,720
No

805
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,520
Are you jealous today?

806
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,480
No

807
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,800
No?

808
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,000
Really?

809
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,960
I thought you went to see the boss

810
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,440
Don't underestimate yourself

811
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,160
and me

812
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,920
You told me

813
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:25,920
I'm the best sister

814
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,440
you've ever seen

815
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,440
Okay

816
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,960
I see

817
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,440
What?

818
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,080
I won't tell you

819
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,000
You're so sentimental

820
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,120
You're good at it

821
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,960
But I was so serious before

822
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,360
Okay

823
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,120
I'm going to bed

824
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,720
You should go to bed early

825
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,520
Let's go

826
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,240
You're going to bed so early?

827
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,040
Nonsense

828
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,160
Go

829
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,800
You're like I'm dragging you

830
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,600
Just go

831
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:12,720
Good night

832
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,320
Good night

833
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,240
Come and lean on me

834
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,080
For a few years

835
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,940
barely

836
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,840
I would have realized that

837
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,280
myself

838
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,960
Have to be someone else

839
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,560
Buzzing

840
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:10,060
Light

841
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,060
I'm so worried

842
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:18,060
The love that's been reflected in my heart

843
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,060
Encloses my thoughts

844
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,060
Where should I go?

845
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:31,060
How should I avoid

846
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:37,060
Those memories about you?

847
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:39,060
I'm so mad at myself

848
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:48,060
But I can't stop being obsessed

849
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:51,060
I'm silent

850
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,060
I put the flowers in the back garden

851
00:43:54,060 --> 00:44:01,060
Maybe it will make the sadness stop spreading

852
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,060
I pretend to be determined

853
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:13,060
But I can't stop being obsessed

854
00:44:13,060 --> 00:44:16,060
The most perfect lie

855
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Deceives me

856
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:25,060
If we let go, we will lose our relationship

857
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,060
Why is it that

858
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:31,060
The moment I cry
