1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I still remember the love

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Your eyes shined when you were young

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You said you loved me so much

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But I'm walking and forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is empty at the edge

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if it hasn't changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If there is still a promise

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
That will be kept

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that you have my dream

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I used to like to be younger than myself

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
After the New Year's Eve party, I went back to the reality

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Hello, I'll serve you a dish

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
What did you say?

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why am I here today?

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Jia Yu has a practice question

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You have to answer it for me

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Who told you to say this?

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
They say that young boys are not good

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You have nothing to say

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Eat

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I think girls are indeed

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
More familiar than boys of the same age

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Boys of the same age are too playful

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's not suitable for long-term development

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
He said we are low-skilled

37
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Especially like Miss Ye

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You are an independent woman

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I think you should consider that

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
For example, you are one year older than you

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You have a very stable mood

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You can support your mature heart

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I tell you, brother

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
We are young and energetic

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now all sisters like to find young brothers

46
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who can like a dead fish eye every day?

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't say you

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I mean, he is old

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
He doesn't mean his emotions are stable

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Especially the kind of glasses

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Speaking of which, I have blood pressure

52
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I understand what Dr. Gao means

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It should be said

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Compared to younger men

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Older men may have more ability to solve problems

57
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, this is a personality problem

58
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
What does this have to do with age?

59
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Young people are sincere and passionate

60
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Older people are greasy

61
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
All are new eyes

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What else can there be?

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Older people are not greasy

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Young people are mature and sensible

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Young people have less experience

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You don't know how to take care of people

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You have to admit that

68
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What's wrong with this?

70
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There are many experienced people

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Is this worth showing off?

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
No

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I mean, I can't take care of people

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We are young

75
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
We can take care of people

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm talking about you

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
We are talking about him

78
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's okay

79
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's okay

80
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Eat something

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are old and fast

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Finished talking

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Discuss

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I think it's meaningless for you to discuss

85
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Miss Ye should be worth a

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
School background

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Good quality and education

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
To see people in the future together

89
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Talk about me

90
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You have a high education

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Look down on us three

92
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Graduated from high school, right?

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
No

94
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Education does not mean culture

95
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Soil does not mean character

96
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
There is a family education does not mean there is a future

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
There is a future does not mean it is appropriate

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Stop it

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Stop it, okay?

100
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Sorry

101
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
My friend may be sensitive recently

102
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's on his wound

103
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
So

104
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What do you mean by it's on my wound?

105
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm not sensitive at all

106
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Okay, okay, okay

107
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You two are almost done

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Don't bully teachers here

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Our young brother

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Listen to your sister

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Learn something

112
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sit down

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
it is good

114
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Sorry, Dr. Gao

115
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's okay

116
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Eat a little

117
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
A stomach of anger

118
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You eat you eat, thank you

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going over

120
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thank you boss

121
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Take care

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ya'an

123
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ya'an

124
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Why is she here?

125
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Isn't this the blind date at that wedding?

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hello

127
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
They have a gathering

128
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
What are you going to do with her?

129
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come with me

130
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Who goes with you

131
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Are you busy?

132
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I have nothing else

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I want to buy a trade fund for our child

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,280
My colleagues are talking about this.

135
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:06,080
I want to buy one for my son.

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,600
You came here to buy fund for your son?

137
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,440
Or you want to change your new car?

138
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:13,360
It's business.

139
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,920
It's normal to change a car.

140
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,040
Ye Meng.

141
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,040
You're close to him.

142
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,080
I can persuade you.

143
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,320
What did I say last time?

144
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,640
Is it a good idea?

145
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,600
It's good to find a stable place.

146
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,440
No.

147
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,480
I just hope I can be a backup for Miss Ye.

148
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,680
To be a backup for Miss Ye.

149
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,720
To prove my overall quality in the highland.

150
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
Dr. Gao is too modest.

151
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,600
Your condition is a big deal in our Mingcui.

152
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,080
Anything else?

153
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,440
If you want to be a good father,

154
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,200
you should reflect on yourself.

155
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,640
Don't disappear every time Jiayu comes to you.

156
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,680
No.

157
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,320
How can you say that about me?

158
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,280
You left your son alone at home.

159
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,200
You came out to have fun.

160
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,120
You said I...

161
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,920
Who left his son alone at home?

162
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,360
Which eye saw me having fun here?

163
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,760
I can't eat out.

164
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,360
You're the only one who eats and plays here every day, right?

165
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,880
Why do you say that about me?

166
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,840
There are so many people here.

167
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,680
We eat and drink here.

168
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,520
You call me a hater.

169
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,200
I call you a hater.

170
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
I'm alone.

171
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,720
Don't stand here.

172
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,320
You...

173
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,080
I...

174
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,440
You can stand here.

175
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,880
You're so annoying.

176
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,000
We're friends.

177
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,800
Don't be so mean.

178
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,200
Chen Jian.

179
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,280
If you want to see the kid,

180
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,920
you can go to Jiayu's grandma's house.

181
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,200
What are you talking about?

182
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,520
You're mixed with these hooligans.

183
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,920
You'll ruin your son sooner or later.

184
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,360
No.

185
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,480
Who took my car?

186
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
What car?

187
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,520
Who took my car?

188
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,560
Who?

189
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,280
How about we go somewhere else?

190
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,880
Go to my place.

191
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,080
Okay.

192
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,040
Let's go.

193
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:44,840
Let's go.

194
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,840
Let's go.

195
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,320
The car wash fee.

196
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,880
I almost took some money.

197
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,840
The Audi has four wheels.

198
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,240
Why do you have four rotten eggs?

199
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:56,960
It's customized.

200
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,760
Wash the eggs.

201
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,800
Or you can't wipe them off.

202
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,720
Kai, your shop is good.

203
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,360
It's okay.

204
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,400
Mai.

205
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:16,880
Mai.

206
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,640
Say hello to her.

207
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,480
Mr. Gao.

208
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:22,280
Order whatever you want to drink today.

209
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
It's all my brother's.

210
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:24,840
Okay.

211
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
I'll call you later.

212
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,760
Okay, brother.

213
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,240
Sister Ya'nan. Sister Ye Meng.

214
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,200
Long time no see.

215
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:30,840
Sister Ya'nan.

216
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,040
Sit down. I'll get the drinks.

217
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:32,520
Okay.

218
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'll go to the bathroom.

219
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:34,960
Mai.

220
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,800
What are you busy with?

221
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you want to be a nurse?

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,480
Sure.

223
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,360
What nurse?

224
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,600
I'll send you a WeChat message.

225
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,200
Okay.

226
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:41,880
Thank you.

227
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,320
Here.

228
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,120
I'll transfer the money for the car wash.

229
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,840
No need.

230
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,480
Not much.

231
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,360
No.

232
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,480
You like A&A, right?

233
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:00,840
Yes.

234
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,040
Where did they go?

235
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,240
Gao Yisheng is here.

236
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,600
He's with Sister Ya Meng.

237
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,160
You like A&A, right?

238
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,080
I really want to know

239
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,960
about this.

240
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,680
If you don't take that step,

241
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,400
you'll be a slave to others.

242
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,880
Gao Yisheng.

243
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,280
Do you usually work out?

244
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
As long as there's no surgery,

245
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,200
I'll do it in ten years.

246
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,640
What about you, Miss Ye?

247
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,840
Do you work out?

248
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,680
I don't usually work out.

249
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,840
But I sometimes go for a run.

250
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,280
Good evening.

251
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,280
Thank you for coming.

252
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm going to sing a special song today.

253
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,200
This song is for someone

254
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,320
who is very important to me.

255
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
He was drunk that day.

256
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,400
He said a lot of drunk words.

257
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:24,960
Li Junyu.

258
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,240
Li Junyu.

259
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,280
If someone tells you

260
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,640
that you're not qualified,

261
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,880
ask him to come to me.

262
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,760
In the future,

263
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,120
please allow me to fight for you.

264
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,920
I wonder if that person

265
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,160
still remembers that.

266
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,040
Yes.

267
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
I'm sorry.

268
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,040
I'm sorry.

269
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
I'm sorry.

270
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm sorry.

271
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,040

00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I'm sorry.

275
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,040
I'm sorry.

276
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
I'm sorry.

277
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm sorry.

278
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
I'm sorry.

279
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040

284
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm sorry.

285
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,040
I'm sorry.

286
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I'm sorry.

287
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm sorry.

288
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
I'm sorry.

289
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
I'm sorry.

290
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
I'm sorry.

291
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,040
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

298
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,040

I'm sorry.

356
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,040
I'm sorry.

357
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,860
They 드�伶 agua

358
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,340
Aren't they malt petit?

359
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
It's small

360
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
I'm a little tired.

361
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
I'll go back first.

362
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Thank you.

363
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,040
Another bowl of?

364
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,040
Soy milk.

365
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,040
Okay.

366
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,040
Boss, I'm going to go now.

367
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,040
Okay, okay.

368
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,040
Take care.

369
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,040
Okay.

370
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
I'm not going to climb the mountain.

371
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,040
I'm too tired.

372
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Miss, yours.

373
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,040
Enjoy your meal.

374
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
Thank you.

375
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,040
The beach is okay.

376
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,040
Let's go to see the sunset.

377
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,040
What are you doing?

378
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,040
I'm changing the water for your goldfish.

379
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,040
Who told you to touch it?

380
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,040
You're not going to drink it?

381
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,040
You're so stupid.

382
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,040
Who told you to touch her?

383
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,200
I'm just letting them shine more.

384
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,840
So they won't get the dark spots.

385
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,280
How do you know she has dark spots?

386
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,800
Sister Nie Meng told me.

387
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,200
That day,

388
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,280
when she came to the bar,

389
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,480
she asked me if I wanted to work part-time.

390
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,160
I thought it was some kind of job.

391
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,480
But she gave me money

392
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,880
to help your goldfish

393
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,600
change water and shine more.

394
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,760
She also said that

395
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,280
the dark spots of goldfish are

396
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,520
usually water quality problems.

397
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,160
And there's lack of sunlight.

398
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,920
Don't say that.

399
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,680
You only have a little bit of sun.

400
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,880
You're much more lively than before.

401
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,920
I have to

402
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
give Sister Nie Meng a hug.

403
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,560
Where did Sister Nie Meng go?

404
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,520
Look at the big circle of friends.

405
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,280
It's so beautiful.

406
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,800
The beach is fine.

407
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's go watch the sunset.

408
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:51,880
How is it?

409
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,880
It has to be me.

410
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm a genius.

411
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
The sun is shining.

412
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,040
The moon is shining.

413
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
The moon is shining.

414
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,040
The sun is shining.

415
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
The moon is shining.

416
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,040
The moon is shining.

417
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,040
The moon is shining.

418
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,040
The moon is shining.

419
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
The moon is shining.

420
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,040
The moon is shining.

421
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,040
The moon is shining.

422
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,040
The moon is shining.

423
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,040
The moon is shining.

424
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,040
The moon is shining.

425
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,040
The moon is shining.

426
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
The moon is shining.

427
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
The moon is shining.

428
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,040
The moon is shining.

429
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,040
The moon is shining.

430
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,040
The moon is shining.

431
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,040
The moon is shining.

432
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,040
The moon is shining.

433
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,040
The moon is shining.

434
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,040
The moon is shining.

435
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,040
The moon is shining.

436
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,040
The moon is shining.

437
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,040
The moon is shining.

438
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,040
The moon is shining.

439
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,040
The moon is shining.

440
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:50,640
What difficulties have big problems now?

441
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,840
The old necessarily wants to find out the child's Florence Fragrance.

442
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:07,000
The beginning of my Muslims

443
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,060
I used to like to be a little bit smaller

444
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,140
After taking austein

445
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,340
Will return to reality

446
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:26,560
They beat me up, I can't open up my heart to them and go onMUSIC

447
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:35,060
that no matter how many times I get hurt

448
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:45,360
I will never stop

449
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,200
I'm sorry.

450
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,640
I thought you went back.

451
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,320
Your house is open here.

452
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
I can't come back if I go back.

453
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,040
Then why did you come back?

454
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Are you afraid that I can't

455
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
jump into the sea?

456
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,920
No.

457
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm a man of love and hatred.

458
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,760
I've decided to kill you.

459
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,800
Ye Meng.

460
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,240
Do you still want me?

461
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,340
Oh.

462
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,840
Neewee is busy.

463
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,800
And Fushing Mind is busy.

464
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,920
Seriously, she's polite.

465
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:09,900
As an exit pics,

466
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,580
only those

467
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,700
for story

468
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
I'm your dream

469
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I've never changed

470
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,700
There's still an if

471
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
Promise will be kept

472
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,700
Please remember

473
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
That dream of mine

474
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,700
No matter it's night or day

475
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Until the end of the world

476
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
Even if we can't meet again

477
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,700
Can you ride a bicycle?

478
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Yes

479
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,700
Then ride that

480
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll be there

481
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Can you slow down?

482
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
This is the only thing I can do

483
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
I can't go after her

484
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
I can't go after her

485
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:14,700
I can't go after her

486
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,700
I can't go after her

487
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
What's wrong with this?

488
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,700
What's wrong?

489
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,700
Nothing

490
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
I'm fine

491
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Is there no electricity?

492
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Something's wrong

493
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,700
I'll do it

494
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:55,700
No, I can do it myself

495
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,700
You really don't need my help?

496
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Then you do it

497
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Hurry up

498
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,700
Or it will be bright when we get home

499
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
You're walking too fast

500
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
You're pretty strong

501
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,700
I just touched my wrist

502
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,700
I can't walk

503
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
My knees hurt

504
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
So?

505
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
You stretch your hand

506
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:41,700
Qiaofen

507
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
I'll sit down and work

508
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,700
Are you still a human?

509
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,700
I have to drag you when I drag the car?

510
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,700
You're pretty gentlemanly today

511
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,700
And you just took the fee

512
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,700
Let's go

513
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,700
Okay

514
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
Thank you

515
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:53,700
I tell you

516
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
I don't care if you fall

517
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,700
You did it on purpose, right?

518
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,700
No

519
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,700
I tell you

520
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,700
I will never get off the car

521
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:10,700
Why are you walking so fast?

522
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:13,700
I'm going to sleep

523
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,700
Wait

524
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Ning Meng

525
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,700
Can you stop being angry with me?

526
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,700
No

527
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
You still say no

528
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,700
I just don't want to talk to you

529
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
I don't want to talk to you now

530
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,700
Okay

531
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,700
You can leave me alone

532
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,700
Then take the goldfish you inherited from my house

533
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:40,700
Okay

534
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
Take it

535
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,700
Okay

536
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,700
Where is the camera on Ping'an?

537
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,700
It's gone

538
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,700
It's gone or you threw it away?

539
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:55,700
Okay

540
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,700
You want to break it off with me, right?

541
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,700
You don't even want the memory I gave to Ping'an

542
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,700
Give me a box

543
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,700
I'll take my fish

544
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,700
You really don't want me?

545
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Didn't you refuse first?

546
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,700
But I regret it now

547
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Don't give me a bitter chicken

548
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
I don't eat your fish

549
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Li Junyu

550
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
What are you doing?

551
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,700
What are you doing?

552
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,700
What are you doing, Li Junyu?

553
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
Li Junyu

554
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,700
Why are you so active?

555
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,700
Because of Dr. Gao

556
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,700
When did you break up with Dr. Gao?

557
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
What if it's not?

558
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,700
It doesn't matter

559
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,700
He is a doctor anyway

560
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,700
He doesn't have much time

561
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,700
I don't have a fixed job

562
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,700
He has a lot of time

563
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,700
So it's a bit painful

564
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
Li Junyu's current thoughts are very problematic

565
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,700
Did you ask Qiao Mai to change the water for the goldfish?

566
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,700
Who did you change the water for?

567
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,700
It turns out that it was a goldfish

568
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
That saved my life

569
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,700
I was saved

570
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,700
It's me

571
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,700
Why are you so deep?

572
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
I always think I am a trash

573
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I don't want to ruin you

574
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
In fact, it's good to be a waste

575
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
I like to be a quiet trash

576
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,700
Others don't care about me

577
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
And won't ignore me

578
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
Then I can't be like you

579
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
Do whatever you want

580
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,700
At least I can't get fat and ugly

581
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Because you are more of a father

582
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,700
Look at your face

583
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
If you get ugly, how can I seduce you?

584
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
When did you seduce me?

585
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,700
Now

586
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,700
Listen

587
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
Listen to what?

588
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
Close your eyes

589
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,700
Open your eyes

590
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Open your eyes

591
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Don't you ever need a woman?

592
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
I will be your fantasy

593
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,700
Come and set me free

594
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Hold me till I can't breathe

595
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Ain't nobody can do it

596
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Like what you did

597
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:50,700
Just let it rain

598
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,700
Drink some water

599
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Thank you

600
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Do I look good?

601
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Yes

602
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
Since I look so good

603
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,700
You are so good at planting flowers

604
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,700
I mean the flowers look good

605
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,700
You just confirmed the first day

606
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
You just add flowers without wild flowers, right?

607
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
I will pull all your flowers out

608
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,700
Whatever

609
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Anyway, you have experience in this

610
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,700
You have pulled it out last time

611
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
What?

612
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:00,700
You said it was the flowers of the Spring Festival

613
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:01,700
The flowers

614
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,700
They were frozen to death

615
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,700
You don't think I pulled them out

616
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,700
Because of you, right?

617
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,700
I really appreciate it

618
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
Because I threw the flowers away

619
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,700
It's inevitable

620
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
No

621
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
When did you start to like me?

622
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
When did you start to like me?

623
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,700
Where are you going?

624
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
I will go to see my grandma later

625
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I will take a shower

626
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,700
You are really guilty

627
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
I am not guilty

628
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,700
You should hurry up

629
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,700
I am a little curious

630
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,700
What?

631
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,700
Why do you like to take a shower so much?

632
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
You just took a shower last night

633
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,700
Can't you just love clean?

634
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,700
Yes, yes, yes

635
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,700
You love clean

636
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,700
You are talking like you don't love clean

637
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:45,700
I take a shower every day

638
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,700
By the way

639
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,700
The door of the bathroom is broken

640
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Don't peek

641
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
I am not a color wolf

642
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,700
Why should I peek at you?

643
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
What?

644
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
Don't take off your socks

645
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,700
I already dropped it, sorry

646
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
Ok

647
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,700
Li Jing Yu

648
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,700
What did you mean yesterday?

649
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:45,700
What's wrong?

650
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,700
Do we have to pay attention to that?

651
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,700
I mean

652
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,700
I

653
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:00,700
Li Jing Yu

654
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Are you nervous?

655
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,700
Nervous?

656
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,700
How can I be nervous?

657
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,700
What is there to be nervous about?

658
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,700
I will take a shower first

659
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,700
You are nervous

660
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Are sisters so bold?

661
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:24,700
No one told you

662
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,700
Don't be so active

663
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,700
What sister?

664
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,700
Why are you missing two of them?

665
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,700
Those two have black-band disease

666
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,700
I isolated them to kill the bacteria

667
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,700
After they get better

668
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
Let them reunite with their families

669
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,700
I regret it

670
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,700
I should change you a birthday gift

671
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,700
For example?

672
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:03,700
For example, a king

673
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
Healthy, long-lived, good for health

674
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
You won't push me away in the new year

675
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,700
You have a thick face

676
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,700
How do you know I am because of you?

677
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:14,700
Because I am smart

678
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,700
I know everything

679
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
Know what?

680
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,700
I know. I know

681
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
I know

682
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
I can help you

683
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,700
Go

684
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
Go

685
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
How are you and Ye Meng?

686
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,700
She doesn't go back to the north of Jiang

687
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
She still contact you

688
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,700
No

689
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,700
Why didn't you message her?

690
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,700
I never replied

691
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:50,700
Why do I not believe it?

692
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,860
I'll go to the farm with me.

693
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:52,740
What are you doing?

694
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,700
Don't forget.

695
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,260
Go change your clothes.

696
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,380
Go, go, go.

697
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,420
I'll raise the fish.

698
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,460
You keep this.

699
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,700
I think you're implying something.

700
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,780
You have Jiang Luzhi, right?

701
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,380
This is a good gift for you.

702
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,500
Please, take this one.

703
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,860
45 yuan.

704
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,220
Besides,

705
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,060
you're breaking up with me

706
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,660
because of a fish.

707
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,540
Even if I'm doing this for our relationship,

708
00:32:23,540 --> 00:32:25,620
you have to raise a long-lived one.

709
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:26,780
You're done, right?

710
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,580
I'll pay you.

711
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:28,900
Okay.

712
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:29,620
Take it.

713
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,820
As a qualified boyfriend,

714
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:38,100
I have to make it up to you.

715
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,100
Let's have a date.

716
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,820
Then...

717
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,700
You treat me to a movie.

718
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,860
I'll treat you to a meal.

719
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
Three-dried fish, steak,

720
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,180
or the biggest chain in our town.

721
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,060
I'll choose the biggest chain.

722
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:50,700
Are you sure?

723
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:51,940
Let's go.

724
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:52,940
Three-dried fish and rice.

725
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,860
Is it too late to change the three-dried fish?

726
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,580
Hello.

727
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:04,260
Chen Jian will be here soon.

728
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,100
Take Jiayu out for a while.

729
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,940
When his dad leaves,

730
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,260
send him back.

731
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,780
What is he going to do again?

732
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,820
I don't want to leave.

733
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,620
He can only come to the store every day.

734
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:14,980
Okay, I'll be there soon.

735
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,380
What's wrong?

736
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,340
Let's go.

737
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
Change into a bucket.

738
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:31,220
Why is it a theme park again?

739
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,140
I'm old.

740
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,140
I'm not going.

741
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,060
How old are you?

742
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,020
I'm eight years old.

743
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,180
Eight-year-old kids

744
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,500
love theme parks the most.

745
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,300
Let's go.

746
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,300
I'm not going.

747
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:43,420
I'm not going.

748
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
Let's go.

749
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,380
Let's go.

750
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,060
Let's go.

751
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:03,820
I'm not going.

752
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,820
It's scary.

753
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,100
Ready.

754
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,500
Three, two, one.

755
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,980
Jiayu, smile.

756
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,900
Help us take a picture.

757
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:19,900
Help us take a picture.

758
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,900
What are you going to play now?

759
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,500
What about you?

760
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
Give it to me.

761
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,500
I'm too young to play.

762
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,460
You two continue.

763
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,020
I just want to stay here for a while.

764
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,660
Chen Jiayu.

765
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,860
This is an amusement park.

766
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,940
This is an amusement park.

767
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,300
Don't play with me.

768
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,260
Are you a witch?

769
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,100
What are you talking about?

770
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,180
My mom and I are more naive.

771
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,180
Please.

772
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,860
I recommend the Ferris wheel over there.

773
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:03,540
It's more private than the haunted house.

774
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,460
I won't be your electric cannon.

775
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,140
By the way,

776
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:09,100
if you need me to take pictures for you,

777
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
you can call me.

778
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,740
I have to let Ya'nan have a good look.

779
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
What books does this kid usually read?

780
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:15,140
I can hear it.

781
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,620
Okay, okay, okay.

782
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,820
Wait for us over there.

783
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,020
We'll be right back.

784
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Go ahead.

785
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
Bye.

786
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:23,820
Go.

787
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,820
What are you going to do?

788
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,420
Are you really going on a date?

789
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
Of course.

790
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,020
What about the kid?

791
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,420
You can't let the kid go.

792
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,220
Go buy water.

793
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,620
Go.

794
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,100
Wang Sisi.

795
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,900
It's really you.

796
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,100
Wang Sisi.

797
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,100
Why did you come to the amusement park alone?

798
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,620
I came out for a walk.

799
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,020
Why are you here?

800
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:53,820
I...

801
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,820
I was forced to come here for a night.

802
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,500
Wang Sisi.

803
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,100
Why are you putting so many tears

804
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,300
on your mask?

805
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:07,900
Because I think I'm like a mermaid.

806
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,420
Mermaids are in the water.

807
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,900
But when they're in the dark,

808
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,900
they'll be seen by people.

809
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,500
School is about to start.

810
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
I don't like going to school.

811
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
I don't like being seen by people.

812
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,300
Did you tell your parents

813
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,300
and teachers?

814
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,300
I've already told my mom.

815
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,100
But she has a brother.

816
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,300
She has to be busy making money for her brother.

817
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,500
She doesn't have time to care about me.

818
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,820
I'm afraid my mom will scold me for being ignorant.

819
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:38,820
I'm afraid she'll be angry and won't love me anymore.

820
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,820
So I don't dare to say it again.

821
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
No.

822
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,620
My mom must love you very much.

823
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,060
It's you,

824
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:50,540
the Jade Emperor.

825
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,340
Did you tell your mom

826
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
why you don't like going to school?

827
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,420
Every time I want to say it,

828
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:01,420
my mom will envy me.

829
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,220
I'll be more sad.

830
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,420
Jade Emperor.

831
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
Did you bring sugar?

832
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
Can we play the game

833
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,420
of which pocket the candy is wrapped?

834
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,820
Let's change another game today.

835
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,220
After all, there are other friends.

836
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,220
Okay.

837
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:23,020
I think your mask is very good.

838
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:24,620
When you go home tonight,

839
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,620
you'll keep this mask on.

840
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,620
When you go home,

841
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,620
your mom will definitely pay attention to you.

842
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,420
You tell her

843
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:33,020
why you drew it like this.

844
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,420
But it's weird to wear a mask.

845
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,420
Many people will stare at me.

846
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,820
It's okay.

847
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,220
We'll be with you today.

848
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,420
After wearing the mask,

849
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,220
you can do whatever you want.

850
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,220
Cry if you want to, smile if you want to.

851
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:51,620
Whoever takes off the mask will be eliminated.

852
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,620
Come on, let's play.

853
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,220
Come on.

854
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,420
This is for you.

855
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
Help me get one.

856
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,420
What color do you want?

857
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,420
What color are you wearing now?

858
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:14,420
Sisi.

859
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,020
Are you tired?

860
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,020
No.

861
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,620
Hello.

862
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,620
Hello.

863
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,220
Thank you for your help today.

864
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,020
Why didn't you say anything

865
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,420
when you ran out?

866
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,620
I've been looking for you for a long time.

867
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,420
It's okay.

868
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,620
Sisi is very good.

869
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:30,820
Sisi.

870
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,620
Don't you have something to tell mom?

871
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,820
Don't forget.

872
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,220
Bye, sister.

873
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:36,420
Bye.

874
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,220
Thank you.

875
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,220
Bye.

876
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:39,620
Bye.

877
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,020
Is Sisi...

878
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:48,220
The child's emotional changes are very sensitive.

879
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,420
But if the parents can notice it soon,

880
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,620
they should be able to adjust it soon.

881
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,020
I regret it.

882
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,620
If I could get a little girl

883
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,220
to have a couple with you, that would be great.

884
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,820
I think you're pretty good.

885
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,020
Just like a little sun.

886
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,820
Do you know?

887
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,420
You're better than I thought.

888
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,820
Really?

889
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,420
Yes.

890
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,420
Jiayu, you're back.

891
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,620
Where's Wang Sisi?

892
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,220
She left.

893
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,220
Her mom came to pick her up.

894
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,220
Here.

895
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,620
Do you want to go back first?

896
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:31,020
I'll take Jiayu to find a milk tea shop

897
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,020
and finish her homework.

898
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,020
Then we can go back.

899
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,020
No.

900
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,620
We came together, so we have to go back together.

901
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,020
Someone came to pick her up.

902
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,620
Who?

903
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:45,820
Why are you in such a hurry to find me?

904
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,820
Pick someone up.

905
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:49,820
Him?

906
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,220
Hurry up and go.

907
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,020
The last lesson was useful.

908
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,820
Why didn't you teach me?

909
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,020
No, you're talking nonsense.

910
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,820
Why didn't you teach me?

911
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:00,020
Let's go.

912
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,420
My hobby is math.

913
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,220
I'll teach you math.

914
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,620
Why are you here?

915
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,220
I'm here to chat with you.

916
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,420
It's a bit cold.

917
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,620
Come.

918
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,820
What are you thinking about?

919
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:36,020
I want to ask you a question.

920
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,220
Go ahead.

921
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,420
I didn't have the right to ask before.

922
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,820
I'm not your boyfriend after all.

923
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:44,220
Now I can.

924
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,020
Just tell me.

925
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:48,020
Tell you what?

926
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,220
About the ex-boyfriend.

927
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,420
We talked about it.

928
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,220
I'm not your boyfriend.

929
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,820
I'm not your boyfriend.

930
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,220
I'm not your boyfriend.

931
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,820
I'm not your boyfriend.

932
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,620
Three.

933
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,420
I don't believe you.

934
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,420
Can you stop

935
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,820
talking nonsense?

936
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,020
I know

937
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,220
you're my first love.

938
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,620
But if I knew

939
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,820
you were in my life,

940
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,420
I would have been afraid of losing you.

941
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,620
Look.

942
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,420
You're the only one who can

943
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:22,420
convince me to believe you.

944
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,020
I'll give you a chance.

945
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,220
Tell me the truth.

946
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,020
Six.

947
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:40,420
Actually, it's nine.

948
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,420
I'm sorry, Brother Shi.

949
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,820
You're here to play boxing with me?

950
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,620
I'm kidding.

951
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:48,620
How could there be so many?

952
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,220
Three.

953
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,420
Really?

954
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
I swear.

955
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,420
Three.

956
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
What about Gou Kai?

957
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
Is he in?

958
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,620
He's definitely not.

959
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,220
How could I

960
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:59,020
be with a businessman like him?

961
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:02,420
You're really weird.

962
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,220
You seem to care about Gou Kai.

963
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,620
I haven't gone through

964
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,620
the photo thing last time.

965
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,620
And he said

966
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,820
he would take you back

967
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
after the Spring Festival.

968
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:17,820
The photo is really a team photo.

969
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
Besides,

970
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,820
I'll go back when he comes to pick me up.

971
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:22,420
I won't show up.

972
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,820
You just let him go.

973
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:29,220
Are you happy like this?

974
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,020
It's not bad.

975
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,220
I'm good, right?

976
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
I'm upright.

977
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,020
How many boyfriends did you have before?

978
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,020
Right, first love.

979
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,620
You know it.

980
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,020
I care about it.

981
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,820
I suddenly remember a question.

982
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,020
Go ahead.

983
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,820
What was

984
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,220
Jiang Luzhi

985
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,820
who was your first love?

986
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:49,820
What's going on?

987
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,820
No.

988
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,420
Jiang Luzhi is not.

989
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
What is Jiang Luzhi?

990
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
What did you say?

991
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
I was trying to deal with my grandma.

992
00:42:57,420 --> 00:43:00,020
She kept urging me to get married and have a blind date.

993
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:03,220
Then I only met her once.

994
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:04,420
Who said that?

995
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:05,820
You can just treat Jiang Luzhi.

996
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,420
Why did you

997
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,020
have a bad face every day when I was chasing you?

998
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,420
Why?

999
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:09,620
You even have a poisonous mouth.

1000
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:11,820
How can it be the same?

1001
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,620
Why is it different?

1002
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:14,420
Look at what you just said today.

1003
00:43:14,420 --> 00:43:15,220
Why is it different?

1004
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,220
What's the difference?

1005
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,420
Of course you can't deal with grandma, right?

1006
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:19,020
Why?

1007
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:23,620
Because I like you.

1008
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:24,620
And then...

1009
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,020
Brother, let's take...

1010
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,820
Let's take the sun-truck.

1011
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,420
It's cold.

1012
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:29,820
Come on.

1013
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,820
Take the sun-truck.

1014
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:32,020
You take the sun-truck.

1015
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,420
By the way,

1016
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,820
what were you and Dr. Gao doing

1017
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,220
when you were waiting for him that day?

1018
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,220
What Dr. Gao?

1019
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:41,420
What are you talking about?

1020
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,020
The day you posted the photo.

1021
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,020
I don't understand what you are talking about.

1022
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:49,220
It's so beautiful.

1023
00:43:49,220 --> 00:43:50,420
Relax.

1024
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,020
Your eyes.

1025
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,020
Look at the car.

1026
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:53,820
Don't move.

1027
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:54,820
I'll take a picture of your legs.

1028
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,420
Come on.

1029
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:58,220
One, two, three, go.

1030
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,820
I got it.

1031
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,020
Oh my god.

1032
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,820
Look.

1033
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,420
This is so big.

1034
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:05,020
Okay.

1035
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,820
I'll send it to you.

1036
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:06,220
Send it to me.

1037
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,220
Come on.

1038
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,020
This photo doesn't even need to be photoshopped.

1039
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,820
You're so good.

1040
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,620
You're already a mother.

1041
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:14,620
I'm fine.

1042
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,820
Are you going back to pick up the kid?

1043
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,820
It's weekend.

1044
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:18,420
I'll stay here alone.

1045
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,020
You go ahead.

1046
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,020
It's okay. I'll go with you.

1047
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,420
You can go with Jiayu.

1048
00:44:23,420 --> 00:44:24,020
Jiayu.

1049
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:24,620
Let's go.

1050
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,020
Let's go.

1051
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:26,820
Let's go.

1052
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:54,620
Literarywood

1053
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:25,460
The love that has been rewound

1054
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:29,620
Encloses my thoughts

1055
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,220
Where should I go?

1056
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:38,180
How to avoid

1057
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:44,340
Those memories about you

1058
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:48,180
I want to be far away but I can't

1059
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:55,460
Can't stop

1060
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:58,540
I keep silent

1061
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:01,980
Put the flowers in the back

1062
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:08,100
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

1063
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:12,300
Pretend to be firm

1064
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:17,420
But still in the distance

1065
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:23,100
The most perfect lie

1066
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:26,100
Deceive yourself

1067
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,060
If you love, let go

1068
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:32,780
Let us lose connection

1069
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:35,380
Why is this

1070
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:38,540
Tearful moment

1071
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,520
Blue sea

1072
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:45,320
Flowing
