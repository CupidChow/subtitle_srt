2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the remaining memories like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the road of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath is gradually missing at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is nothing, which one still loves you

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Actually never changed, if there is still a promise to be kept

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember, which one has my dream

The Long Ballad

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
President Ye, the project of the forest is ready

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The land of the welfare center is basically also in the background

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
What else do I need to do?

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Find a way to pull Shu Yi into the project

21
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Pull all his relatives and friends in

22
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then you can take the money and leave

23
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
President Li, you don't want me to cheat

24
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
This is not right

25
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is completely different from the plan we talked about before

26
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Once something happens, I have to do it alone

27
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You have been with me for so many years

28
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I won't treat you badly

29
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If something really happens

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
You just have to shut your mouth

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I will give you a large sum of very significant revenge

32
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
How about this?

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
How much money do you accept?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
All for you

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The Long Ballad

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Not cold?

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Not cold

38
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Not cold

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The surgery is almost over

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The doctor will arrange the surgery for you

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
So fast

42
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Nervous?

43
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
What are you afraid of?

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What am I nervous about?

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I am old

46
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have never experienced anything

47
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What are you afraid of?

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's just a surgery

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
When you close your eyes and open them, it's over

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You should eat and drink

51
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
You don't go to the heart

52
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You are very smart

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You should learn from me

54
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You are not afraid of anything

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You have to learn from me

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When something happens, you have to hide

57
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You have to face it bravely

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can't hide

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I know

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,000
After today, we will be a family

61
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
We will be together

62
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
We will face our own difficulties

63
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't leave me

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It seems that your mother was cheated

65
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It has a big relationship with Li Lingbai

66
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Although I don't know what is the connection between Li Lingbai and Wang Xingsheng

67
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But this recording was exposed

68
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a big deal

69
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Wang Xingsheng should use this recording to threaten Li Lingbai

70
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
But now he is gone

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He only gave me the recording

72
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
He wants me to deal with Li Lingbai

73
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
It's too risky for you to go

74
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Li Lingbai is not a good boy

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you have him, you don't know what he will do

76
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I can only bet one

77
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What about Li Jingyu?

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Does he know this?

79
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What are you thinking?

80
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm thinking

81
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If the USB is not empty

82
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Li Lingbai's testimony is inside

83
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What will you think?

84
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I want to know

85
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
What will you do when you know the truth?

86
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'll let you know

87
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
What do you think?

88
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
What do you think?

89
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You are afraid that Li Lingbai will change his mind

90
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If he is true

91
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,940
About the suicide of your mother

92
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I will not hide it

93
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
If you pay the heavy price

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Will you hate me?

95
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It doesn't matter who

96
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
you should pay the price.

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I just hope

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you won't be a loser

99
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
because of me.

100
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
But she is your mother.

101
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Grandma talked to me today.

102
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She told me

103
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
no matter what happens,

104
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
you should face it bravely.

105
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
She told me not to think too much.

106
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
She is old.

107
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
She has the courage.

108
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
We should learn from her.

109
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So don't be afraid.

110
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Do whatever you want.

111
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Face it bravely.

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Face it yourself.

113
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Okay.

114
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Miss Ye.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You can't go in.

116
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Miss Ye.

117
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Miss Ye.

118
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Miss Ye, you can't go in.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You go out first.

120
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
You are so uneducated.

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Is this how your parents teach you?

122
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
As a mother like you,

123
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
what right do you have to be educated with me?

124
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What are you doing here?

125
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I want to listen to something.

126
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Miss Ye.

127
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Aren't you afraid that I will be a mystery

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
with your friend?

129
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
She deserves it.

130
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Compared with being famous,

131
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I have already suffered enough

132
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
for what I have suffered.

133
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What do you want?

134
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I want to know the truth of what happened that year.

135
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I don't know what you are talking about.

136
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What did you say?

137
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
How about I expose this recording to the media?

138
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
This kind of gossip topic

139
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
should be interesting to many people.

140
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Li Linbai.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You can ignore yourself.

142
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But you should care about the interests of Hainan Group.

143
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Hello.

144
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Mom, come back.

145
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Come back to the old house.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
We are all back.

147
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Your dad was reported.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He was taken away for investigation.

149
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I will go back immediately.

150
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You are so good.

151
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The thing is

152
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
that my second sister asked someone to inquire about it.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
It means that

154
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
a salesman

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
took over a project in Hanhai

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
and asked your dad to pay the loan.

157
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Then your dad approved it according to the procedure.

158
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Then this person ran away with the money.

159
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Now he is reported to be a fraud.

160
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I don't know where he is taken to now.

161
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If I can't pay back the money,

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
your dad will be in trouble this time.

163
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Really, sister?

164
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What should I do?

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Don't scare yourself.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I am investigating it.

167
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Did something happen to dad?

168
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Go out and talk.

169
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What's wrong?

170
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The USB is not empty.

171
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I deleted it on purpose.

172
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
There is the content of Li Lingbai

173
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
seducing Wang Xingsheng

174
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
to trick my mom.

175
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I went to Li Lingbai today.

176
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I guessed the USB thing

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
a long time ago.

178
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
With your character,

179
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
if you can't get the USB,

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
it's impossible to just forget it.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't think it through.

182
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I didn't expect Li Lingbai

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
to set a trap for my dad so early.

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Don't blame yourself.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
It's not your problem.

186
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The most important thing now

187
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
is to solve dad's problem.

188
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Give me a few days.

189
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'll figure it out.

190
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Are you going to Li Lingbai?

191
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I'm going to see someone.

192
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Maybe he will have a way.

193
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Dad, let's go.

194
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Dad.

195
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I've been thinking about something

196
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
for a long time.

197
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
It's about your grandpa.

198
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
That person is abroad.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He said he was rich.

200
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I told you about this today.

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I don't want you to regret it.

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You want to know about your biological father.

203
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
You can ask him.

204
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I won't regret it.

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You're so quick to remember.

206
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You're afraid I'll mind.

207
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Don't worry.

208
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Grandma won't mind.

209
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You will always be my baby grandson.

210
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
That's not it.

211
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
I just don't want to see him.

212
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I only have one father in my life.

213
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
That's Li Mu.

214
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Dad.

215
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
You can't avoid some things.

216
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
You've been running away for so many years.

217
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You have to learn to face it.

218
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When you figure it out,

219
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you'll contact him.

220
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Dad.

221
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Li Jingyu

222
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Li Jingyu has been gone for two days.

223
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Did you miss him too?

224
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,600
Sorry, the number you have dialed is not available at the moment.

225
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,600
Please try again later.

226
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
When will you come back?

227
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,800
Yes.

228
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Hello?

229
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,600
Meng Meng, Jia Yu is missing.

230
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,600
The teacher said she didn't go to school this afternoon. I can't reach her.

231
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,800
Don't hurry. I'll go find you right away.

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Sister Yang.

233
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,400
I'll go find Chen Jian and see if she's there.

234
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't rush. Let's meet at the school gate.

235
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,200
I'll stop talking.

236
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,800
The car keys. The phone.

237
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,400
Yang!

238
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Where is Jia Yu? What's wrong?

239
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,600
The teacher said she was missing this afternoon.

240
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
She thought I took her away.

241
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,200
Jia Yu is so weird. She can't have a runaway. Did Chen Jian take her away?

242
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
No. I called her. I didn't.

243
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,400
Did she go to the kindergarten with her classmates?

244
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,800
No. I asked. Jia Yu is missing.

245
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,000
She won't be in trouble.

246
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,200
Don't rush.

247
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,800
We'll go separately to find her. Think about where she usually goes.

248
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,400
We'll call her later.

249
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,200
Find her.

250
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,800
Don't rush. Drive safely.

251
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,200
I know.

252
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Drive safely.

253
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,600
Okay.

254
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,200
Okay.

255
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
Hello.

256
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,200
Hello, how are you?

257
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm fine.

258
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:07,400
Hey, Jia Yu!

259
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm fast...

260
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm done.

261
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,400
Hello. Who are you?

262
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm looking for my kid.

263
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,400
Have you seen a boy who almost came to my place and gave me a kiss?

264
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,000
No. We're shooting.

265
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,200
Thank you for leaving.

266
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,600
We're shooting. Sorry.

267
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:26,400
Thank you for your cooperation.

268
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,800
Sorry, sorry, bro.

269
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,400
I'm leaving.

270
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Sorry. Excuse me. Thank you.

271
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,800
Hey, brother.

272
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
I brought my brother and a kid.

273
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,800
They're so tall. They're as tall as a watermelon.

274
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,800
They're sitting here. Did you see them today?

275
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,400
No.

276
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,000
Hello.

277
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,800
Have you seen this kid?

278
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,800
Sorry, I didn't notice.

279
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,400
Thank you.

280
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Sorry to bother you.

281
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,000
Have you seen this kid?

282
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
No, I didn't see him.

283
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,800
Hello, classmate.

284
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Have you seen this classmate?

285
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
No.

286
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Let me see him again.

287
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
I haven't seen him.

288
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,800
No.

289
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,600
Jia Yu.

290
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,200
Jia Yu!

291
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,200
I'm afraid you two have seen a similar one.

292
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,200
Jia Yu!

293
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,400
Jia Yu!

294
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,400
What's wrong with you?

295
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Who did you fight with?

296
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,600
Where is he?

297
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,400
Don't worry.

298
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,600
Brother Yu, we're brothers.

299
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,400
You didn't call me when you fought with someone.

300
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,000
We're not brothers.

301
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,400
We're not brothers.

302
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,000
Why did you fight with someone?

303
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,200
They're so stubborn.

304
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,400
They said my mom was with a bar owner

305
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,000
and that's why they divorced.

306
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,600
I'm just unable to fight against people.

307
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
Are my feelings like what'...

308
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,600
like what?

309
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,680
Be yourself,

310
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,200
Yu separate me from you.

311
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,040
I don't wanna stay with him.

312
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,520
I'm not like your mum.

313
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,840
I didn't betray her.

314
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,960
My dad is someone who I know clearly.

315
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
I feel wronged.

316
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,600
Don't tell her the truth.

317
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,720
I don't want her to worry.

318
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,560
Don't worry.

319
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,280
We found the turtle.

320
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,360
It's in the wetland park.

321
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:51,680
Does it hurt?

322
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,360
It hurts.

323
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,000
Let me see.

324
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,160
If I hit you again,

325
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,640
you'll hurt your face.

326
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,800
Do you hear me?

327
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,080
Chen Jiayu!

328
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,440
Who told you to come here?

329
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm so worried, you know?

330
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,560
Get out!

331
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:15,840
Don't.

332
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:16,600
It's itchy.

333
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,160
Stop it.

334
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,160
It's itchy.

335
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,080
I don't give you any punishment now.

336
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,000
I've told her just now.

337
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,960
She's sincere in her attitude.

338
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,160
Can she remember if you don't hit her?

339
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,680
If anything happens to you today,

340
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,360
she'll regret it.

341
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,720
What's wrong with your neck?

342
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,000
I'm fine.

343
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,360
Let me see.

344
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,040
What are you doing?

345
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,280
What are you doing?

346
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,240
What are you doing?

347
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,640
Where did you get it?

348
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,960
Mom, I stole the money.

349
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
I didn't give it to me.

350
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,520
So we fought.

351
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,720
Chen Jiayu, did you fight with others?

352
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,520
Did others hit you?

353
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,240
I'll go to your teacher now.

354
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:54,640
No, no.

355
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,360
It's itchy.

356
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:55,720
It's itchy.

357
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,760
Don't, don't.

358
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,160
They were just

359
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,920
playing with each other.

360
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,120
It's nothing serious.

361
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,160
When I go back,

362
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,880
I'll teach them some boxing moves.

363
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:04,800
I'll win next time.

364
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,600
Don't worry.

365
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,240
What are you talking about?

366
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,720
Next time?

367
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,240
What are you going to do next time?

368
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,680
Will you break your legs?

369
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,760
You fought with others since you were a kid.

370
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,680
You should be a kid.

371
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,040
You let my son learn from you.

372
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,440
Chen Jiayu never fought before.

373
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,480
He only fought with others

374
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,920
because you taught him boxing.

375
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:21,560
Yang.

376
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:22,760
He was a kid.

377
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,080
What did they talk about?

378
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,800
All day long.

379
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:25,920
They were just playing with each other.

380
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:26,840
They were just playing.

381
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,120
They weren't playing.

382
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,400
They were just teaching

383
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,480
self-protection moves.

384
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,440
How old are you?

385
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,280
Self-protection?

386
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
Do you have to fight for self-protection?

387
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,000
He's not your son.

388
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:44,840
You don't care about him.

389
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,880
I care about him.

390
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,520
I don't want him to fight with others.

391
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,080
Go home.

392
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,720
Mom.

393
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,080
Go.

394
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Don't blame him, Kaka.

395
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,320
He's too nervous because of Jiayu.

396
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,640
What's your name?

397
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,120
Say something.

398
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:19,720
Here.

399
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:34,280
Does it hurt, son?

400
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,360
Does it hurt?

401
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,320
Does it hurt?

402
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,080
Does it hurt?

403
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,200
Does it hurt?

404
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,640
You...

405
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,320
You made me look for you today

406
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,240
and went to fight with others.

407
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,320
You're angry now.

408
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
I was wrong about today.

409
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,080
But you shouldn't have said that just now.

410
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,040
Why can't I say that to him?

411
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,520
You went to fight with others

412
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,680
because he taught you boxing.

413
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,720
No.

414
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,440
I don't want to be bullied when I learn boxing.

415
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,000
Mom.

416
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,440
You said you would respect my choice.

417
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,800
Boxing is my choice.

418
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,920
I will feel sorry for you and worry about you.

419
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

420
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,480
Mom.

421
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm not everything you've ever lived.

422
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,720
If you surround me every day,

423
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,400
I'll be suppressed and can't breathe.

424
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,320
Jiayu, you have to promise me

425
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,440
that no matter what happens in the future,

426
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,040
you can't make me lose you.

427
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
Promise me.

428
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,560
Mom.

429
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,600
I'm not a kid anymore.

430
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,200
Does it hurt?

431
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:08,960
Will you fight again?

432
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:09,920
No.

433
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,440
Okay.

434
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:13,600
Have a rest.

435
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,200
Don't touch the water.

436
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,800
Don't move.

437
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,440
Okay, go.

438
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,840
You can go back first.

439
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:31,640
Okay.

440
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,440
I'll lock the door.

441
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,040
I'll go first.

442
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,480
You don't know that he's not your son.

443
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,280
You don't know that you care about him.

444
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,000
I care about him.

445
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,320
I don't want him to fight with others.

446
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,240
You fought with others since you were a kid.

447
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,000
You should be ashamed.

448
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,440
You want my son to learn from you?

449
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,720
There's a National Benefactor Ceremony.

450
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,200
I hope him to do well on his test.

451
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,320
What I just said those words are over.

452
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,400
Don't take it to heart.

453
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,040
Why're you bestimmt to live by yourself?

454
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:54,920
When do I get the chance to ask you that question?

455
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,480
What is the question?

456
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,680
This has nothing to do with your case,

457
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,480
so I'm going to ask any question to you once.

458
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,840
Hey.

459
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:13,180
I- I'm sorry.

460
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,800
OK.

461
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,800
Episode 18

462
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,040
Mengmeng.

463
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,640
Dad.

464
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,840
Dad.

465
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
You're back.

466
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,880
Look.

467
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,160
I'm fine.

468
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,240
Did you suffer?

469
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:45,880
No.

470
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,560
No.

471
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
You're right.

472
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,800
Actually, I'm lucky this time.

473
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,160
The loan shark took the initiative

474
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,520
and cleared me up.

475
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
That project

476
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,560
is not a fake loan.

477
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,240
Hanhai is going to be the project.

478
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,440
I'm glad you're fine.

479
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,400
Were you worried about it?

480
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,000
Of course.

481
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,760
But the most important thing is grandma.

482
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,360
They're worried sick.

483
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,160
Look at me.

484
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm worried about everyone.

485
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:18,880
How about this?

486
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,520
Let's go to grandma's house for dinner.

487
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,200
Go ahead.

488
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,000
I'll make a call.

489
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,600
Okay.

490
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:35,920
Hello.

491
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,160
Hello.

492
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Dad is back.

493
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,640
I know.

494
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,080
What about you?

495
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,920
When will you come back?

496
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,520
Turn around.

497
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,040
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

498
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,320
I want to give you a surprise.

499
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,480
The sea has really changed about

500
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,640
how i got into the fix.

501
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,320
Take a look.

502
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,400
Honey,

503
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,240
I realize I can't leave you.

504
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,440
Dear,

505
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,680
I'm not coming back home.

506
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,500
The

507
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,840
What are you doing?

508
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Tell me the truth.

509
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
Did you go to Lin Lingbai?

510
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
No.

511
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,840
I went to visit the country.

512
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
I met Grandpa Wu.

513
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,420
Grandma gave me his contact information before I was admitted to the hospital.

514
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,800
I didn't want to see him.

515
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,240
I thought I would never

516
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,440
have any relationship with him.

517
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,280
But after I met him, I realized I was fine.

518
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,600
If it wasn't for me,

519
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,200
you wouldn't have to see him.

520
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,800
It's not all.

521
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,160
I want to know what happened back then.

522
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:37,800
I want to face it sooner or later.

523
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,400
And I'm not a loser.

524
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,400
That old man is very rich.

525
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,240
He's even richer than Li Lingbai.

526
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,880
So the money my dad used to pay the bill

527
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,720
was his?

528
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,480
No.

529
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,640
Li Lingbai is behind all this.

530
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,800
That old man found the loan company

531
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,200
and got the money back.

532
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:04,920
Li Jinyu.

533
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,520
Thank you.

534
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,480
Just a word of thanks.

535
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,640
What do you want?

536
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,320
Let me hold you for a while.

537
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,640
I'll help you solve

538
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,480
Xiao Bai's problem.

539
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,400
Don't ask about the past.

540
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,040
Look at you all pulling your faces.

541
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,320
It's just a surgery.

542
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,480
It'll be out soon.

543
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,200
You're a man of your word, Grandma.

544
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,120
I'm not.

545
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm not.

546
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,960
I'm not.

547
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,960
I'm not.

548
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,640
You're a man of your word, Grandma.

549
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,520
You have to send me to college.

550
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,160
Have a good exam. I'll be waiting for you.

551
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,520
Don't be afraid, Ju Hua.

552
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,160
You'll be out soon.

553
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,000
I'll be waiting for you at the door.

554
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,480
Don't worry.

555
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:24,080
Here's the beans.

556
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,760
Here's your hand.

557
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:28,680
Mengmeng.

558
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,560
Take care of yourself.

559
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
Take a good rest when you're out.

560
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,120
Let's go to the tea house.

561
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:39,640
Okay?

562
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,040
You'd better get some rest.

563
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,840
Take care.

564
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:44,800
Don't worry.

565
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,440
Okay.

566
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,120
Good luck.

567
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,240
Good luck, Mengmeng.

568
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,440
The patient is having a surgery.

569
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,720
His family is waiting outside.

570
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
The patient is having a surgery.

571
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
The patient is having a surgery.

572
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,920
That may be good.

573
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,920
Chapé tin in there.

574
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:13,640
It helps loose balls.

575
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,440
Everything is developed on her.

576
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,720
If it's not different from her,

577
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,240
you won't have to go to college.

578
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,160
I know her.

579
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,400
I found her very lucky and smart.

580
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,120
She is very important for Zeyuan.

581
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:33,180
I think Zeyuan is the best for Zeyuan.

582
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,480
There is nothing special to her.

583
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,120
She is just a kind person.

584
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,240
Still she is a woman for her.

585
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,440
Li Jingyu?

586
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,640
Where did this talent knee Li Jingyu were he from?

587
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,640
It is not Li Jingyu..

588
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,440
It is me!

589
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,440
In here, I'm not his decree appraiser!

590
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,880
President Wang?

591
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,620
You have not been here for aate long!

592
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,420
I, if I still not come to this company

593
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,780
I still don't know how bad it is created by you Hanhai gang!

594
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:07,540
The previous incident at Hailangang

595
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,220
caused a huge stock market in Hanhai.

596
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:13,340
The directors have a big opinion about you.

597
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,540
If you can't manage the company,

598
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,460
you can quit.

599
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,100
Mr. Huang, are you kidding me?

600
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,180
I've been working here

601
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,860
for so many years.

602
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,180
Besides,

603
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,300
I'm the largest shareholder in Hanhai.

604
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,580
How can I quit?

605
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:32,900
Mr. Li has acquired

606
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,980
some of the shares of small shareholders.

607
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:36,740
And now,

608
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,500
some of the shareholders are on his side.

609
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:41,500
Li Changjin and his grandson

610
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,900
are close to

611
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,660
15% of the shares.

612
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:46,980
Who do you think

613
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,300
Hanhai is?

614
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
You two work together to deal with me?

615
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,260
I only care about the interests of the company.

616
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,060
As for who will take this position,

617
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,860
it doesn't matter.

618
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
I'm here to inform you that

619
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:08,180
instead of being dismissed by the board,

620
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,780
you should resign now.

621
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,220
You should keep your dignity.

622
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,500
You don't even know

623
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,620
your own family background.

624
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,620
How can you be assured to hand over the company to you?

625
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,940
Help me carry the body.

626
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,660
Are you thirsty?

627
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,300
No.

628
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,020
Have some water.

629
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,380
The doctor is out.

630
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,740
He's out.

631
00:38:27,380 --> 00:38:28,340
How is he, doctor?

632
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,140
How is he?

633
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:30,740
He's fine.

634
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,460
How is he?

635
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,340
Doctor.

636
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,500
The operation went well.

637
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:36,580
Don't worry too much.

638
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:49,100
Be careful of the

639
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:50,060
You're back.

640
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,140
Grandma, I'll send you back first.

641
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:54,540
Then I'll go back to get some clothes for Grandma Tong.

642
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:57,340
Okay, we'll go back first.

643
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,180
I'll let Mengmeng pick you up.

644
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,220
Rest early, Grandma.

645
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:00,860
Okay.

646
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:01,500
I'm leaving.

647
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,180
Take care, Mengmeng.

648
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,060
Take care.

649
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,140
Are you tired?

650
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,180
I'm fine.

651
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm fine.

652
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,380
You're back.

653
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,180
I'm back.

I'm back.

655
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,180
I'm back.

656
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm back.

657
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,180
I'm back.

658
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,140
I'm back.

659
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,180
I'm back.

660
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,380
I'm back.

661
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:29,580
I'm back.

662
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,780
I'm back.

663
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,980
I'm back.

664
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,180
I'm back.

665
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,380
I'm back.

666
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,580
I'm back.

667
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,780
I'm back.

668
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,980
I'm back.

669
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,180
I'm back.

670
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,380
I'm back.

671
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,580
I'm back.

672
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,780
I'm back.

673
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,980
I'm back.

674
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,180
I'm back.

675
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,380
I'm back.

676
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,580
I'm back.

677
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:48,780
I'm back.

678
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,220
I'm back.

679
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,580
I'm back.

680
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,860
I'm back.

681
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,660
I'm back.

682
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,780
I'm back.

683
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,260
times up

684
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,020
Mrs. Tong.

685
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,900
I'm back.

686
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:03,260
I'm back.

687
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,020
I'm back.

688
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,940
You…

689
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:09,660
you need to learn

690
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:12,220
not to be afraid

691
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:14,060
like me.

692
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,300
Don't try to avoid

693
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,140
any situations.

694
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:20,680
paid for his NT$16 onion

695
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:37,860
What are you doing?

696
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,480
What are you doing,

697
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,300
I understand, 이미itic

698
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,140
Franz Schwarz

699
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,060
fikur

700
00:40:52,060 --> 00:41:04,680
b

701
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,920
Good, h Goodbye

702
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,260
Goodbye

703
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:08,600
Love you

704
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,500
Hope you are well

705
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:15,740
Wish you little

706
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,740
I can't find any news about you

707
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:26,740
The love that's been reflected in my heart

708
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,740
Encloses my thoughts

709
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:35,740
Where should I go?

710
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:39,740
How should I avoid

711
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:44,740
Those memories about you

712
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:55,740
I'm so deep that I can't get rid of you

713
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:59,740
I'm silent

714
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:02,740
Put the flowers in the back

715
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:08,740
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

716
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:13,740
Pretend to be firm

717
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,740
But still in the distance

718
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,740
The most perfect lie

719
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:27,740
Deceive yourself

720
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:33,740
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

721
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Why is this the moment of tears

722
00:42:39,740 --> 00:43:03,680
The heart is still

723
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,740
The most perfect lie
