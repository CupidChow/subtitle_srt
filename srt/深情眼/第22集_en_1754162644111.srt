00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If the world can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When the breath is gradually missing at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There is nothing that still loves you

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's just that it's never changed

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that song has my dream

Episode 2

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
How is it? Are you satisfied with my makeup?

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Satisfied

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Come, let me see

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Have you seen the most beautiful bride?

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What are you doing? Are you going to cry? Don't cry

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I'm not crying. I'm putting on makeup for you

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
It will be ruined

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm just too happy

24
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I know

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Look at us

26
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You didn't go anywhere

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Happy new year, my baby

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You will have a lot of identities in the future

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Your identity, wife, mother

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
But in my place

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You will always be that

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Do whatever you want to do

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Happy child

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Enough, enough

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will be with you, okay?

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I will be with you

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No, no, no

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Be careful

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't think I don't know

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I can see Chen Kai Ran's mind

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you think?

42
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I really have nothing with him

43
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And I really didn't plan

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
To start a new relationship

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Because of the shark?

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Not entirely

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
To be honest

48
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I think it's very awkward

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Kai Kai has always liked you

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Right?

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
And now he likes you

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I think it's a good thing

54
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Right?

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Yes

56
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And now he suddenly treats me like this

57
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
And I really feel

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's very strange

59
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, no, no

60
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is this?

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Does he like me?

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
He has mistaken me

63
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Don't deny him

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Because of these ridiculous things

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Anyway, I'm fine now

66
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I just want to be normal

67
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
But don't think too much

68
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Do you know?

69
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Okay

70
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Today is your wedding day

71
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I know

72
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
People

73
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Have to believe in love, right?

74
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes

75
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Ya'an

76
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You will meet your happiness

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Chen

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let's go, let's go

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let's go, let's go

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Sister, sister

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Everyone, please

82
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
No, sisters

83
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Have mercy

84
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If you want to take the bride away

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have to pass this level

86
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Listen carefully

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Question

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Question

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
In 20 seconds

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Say ten kinds of nicknames to the bride

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Ready to start

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are so brave

93
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Sister

94
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What is it?

95
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
What is it?

96
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Say it

97
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Wife

98
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
That

99
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Forget it, I'll just help you, okay?

100
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What are you talking about?

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Bride

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Yes

103
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Second question

104
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Then you can change the next question

105
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Change the second question

106
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Hurry up

107
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I have a lot

108
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Yes

109
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Now the second question

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Say one thing you will never forget

111
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
When you were in love

112
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I force you to get married

113
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are the first

114
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You are the first

115
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are not a man

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are a traitor

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Say

118
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You are the first

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
No matter what the nickname is

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
As long as it's you

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You didn't force me to get married

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
No poor people can fight

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I expressed my feelings very early

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I said

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I know I will fall in love with you

126
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Ladies and gentlemen

127
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Is this answer okay?

128
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let me in

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The red envelope is full

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I have money now

131
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So kind

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
What

134
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Hurry up

135
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000

00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Red envelope

00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Sisters

138
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000

No more

143
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Bridegroom and bridegroom

144
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Please serve tea to your father

145
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Dad

146
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Drink tea

147
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Dad, please drink tea

Come

Take two

150
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Thank you, dad

151
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Mom

152
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Bridegroom and bridegroom

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Please serve tea to your parents

154
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Grandma

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Please drink tea

156
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Be careful

157
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Red

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Come

159
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I give you

160
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Thank you, grandma

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Wish you a happy marriage

162
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And have a son soon

163
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Yes

164
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Hurry up

165
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Come

Brother

169
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
We are in the same boat

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Second aunt

171
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Second aunt

172
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Big father, big daughter

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We will take care of the money

174
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Do you hear me?

175
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000

Be happy and sweet forever

Thank you

186
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Sure

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Don't worry

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Ok

189
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
It's time to change the wedding dress

190
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Wedding dress

191
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Yes, come and change the dress

192
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Change the dress

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hurry up

00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Let me change the dress

Go

과� ます

280
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'll tell you

281
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'll leave Jinyu to you.

282
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Don't worry, Dad. I'll take good care of her.

283
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You see the love that's in my heart.

284
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I will go wherever you go.

285
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
There will stop whenever you stop.

286
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Even far away from home.

287
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I will make you feel the love.

288
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I'll stand right here.

289
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'll stand right here.

290
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I'll stand right here.

291
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Look, it's so beautiful.

292
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Everyone, welcome to Mr. Li Jinyu and Ms. Ye Meng's wedding.

293
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm the bridegroom's half-bride.

294
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
By the way, I'll tell you a few things.

295
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Of course, I'm definitely the first witness of their love.

296
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Do you know when I found out that the groom fell in love with his bridegroom?

297
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
When?

298
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
After I was the bridegroom's half-bride.

299
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
That day, Ms. Ye Meng seemed to be busy and not in her school.

300
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
My brother was sitting in the yard reading books.

301
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
He didn't even text me for an entire afternoon.

302
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Right, Grandma?

303
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Yes, he sent a message.

304
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I just couldn't get a hold of it.

305
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I was alone all day.

306
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I asked him, what were you thinking about?

307
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Ms. Ye Meng, do you know what my brother said?

308
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Say it properly.

309
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He said he had a memory palace in his mind.

310
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He wanted to put you in there.

311
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Then he could see you with his eyes closed.

312
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Qiao Man Mo said that.

313
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
It's almost the same anyway.

314
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I said it.

315
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
My brother said he missed you very much.

316
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Is this true?

317
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Ms. Ye Meng, actually, what I want to say is that

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
it doesn't matter if you're acting or not.

319
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But if you're just looking at it,

320
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
my brother really loves you very much.

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
He'll definitely be nice to you.

322
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Right, bridegroom.

323
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
My dear bridegroom,

324
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
it's time for you to say a few words.

325
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,720
If you have any true feelings or

326
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,000
little works, please tell Xin Yang.

327
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Come on.

328
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Mr. Luo.

329
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Mr. Luo.

330
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mr. Luo.

331
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Mr. Luo.

332
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Actually, I've said a lot of things.

333
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
But today,

334
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I want to thank you for your tolerance.

335
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You once told me

336
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
that the world was never mean to me.

337
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I didn't believe it at all.

338
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But now,

339
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm going to try to believe it.

340
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm going to try to feel this world.

341
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Because I've already met my own moon.

342
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Ye Meng.

343
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The luckiest thing in my life is to meet you.

344
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I may not have been a qualified lover.

345
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
But from now on,

346
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll try to be a qualified husband.

347
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Good, brother.

348
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Good.

349
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Good.

350
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Cool.

351
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I believe my brother will be a good husband.

352
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Bridegroom,

353
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
do you have anything to say to your husband?

354
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
No.

355
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
When I first met Li Jingyu,

356
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I was thinking,

357
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
how could there be someone in this world

358
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
who is so compatible with my sister?

359
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Luo Yang.

360
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Hua Chi.

361
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Good grandma.

362
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I really feel lucky.

363
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Because I resigned from my job,

364
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
and met my crush.

365
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
What? What?

366
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Actually, I've always known that

367
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm a very lucky person.

368
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Because there are many people who love me.

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
And today,

370
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
there is another person who loves me.

371
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Li Jingyu.

372
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
From now on,

373
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
my family is your family.

374
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
My friend is your friend.

375
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
And all the love and luck I got,

376
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'll share with you.

377
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'll share with you.

378
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Okay.

379
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Then the next time,

380
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I should give it to our head of the family,

381
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Ms. Junhua.

382
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
She's already in a hurry to steal my microphone.

383
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Come on, grandma.

384
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Come on, head of the family.

385
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Come on, head of the family.

386
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Grandma.

387
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm afraid to be too excited.

388
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm afraid that I'll forget what I want to say.

389
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
I even memorized a little book last night.

390
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Mengmeng.

391
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
This is the first time I've seen you.

392
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I know you at a glance.

393
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You are my baby.

394
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Sun Xi.

395
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This is called fate.

396
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Right?

397
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Yes.

398
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You can't get away.

399
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I fell in love with you at a glance.

400
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You're so beautiful.

401
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I don't want to close my eyes.

402
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I just want to keep looking at her.

403
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
So beautiful.

404
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
That's it.

405
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I tell you, this bad boy,

406
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
he's a little bit of a problem.

407
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He's timid and worried.

408
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
He doesn't say anything.

409
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But I saw this today.

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
My grandson is in charge of this big task.

411
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Right?

412
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Yes.

413
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Good.

414
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I have to thank Mengmeng.

415
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You can tolerate her.

416
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I have to thank you for accepting her.

417
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Then,

418
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
you two have to live well in the future.

419
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,000
If Badou doesn't obey, you tell Grandma.

420
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
OK.

421
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Right.

422
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Badou will learn from Grandma.

423
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
He's not afraid of anything.

424
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Just say it.

425
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
OK?

426
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I have too many books.

427
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Come on.

428
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Meilan, say something.

429
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Look at you crying.

430
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Am I too excited?

431
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Come on, say something.

432
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't cry.

433
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Happy day.

434
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I say something on behalf of my family.

435
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Say it.

436
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Actually, I just say one sentence.

437
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
You live well.

438
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
The ninth day is long.

439
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Jin Yu.

440
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I have only one daughter.

441
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
She grew up in my heart.

442
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
If you don't treat her well,

443
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I won't let you go.

444
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Right.

445
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I won't let you go.

446
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And me.

447
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Don't worry, Dad.

448
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I believe my brother can do it.

449
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Right?

450
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Yes.

451
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
OK.

452
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Then,

453
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
it's time for the most sacred and romantic announcement.

454
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
First,

455
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
please welcome the most handsome and cute kids in the universe,

456
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Chen Jiayu and his friends.

457
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Please give them the ring.

458
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Great.

459
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Great.

460
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Great.

461
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Bridegroom.

462
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Would you like to accept Mrs. Ye Meng

463
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
to be your wife?

464
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
From today on,

465
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,000
whether it's a good or bad situation,

466
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
rich or poor,

467
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
healthy or ill,

468
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
you will always love her and cherish her.

469
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Until death do you separate?

470
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I do.

471
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Great.

472
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Bridegroom.

473
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Would you like to accept Li Jingyu

474
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
to be your husband?

475
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
From today on,

476
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,000
whether it's a good or bad situation,

477
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
rich or poor,

478
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
healthy or ill,

479
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
you will always love her and cherish her.

480
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Until death do you separate?

481
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I do.

482
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Louder.

483
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I do.

484
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Then, please exchange the rings.

485
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I've forgotten all my memories

486
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
but I can't erase you

487
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
from the shadows in my mind

488
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Every time I look at you

489
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,000
I want to get closer to my own indulgence

490
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
How can I forget

491
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
those unintentional things?

492
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
If you know my feelings

493
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Now,

494
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
the groom can kiss your bride!

495
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

496
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

497
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Hug you

498
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Don't doubt

499
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

500
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Kiss! Kiss!

501
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Kiss! Kiss!

502
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Kiss! Kiss!

503
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Every time I look at you

504
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I want to get closer to my own indulgence

505
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
How can I forget

506
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
those unintentional things?

507
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
If you know my feelings

508
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't want to escape

509
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
because I care too much

510
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:35,000
the courage to be lost

511
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Let's continue to learn

512
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
the courage to embrace you

513
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
in my last strength

514
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

515
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Okay.

516
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
One more.

517
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
We're married.

518
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Wait a minute.

519
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Is it beautiful?

520
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Is it beautiful?

521
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Okay.

522
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Today, the groom is getting married.

523
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
What do you want to say?

524
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I feel like I'm marrying my daughter.

525
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm so happy.

526
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You must be a little sad.

527
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Are you happy?

528
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Of course I'm happy.

529
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
After all, I'm such a woman.

530
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Right?

531
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Remind Mengmeng

532
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
that women should be economically independent.

533
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
The economic power

534
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
must be in her hands.

535
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I originally thought

536
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I would be very happy today.

537
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,000
But I'm a little sad.

538
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Do you miss Fang Ya'en?

539
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,000
It feels sweet.

540
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I wish her happiness.

541
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I wish you two a happy life.

542
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I wish you two a happy life.

543
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
My brother has always been a good man.

544
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm relieved.

545
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
The suggestion is

546
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
that we should give each other space.

547
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Then give birth to more children.

548
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Give birth to more children.

549
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'll bring you.

550
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'll bring you the drum.

551
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I want to tell Fang Ya'en

552
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
to think about it.

553
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
But I still feel a little burdened.

554
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I think it's better to be friends.

555
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But I don't know what the future will be.

556
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I didn't say it.

557
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I don't know what to say.

558
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Brother Kai, thank you.

559
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I think you play with me every day.

560
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
I'm very happy.

561
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Right.

562
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
When I heard grandma say that today,

563
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I suddenly felt that

564
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I don't want to have regrets in my life.

565
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I want to be a very brave person.

566
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
So I decided to retake college.

567
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Then continue to do my music.

568
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Do you still want to play the drum?

569
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Not necessarily.

570
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Gouzi, don't be sad.

571
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You still have me.

572
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Husband.

573
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
What's wrong?

574
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
When can you fix the door of your bathroom?

575
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
I'm really inconvenient.

576
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I'll fix it tomorrow.

577
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I forgot.

578
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
You said it.

579
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
What are you looking at?

580
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I'm looking at the photos.

581
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
My wife is really beautiful.

582
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You just know it.

583
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Red face.

584
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
What face?

585
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
This backpack is too red.

586
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Hard shot.

587
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I didn't expect my sister's face to be so thick.

588
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
And when your face is red.

589
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
When is my face thick?

590
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
What do you mean?

591
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
My husband is so handsome.

592
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I'll give you something.

593
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What?

594
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Open it.

595
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
The puzzle I hid?

596
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
The puzzle?

597
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
Why?

598
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I always thought.

599
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
I was the puzzle that was missing.

600
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Until I met you.

601
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I'm complete.

602
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Really?

603
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You didn't have feelings for other girls before.

604
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
When you were young.

605
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
You didn't have feelings for other girls before.

606
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Maybe.

607
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
But if you say.

608
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I didn't have feelings for other girls before.

609
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Really?

610
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Then you didn't think about chasing other girls.

611
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Or let other girls be your girlfriends.

612
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Like us now.

613
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I swear.

614
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I only have feelings for you.

615
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Your lips are getting sweeter.

616
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
No.

617
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Actually that day at the beach.

618
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
You asked me for WeChat.

619
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
After I came back, I dreamed about you.

620
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I know.

621
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
You know?

622
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
How could you know?

623
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Why can't I know?

624
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Do you remember the recording of the safe?

625
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
I lost it.

626
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
You still don't believe it?

627
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I found it.

628
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I heard everything you said to me on New Year's Eve.

629
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
You.

630
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You heard everything.

631
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Li Jinyu.

632
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,000
If you had sent me that message.

633
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
We wouldn't have to go through all this.

634
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Luckily.

635
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
I didn't lose you.

636
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Why?

637
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Someone always said I was not active.

638
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Now I'm married and a husband.

639
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
I have to make some progress.

640
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm sorry.

641
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I'm sorry.

642
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'm sorry.

643
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,000
I'm sorry.

644
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
I'm sorry.

645
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
I'm sorry.

646
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
We're here.

647
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Wake up, Jinyu.

648
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Don't fall asleep.

649
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I can't wake you up.

650
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,440
kiemu

651
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,760
Is it good?

652
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,720
Thank you very much

653
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
You said he was so heavy

654
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,720
and he was carried up

655
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,200
Zhijie

656
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,320
It's okay

657
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,720
He's not as heavy as me

658
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,560
But he will be heavier and heavier in the future

659
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,480
He can be a little more energetic

660
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:36,840
All right

661
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,200
I don't dare to trouble you

662
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,680
Now you are the big boss

663
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,600
and you have the project of the Haran Port

664
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,560
You will be in trouble

665
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,560
I won't cause you any trouble

666
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,480
How can I cause trouble?

667
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,280
Nothing is more important than you and Jia Yu

668
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:50,120
It's not important

669
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,760
You see, being the big boss is different

670
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,680
Your EQ has been raised

671
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,200
All right

672
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,480
In the future

673
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,960
you and your Jia Yu brothers

674
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,280
will be together

675
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,600
Fang Yang

676
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,800
When will you stop pretending?

677
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,440
When?

678
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Who is pretending?

679
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,440
You only call me big name

680
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,240
No big no small

681
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
Go back

682
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:19,960
Really

683
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,920
You are going to attend the night-dress wedding

684
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,400
I think you are pretending

685
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:23,960
I am serious

686
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,440
I know you are divorced

687
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:30,000
I am embarrassed to say it

688
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,880
Then don't say it

689
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,080
I want to say it

690
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,160
Fang Yang

691
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,000
I like you

692
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,440
I don't want to be your brother forever

693
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,640
I know you are in some trouble now

694
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,320
You beat my mom since you were a child

695
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,360
I just taught me

696
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
But now I don't know what's wrong with me

697
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,960
I just can't control my love for you

698
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
When I think of the life-saving grace

699
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,160
What life-saving grace?

700
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,360
I tell you

701
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,000
At the back of the school

702
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,040
a child was almost killed

703
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,160
You saved him

704
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,840
I am that child

705
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,880
I didn't think about it seriously before

706
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,040
But when I know you saved me

707
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:18,160
I will take it seriously

708
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,040
Pei Kai

709
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,000
We are not suitable

710
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,320
Why not suitable?

711
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
What you want now

712
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,320
is a peaceful life

713
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,520
and a life full of love

714
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,800
I want to live with you

715
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,560
I have no ambition

716
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
I want to stay in Ningcui for a lifetime

717
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,640
I will exercise in the morning

718
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,800
Go to the vegetable market to buy food

719
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,200
and cook at home

720
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,760
After dinner

721
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,000
I will go to the beach

722
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,280
and eat

723
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,960
Then when the rain is stronger

724
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,760
we will go to our own home

725
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,520
Pei Kai, now I...

726
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,440
I know what you want to say

727
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,600
We just got divorced

728
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,160
I don't want to have new feelings

729
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
But it's okay

730
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,120
I am waiting for you

731
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,880
I have been waiting for you

732
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,400
I really like you

733
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,120
Don't reject me so soon

734
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,120
Think about what I said

735
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,200
I have to go now

736
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:50,280
Where should I go?

737
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,360
How to avoid

738
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:54,360
the time when we were together

739
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,640
How can we chat here?

740
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
Nothing is more important than you and Jiayu

741
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,880
You didn't divorce me before

742
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,880
I am embarrassed to say that

743
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,920
I am afraid to disturb you

744
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,000
Then don't say it

745
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
I want to say

746
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
Fang Yang

747
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
I want to say

748
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,200
I want to say

749
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,200
I want to say

750
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,200
I want to say

751
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,200
I want to say

752
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
I want to say

753
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,200
I want to say

754
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
I want to say

755
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,200
I want to say

756
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
I like you

757
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,800
I don't have any ambition

758
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,400
I want to stay in Ningcui for a lifetime

759
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,800
I will exercise in the morning

760
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,120
Go to buy food

761
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,000
Go home to cook

762
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:35,200
After dinner, I will go to the beach to walk

763
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,680
and have a little talk

764
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,000
Then when Jiayu gets older

765
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,200
we will go to eat home

766
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,200
Don't reject me so quickly

767
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,200
Think about what I said

768
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I promise

769
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,520
I will wait for you

770
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,200
Slow down

771
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,520
I know it's hospitalization

772
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
I don't know

773
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
I thought I was moving

774
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,520
It's better to wear more than less

775
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I have to go back to pick it up

776
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
OK, OK, OK

777
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Anyway, what I said now is useless

778
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,520
Here you are

779
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,520
Come on, change your slippers

780
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,520
I have packed the things for you

781
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,520
Then put the food in the cabinet

782
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,520
And

783
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,520
the rest

784
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,520
OK, OK

785
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,520
I know the hospital better than you

786
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,520
You and Meng are busy

787
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
Well

788
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
You and Meng

789
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,520
Meng will go back to work

790
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,520
You are so annoying

791
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,520
I just got married

792
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,520
You think I'm not good at it?

793
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
You don't know the distance is beautiful

794
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,520
You stay together every day

795
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,520
Look at the flowers

796
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Of course you are busy

797
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,520
OK

798
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Go

799
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
Something happened to Mr. Hanan

800
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,520
Come to the company to sign

801
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Hurry up

802
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Listen, all the staff are here for money

803
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,520
Hurry up

804
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,520
We have something to do in the company

805
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,520
We are leaving

806
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,520
Here we are, we are leaving

807
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,520
Bye

808
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
Put the food in the cabinet

809
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
OK

810
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,520
Bye

811
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,520
Do you want to eat?

812
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,520
Take my son

813
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Give us a explanation

814
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,520
You are a black-haired monk

815
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,520
Give us an explanation

816
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,520
Give us an explanation

817
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:38,520
You are a black-haired monk

818
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,520
We are going up

819
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,520
You are so annoying

820
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,520
Stop it

821
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Stop it

822
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:43,520
Listen

823
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,520
There was a problem with the Hai Lan Sect

824
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,520
They had a black-haired financing

825
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,520
Now they are changing materials

826
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
We must give an explanation today

827
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,520
Yes

828
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Give us an explanation

829
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,520
We are going up

830
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,520
I think

831
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,520
You are getting the project

832
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
with illegal means

833
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,520
Especially to

834
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,520
see our people

835
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Today

836
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,520
You can't work without an explanation

837
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,520
You can't work

838
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:07,520
We are going up

839
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,520
We are going up

840
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,520
We are going up

841
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:10,520
We are going up

842
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
We are going up

843
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
What's going on?

844
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,520
What's going on?

845
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,520
They robbed us in the morning

846
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,520
They are trying to get us

847
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,520
I don't know who

848
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,520
is going to tell the police

849
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,520
about the Hai Lan Sect

850
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,520
I am so angry

851
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
I want to ask for an explanation

852
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,520
They are coming

853
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,520
They are coming

854
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,520
They are coming

855
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
They are coming

856
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:25,520
They are coming

857
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Stop it

858
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,520
Calm down

859
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Calm down

860
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
You can't talk

861
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,520
Calm down

862
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,520
Calm down

863
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:36,520
You are here

864
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
Someone told you

865
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,520
Hai Lan Sect

866
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,520
is suspected of using illegal materials

867
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,520
and leading to human trafficking

868
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
Do you need to cooperate with us?

869
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,520
Come with me

870
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
No problem

871
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,520
No, Chen

872
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,520
You haven't figured it out

873
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,520
You can't take them away

874
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,520
What?

875
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,520
You want to come with me?

876
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Look

877
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Officer Chen

878
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
We didn't use illegal materials

879
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,520
Is there any misunderstanding?

880
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:57,520
Yes

881
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:58,520
If there is nothing wrong

882
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
we won't do anything to them

883
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,520
Don't worry

884
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
I will come back

885
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,520
as soon as I go to

886
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,520
the Hai Lan Sect

887
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
Don't worry

888
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,520
But

889
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Take care of yourself

890
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,520
and your grandma

891
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Let's go

892
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
What should we do

893
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:18,520
if we take them away?

894
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
What should we do?

895
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Okay

896
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,520
The police have started

897
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,520
to investigate

898
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,520
Let's go

899
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,520
We will tell you

900
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
the result of the first-class

901
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Let's go

902
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,520
We are waiting for you

903
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,520
Yes

904
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,520
We are waiting for you

905
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,520
We are waiting for you

906
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,520
We are waiting for you

907
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,520
We are waiting for you

908
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Let's go

909
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,520
We are waiting for you

910
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
We are waiting for you

911
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
We are waiting for you

912
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,520
We are waiting for you

913
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:40,520
We are waiting for you

914
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,520
Let's go back to work

915
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,520
Don't look

916
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,520
Okay

917
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,520
Thank you

918
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,520
How is your worker?

919
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,520
She is fine

920
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,520
Don't worry

921
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
There is something wrong

922
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,520
We can't

923
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,520
use illegal materials

924
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,520
All construction plans

925
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,520
and architectural design

926
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,520
are reviewed by each department

927
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,520
Now when something happens

928
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,520
the public opinion is different

929
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
So you mean

930
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:03,520
someone is doing something on purpose

931
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,520
Is it possible?

932
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,520
Hello?

933
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,520
Have you seen the news?

934
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Li Lingbai is going to have a press conference tomorrow

935
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,520
What?

936
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,520
What's wrong?

937
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
Li Lingbai is going to have a press conference

938
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,520
We need to find out

939
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,520
the time before the press conference

940
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,520
Go to the construction site

941
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,520
Go

942
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Go

943
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,520
It's different from the contract

944
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,520
material specifications

945
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
Did someone change the materials?

946
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,520
I think so

947
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,520
When did you come last time?

948
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,520
I'll go and check the surveillance of this area

949
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Zhou Yu

950
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,520
Zhou Yu

951
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Stop

952
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,520
Stop

953
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,520
Zhou Yu

954
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,520
What are you doing here?

955
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
I tell you

956
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:02,520
I tell you

957
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,520
I will make you pay

958
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,520
I have the evidence to prove your illegal materials

959
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,520
What evidence?

960
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,520
My evidence

961
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,520
You are so stubborn

962
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
What evidence?

963
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,520
Come on

964
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,520
Look

965
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
Did you see it clearly?

966
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
Thieves are calling for thieves

967
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,520
Thieves are calling for thieves

968
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
Do you have any good people in Haihai Group?

969
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,520
You are all with Wang Xingte

970
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,520
You are all cheaters

971
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,520
You are all bad guys

972
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,520
Go away

973
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,520
What are you talking about?

974
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,520
You go back first

975
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,520
I'll talk to him

976
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Stop

977
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,520
Meixiao

978
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I want all the surveillance videos of Hai Lan Group

979
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,520
All of them

980
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,520
Go

981
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,520
Grandma

982
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,520
Mom

983
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
Why didn't Bartol answer the phone?

984
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,520
Is there something wrong?

985
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,520
I can't get through

986
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,520
I think he is too busy with overtime

987
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,520
It's okay

988
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,520
What's wrong with my company?

989
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
He didn't even have time to answer the phone

990
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,520
He is working overtime

991
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
You two must have a good meal

992
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Don't worry

993
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,520
You should rest early

994
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,520
Then we'll go to see you when we are done

995
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,520
Okay?

996
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
No need to accompany me

997
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,520
Let him have time to accompany you

998
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,520
You are still a bride

999
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I'll go to sleep

1000
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,520
Okay

1001
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,520
Then you should sleep early

1002
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,520
Okay, I hang up

1003
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,520
Be good

1004
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
What's wrong?

1005
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,520
Did you notice anything?

1006
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,520
I didn't notice it now

1007
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
It's not sure if I can take it off

1008
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,520
You've been watching for so long

1009
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Take a rest

1010
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,520
I think we should

1011
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,520
think of other ways

1012
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,520
There is no progress

1013
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,520
I'll look it up

1014
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,520
Look at this video

1015
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,520
This is taken with Lin Yangyang

1016
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
to the construction site

1017
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
The equipment at this time is all returned

1018
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
It's completely different from the construction site now

1019
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,520
And this

1020
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
This video was replaced during this period.

1021
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,920
That's right.

1022
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,600
Now it depends on whether the adults

1023
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,880
can catch Zhou Yu or not.

1024
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,320
How is it?

1025
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,120
Did you catch him?

1026
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,120
Yes, I did.

1027
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:42,760
And then?

1028
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,600
Actually, Zhou Yu

1029
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,800
doesn't want to

1030
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,120
help Li Jing Yu to get married.

1031
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,200
He

1032
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,760
hates Hailang Port since he was a kid.

1033
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,520
He wants to close the Hailang Port.

1034
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,760
But without Zhou Yu's words,

1035
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,360
that video is useless.

1036
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,280
Zhou Yu

1037
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,160
Zhou Yu

1038
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,160
Zhou Yu

1039
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,920
Don't let me go back.

1040
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,680
Come here.

1041
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,320
Stand here.

1042
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,960
Move.

1043
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,600
Why did you run?

1044
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,240
You always run.

1045
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,320
You always run away from me.

1046
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,360
You will fall down again later.

1047
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,520
Why are you here again?

1048
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,040
I've told you many times.

1049
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,840
I won't help others with the team.

1050
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,440
I've told you many times.

1051
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:32,960
It has nothing to do with Li Jin Yu

1052
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,320
We didn't do it

1053
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,840
If you don't stand up now

1054
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,680
you are helping the bad guys, you know?

1055
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,440
Zhou Yu

1056
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,600
I came for Li Jin Yu

1057
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,560
But I don't want you to lie

1058
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
I just hope you can tell the truth

1059
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,600
As for the truth

1060
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,840
we will have a judgment

1061
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:56,520
In this welfare home

1062
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,040
these kids like you very much

1063
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,000
They think you are a good brother and a good role model

1064
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,360
But if you don't say anything now

1065
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,520
you may cover up a bad guy

1066
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,160
and frame a good guy

1067
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,480
This is not the result you want to see now

1068
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,600
Isn't it?

1069
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,120
Think about it

1070
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,400
Dad is going to start

1071
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:22,840
Sit down

1072
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,920
Think about it

1073
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,280
Su 120

1074
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,280
�

1075
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:00,040
Hurry up!

1076
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,040
Tell us!

1077
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,520
We'll have to trouble you

1078
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,040
to approve our joint statement later.

1079
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:05,040
We'll pay you together!

1080
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,040
It's okay.

1081
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:08,040
As long as you can help us get to the end,

1082
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,040
we'll leave.

1083
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,040
Liang Bingzhang is on his way.

1084
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,040
How's our new statement?

1085
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,040
It's safe.

1086
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,040
We'll watch him do his job.

1087
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,040
It's all right!

1088
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,040
Hurry up!

1089
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,040
Hurry up!

1090
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,040
Don't leave!

1091
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,040
Don't leave!

1092
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,040
Don't leave!

1093
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
Hurry up!

1094
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,040
Hurry up!

1095
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:34,040
From what we saw last year

1096
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:41,040
a root of more than Stewart�

1097
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,040
our company will be opened from next week

1098
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,040
Hello, everyone.

1099
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,040
This is Li Linbai.

1100
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,040
Tomorrow is the opening of WeChina product.

1101
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,040
I never thought I would meet everyone

1102
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,640
to meet you in this way.

1103
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,960
As the chairman of Hanhai Group,

1104
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,800
I would like to apologize

1105
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,080
to you

1106
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,160
for the collapse of the second phase of the Hailangang project.

1107
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,520
The person in charge of this project

1108
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,280
is my eldest son, Li Jin Yu.

1109
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,080
Our Hanhai Group

1110
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,720
will take full responsibility.

1111
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:25,000
I will also deal with Li Jin Yu

1112
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:29,800
and secretly bomb the position of heads.

1113
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,040
You, I saw you, I thought of you

1114
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:08,040
I heard any news of you

1115
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:14,040
The love that was raised in my heart

1116
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,040
It occupies my thoughts

1117
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,040
Where should I go?

1118
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:33,040
How should I avoid those memories about you?

1119
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:37,040
I'm so addicted to you

1120
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,040
I can't stop thinking about you

1121
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:46,040
I'm so addicted to you

1122
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,040
I can't stop thinking about you

1123
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,040
I'm silent

1124
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,040
I put the flowers in the back garden

1125
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:06,040
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

1126
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:10,040
I pretend to be determined

1127
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,040
But I'm still obsessed with the origin

1128
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,040
The most perfect lie

1129
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,040
Deceives yourself

1130
00:44:24,040 --> 00:44:30,040
If we love, let go, let us lose the relationship

1131
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:36,040
Why is it that the moment I cry

1132
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,040
The stars are still lingering
