00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the remaining memories that suddenly burn and scatter

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If the world can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The heart that can't be hidden

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When the breath gradually disappears

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Have all I have

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Assuming there is still if

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The promise will be kept

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that there is my dream

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You said you wouldn't drive

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Are you still lying to me?

19
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I have the surveillance video

20
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will give it to you

21
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
The video of the club

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Has something to do with Wang Xing Sheng and Li Lin Bai

23
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And Wang Xing Sheng is missing

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want you to investigate any further

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm afraid Li Lin Bai will do something to you

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What about the case of my mother's suicide?

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You are the witness, right?

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I knew it, back then

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I only saw Wang Xing Sheng car's license plate

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why didn't you search?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I could only find it

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Two holes under the middle

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Pull the interpter

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
And drag it down

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Youhh

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then why did you turn around?

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
At that time, Li Ningbai

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
gave her an unidentified witness

39
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It happened to be raining heavily

40
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
So I suspected that I was mistaken

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I really don't know if I should believe it

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Ye Meng

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I have lost my dad

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I don't want to lose you again

45
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Jin Yuan, stop the car

46
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Jin Yuan, stop the car

47
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Dad

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I have a question

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Ask

50
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Am I

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
not your biological son?

52
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
So you knew I wasn't your son

53
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You kept it from me

54
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

55
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I always thought you were my child

56
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But I'm not

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And my biological father

58
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Who is he?

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Why hasn't he appeared in so many years?

60
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
My mom

61
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
She always hates me so much

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Is it because of that person?

63
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Jin Xu, don't ask about this

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You just need to know that I'm your dad

65
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I just want to know the truth

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Jin Xu, be careful

67
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Jin Xu

68
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I've been thinking

69
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
If I had the ability

70
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
To protect her

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Would the result be different?

72
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Jin Xu

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Jin Xu

74
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Jin Xu

75
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Jin Xu

76
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Jin Xu, be careful

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Jin Xu

78
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Jin Xu

79
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Jin Xu

80
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Be careful

81
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Jin Xu

82
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Jin Xu

83
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Jin Xu

84
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Jin Xu

85
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Be careful

86
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Be careful

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Be careful

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Be careful

89
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Jin Xu

90
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Jin Xu

91
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Jin Xu

92
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Jin Xu

93
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Dad, let's go

94
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Come with me

95
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Come out

96
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Jin Xu, leave me alone

97
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Leave me alone

98
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Dad

99
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I know

100
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I've hidden a lot from you

101
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
The way to protect you is very extreme

102
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
But

103
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I've never liked anyone

104
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is the first time

105
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So I'm really scared

106
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't want to lose my love again

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm so scared

108
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Don't drive

109
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Your car is not as good as mine

110
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Get off

111
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm sorry

112
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm sorry

113
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I'm sorry

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'm sorry

115
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'm sorry

116
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm sorry

117
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry

118
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm sorry

120
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'm sorry

121
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm sorry

122
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry

123
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I'm sorry

124
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sorry

125
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry

126
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm sorry

127
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I'm so sorry

128
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm sorry

129
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Your car is too late

130
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sorry

131
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Jin Xu

132
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Pei Tian

133
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Then you are

134
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,320
Mr. Fu, glad to see you.

135
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,720
This is the first time being on the foreign leadership speech.

136
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,280
Besides, the high retour that will be supported by this team

137
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,720
is aniya.

138
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,540
I hope TrangETH STOPS

139
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,420
by veins over median course.

140
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,500
Always be be together

141
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,020
What a genius

142
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:33,580
Look at it

143
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:34,740
The pink flowers

144
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,740
shall haul out more

145
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:36,900
Move just a little bit

146
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,260
LOA1

147
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,260
we should modify it

148
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,100
Motivate it

149
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,300
where I'm going

150
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:54,900
Dong

151
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:55,980
Wait

152
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,540
What?

153
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:56,860
Huh?

154
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,200
It's pretend

155
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,860
Withdraw

156
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,940
Pretend what?

157
00:12:58,980 --> 00:12:59,620
What's with me?

158
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,220
No

159
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,740
Li Jinyu was killed on the way

160
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,300
I called him to join the team

161
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,580
Are you crazy?

162
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,500
Find a new room

163
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,820
and set up the scene, understand?

164
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,100
I told you

165
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,940
I won't confess here

166
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,220
It's not easy to confess

167
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:11,620
Do you understand?

168
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:13,140
I understand

169
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,420
I'll leave first

170
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:15,860
Thank you

171
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,580
Hurry up

172
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,460
I'll go first

173
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:23,300
I'm angry

174
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,300
Li Jinyu

175
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:39,860
Wait

176
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm competing with him

177
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,340
Why are you driving?

178
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,220
I'm a little bit jealous

179
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,180
seeing you driving

180
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,780
Congratulations, Mr. Gou

181
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:47,580
You won the competition

182
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,220
Let's go

183
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,580
The company's team is full

184
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,820
Why are you following me?

185
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,780
Our company's internal team

186
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,420
What?

187
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,220
You don't welcome me?

188
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,900
You're all here

189
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,340
Mr. Gou

190
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,820
Xiao'an did well today

191
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,260
I think you two should learn from him

192
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,780
Don't lose your temper

193
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,980
OK

194
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:21,380
You're still so brave

195
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,260
Don't worry

196
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,060
Drink more today

197
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:23,380
OK

198
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,780
I have something to do with Mr. Gou

199
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,100
You two talk first

200
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:26,660
OK

201
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,300
I'll talk to you later

202
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,340
Wait for you, Mr. Gou

203
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,220
I'll be back

204
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,980
I'm ready

205
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,020
Where is he?

206
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,540
Come on

207
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,180
Hello

208
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,340
It's almost done

209
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,020
You can leave now

210
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:43,660
Thank you

211
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,660
Thank you

212
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,460
You're welcome

213
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,220
Come on

214
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,180
How is it?

215
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,620
How is it?

216
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,420
Romantic or not?

217
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:55,900
Look at this

218
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,420
To love and to be a little warrior

219
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,380
To be your own sun

220
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,140
You made it?

221
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:03,900
I'm a playboy

222
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,900
I told you, bro

223
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,780
Only I can make this

224
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
I can't find another one

225
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,140
Face to face

226
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,820
What is this?

227
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,540
So ugly

228
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:17,900
Who brought it?

229
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,260
Is it a head?

230
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
Is it a pervert?

231
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,660
If you are moving

232
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,340
I brought this

233
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,420
Real close your mouth

234
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,420
To this leave is not good

235
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,460
So narcissistic

236
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,140
Tell me

237
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,500
I have to record this

238
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,660
What do you know?

239
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,980
When I'm with Ye Meng

240
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,820
these are our beautiful memories

241
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,660
Is it appropriate?

242
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,420
Ye Meng hasn't divorced yet

243
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,900
Will you be punished for doing this?

244
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:12,460
Let me tell you this

245
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,980
Cheng Anran

246
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,980
is a bastard who wants to see money

247
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,500
I asked him to divorce Ye Meng

248
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,340
He dared to ask me for 5 million

249
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,620
5 million

250
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,580
He's crazy

251
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,380
Are you really a little uncle?

252
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,820
Right?

253
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,660
So I'm normal to marry him

254
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,580
He also sold me 250

255
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,620
Are you crazy?

256
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,260
Too much

257
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,340
Ye Meng is now in the dark

258
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,700
Can't see his face

259
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,060
So I'm going to record this video

260
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:38,940
Send it to his husband

261
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,140
Let him realize the reality

262
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,340
Give up early

263
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,540
Right?

264
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,260
You have to send it to her husband

265
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,940
You are so bad

266
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,180
No, bad?

267
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,180
Do you want the bonus?

268
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,180
Put it here

269
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,100
Put it here

270
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
I'll help you study it now

271
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,900
Let's connect it

272
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,220
And

273
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,180
Remember to

274
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,900
vent your anger later

275
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,380
You have eyes

276
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,340
Let's go

277
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,220
Give me a minute

278
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,180
Ye Meng

279
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,220
Ye Meng

280
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,220
You see the sea so clear

281
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,460
Just like my love for you

282
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,100
So pure

283
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,220
So simple

284
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,140
No flaws

285
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,980
I love you

286
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,140
I love you

287
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,300
Where has Vayise lost?

288
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:58,940
Must be working with Lau

289
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,660
Wang Kadi

290
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:17,840
Qing from Nailcoating

291
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,460
Nobody is going to be in my hospital

292
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,340
I think we'll just spend this moment

293
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,180
at the hospital

294
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,680
to dialogue with each other

295
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,000
For that,

296
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
we still need to

297
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,500
have a peaceful talk

298
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,080
in such cold Tiananmen

299
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:36,480
Anyway,

300
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,620
Many people

301
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,660
are involved in antagonism

302
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,820
Ng Lai�ing

303
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,600
is the manager

304
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I'm a little uncomfortable in the big house

305
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,600
No, no, no

306
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Of course

307
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
No, no, no

308
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
No, no, no

309
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
No, no, no

310
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,600
No, no, no

311
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
No, no, no

312
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Can play, right?

313
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Can play

314
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,600
I love to play

315
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Want to play, want to play

316
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,600
OK, OK

317
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Let's see

318
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,600
Then who will come first

319
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,600
Mr. Gou

320
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
You go first

321
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,600
it is good

322
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,600
Let me make an example

323
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
I'm sorry

324
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I'm sorry

325
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,600
OK

326
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Just take a random one

327
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Take a random one

328
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Let me see

329
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,600
It's a little too much

330
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,600
It's like this

331
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Tai Mingxiao

332
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,600
is Gou Kai's capable general

333
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,600
Very favored

334
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,600
But Ye Meng came these days

335
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,600
You suddenly lost favor

336
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,600
Mr. Gou, do you like Ye Meng?

337
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
What's the problem?

338
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
What's the problem?

339
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,600
Is there such a problem?

340
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Don't make up nonsense

341
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,600
Can it be

342
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Can it be

343
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Yes, just say it directly, right?

344
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Yes

345
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,600
Yes

346
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,600
Yes, OK

347
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
This Mingxiao usually doesn't lie

348
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,600
OK, I'll answer it, OK?

349
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,600
like

350
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Don't you like it?

351
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,600
like

352
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
Who doesn't like our boss?

353
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,600
I like it

354
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,600
As a boss

355
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
The stronger the ability, the more normal it is to like someone

356
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,600
Next

357
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,600
Then the

358
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
I'll wait

359
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
I'll go first

360
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
OK

361
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
I'll go first

362
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
I'll go first

363
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,600
First

364
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Do you support office romance?

365
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
This is definitely not OK

366
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Our company is so traditional

367
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,600
support

368
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,600
As long as I don't work

369
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,600
Why do you still support it?

370
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,600
Don't forget

371
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,600
Do you have someone you like?

372
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,600
Who?

373
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,600
Mr. Li, who do you like?

374
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Who?

375
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,600
Who?

376
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,600
Ye Xingli

377
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Like Ye Meng

378
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,600
Go to the bathroom

379
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,600
Go to the bathroom

380
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,600
I'm done answering

381
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,600
Next one is yours

382
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,600
You talk like you're in a big breath

383
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,600
I'm scared

384
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
Ye Meng

385
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,600
This one

386
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,600
Free question

387
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,600
I'll ask one

388
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,600
I'll ask one

389
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,600
Ye Meng

390
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,600
You are Mr. Gou's subordinate

391
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,600
And Li Jinyu's partner

392
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
If there is a cooperation

393
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,600
I have to let you choose one of them

394
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,600
Who do you choose?

395
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,600
I choose

396
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,600
I choose Mr. Gou

397
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,600
I'm a little upset

398
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,600
I said it

399
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,600
You are very good

400
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,600
But if you are talking about your subordinate

401
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,600
you should be more tolerant

402
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,600
I'll go out

403
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:37,600
I'll go out

404
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Where are you going?

405
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,600
To the bathroom

406
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,600
Can I go with you?

407
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,600
Yes

408
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,600
You go to the room downstairs

409
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,600
There is no one in the bathroom

410
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,600
The room is so cold

411
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,600
Is the window not hot?

412
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Take it off

413
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,600
I want to play

414
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,600
Xiaoling, you can host

415
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,600
Ok

416
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,600
Go on, go on

417
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,600
Mr. Li, hello

418
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,600
Boss, I play that game

419
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,600
It's just our new effect

420
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,600
New effect

421
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,600
You don't even choose your husband

422
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,600
He is really good

423
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:41,600
Wrong

424
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,600
He really put a lot of effort

425
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,600
to prepare the flower and the balloon

426
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,600
and confess to you

427
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,600
I swear to you

428
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,600
I definitely didn't know in advance

429
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,600
And

430
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
I haven't forgiven you completely

431
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,600
Can you forgive me now?

432
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,600
I'm afraid others will see

433
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,600
Don't you think it's more exciting?

434
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,600
Gao Kai

435
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Sinful

436
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,600
What happened?

437
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,600
I also thought that

438
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,600
the way Gao Kai looked at you

439
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,600
was so strange

440
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
I thought you were

441
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
a little bit strange

442
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,600
I also thought that

443
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,600
the way Gao Kai looked at you

444
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,600
I wanted to take out his eyes

445
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,600
You are so stubborn

446
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
What are you competing with him?

447
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,600
I can leave with you anytime

448
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,600
Bro, I want to kill myself

449
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,600
I forgot

450
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:35,600
Wait a minute

451
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,600
Wait a minute

452
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Wait a minute

453
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Wait a minute

454
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
Wait a minute

455
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,600
Wait a minute

456
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,600
Wait a minute

457
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,600
Wait a minute

458
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,600
Wait a minute

459
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,600
Wait a minute

460
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,600
Wait a minute

461
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Wait a minute

462
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:03,600
Wait a minute

463
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,600
Wait a minute

464
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,600
Wait a minute

465
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,600
Wait a minute

466
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Wait a minute

467
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,600
Gao, don't

468
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,600
Are you sick?

469
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,600
You can't go in

470
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,600
Your dad is not ready yet

471
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,600
I saw Ye Meng go in

472
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,600
You bastard

473
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,600
I have something very important

474
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
to tell you

475
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,600
Can we still be

476
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,600
brothers in the future?

477
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,600
I just want to persuade you

478
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Or the confession today

479
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,600
will be considered

480
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,600
You are getting married

481
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
It's not good

482
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,600
Right?

483
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
You also like Ye Meng, right?

484
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Why do I compete with you?

485
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
You?

486
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,600
No, no, no

487
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,600
Anyway, I'm doing this for your good

488
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,600
If you don't like me, get out of here

489
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,600
I'm done with you

490
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Bastard

491
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,600
Listen to me

492
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Don't go

493
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,600
Bastard

494
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,600
Don't go

495
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Go home

496
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,600
Don't go

497
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
Don't go

498
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,600
Don't go

499
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:29,600
Don't go

500
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,600
Don't go

501
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
Don't go

502
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
Don't go

503
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Where is he?

504
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,600
He's gone

505
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,600
I told you

506
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,600
I'm not ready

507
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,600
No

508
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
He just went into the room

509
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
He said he had something urgent

510
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,600
and left

511
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
He's definitely not

512
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
leaving with Li Jin

513
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,600
I swear

514
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
I swear

515
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
What are you doing here?

516
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,600
I'm checking your bag

517
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,600
I'm here

518
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I'm here

519
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,600
The surveillance camera is broken

520
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
I didn't record it

521
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,600
Did you hide something from me?

522
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,600
No

523
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
No?

524
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,600
No

525
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,600
I'm serious

526
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,600
Let me see

527
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,600
The camera is broken

528
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,600
Where?

529
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,600
Isn't it good?

530
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,600
What do you mean?

531
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
It's broken

532
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,600
It's broken

533
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,600
Little thing

534
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,600
Come here

535
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Come here

536
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
Don't be angry

537
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,600
Listen to me

538
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,600
Don't be angry

539
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Listen to me

540
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
Listen to me

541
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,600
I'm just thinking

542
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Listen to me

543
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,600
It's not the right time to confess

544
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
It's not the right time

545
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,600
I'm ready

546
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
Tell me it's not the right time

547
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,600
I'm on your side

548
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Really?

549
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
But think about it

550
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,600
Even if Ye Meng's husband

551
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,600
is in the scene

552
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,600
they are not divorced

553
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,600
You don't know him

554
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,600
or his husband

555
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
How do you get along?

556
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,600
How do you get along?

557
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,600
How do you get along?

558
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,600
You are

559
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,600
a family of many people

560
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
Are you kidding me?

561
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
I'll see if I can fix it

562
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,600
I broke my hand

563
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,600
You don't believe me?

564
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,600
Confession is only once

565
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
You must focus on it

566
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
Now the enemy is obvious

567
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
You must go deep into the enemy

568
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,600
and dig deep from the inside

569
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,600
Don't let Ye Meng think

570
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,600
that we are not good-natured

571
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,600
and that we have done everything

572
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,600
Do you understand?

573
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,600
I'm listening to you

574
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,600
I'll go and find out

575
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,600
what's going on with her husband

576
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
When I come back

577
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,600
Stop

578
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,600
Move

579
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,600
Let's go and have a look

580
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Where is your boss?

581
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,600
The one on the sofa

582
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,600
The one in white pants

583
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,600
Yes, I need to find a good designer

584
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,600
Are you Ye Meng's husband?

585
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,600
Why is it endless?

586
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,600
Hello, I'm Ye Meng's friend

587
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,600
Pei Mingxiao

588
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,600
He doesn't want to get married

589
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,600
I just want to say hello to you

590
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,600
Sit down

591
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
Let's talk while drinking

592
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,600
Your bar is quite big

593
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,600
Business is good

594
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,600
You are usually very busy

595
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
I'll be honest

596
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
I said last time

597
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,600
At least two million

598
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,600
Not even one less

599
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,600
I am a very low-key person

600
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,600
What two million and fifty thousand?

601
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,600
I didn't talk about money with you

602
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,600
I just want to talk to you

603
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,600
about Ye Meng's emotional problem

604
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,600
You don't even pay now

605
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Just talk

606
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
That's impossible

607
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,600
I will never leave Ye Meng

608
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,600
I don't need to think about it

609
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
That's right, buddy

610
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,600
Then you can't just sit there

611
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,600
You have to be with her

612
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:25,600
She doesn't need me to be with her

613
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
No, buddy

614
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,600
She doesn't need you to be with her

615
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,600
I tell you, women

616
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,600
are really the same as men

617
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,600
You have to control her

618
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,600
You can't let her be too free

619
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,600
Especially like Ye Meng

620
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,600
She is pretty

621
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
I think she has a lot of male friends

622
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,600
If you don't look at her

623
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,600
Don't worry

624
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,600
Don't worry

625
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,600
I know her best

626
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,600
I know her best

627
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,600
Buddy, you

628
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,600
You have green grass on your head

629
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,600
You know her

630
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,600
What did you say?

631
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,600
I know her best

632
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,600
I know her best

633
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,600
I know her best

634
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,600
No

635
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I mean

636
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,600
You know her

637
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,600
But you don't know

638
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,600
the people around her

639
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,600
What if you meet that

640
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,600
very unpractical

641
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,600
like the ones who stick up

642
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,600
and press your feet

643
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Don't you pay attention?

644
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,600
What's the dog bite?

645
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,600
What dog bite?

646
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,600
Didn't you just say

647
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,600
stick to you

648
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,600
and scratch your feet

649
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,600
Isn't this a dog bite?

650
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
And speaking of

651
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
Ye Meng doesn't like her

652
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
If she finds out

653
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,600
this dog bite

654
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,600
I will tell her name

655
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,600
and come here

656
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Come on, cheers

657
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,600
Not Gao Kai

658
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,600
I didn't say Gao Kai

659
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,600
Then what new characters

660
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
appeared?

661
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,600
I

662
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,600
Buddy

663
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,600
This time

664
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,600
she is more difficult than Gao Kai

665
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,600
She is more difficult

666
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,600
than her

667
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,600
I can see her

668
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,600
and feel her heart

669
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,600
She is the king of four

670
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,600
Do you know Hainan and Nangang?

671
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,600
She has a new person in charge

672
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,600
Li Jin Yu, the big company

673
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:08,600
of the Hanhai Group

674
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,600
Do you know?

675
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,600
Li Jin Yu

676
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Yes, that's her

677
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I thought you were talking about

678
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
a friend

679
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,600
Buddy

680
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,600
The more you are careful

681
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:22,600
the more you are careful

682
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
No, buddy

683
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,600
I know you mean well

684
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:27,600
But Li Jin Yu is fine

685
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,600
We are not different from you and me

686
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,600
Buddy, you

687
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,600
You have such a big scale

688
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,600
What does this have to do with scale?

689
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,600
You have to open your gap

690
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,600
Open the gap

691
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,600
If you have nothing to do

692
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,600
you worry more

693
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,600
You will

694
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,600
You will have Boss Gao

695
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,600
You worry about her

696
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,600
The gap is quite big

697
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,600
Crazy

698
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
The world is too crazy

699
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,600
Ye Meng is so down

700
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,600
Why did I come to you?

701
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,600
What are you talking about?

702
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
If you are free

703
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,600
I will go to do something else

704
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,600
Well

705
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,600
I will give you a bottle of wine

706
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Xiaoxiao, you drink here

707
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,600
Well

708
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:12,600
I will ask him to buy the bill

709
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,600
Okay

710
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,600
Wait a minute

711
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,600
It's not open

712
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:20,600
I will scan the code and pay later

713
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,600
Okay

714
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,600
What?

715
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
I want to wash my hands

716
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
Okay

717
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,600
I will go to the bathroom

718
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,600
There should be no one else now

719
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:24,600
I will go to the bathroom

720
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,600
I will go to the bathroom

721
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
Lin Jingyu

722
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:28,600
Lin Jingyu

723
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
Lin Jingyu

724
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,600
Come back

725
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,600
Go, go, go

726
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,600
Lin Jingyu, come back

727
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:42,600
Go, go, go, go, go

728
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Shake me

729
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
Shake me

730
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,600
What are you doing here?

731
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,600
Shang Baitian

732
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,600
What's going on between you and Ye Meng?

733
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,600
Pretend

734
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,600
Pretend

735
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Pretend

736
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,600
You two are in the room

737
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
I saw it

738
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
You saw it?

739
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:09,600
Yes

740
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,600
I'm embarrassed to say

741
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,600
Hello

742
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:16,600
What?

743
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
I saw nothing

744
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,600
in the door

745
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,600
Shang Baitian

746
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,600
Why are you so down?

747
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Yes

748
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
You are a man

749
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,600
I know

750
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,600
Ye Meng is so beautiful

751
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,600
and she is so hot

752
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,600
You can't control

753
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,600
such a beauty

754
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,600
She is married after all

755
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,600
But her husband

756
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,600
Her husband

757
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,600
Her husband doesn't mind

758
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,600
Even if her husband doesn't mind

759
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,600
we can't live together

760
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:44,600
It's a mess

761
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Ye Meng is also

762
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,600
Why is she down?

763
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,600
Who is down?

764
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,600
Who is down?

765
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
You live together?

766
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:06,600
You are so dirty

767
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,600
You are dirty

768
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Ye Meng and I

769
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
are a harmonious and legal

770
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,600
relationship

771
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,600
Do you understand?

772
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,600
A harmonious and legal relationship

773
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,600
Li Qingyun, are you talking about humanity?

774
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,600
You are

775
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
You are a family

776
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,600
with a good sense of shame

777
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,600
You are a family with a bad sense of shame

778
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:25,600
You never thought

779
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
Ye Meng

780
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
is a poor husband

781
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
Husband

782
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,600
Do you think he is poor?

783
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,600
Yes

784
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,600
After all, the wife is so beautiful

785
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:39,600
but she can't find the right man

786
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,600
A wind blows

787
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,600
A wind blows

788
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
A wind blows

789
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
Li Qingyun

790
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,600
You little bitch

791
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,600
You are shameless

792
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,600
I'll get it

793
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
Wait

794
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,600
What are you doing?

795
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,600
I'm still here

796
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,600
Can you let me go?

797
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,600
For the sake of the wife

798
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,600
What?

799
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,600
Open it

800
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,600
Marriage certificate

801
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:17,600
Look carefully

802
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,600
The person who holds the certificate

803
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
Li

804
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
Li Qingyun

805
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,600
Yes

806
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,600
I'm the poor husband

807
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,600
you mentioned

808
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
How could it be?

809
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,600
I'll get it

810
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
So you are

811
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
divorced

812
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
Why are you divorced?

813
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,600
It's about Wang Xingsheng

814
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
What does

815
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,600
Chun Kairan

816
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,600
do?

817
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
Just to investigate Wang Xingsheng

818
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,600
He is just a joke

819
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,600
OK

820
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,600
Hailangang is about to open

821
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,600
Li Lingbai will come to Ningcui soon

822
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,600
So my relationship with Ye Meng

823
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,600
can't be public

824
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
OK

825
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,600
OK

826
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:47,600
Since you want to hide it

827
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:48,600
don't tell me

828
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:50,600
I know a little bit more now

829
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,600
If your mother finds me

830
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,600
I'm in danger

831
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,600
Yes

832
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,600
So you can choose

833
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,600
choose to keep the secret for us

834
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,600
or

835
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
Don't pretend to be like

836
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:01,600
you are democratic, OK?

837
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,600
I have no choice

838
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Thank you

839
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
No

840
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,600
It's fate

841
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,600
Be careful

842
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,600
You

843
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,600
I saw you

844
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,600
I thought of you

845
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:58,600
I heard any news about you

846
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:03,600
The heart is torn apart

847
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,600
by the love

848
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,600
I have for you

849
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,600
I want to tell you

850
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:10,600
I love you

851
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
I love you

852
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I love you

853
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:16,600
I want to cry

854
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:44,600
I want to see you

855
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,600
I am silent and not saying anything,

856
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:53,600
I am putting the flowers in the back garden.

857
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading.

858
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:03,600
I pretend to be firm,

859
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,600
but I am still obsessed with the source.

860
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:14,600
The most perfect lies,

861
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:17,600
they all deceive themselves.

862
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:20,600
If we still let go,

863
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,600
we will lose our relationship.

864
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,600
Why is it that

865
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,600
the moment I cry,

866
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:34,600
my heart still yearns?

867
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,600
The most perfect lies,

868
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600
they all deceive themselves.

869
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:48,600
Why is it that

870
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,600
the moment I cry,

871
00:44:51,600 --> 00:44:54,600
my heart still yearns?
