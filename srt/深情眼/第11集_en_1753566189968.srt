1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks that are burning and scattering

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

6
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The heart that can't be hidden

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

9
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is me who loves you without a trace

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

14
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 2

16
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
This little hole is really good

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Li Yuan Ding made it

18
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
This man

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It's true that only when you are in the red girl group

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Can you see the 18 million people

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Look at this nice nose

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Let me take a picture for you

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Come come come

24
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
This baked bread is for Yang Yang

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ye Meng didn't eat breakfast to welcome you

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
This Yang Yang sent Jiayou to school early in the morning

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Must be hungry

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What identity do you request

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Yang Yang's brother who has no blood relationship

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Or his pursuit

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Take it away

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Take it away quickly

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Almost

34
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yang Yang also ate

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
coming

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'll pick one for you

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This one

38
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Is it hot?

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Maybe a little bit

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I really want to find Ping An to eat dog food

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The life of a single dog is also life

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I should really take Jiayou

43
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Go to eat children's set meal

44
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm here to suffer

45
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What do i do

46
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Yang Yang

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Yang Yang, this is baked

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You can eat this

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Okay, thank you

50
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come on, mom, you eat first

51
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you sister

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Be careful it's hot

53
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'll get it to drink

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Be careful

55
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Chen Kai Ran

56
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
You think about where to do it

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Are you a member of Ye Meng's family

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Or people from Li Jingyu's side

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I am

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I am a member of the family

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Then I'm half a member of the family

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I also take care of the Ye Meng family

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You are the member of the family

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
OK, look at us

65
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The battle has been opened

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Now we are a few of the family

67
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can you come to a free question

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I'm so great

69
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
OK, who comes first

70
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Then let me ask

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Before you meet Ye Meng

72
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What is your ideal type

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
There is no ideal

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
impossible

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Absolutely impossible

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You haven't been in love

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Have you ever imagined

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Is it right

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Yes

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Da Fang said I don't chase

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I really have no ideal

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
But I did think about it before

83
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Absolutely not the type of dating

84
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What kind of type is that

85
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I'll tell him

86
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Write a letter

87
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Won't look for me

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Say it well

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Won't pursue today

90
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Who said I won't chase

91
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll chase today

92
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Didn't you just say

93
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm so happy

94
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm so happy

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You two

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What do you mean

97
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It's quite sweet to be in a fight

98
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Have you ever thought about us

99
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How miserable it is to make gunpowder

100
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Li Jing, let me tell you something

101
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
One day, Ye Meng asked me to go to him

102
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Take a group of sea-side movies

103
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Then I think it's the fishing movie

104
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll leave after the shoot

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You know

106
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
That day that wind

107
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I know

108
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
There is one more

109
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Really

110
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Really

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Little plot

112
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
OK, OK, OK

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll ask for your family

114
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It's a good thing

115
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You came from Jiangbei, right?

116
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
So your household registration is in Jiangbei

117
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What about your social security

118
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Because I don't have a full-time job now

119
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So I don't have social security for the time being

120
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You don't have social security now

121
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then your future child goes to school

122
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Including your old age

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's a problem

124
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You can eat full now

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The whole family is not hungry

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What about the future

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let Ye Meng drink with you

128
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Don't talk about the future

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
How can I let Ye Meng go to drink with the northwest wind

130
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I bite you

131
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'll give you a social security shot tomorrow

132
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
We can drink with you

133
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't interrupt there

134
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
If I don't mention these questions

135
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then Ye Meng's aunts

136
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sure I'll mention it

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So if you two want to go on for a long time

138
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I think these questions have to be thought about

139
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
And have to figure out how to solve it

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
OK, I'm the one

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I don't like what you said

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But it's also an experience to share with people

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Don't blame me

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I'm done

145
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm done

146
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Thank you, Sister Yang

147
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I'll think about what you said

148
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Why can't you bite your hand

149
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is the three-part cooked

150
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Beef three-part cooked can be eaten raw

151
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'll give you a little fire

152
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Really

153
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Don't worry to eat

154
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are really beautiful

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You are really beautiful

156
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You are really beautiful

157
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Let me tell you

158
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What Fan Haiyong said just now is not unreasonable

159
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ye's family is not so easy to remember

160
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I know

161
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You have a number

162
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
But I've thought about it for you

163
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
That Hailangang

164
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm so happy

165
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't wait to see you

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Come on, let's take a look

167
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can't wait to see me

168
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Come on, let's take a look

169
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Come on, let's take a look

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You can take a look

171
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You can take a look

172
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Come on, let's take a look

173
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You can take a look

174
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
OK, come on

175
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I came from the village

176
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I want to continue to develop in our Ningsui

177
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Prepare to tear down these old and broken houses in the town

178
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You look at it

179
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Take the money to buy a new house

180
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Or do some other investments

181
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What are you two arguing about

182
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Talk about your own days

183
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Come on

184
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Give me

185
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,560
What Ya'en said to you just now

186
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
wasn't unhappy, was it?

187
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,320
Of course not.

188
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,000
Ya'en and I grew up together.

189
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,760
Although we're the same age,

190
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,760
he's always like a sister.

191
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,440
He's always worried.

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,920
I know. He's doing this for your own good.

193
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,760
But it's quite strange.

194
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,800
It's the first time you've been asked by your mother's family.

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,240
So that's how it feels.

196
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,720
I want to tell you.

197
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,560
No matter what you do,

198
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,520
as long as you're happy, that's good.

199
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,160
I know.

200
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,680
Mei Qi Yue.

201
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,160
What?

202
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,000
I like this kind of day.

203
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,720
Me too.

204
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,280
Let's go.

205
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:18,680
I thought they'd ask me.

206
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
I didn't prepare for so long.

207
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
I'm not going to ask them.

208
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
I'm going to ask them.

209
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I'm going to ask them.

210
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,680
I'm going to ask them.

211
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm going to ask them.

212
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
I'm going to ask them.

213
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,280
What did you prepare?

214
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,960
I'm going to answer

215
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,680
what your body part is

216
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
or when you're the sexiest.

217
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,200
When?

218
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,080
When you play the piano.

219
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Teach me how to play the piano.

220
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,440
Can you learn it?

221
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,640
I can.

222
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,600
I want you to see

223
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
who's the richest and most talented person in the world.

224
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
I'll think about it.

225
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
What's there to think about?

226
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,440
You have to teach me now.

227
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,320
You're a good student.

228
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
You even need to learn how to play the guitar.

229
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Come on, Ye Meng.

230
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,000
Be careful.

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay.

232
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
That's right.

233
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,720
You're too high.

234
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
You're...

235
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Where are you?

236
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
Are you playing the pipa?

237
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,120
Don't laugh at me.

238
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:23,120
Okay, lower your body.

239
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,320
And then...

240
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:24,880
That's right.

241
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,280
Press your hand and string.

242
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,520
Press and string.

243
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,120
Up.

244
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Press and string.

245
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
Press and string.

246
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Okay.

247
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,760
Is it okay?

248
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,760
It's okay.

249
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,240
I want to learn my love story.

250
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,640
Okay.

251
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,920
Come on.

252
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,080
Let me show you the first chord.

253
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,920
Like this.

254
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,560
The first chord is like this.

255
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,280
Got it?

256
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,160
Got it.

257
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Give me your hand.

258
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Your index finger is here.

259
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,160
And relax.

260
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Okay.

261
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,160
Relax.

262
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
I'll let you do it.

263
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,160
Okay.

264
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,160
Why don't you learn it?

265
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
It's worth remembering

266
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
when you post it on WeChat.

267
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
Okay.

268
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,160
Okay.

269
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
Are you done?

270
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,160
Not yet.

271
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,160
I'm laughing.

272
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,160
Can you be faster?

273
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm fast.

274
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,160
Don't be so slow.

275
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,160
Okay.

276
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,160
Okay.

277
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,160
Come on.

278
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,160
One, two, three.

279
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,160
One, two, three.

280
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Excuse me.

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
The spring of animals is here.

282
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
Can you knock?

283
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
Knock what?

284
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
Look at the circle.

285
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,160
Look.

286
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:10,160
You regret it.

287
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I stopped you.

288
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
You didn't listen to me.

289
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,160
You went to trouble the night.

290
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Now it's okay.

291
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
You should be happy.

292
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
You should be happy.

293
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,160
You should be happy.

294
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,160
You should be happy.

295
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
You should be happy.

296
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,160
You should be happy.

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,160
You should be happy.

298
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
You should be happy.

299
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Now it's okay.

300
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,160
When you go back to your hometown,

301
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,160
you'll have a little beauty.

302
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Stop looking.

303
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,160
Do you want to know?

304
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Ask yourself.

305
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Don't touch the other fingers.

306
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,160
Like this?

307
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
Yes.

308
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Not like this?

309
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,160
Be good.

310
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
Be good.

311
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,160
Come on.

312
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,160
Go on.

313
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
If it's not convenient,

314
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
I'll go out and you can pick up.

315
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,160
No need.

316
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
I'll turn it off.

317
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,160
No need.

318
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
What if I have to go to his company

319
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,160
to work in the future?

320
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,160
No.

321
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,160
I promise I will never go back.

322
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
What's wrong?

323
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
Are you angry?

324
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,160
No.

325
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,160
Let me coax you.

326
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Then...

327
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
You said you were wrong.

328
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
I was wrong.

329
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,160
Call me brother.

330
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Brother, I was wrong.

331
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,160
You're too good.

332
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,160
Brother, I was wrong.

333
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
I'm sorry.

334
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
Brother, brother, brother.

335
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,160
Okay, okay, okay.

336
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:50,160
Stop.

337
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,160
I don't know.

338
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,160
I thought it was my name.

339
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,160
You're wrong.

340
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Let's play again.

341
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,160
Let's hug first.

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,160
Hug.

343
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,160
Hug.

344
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,160
I'm not a kid.

345
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
You can't hug me like this.

346
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Okay.

347
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,160
I'm sorry.

348
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
Why didn't you put the express in?

349
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,160
I was in a hurry to see grandma.

350
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,160
By the way,

351
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
stretch out your hand.

352
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,160
I'll get you something.

353
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
Hurry up.

354
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,160
What?

355
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,160
Congratulations.

356
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
You unlocked your girlfriend's key.

357
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
That's not good.

358
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
It doesn't matter.

359
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:17,160
If I have to go to Jiangbei in the future,

360
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,160
can you help me with the express?

361
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Can you, Mr. Li?

362
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,160
Sure.

363
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,160
Let's go.

364
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Wang,

365
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,160
I'm going to be discharged in two days.

366
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,160
I can't bear to part with you.

367
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,160
I have feelings for you.

368
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,160
You know?

369
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,160
My granddaughter is very sensible.

370
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,160
Look at this car.

371
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
My grandson bought it for me.

372
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,160
I think I didn't take it home, right?

373
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,160
If I gave it to you,

374
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,160
you wouldn't accept it, right?

375
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
So this is the only home.

376
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,160
When I leave,

377
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,160
you'll miss this car, right?

378
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
Grandma.

379
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Meng.

380
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
You're back.

381
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,160
You're back.

382
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
Grandma, don't mind about this car.

383
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,160
No.

384
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
We won't sell it.

385
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,160
Look at what you said.

386
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,160
You have to persuade Bado

387
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,160
to get the discharge procedures done.

388
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,160
I have to wait for the doctor

389
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,160
to give you a discharge certificate

390
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,160
before I can go out.

391
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
One more day.

392
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
No, I just remembered

393
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,160
that there's a free physical examination

394
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
in the town.

395
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
So I can save you money.

396
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,160
Save money?

397
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,160
Be good.

398
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,160
Mom.

399
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Are you stupid?

400
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,160
Yes.

401
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
If you lie to me,

402
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
I'll let you go out safely.

403
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,160
I thought you'd be soft-hearted

404
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,160
when you had a girlfriend.

405
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
You're so heartless.

406
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,160
But I promise you

407
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,160
I'll definitely go to the physical examination.

408
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
He did it for your own good.

409
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
I'll make you some oranges.

410
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,160
Why are you still listening to him?

411
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
Please.

412
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
Let him do it.

413
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,160
You do it.

414
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,160
I'll do it.

415
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:52,160
Hello.

416
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Wang.

417
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,160
300.

418
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I ordered flowers for Grandma.

419
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Come and get them.

420
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,160
Grandma.

421
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I'll go out for a while.

422
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,160
Okay.

423
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,160
Come back.

424
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
I'll wait for you.

425
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,160
Hello.

426
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
It's me, Gou Kai.

427
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
What's wrong with you?

428
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,160
You've been calling me for two days.

429
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Now you have a strange number.

430
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Pan Jin Gu.

431
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,160
I'm here in Ning Cui.

432
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,160
At your door.

433
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
What?

434
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
This way.

435
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,160
You should take the physical examination.

436
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
I'm not eating.

437
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Listen.

438
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm going to be discharged.

439
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I'm a little worried.

440
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
If I don't come home,

441
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:42,160
will I affect your relationship with your mother?

442
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,160
Although I don't live in a room,

443
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,160
I'm not young anymore.

444
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,160
I'm not like you young people.

445
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,160
I'm a little awkward.

446
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,160
I'm a little...

447
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
Da Huo.

448
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
You don't sleep.

449
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
That's not because you don't sleep much.

450
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,160
It's because you want to play with your phone.

451
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,160
And you can't sleep at night.

452
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
Tell me the truth.

453
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,160
Be serious.

454
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,160
I heard that there is a new building in this new district.

455
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
The doctors and nurses all say it's good.

456
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,160
It's called Hailangang.

457
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,160
I've been giving you all the money you've been filial to me all these years.

458
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
All for the bank.

459
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,160
I'm waiting for you to buy a house for your wife.

460
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
Don't say it.

461
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
I'll wait for you in the cafe.

462
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,160
You'll take Mengmeng to see the house in two days.

463
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Now the girl is going to get married.

464
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,160
You have your own house, right?

465
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,160
I'm still anxious to get a grandson.

466
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,160
Besides, you have a relationship with Mengmeng's family.

467
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
I'm talking to you. You didn't hear me.

468
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
I'm not going.

469
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,160
You're not going?

470
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,160
You never thought about living with someone, right?

471
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
It's not necessary.

472
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,160
It's too early to think about it now.

473
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,160
What do you mean?

474
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
What do you mean it's not necessary?

475
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,160
What is necessary?

476
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
I'm telling you.

477
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
I don't mean that.

478
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Ye Meng is just resting here for a while.

479
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,160
She won't stay with you forever.

480
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
Where are you going after the blood test?

481
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:16,160
It's not decided yet.

482
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,160
I don't want to use these to kidnap her before she's sure.

483
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
No.

484
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,160
No matter where you are,

485
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:29,160
you have to discuss it with her in advance.

486
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,160
Communicate with her.

487
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,160
Don't let her misunderstand you.

488
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
Do you know?

489
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
I know.

490
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,160
You have to think about it.

491
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
Right?

492
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
I have an appointment with someone.

493
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,160
Who?

494
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,160
I asked the deliveryman to put the nurse's table for grandma.

495
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
Remember to take it.

496
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
Ye Meng.

497
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,160
She said she had something to do and left.

498
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,160
She bought you something to take it.

499
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,160
She bought it for me?

500
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
Hurry up.

501
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,160
Gao Hu.

502
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,160
What are you doing?

503
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,160
Well...

504
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Nothing.

505
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,160
What song did you play at the concert that day?

506
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,160
Search it for me.

507
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,160
It's been a while.

508
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,160
This one.

509
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,160
Congratulations.

510
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Go ahead.

511
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,160
Okay.

512
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:28,420
Translation by

513
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,160
What are you doing during the day?

514
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,160
Now you go.

515
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Close your eyes.

516
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Be obedient.

517
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,120
Feel it.

518
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Feel it.

519
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
Your breath...

520
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,160
What's empty in your heart...

521
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Do you feel it?

522
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:46,760
Enough. I can't play the old-fashioned music.

523
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,040
I don't want you to play it.

524
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,160
I mean, do you think your heart is beating faster?

525
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,800
No.

526
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,600
It just sounds quite uncomfortable.

527
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,840
What? Are you testing the patient level of the guests?

528
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,560
It has nothing to do with the guests.

529
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,360
I just want to know if my heart beat

530
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,360
because of the music or because...

531
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,600
That is to say, you found out that you like Ye Meng.

532
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,640
Is the heartbeat the same as the one you heard?

533
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,040
Or is it faster?

534
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,000
It sounds like it's beating 180.

535
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
How about going to the hospital? We can't treat the patient.

536
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm serious. I've been crazy these past two days.

537
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I think I like Fang Xiao'n.

538
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,880
What?

539
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:36,400
I think I like Fang Xiao'n.

540
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,080
But I'm not sure.

541
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,480
How could I like Fang Xiao'n?

542
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,080
I'm the only one who likes her.

543
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,480
I don't like anyone else.

544
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:52,560
But I think she was smiling so happily at the concert.

545
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,680
I'm happy too.

546
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,760
You mean

547
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,280
you don't know if you like Shang Lafayette?

548
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,560
Then why are you looking for me?

549
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,160
I'm not...

550
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,760
I don't dare. I want you to be with me.

551
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,360
You admit that you're a coward now?

552
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,160
I admit it. I admit it. I'm a coward now.

553
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,960
You can go with me. Let's go to the hospital.

554
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,160
I have to work today.

555
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,360
Pay the salary.

556
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,960
Pay the salary abroad.

557
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,560
Three times.

558
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,360
Let's go.

559
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,160
Man Man, go to the store.

560
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
Okay.

561
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,160
You grew up here.

562
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,560
It's good.

563
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:49,360
Everyone is very honest. It's suitable for retirement.

564
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,560
But it's not suitable for you now.

565
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,560
The coffee quality is almost interesting.

566
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,960
Boss.

567
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:05,560
Let's go back to Jiangbei and drink your favorite coffee.

568
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,160
Can you change your temper?

569
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,760
Can you change your temper?

570
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,760
I can't. Just tell me.

571
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
Why are you looking at me?

572
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,760
You can see me from here.

573
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,760
I just want to look at her from afar.

574
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:25,360
Feel her.

575
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,560
You look like a pervert.

576
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,160
Like a ghost.

577
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
Who are you talking about?

578
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,160
I think you're the pervert.

579
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,560
You're so pretty.

580
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,360
Thank you.

581
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,760
Come on.

582
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,560
Let's go.

583
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,360
This kid.

584
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
He was still there yesterday.

585
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,360
He came here today to show off, right?

586
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Really.

587
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,960
He didn't come here, right?

588
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,560
Take a look.

589
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,360
He didn't find us, did he?

590
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Keep going.

591
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,960
He didn't come here, either, right?

592
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
Yan Yan.

593
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,360
Hi.

594
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,160
Why are you here?

595
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,760
Well...

596
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,960
I have something to tell you.

597
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,560
Oh, go to the store.

598
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,760
It's too cold outside.

599
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,960
Let's go.

600
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,560
It's too cold.

601
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,960
It's cold.

602
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,960
I'll make you some tea.

603
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,760
Yan Yan.

604
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
I'm not going in.

605
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,760
Why?

606
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
It's him.

607
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,760
He came to talk to you.

608
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,160
Right?

609
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,560
You two talk. I'm leaving.

610
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,960
Where are you going?

611
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,360
I'm going back to work.

612
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,160
Okay.

613
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,160
Talk to you later.

614
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,760
Bye.

615
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,160
Turn right.

616
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,960
Oh, my God.

617
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:14,560
I'm so confused.

618
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
Actually, I...

619
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,760
Give me a break, sister.

620
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,960
You and Gou Kai drank coffee.

621
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,360
You almost got caught by Lin Jing Yu.

622
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
Luckily, I blocked you.

623
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,160
Okay.

624
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,760
I apologize to you for making a mistake.

625
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,560
Can you come back with me?

626
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,360
Gou Kai, if you didn't hear it clearly,

627
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,760
I'll tell you again.

628
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,960
I never thought of going back.

629
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,360
Did you find a boyfriend?

630
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,760
I saw you on the Internet.

631
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,960
Are you a local?

632
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,360
Just go for it.

633
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,160
Are you really going to stay here forever?

634
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,960
What can't I stay here forever?

635
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,760
And let me tell you.

636
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,160
I'm very serious.

637
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,760
I'm very loyal.

638
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,760
How serious?

639
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,560
Just wait and see.

640
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,360
Don't think I don't know what you're thinking.

641
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
Don't try to use the position of a superior to talk to me.

642
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,360
You and I were not in the same world from the beginning.

643
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,760
Don't be angry with yourself.

644
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,360
If you want to be safe, you won't choose to come to Jiangbei.

645
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,360
I did want to break into Jiangbei when I was young.

646
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,360
But then I found out that the world was not suitable for me.

647
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,960
I don't like it. Is there a conflict?

648
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
Ye Meng, I did everything for your good.

649
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,360
I hope you can make progress soon.

650
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,760
I'm leaving first.

651
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,360
By the way, Gou Kai.

652
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:49,160
Okay.

653
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,760
You're so low now.

654
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,560
Boss, here's the bill.

655
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,560
Your tofu is almost ready.

656
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:06,760
I'll take it out.

657
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,160
Hey!

658
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,960
What are you doing?

659
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,360
Chatting?

660
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:15,760
Right.

661
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,160
Chat.

662
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,560
Chat.

663
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I sent a suit to you two days ago.

664
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,560
It's too big.

665
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,160
You want me to change it?

666
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:24,960
Yes.

667
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
It's fine.

668
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,360
It's here.

669
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,160
Here.

670
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,160
Tell me if it's not suitable.

671
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,160
Okay.

672
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,560
I'll transfer the money to you via WeChat.

673
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,760
No need.

674
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Then I'll treat you to coffee.

675
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
Okay.

676
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,960
Gou Kai.

677
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,160
Yes.

678
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,560
Well...

679
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,160
Well, I'll...

680
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,360
I'll re-apply the sheet for you.

681
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:49,960
I'll change it for you.

682
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,560
It's not necessarily accurate.

683
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,360
Give it to me.

684
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,960
Come on.

685
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,760
I'll measure it for you.

686
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,360
Come back.

687
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,360
I'll apply the sheet for you.

688
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,560
It'll be more accurate when you come back.

689
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,560
Take off the coat.

690
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
No.

691
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,160
That's it.

692
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,960
Come here.

693
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,360
Put it here.

694
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
Relax here.

695
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,760
Why are you shaking?

696
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,160
I'm staying up.

697
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,160
I'm having a heart attack.

698
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,360
You can sleep early.

699
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,160
I can't sleep.

700
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Come here.

701
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
I'll be right here.

702
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,360
It's not short.

703
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,160
Turn around.

704
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,160
Left or right?

705
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,560
Whatever.

706
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,360
What are you doing?

707
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,160
Why are you hiding?

708
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,960
Your shoulders are wide.

709
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,160
Really?

710
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,360
Do you practice?

711
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,760
Of course.

712
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,160
Come on.

713
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,160
I'm having a heart attack.

714
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Why are you shaking?

715
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,160
Ya'an.

716
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,360
I'm here to get the coat.

717
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,360
Wait a minute.

718
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,960
When did you get a man's outfit?

719
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
No.

720
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,960
This is your boyfriend.

721
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,160
What boyfriend?

722
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,760
My brother.

723
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,360
He's even closer to my brother.

724
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,360
Here you are.

725
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,560
You're quite energetic.

726
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:23,960
Right?

727
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,160
Do you have a girlfriend?

728
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:25,960
No.

729
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,760
No?

730
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,960
Then come to my wedding.

731
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,160
I'll give you a red envelope.

732
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,160
Right.

733
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,960
You can go to your wedding.

734
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,360
My brother is very good.

735
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,960
He's like a diamond in our town.

736
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,360
Diamond Wang Lao Wu.

737
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,360
You should pay attention to him.

738
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,160
I'll give you a red envelope later.

739
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,760
No.

740
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,960
I...

741
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,960
I like you.

742
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,560
I'm sorry.

743
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,360
I'm being rude.

744
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:49,960
No need.

745
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,560
I'm leaving.

746
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:50,960
Okay.

747
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,760
I need to contact you.

748
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,560
Okay.

749
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,960
Take care.

750
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I blew it up.

751
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,760
Didn't you say that you didn't have one last time?

752
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,760
It's just that I'm embarrassed to say it.

753
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,960
Who is it?

754
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,960
Do I know her?

755
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,960
I...

756
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
I think so.

757
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,360
I... I know her.

758
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:10,960
Really?

759
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,160
I know her?

760
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,360
Who is it?

761
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
Wait a minute.

762
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,760
Hello, Mr. Cheng.

763
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,760
What's wrong?

764
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:21,960
Wait a minute.

765
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:22,760
I'll go over there now.

766
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,760
What's wrong?

767
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Jiayu is sick.

768
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,360
She can't stand it.

769
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:25,960
I'll go with you.

770
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:26,560
I'll go with you.

771
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,160
Okay.

772
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,760
Let's go.

773
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,560
Hide.

774
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:29,760
Okay.

775
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,960
Didn't she say that

776
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,160
after the Spring Festival,

777
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
she would pick you up in person?

778
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,760
I don't think so.

779
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
I'm not going to do that.

780
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,760
I'm going to go.

781
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,760
Did she pick you up in person?

782
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
I'm leaving after she picks me up.

783
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,760
I won't show up.

784
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,760
You just let her get out.

785
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,760
Sorry.

786
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
That's all for today.

787
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
Thank you.

788
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:17,760
Brother Cheng, sing again.

789
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
I'll sing.

790
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
Sing again.

791
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
I'll sing.

792
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,760
Brother,

793
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,760
are you in a bad mood today?

794
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Why don't you sing?

795
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,760
No.

796
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:38,760
Why?

797
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,760
Are you not happy today?

798
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,760
I have a girlfriend.

799
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,760
The kind to get married.

800
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,760
You're really my Mr. Ye.

801
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,760
You're so loyal.

802
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,760
Xin Yu,

803
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,760
I've been looking for you

804
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,760
for a long time.

805
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,760
I didn't find anyone.

806
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:56,760
You have a friend here.

807
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
Please pay attention to her.

808
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,760
You're here.

809
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,760
Mr. Gou.

810
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,760
Come in.

811
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,760
Old Jiang,

812
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,760
please send me the purchase form

813
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
of the class.

814
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,760
Thank you for your help.

815
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,760
No problem, Mr. Gou.

816
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,760
We're friends.

817
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,760
Okay.

818
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,760
Let's get together

819
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:28,760
when we get back to Jiangbei.

820
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,760
Sit here.

821
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,760
You want to buy a class?

822
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,760
No.

823
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,760
Mr. Gou asked for the schedule.

824
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Are you done?

825
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,760
He came to see you.

826
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,760
Stop it.

827
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,760
I'm already surprised

828
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,760
that you can come to Ningcui.

829
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,760
Isn't Hainan Port

830
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:50,760
a busy city?

831
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,760
I'm here as a boss

832
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,760
to have a look.

833
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,760
But I have to go back to Jiangbei tomorrow.

834
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,760
Why are you in such a hurry?

835
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,760
You're here.

836
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,760
Why don't you ask your

837
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,760
capable leader

838
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
to have a meal and a cup of coffee?

839
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,760
Aren't you my capable leader?

840
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,760
You want to ask me to have a meal?

841
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,760
Just say it.

842
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:08,760
You choose a place.

843
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,760
Stop it.

844
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,760
You know I'm talking about Ye Meng.

845
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,760
I know.

846
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:15,760
But didn't you say

847
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,760
that he didn't plan to leave Ningcui

848
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,760
and to meet his life here?

849
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,760
I can't force you, can I?

850
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,760
And I saw that

851
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,760
he was in love with someone.

852
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,760
He's very attractive.

853
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,760
Do you know him?

854
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:31,760
I've seen him.

855
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,760
I'm not familiar with him.

856
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,760
But it seems

857
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,760
that he's Ye Meng's type.

858
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,760
That's good.

859
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,760
Why?

860
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,760
Are you curious about his boyfriend?

861
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:43,760
No.

862
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:44,760
Didn't you say

863
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,760
that you wanted to see Ye Meng?

864
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,760
I just asked.

865
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
It doesn't matter.

866
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,760
Are you free later?

867
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,760
Let's have a drink together.

868
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,760
Next time.

869
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,760
I'm a little tired.

870
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,760
I'll see you before I leave tomorrow.

871
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,760
Okay.

872
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,760
I'll go back first.

873
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,760
Mr. Gou, have a good rest.

874
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:09,760
Bye.

875
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,760
Are you reading?

876
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:52,760
Have you had dinner?

877
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,760
I brought you a cake.

878
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,760
Why do you suddenly

879
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,760
want to buy a cake?

880
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,760
I went to the cafe this afternoon.

881
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
The cakes there are very delicious.

882
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
I thought I must bring it back

883
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,760
for you to try.

884
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,760
You're going to the cafe to meet someone?

885
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,760
Are you friends in town?

886
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,760
How's the chat?

887
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,760
I'm not going to meet anyone.

888
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
I'm going to meet someone.

889
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,760
I'm going to meet someone.

890
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm going to meet someone.

891
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:16,760
I'm going to meet someone.

892
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:17,760
What's the matter?

893
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,760
We didn't have a good chat.

894
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,760
We broke up.

895
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,760
We won't meet again.

896
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,760
It's very unreliable.

897
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,760
Then you should

898
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,760
make more reliable friends in the future.

899
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,760
Professional accounting food?

900
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,760
Are you going to get an accounting license?

901
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,760
Your temperament

902
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,760
doesn't match with the accountant.

903
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:46,760
You're going to call yourself accountant Li in the future?

904
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,760
I just casually look at it.

905
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,760
Are you casually looking at it

906
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,760
or are you going to find a stable job

907
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,760
for me?

908
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,760
Didn't you just stay in Ningcui

909
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,760
for a while and leave?

910
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
I'm going to stay with my grandmother

911
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,760
for a long time.

912
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,760
Yes.

913
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,760
Then you stay with your grandmother.

914
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,760
I'll stay with you.

915
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,760
Is that okay?

916
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,760
Don't you still plan to go back to Jiangbei?

917
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:16,760
You can't bear to leave me?

918
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Then I won't leave.

919
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,760
Ye Ma,

920
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,760
I remember every word you said.

921
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,760
So,

922
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:26,760
don't make promises easily

923
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,760
when you can't do it.

924
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:29,760
Don't coax me either.

925
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,760
I'm not coaxing you.

926
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,760
No one can say the future.

927
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,760
It's just that now

928
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,760
I don't want to leave you.

929
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,760
Okay.

930
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,760
Okay.

931
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,760
I heard from Jiang

932
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:55,760
that you've been looking for

933
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
this class's seller.

934
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I happen to have some news.

935
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,760
Do you want to know

936
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,760
this seller's information?

937
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:09,760
I'm leaving.

938
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Don't read too late.

939
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,760
Have some cake.

940
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,760
Okay.

941
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,760
You're here.

942
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Sit.

943
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,760
I'm done.

944
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:46,760
Didn't you say

945
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,760
you have the information of the seller?

946
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,760
What information?

947
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Don't be so anxious.

948
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,760
Let's talk while drinking.

949
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
I'm in a hurry.

950
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,760
Is your boyfriend

951
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,760
so strict with you?

952
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,760
I know you're mad at me.

953
00:37:58,760 --> 00:37:59,760
So I deliberately

954
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,760
find a boyfriend to tease me.

955
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:01,760
You don't have to be so happy.

956
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:03,760
As long as you go back with me,

957
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,760
I'll pretend that it never happened.

958
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,760
Wang Xing Sheng.

959
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,900
The man who sold the

960
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,760
bandage was called Wang Xing Sheng.

961
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,760
He was a real estate agent.

962
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,760
He likes to collect antiques.

963
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:25,760
Wang Xing Sheng?

964
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,760
Where is he now?

965
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,760
In Jiangbei.

966
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,760
I can contact him

967
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,760
in the name of Tan Yi Ou.

968
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,760
It's so cloudy.

969
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,760
Why did you come out?

970
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,760
Where did you go so late?

971
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:52,760
I went to see someone.

972
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,760
Let's talk at home.

973
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,760
You went to see the person

974
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:55,760
in the cafe again, right?

975
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,760
Didn't Sheng Xia tell me

976
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,760
that she had talked to him?

977
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,760
She will never see him again.

978
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
I didn't want to see him again.

979
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:03,760
But she sent me a message

980
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,760
saying that she had the clue

981
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
of my mom's bandage.

982
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,760
Is it your boss?

983
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Yes.

984
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,760
Why didn't you tell me?

985
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,760
I was afraid that you would be angry.

986
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,760
And...

987
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:24,760
I was going to Jiangbei.

988
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:29,760
How long?

989
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
I don't know.

990
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,760
He said that he would help me

991
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,760
to ask that person out.

992
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
After I met that person,

993
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,760
I could find out

994
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:36,760
the fact that my mom committed suicide.

995
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,760
I'll be back

996
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,760
as soon as I find the clue.

997
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,760
What if you can't see that person?

998
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,760
Will you not come back?

999
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,760
How could I not come back?

1000
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,760
Don't you know that your ex-boss

1001
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:46,760
cares about you?

1002
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,760
He can use that bandage

1003
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,760
to hook you to Jiangbei.

1004
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,760
How could he let you come back so easily?

1005
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,760
I know it.

1006
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,760
So you didn't plan to

1007
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:58,760
discuss with me from the beginning.

1008
00:39:58,760 --> 00:39:59,760
You just want to go directly, right?

1009
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
I'm discussing with you now.

1010
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,760
It's not a discussion.

1011
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,760
It's a notice.

1012
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,760
What do you want me to do?

1013
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
For the sake of your relationship

1014
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:07,760
that doesn't have to be long-term,

1015
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,760
I won't go to Jiangbei

1016
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:09,760
and won't investigate my mom's matter.

1017
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,760
Did you hear what my grandma and I

1018
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,760
said in the hospital?

1019
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,760
Yes, I heard it.

1020
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,760
I was going to tell you

1021
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,760
about my ex-boss coming in the afternoon.

1022
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,760
Then I heard you

1023
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,760
telling grandma that

1024
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,760
our relationship

1025
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
doesn't have to be that long-term.

1026
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,760
That's not what I meant.

1027
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:27,760
What I meant is

1028
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,760
I know

1029
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
you don't plan to stay in Ningcui for a long time.

1030
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:31,760
So I don't want to

1031
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,760
delay your future plan because of me.

1032
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
You don't want to delay it

1033
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
or you think it's not necessary?

1034
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,760
That's right.

1035
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
I've been around you all the time.

1036
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,760
I've been celebrating your birthday

1037
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,760
and confessing to you.

1038
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I've been posting those

1039
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,760
things in the circle of friends.

1040
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,760
And you?

1041
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,760
You're always

1042
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,760
in a state of being able to get away at any time.

1043
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,760
So that's what you think, right?

1044
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,760
Does it matter what I think?

1045
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,760
What matters is what you think.

1046
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
Let's calm down.

1047
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,760
Let's calm down.

1048
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,760
How's the baby?

1049
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,760
Is he still afraid of the fever?

1050
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,760
He's not burning anymore.

1051
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,760
Then let's observe him for another night.

1052
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,760
Are you the only one who's taking care of the baby?

1053
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Where's the baby's father?

1054
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor.

1055
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:55,760
I'm the baby's father.

1056
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:56,760
That's fine.

1057
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:57,760
You two have to keep an eye on the baby

1058
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,760
in order to make it easier.

1059
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,760
The baby must be careful

1060
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
and be careful not to get hurt.

1061
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor.

1062
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,760
I'm the baby's father.

1063
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,760
That's fine.

1064
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,760
You two have to keep an eye on the baby

1065
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,760
in order to make it easier.

1066
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,760
The baby must be careful

1067
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
and be careful not to get hurt.

1068
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,760
I understand.

1069
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,760
Yes, use the cotton swab to dip the baby in water.

1070
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Damp it when it's dry.

1071
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,760
Okay.

1072
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,760
Okay.

1073
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:16,760
Thank you.

1074
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,760
It's okay.

1075
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,760
Take care of the baby.

1076
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,760
Why is it so heavy all of a sudden?

1077
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
Did he eat something bad?

1078
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:22,760
Let me do it.

1079
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,760
You take a break.

1080
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,760
Okay.

1081
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:25,760
You take a break.

1082
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,760
The baby is away.

1083
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:42,240
Right?

1084
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:12,760
I thought of you

1085
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:18,760
I heard any news about you

1086
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,760
The love that was reflected in my heart

1087
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,760
Enclosed my thoughts

1088
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,760
Where should I go?

1089
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:37,760
How should I avoid it?

1090
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:42,760
Those memories about you

1091
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:53,760
I was so far away but I couldn't get you out of my mind

1092
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,760
I was silent all night

1093
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,760
I was putting the flowers in the back garden

1094
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,760
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading

1095
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:12,760
I pretended to be firm

1096
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,760
But I'm still obsessed with the origin

1097
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,760
The most perfect lie

1098
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,760
Deceives yourself

1099
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:32,760
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

1100
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
Why is this?

1101
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,760
The moment of tears

1102
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,760
The heart is still attached

1103
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,760
The most perfect lie

1104
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:04,760
The most perfect lie
