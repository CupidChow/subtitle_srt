1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excitingly saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that one has my dream

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 2

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Thank you today

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Sister, are you okay?

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Did he leave?

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
He left, I've seen it

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you, thank you

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then you don't have to be so polite

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If there is such a thing in the future, you can just bother me

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Anyway, my brother told me

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You are very rich, you will treat me well

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How do you think I'm rich

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Don't think we are not goods

31
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
You go first

32
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
No, you say

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Row

34
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Then find me if you have something

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Thank you, bye bye

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Bye bye

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Please

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You let Mai Mai to lure Chen Kai Ran

39
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
How can you be so confident to lie to her?

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I just know more about Boss Cheng's character

41
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Brother is not only good at acting

42
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Also know humanity

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Smart

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
What are you looking for me for?

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm here to apologize to you

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
About Jiang Luzhi

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know, is there anything else?

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Add a WeChat

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Today you ruined your reputation for me

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I won't treat you

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll transfer the money to you later, scan me

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I didn't talk nonsense, I don't need it

53
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Meng, I have an appointment with Dr. Gao again

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Don't let him go again

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Then change a way of compensation

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I'm more reliable than Jiang Luzhi in love with me

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Meng

58
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You sisters hate each other so much

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Really younger than me

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Two years younger

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
How do you know?

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Today when the hospital was on duty

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I accidentally saw your ID card

64
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You follow me

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You think too much

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I'm not that boring

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
OK, do you accept sister's love?

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I like it smaller than me

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's best to be good and good

70
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Understand?

71
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Then you really like to see Yuwei

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You sacrificed your reputation for me today

73
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Just to make Jiang Luzhi jealous

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Is it worth it?

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Can you control it?

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Go quickly

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Can you add a WeChat?

78
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Sister also needs to learn to protect herself

79
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Love and hate

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
This one needs another boat

81
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
This one?

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Correct

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What else?

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Then I have to eat a bowl of tofu

85
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Tofu balls

86
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
That ball

87
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This one, good

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
How much is it?

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Twenty

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Thank you

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Thank you

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I didn't eat enough in the afternoon

93
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Come on, eat quickly

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
How much is sister Mei in total?

95
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Four yuan

96
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Thank you sister Mei

97
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Thank you for being my guest

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You really bought me food

99
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You always eat me

100
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Don't run

101
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Don't chase me

102
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Is that K&K?

103
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What happened to him again?

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
You say, can he win?

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
It's strange if you can win

106
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Save me, Sister Yan

107
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Sister Yan Meng

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Stop

109
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Save me

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Don't run

111
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Go quickly

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't run

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Go quickly

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Mom, didn't expect

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I have been to Jiangbei for so many years

116
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I still keep this early habit

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Good

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
In the future

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Every morning

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Come with grandma to find things

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Mom, I like running

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
So I have to run every day

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You can buy some food

124
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Running is a good habit

125
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The time when the little doctor and the others go to the morning shift

126
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
It's almost this time

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You two can still have a meeting in time

128
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You know how many little girls

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm in a hurry to date him

130
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I tell you

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Even if your legs are broken tomorrow

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to climb the holy tree for me

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Did you hear that?

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Every time I tell you this

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You pretend to not hear

136
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
OK, I know

137
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Let's go

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Wait for me at home

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Go or not

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go, go, go, go, go tomorrow

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Go, go, go, go, go

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Hello

143
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
What is Chen Kanran doing recently?

144
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Chen Kanran

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
He

146
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
He's out now

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But his things

148
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I can't tell you clearly on the phone

149
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
After I got married

150
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Chen Jian didn't let me contact him

151
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
So we have

152
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I haven't seen him for years

153
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The scar on his face was left by me at that time

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yes

155
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
A handsome kid

156
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
A scar on his face

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So he's been looking for you

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A few years ago

159
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
The old house in Ninan Tang

160
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
He's staring at it every day

161
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Then your grandma moved to the aunt

162
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This is what he's like

163
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
But he said

164
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He said

165
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have to pay you a price

166
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then I'll talk to him

167
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Don't wait for me

168
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
After I'm discharged

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll help you find him

170
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Don't forget

171
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You are the life of two mothers

172
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Why do you care about this?

173
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
OK, don't worry

174
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'll solve it myself

175
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I'll go to the bathroom

176
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
What a coincidence

177
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You told me it was a coincidence

178
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why don't you hide?

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Do you have time?

180
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Talk about the past

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Talk

182
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I know you are more and more concerned about what happened that year

183
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I came here today to tell you

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I called the police at that time

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But the police didn't find you

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Because you don't want to go into the police station

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Those people ran away

188
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You also ran away

189
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Hello, Yaoyao Li

190
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I want to report to the police

191
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Is this a police report?

192
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
We were so close at that time

193
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You saw me being pulled away

194
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'm so angry

195
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't realize how serious the matter was

196
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You said you were going to ask someone for a leave three days at that time

197
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So I don't know

198
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't wait for me

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is it meaningful to say this first?

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
OK

201
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
You're going to put everything on me, aren't you?

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Correct

203
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Then you give me a knife too

204
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
That's enough

205
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You dare not touch me

206
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Brother Kai

207
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
No matter what happens

208
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
A man should not hurt a girl

209
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Let go

210
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Brother, I'm sorry to see you like this

211
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Brother, Brother Jingyu

212
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you doing?

213
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Why are you here?

214
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Brother Jingyu, why are your hands injured?

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why are you here?

216
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Brother Jingyu has a performance tonight

217
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I took him on vacation to come and see

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Just let Brother Jingyu

219
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Continue to give me a study

220
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Kai Kai

221
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I really hope you can live well

222
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If you particularly mind this bar

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I know a doctor

224
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Can help you get rid of it

225
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Brother Jingyu, are you okay?

226
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Jingjing, let's go

227
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
coming

228
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Show me your hand

229
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Nothing

230
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Brother Jingyu

231
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
When are you going to be with me?

232
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Didn't follow you

233
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
My family also goes this way

234
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Thank you today

235
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But that sister

236
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Looks simple and kind

237
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Should be your favorite type

238
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I'm sorry

239
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I'm sorry

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I'm sorry

241
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm sorry

242
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm sorry

243
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm sorry

244
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I'm sorry

245
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry

246
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm sorry

247
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm sorry

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm sorry

249
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
I'm sorry

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'm sorry

251
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry

252
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Sorry

253
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let me touch you

254
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let me touch you

255
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Let me touch you

256
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Great

257
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
It's okay

258
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
My brother

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I don't want to be Ugo

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And there is no interest

261
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
No energy

262
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Participate in your love game

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,840
I forgot to bring my keys today.

264
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,240
I'll borrow yours to go back to my house.

265
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,600
Excuse me.

266
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,480
Do you want to come to my house?

267
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,800
No need.

268
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm leaving.

269
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
Are you still alive?

270
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I'm still alive.

271
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,720
I'll pay you back for your injury.

272
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
Do you still have money?

273
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
You always have to pay others.

274
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,320
Bye.

275
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,840
Bye.

276
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Take care of your wound.

277
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,800
My words are only so vivid.

278
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,080
You retard.

279
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:05,880
Every time,

280
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,220
you'd be upset.

281
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,080
I hate it.

282
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:17,880
Hey,

283
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,320
give me a pen.

284
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,760
Enough.

285
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,680
I love you.

286
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:38,080
I'm here to see the new

287
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:44,200
My heart and headed where

288
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:50,480
Now she knew

289
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,020
You came up

290
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:55,500
Ok

291
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:26,700
I'm so tired.

292
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,500
Here, drink some milk first.

293
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,900
Let's finish this one and go to bed, okay?

294
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,100
Mom, I don't want to do it anymore.

295
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Why not?

296
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,700
If you don't want to do it, you'll have to go to the hospital tomorrow.

297
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,100
Listen to me. Drink the milk first.

298
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,900
After you drink it, you'll have strength again.

299
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,700
Hurry, drink it.

300
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,700
Mom, I'm so tired.

301
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,300
I'm so tired.

302
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,700
I'm so tired.

303
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,300
I'm so tired.

304
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,500
Hurry, drink it.

305
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,500
Da Bao is so good.

306
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,300
He did... He did such a good job.

307
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,300
Are you asleep?

308
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,500
Looks like you've been doing well lately.

309
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,700
I'm fine.

310
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:23,900
I just wanted to ask how you're doing over there.

311
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm on a business trip. I'm free to visit you.

312
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:53,500
I'm so tired.

313
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,700
I'm so tired.

314
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,300
I'm so tired.

315
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,700
I'm so tired.

316
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,100
Dr. Gao,

317
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,100
the first test result has been released.

318
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,300
This is their new product.

319
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,500
This test result, I'm telling you,

320
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,700
if we let him do surgery today,

321
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,460
You're back.

322
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,300
Why are you back so late?

323
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,980
Dr. Xiao Yao has been waiting for you for a long time.

324
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,060
Did she go to the hospital

325
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
to accompany your sister?

326
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,780
Mengmeng is a warm-hearted person.

327
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,020
No.

328
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,940
I went to the nightclub yesterday.

329
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,300
I slept for a whole night.

330
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm so tired.

331
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:34,980
I don't think I can come back.

332
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,980
It's you.

333
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,820
Cool.

334
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,140
Miss Ye.

335
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:41,540
We meet again.

336
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,860
You two know each other?

337
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:44,700
Come on, Mengmeng.

338
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,580
Come on, sit here.

339
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:46,980
Move.

340
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,660
Go, go, go.

341
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,540
Go to the other side.

342
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,260
Come on.

343
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,980
You didn't sell it, did you?

344
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,420
Sit here.

345
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,420
Dr. Xiao Gao.

346
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,100
You didn't see Mengmeng

347
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,420
last time you came

348
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,020
because she was too busy.

349
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,660
Mengmeng is fine this time.

350
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,940
You young people

351
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,820
should have a good talk.

352
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,900
Have a good talk.

353
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,900
Grandma.

354
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,780
Why are you going?

355
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,980
It's good to chat together.

356
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,860
Sit down.

357
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,420
Okay.

358
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,700
Sit down, Xiao Zong.

359
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,380
Sit down.

360
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:34,940
Dr. Gao.

361
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,180
Since we've met before,

362
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:38,540
you've known

363
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,700
my basic conditions.

364
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
Let me make a few requests.

365
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:44,900
Okay.

366
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,180
After you get married,

367
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,500
you can live with me in my mother's house.

368
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,340
On your working day,

369
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,180
you have to get up

370
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,420
before 6.30 a.m. every day.

371
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,780
I like to take care of my family.

372
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,020
So,

373
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,500
all the hard work

374
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,380
and gatherings

375
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,380
are canceled.

376
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:57,940
Okay?

377
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,460
Okay.

378
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,620
There are many people at home,

379
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,460
so we have to prepare breakfast separately.

380
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:07,260
For grandma,

381
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:08,180
she has a bad teeth.

382
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,820
The porridge needs to be cooked a little softer.

383
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,660
Aunt likes the sugar-oil pancakes in the South Street.

384
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,540
It's more oily.

385
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,660
So, we need to absorb all the oil

386
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,980
from the oil-sucking paper.

387
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,700
Aunt likes the steamed buns in the West Street.

388
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,380
Am I right?

389
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,260
That shop is popular.

390
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,820
You have to line up in advance for half an hour.

391
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,500
Or you'll be late.

392
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,180
I don't need to.

393
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:21,980
I'm on a diet.

394
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,420
Don't you like that shop the most?

395
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,300
And Aunt.

396
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,340
Aunt came back from abroad.

397
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,500
So, she likes to eat white rice.

398
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,500
No matter it's

399
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,340
baguette or toast,

400
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,500
you have to prepare it.

401
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,940
The most important thing is coffee, right?

402
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,940
You have to grind it.

403
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:35,940
What did I say?

404
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,340
Is there anything else to add?

405
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,460
Why are you hitting me?

406
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,860
Grandma has a bad teeth.

407
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:50,900
Aunt likes to eat less oily sugar-oil pancakes.

408
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,340
Aunt likes the steamed buns in the South Street.

409
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,700
She needs to line up.

410
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,940
Aunt likes baguette.

411
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:57,940
And

412
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,300
coffee.

413
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,580
I can't drink coffee.

414
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,380
No problem.

415
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,620
I remember it all.

416
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,660
I'm a good person.

417
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,660
I like to get up early.

418
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,700
You can have a baby with me.

419
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,540
All my family name is Ye.

420
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,700
No problem.

421
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,380
I have only one family name.

422
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,500
So I decided to follow the national policy.

423
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,660
I have two children.

424
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,940
All my family name is Ye.

425
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,460
You can stay.

426
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,020
No problem.

427
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,740
Women's birth is not easy.

428
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,220
I understand your request.

429
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,740
And I don't have any requirements for my family name.

430
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,820
We are a family anyway.

431
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,100
Dr. Gao, if you don't tell me the truth,

432
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,300
how much will I pay you?

433
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,540
You agreed to marry me?

434
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,020
After grandma got married,

435
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
I don't need to buy a house and a car.

436
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,300
Her old house

437
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,020
is my name.

438
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,020
But after 50 years old...

439
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:02,660
After 50 years old, it's a small house.

440
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,540
Okay.

441
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,700
If Dr. Gao doesn't agree,

442
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,740
let's call it a day.

443
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,300
Okay?

444
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,620
I'm just kidding about the house.

445
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,780
I have a house and a car.

446
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,700
I mean

447
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,740
I'm willing to.

448
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,820
Good.

449
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:28,660
Let's talk.

450
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,380
Sit down.

451
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,740
What are you doing?

452
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,860
Dr. Gao,

453
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,020
let's keep a contact.

454
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,260
Okay.

455
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
What are you talking about?

456
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,940
Why do you keep a contact?

457
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,940
You have the right to have a contact.

458
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,300
Come on.

459
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,940
Let's go.

460
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:40,620
Let's go.

461
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,300
Take her back.

462
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,820
Okay.

463
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:42,900
You try it first.

464
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,580
Yeah.

465
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,100
Dr. Gao.

466
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,700
It's not right.

467
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,060
Dr. Gao.

468
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,260
You like coffee, too?

469
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,740
Why are you so nosy?

470
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,340
I've been to this house before.

471
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,020
What coffee?

472
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:51,780
Why do you drink coffee?

473
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,180
You're a Chinese.

474
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,180
You drink coffee every day.

475
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,660
What?

476
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,460
Is it better than your mom's coffee?

477
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,460
It's good for your health.

478
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,220
It's good for your health.

479
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,780
Li Jin Yu.

480
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,060
Li Jin Yu, are you home?

481
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,620
Li Jin Yu.

482
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:15,860
Yes.

483
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,660
Hello.

484
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,500
Good morning.

485
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:23,580
Good morning, sir.

486
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,860
Have a good sleep?

487
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,100
Are you going to show your problems at my place again?

488
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,820
I have a key today.

489
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,620
Why do you want to see me today?

490
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,180
There's no electricity now.

491
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,940
I want to lend you a toolbox.

492
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,420
So cute. What's your name?

493
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:47,620
Ping An.

494
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,300
Ping An.

495
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,860
I'm moving to the next room.

496
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,860
I'm your neighbor from now on.

497
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
What's he doing?

498
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,340
Why doesn't he come down?

499
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,700
He always wants to get on the rooftop.

500
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,780
But he can't.

501
00:23:58,780 --> 00:23:59,580
He's very stubborn.

502
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,740
You look like him.

503
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,660
Come on.

504
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,380
How's your hand?

505
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,140
It's fine.

506
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,060
That's good.

507
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,300
If something happens to your hands

508
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:10,300
when you play the piano,

509
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,500
I can't afford to pay you.

510
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,540
Thank you.

511
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,140
Goodbye.

512
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:33,820
Li Jin Yun.

513
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:35,540
Hi.

514
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,820
What else?

515
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,820
I don't know how to use the toolbox.

516
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,980
So I want to find a electrician

517
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,020
to settle the bill on time.

518
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,460
Thank you.

519
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,740
Thank you.

520
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,460
Meng.

521
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,900
I'm moving to Fang Ya En's house.

522
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,340
This kid.

523
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,300
Tong will moveん

524
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,060
to the apartment.

525
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,980
I found the electric Admissions.

526
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,660
Please take a look.

527
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,780
You remember that?

528
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,460
I found it

529
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:34,620
during the hospital visit that day.

530
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
You have very good memory.

531
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,620
I haven't remembered that.

532
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,220
How can you fix it if you don't remember?

533
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:41,900
You're done?

534
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,460
Yes.

535
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:44,740
That fast?

536
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:45,900
Thank you.

537
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,700
The light in my house is not on.

538
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,980
Are you sure you fixed it?

539
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,340
Actually, I don't need to fix it.

540
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,980
Because you forgot to pay the electricity bill.

541
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,180
Remember to pay me back the bill.

542
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,900
Okay.

543
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:29,980
What's wrong?

544
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,420
Give me your contact information.

545
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,300
I'll transfer the money to you.

546
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,180
Pay the bill.

547
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:41,660
Pay the bill.

548
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,860
New payment on time.

549
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,340
I'll transfer one hour to you.

550
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,140
Fifty yuan is enough.

551
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,380
What are you drinking?

552
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,660
Our drink is not ready yet.

553
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,900
I'm thirsty too.

554
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,820
There's water in the fridge.

555
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,540
Take it yourself.

556
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,620
Memory Palace.

557
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,420
I've seen this book.

558
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,620
I heard that this book is about

559
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,020
how to remember

560
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,620
some strange and fresh things

561
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,020
in the most familiar way.

562
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,420
It's like a room in your brain.

563
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,460
Every room can store

564
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,900
a lot of information, right?

565
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,300
Almost.

566
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,180
But it's not necessarily a room.

567
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,140
It's a room.

568
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,100
It's a room.

569
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
It's a room.

570
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
It's a room.

571
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
It's a room.

572
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,100
It's a room.

573
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
It's a room.

574
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,100
It's a room.

575
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,580
But it's not necessarily a room.

576
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:02,540
To put it simply,

577
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,340
it can be a person

578
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:05,900
or a sentence.

579
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:06,900
You're so serious.

580
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,220
Mom.

581
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,900
You can remember

582
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:10,780
familiar things

583
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,780
when you close your eyes.

584
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,620
When you need memories,

585
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,020
you can use your imagination

586
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,940
to bring them all in.

587
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:25,300
It'll be easier to remember things.

588
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,300
You're so good.

589
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,300
What university did you graduate from?

590
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,140
I didn't graduate from college.

591
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,140
I graduated from a high school.

592
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,180
A high school?

593
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,060
What?

594
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:39,420
You graduated from a prestigious university.

595
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,700
You look down on your high school graduation?

596
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,220
How is that possible?

597
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,980
I didn't graduate from a prestigious university.

598
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:48,700
Your Jiang Luzhi graduated from a prestigious university.

599
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,220
Besides, he doesn't look down on you.

600
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,940
How could I look down on you?

601
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,460
I broke up with him.

602
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,260
Right.

603
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Ex-girlfriend.

604
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,020
But the book of Memory Palace

605
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,300
is really impressive.

606
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,980
It's a good book.

607
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,580
It's not a good thing.

608
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,380
What's wrong with that?

609
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:11,420
If I had studied it earlier,

610
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,020
I might have passed Jiang Luzhi.

611
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,420
You don't even know

612
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,380
how hard it was to memorize the book.

613
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,380
You still can't memorize it.

614
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,580
Why do you always like to compare yourself with Jiang Luzhi?

615
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,780
It's not that I have to.

616
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:23,860
But didn't your brother say

617
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,980
he's better looking than me?

618
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,580
There are many people who are better looking than you.

619
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,940
Everyone has to compare themselves.

620
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:28,980
Who?

621
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,980
Tell me or listen to me?

622
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,180
Do you have anything else?

623
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,980
I'm fine.

624
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:39,820
I'm here.

625
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,460
I just want to ask you

626
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,420
if you're free tomorrow.

627
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,780
I want to treat you to dinner.

628
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,420
Hello?

629
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,100
My high school classmate is getting married next week.

630
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,620
She invited me to be her half-mother.

631
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,420
I'm going back to stay for two days.

632
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,940
Let's meet up then.

633
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:04,940
We'll talk face to face.

634
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,180
I'm not free tomorrow.

635
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,300
You mean dinner tomorrow?

636
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,060
I have something to do tomorrow.

637
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,620
Okay.

638
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Let's talk another day.

639
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,260
I'm leaving.

640
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,420
Thank you for your water.

641
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:24,940
Help me close the door.

642
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
No problem.

643
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,420
Okay.

644
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,020
Jing Yu.

645
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:25,220
Jing Yu.

646
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
What's wrong?

647
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,340
Dad.

648
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,980
Mom doesn't want me anymore.

649
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:30,980
Why would she?

650
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,180
She's just angry.

651
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,180
She won't.

652
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,180
I'll go to the country to ask her.

653
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,780
Don't abandon me.

654
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,500
I'll go back and tell mom.

655
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Let's go.

656
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:57,420
Li Jing Yu.

657
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,420
Li Jing Yu.

658
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Li Jing Yu.

659
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Li Jing Yu.

660
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,420
I can't believe it!

661
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:27,660
I love you, my dear

662
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,740
Li Jingyu

663
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,940
Li Jingyu

664
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,860
Someone is here

665
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,540
Li Jingyu

666
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,100
Do you want to try the heart-shaped double-peel milk

667
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,940
made by your good neighbor in China?

668
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,860
I made it myself

669
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,860
You made it yourself

670
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,340
Double-peel milk

671
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,060
I bought it myself

672
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,740
I bought it for you

673
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,380
What's wrong?

674
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,700
You look like a loser

675
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,100
If I make you happy,

676
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,140
can you get promoted?

677
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,020
Did something happen?

678
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,540
You're a good neighbor in China

679
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,580
You worry too much, don't you?

680
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Did anyone tell you that

681
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,860
you're so hard to deal with?

682
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,900
Don't eat the double-peel milk

683
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,980
What?

684
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,540
You asked Li Jingyu

685
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,820
if he wanted to date you

686
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,580
I'll be deaf if you make a noise

687
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,820
I didn't blame you

688
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,780
for telling me the big news

689
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,380
when I was eating

690
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,740
I was wondering why you were so kind today

691
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:07,540
and gave me the double-peel milk

692
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,100
Am I the one who saw the netizen?

693
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,740
Aren't you?

694
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,540
Stop it

695
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,740
Give it to me

696
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,620
I said you were so shameless

697
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,220
You told me two days ago

698
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:17,860
that he was Jiang Luzhi's ex-boyfriend

699
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:19,220
I couldn't find him

700
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,300
It's only been a few days

701
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,420
He's a dog now

702
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:23,140
I'm a dog

703
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,940
I'm just because

704
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,460
he grew up on my aesthetic point

705
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:26,700
My family is in a hurry to get married

706
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:27,660
Don't I need a boyfriend

707
00:36:27,660 --> 00:36:28,580
to be my shield?

708
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,540
Come on

709
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,460
Jiang Luzhi has been pressuring you for so many years

710
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:33,420
You want to catch up with his ex-boyfriend

711
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,340
and turn the tables

712
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,500
Now it's a turn-over

713
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:37,980
It's hard to deal with my brother

714
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:42,620
You're talking about your brother

715
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,060
He's coming

716
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:48,020
Why is he here?

717
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,820
I got a new model recently

718
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,100
I need a pat

719
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,420
I can do the part-time job

720
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,820
I can make it sweet

721
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,100
Sister Yan

722
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,580
Ye Meng bought me a double-peel milk

723
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,540
Try it, it's very sweet

724
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,100
No need

725
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:13,700
Well

726
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:14,980
You're here today

727
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
to hang my new model

728
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,100
And some of them are going to the warehouse

729
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,860
And some are tired

730
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,700
I need to deliver the goods today

731
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:22,740
No problem

732
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,740
OK, ask Ye Meng

733
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,580
He knows

734
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,860
I'll get the delivery order

735
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:28,860
I'll help you

736
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:29,540
You go ahead

737
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,460
Go ahead

738
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,260
You can talk to me, right?

739
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,020
You can call me sister Yan

740
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,540
when you're with Ya'an

741
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,140
You're so cold to me

742
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,380
Money is a service

743
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,300
You need to pay more

744
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,180
What are you doing here?

745
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,060
Boss

746
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,620
I need a part-time job

747
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:12,620
I'm busy

748
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,060
You're here to see Yan

749
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,100
I'll go to call the police

750
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,660
No

751
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,700
I'm looking for you

752
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,780
Let's talk outside

753
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,820
What's up?

754
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,100
I

755
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,020
I'm here to apologize

756
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,620
I know

757
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,300
you tried to provoke me on purpose

758
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,100
You know

759
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,900
I can't really do anything to you

760
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:42,980
I can't

761
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:46,060
be your water-sweeper

762
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,860
OK, I see

763
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,780
Anything else?

764
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,940
What's your relationship with him?

765
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,500
You're younger than him

766
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,420
Don't call him that

767
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,540
Anyway, you should stay away from him

768
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,660
Don't be so nice to him

769
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:04,220
He's not a good person

770
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,300
He fought with someone when he first came here

771
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,740
He went to the ICU

772
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,260
If he hadn't spent hundreds of thousands

773
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,340
on the coffin

774
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,460
he would have been dead

775
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:13,540
Cheng Kairen, you didn't fight when you were a kid?

776
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,660
You're young and crazy

777
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,860
You must be jealous

778
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,780
Anyway

779
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:20,100
I can't even finish his three-day and three-night work

780
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,820
He's a real jerk

781
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,900
He's in my bar

782
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,380
He's always messing with women

783
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,860
All the women in town

784
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,820
are being bullied by him

785
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,460
Remember that Mrs. Zhang in town?

786
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,180
She's bald

787
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,980
Two days ago

788
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,300
he was in the women's toilet in my bar

789
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,180
with a woman

790
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,020
I knew it

791
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:36,300
I knew it

792
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,300
I knew it

793
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:41,820
You knew it?

794
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:48,020
You were the one who was in the coffin

795
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:52,860
When did you two meet?

796
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
Just now

797
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:54,860
Just now?

798
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,460
He lied to me when he first met you

799
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,740
That little bastard

800
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,700
I really forgot who gave him the car

801
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:04,820
He

802
00:40:06,340 --> 00:40:07,620
doesn't like you, right?

803
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
Cheng Kairen

804
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
I'm sorry

805
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,700
I didn't mean to

806
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,780
I didn't mean to

807
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,860
I didn't mean to

808
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,780
Cheng Kairen

809
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,740
I advise you not to do anything

810
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:19,820
If I were to be locked up

811
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,340
I'd be out of control

812
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,540
Listen

813
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,900
If I find someone who's causing him trouble

814
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,100
you'll be the one to blame

815
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:36,180
Why are you still here?

816
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,020
No, Ye Meng, I'm...

817
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,180
You two

818
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:40,900
You're here to see me

819
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,260
Why are you so angry?

820
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,300
Are you here to mess up the place?

821
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:47,060
You're so cruel, Yang Jian

822
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,980
Leave me alone

823
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:49,420
I'm cursed

824
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Well

825
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:56,140
If you need help in the future

826
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,460
just tell me

827
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,060
I'll ask someone else to come

828
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,380
Alright

829
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,780
If someone you're looking for comes

830
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,940
who dares to come in?

831
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,820
I'll be in big trouble in a few days

832
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:06,020
It's okay

833
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,340
It's okay

834
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,420
I'm busy

835
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:11,380
What are you doing here?

836
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,460
I heard your leg was injured

837
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:13,460
Come and have a look

838
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,780
Stop acting, okay?

839
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,940
Didn't I tell you

840
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:20,300
we'd meet in the civil affairs bureau in the冷静期

841
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,820
I want to take my son back to live for a few days

842
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:22,940
Grandma misses her grandson

843
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,980
Now you want to be a good father

844
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:27,860
Ye Meng

845
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,220
I heard you couldn't get married in Jiangbei

846
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,100
You're funny

847
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,340
You've been in the capital for so many years

848
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,540
but you still didn't get married

849
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,940
after you got a bad three-pronged

850
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,420
I'll ask you to go back to your hometown

851
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:39,500
and find a stable job

852
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,180
Maybe you'll find someone serious

853
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,420
to be your husband

854
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,500
Who are you?

855
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,940
You're talking about Yang Yang?

856
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,060
Who are you?

857
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,780
Let me introduce you to a man

858
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,100
Chen Jian

859
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,540
Ya'an's ex-husband

860
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:56,060
is a very serious man

861
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,460
What are you talking about?

862
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,940
Besides, what's the ex-husband?

863
00:41:58,940 --> 00:42:00,020
I'm not engaged

864
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,100
It's almost time

865
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:02,620
If you want to end the divorce in advance

866
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,540
and get married in the cold period, that's okay

867
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:06,300
Ya'an can sue you right away

868
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,460
Didn't he save your life

869
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,260
because you're the child's father?

870
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,700
You should go

871
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,540
I've already known your demand

872
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,180
When Jiayu comes back

873
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:18,060
I'll see what he thinks

874
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,540
Okay

875
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,900
Be careful with your education

876
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:22,860
and bring back the child

877
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:26,220
Ye Meng

878
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:29,100
You're the one who's good at this

879
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,380
You're being embarrassed

880
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,660
and he doesn't even dare to help you

881
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:35,300
Do you need it?

882
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:37,460
Do I need it?

883
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,340
Okay

884
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:43,900
Okay

885
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,540
You don't have to go to my place

886
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,140
You've found a part-time job

887
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,500
If you have any problems in the future

888
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,580
you can ask your sister Ye

889
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,860
Come on, get some fruit beans

890
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,140
You two can keep it for yourself

891
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:15,700
Zhu Jiaxin

892
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,000
Accompany you next time

893
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,320
I know you've aced outfit

894
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,360
I'll go to catch up with you

895
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,260
Okay

896
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,640
Come home

897
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,520
Brat

898
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,360
xy

899
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,220
Serves you right

900
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:38,860
Have you eaten yet?

901
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:41,680
What exactly

902
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:46,440
I saw you, I thought of you

903
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:52,680
I heard all the news from you

904
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,040
The love that's been reflected in my heart

905
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,160
occupies my mind

906
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,080
Where should I go?

907
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,280
How can I avoid

908
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,920
those memories about you ?

909
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,920
I hate that.

910
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:22,120
But in such a big way,

911
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:27,140
I can't help but remember

912
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,880
I буду את dürfen

913
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,800
and change my love to good luck

914
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:42,000
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading

915
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:46,300
I pretend to be firm

916
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:52,000
But I'm still obsessed with the source

917
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,100
The most perfect lie

918
00:44:57,100 --> 00:45:00,200
Deceives myself

919
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:06,200
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

920
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:12,200
Why is this the moment of tears

921
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,200
Heart still keeps

922
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,200
The most perfect lie

923
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:39,200
Deceives myself
