00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the remaining memories like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath is gradually missing at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is me who loves you so much

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that song has my dream

Episode 16

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
But please don't be too harsh on him

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Jin Yu had serious psychological illness many years ago

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Today, his psychologist has arrived

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
There will be a detailed explanation about his illness after the meeting

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
But no matter what the reason is, it's my fault

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
With the attitude of being responsible for everyone

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Li Jin Yu will completely quit Hailangang

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And I will also take the responsibility of this accident with him

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Our Hanhai Group will give the sovereignty of Hailangang forever

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The Lin Group will take full responsibility

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I am Lin Yang Yang from Lin Group

27
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Next, we will completely dismantle the existing 2nd phase of the project

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Rebuild Hailangang and welcome the villagers to supervise the reconstruction

29
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So I announce here

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What's going on?

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What's going on?

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Why is it still laughing?

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What's going on?

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Look, there's a picture

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Look, look, look

36
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Take a look

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Take a picture

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What are you doing?

39
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Shut up

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Are you done?

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Shut up

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm done

43
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't be so agitated

44
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Agitated

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Who is this?

46
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Hello, everyone

47
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm Ye Meng, the PR manager of Hailangang

48
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
As you can see

49
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
This is the scene of the 2nd phase construction site a week ago

50
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
You can see that all the materials for the construction site are in accordance with the regulations

51
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm the PR manager of Hailangang

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm Ye Meng

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'm Ye Meng

54
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm Ye Meng

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm Ye Meng

56
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm Ye Meng

57
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm Ye Meng

58
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm Ye Meng

59
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm Ye Meng

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm Ye Meng

61
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'm Ye Meng

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'm Ye Meng

63
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm Ye Meng

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Miss Lin

65
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You can testify for us

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
But after the project was launched

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
All materials for the construction site

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
All of them are in disarray

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Coincidentally

70
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The monitoring video of this period

71
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Has also been transferred by someone

72
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Director Li

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Director Li

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Li Jingyu is the first person in charge of the project

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
He won't make trouble

76
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And set the project up by himself

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Of course I hope Li Jingyu

78
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Has nothing to do with this

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
But as a PR manager

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What status and qualifications do you have

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
To represent Manager Li

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
And you even disrupt the public order

83
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Security, get someone out for me

84
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What do you want?

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Who says I have no qualifications and status?

86
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm Li Jingyu's legal partner

87
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Do I have qualifications now?

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Director Li, you want Li Jingyu to quit the group

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Why don't you talk to her?

90
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
After all, what she cares about

91
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Is your mother

92
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Li Jingyu is married

93
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why are you hiding from me?

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Yin Yin

95
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If there are evidence

96
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Who knows if Li Jingyu

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Diss Billie Br Sea

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Li Jingyu is insane

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The insane thing

100
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
When did he get it out?

101
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
All believe in him

102
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
In addition

103
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Is there anyone in video

104
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Withifa mala

105
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Right

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Did he fell for it?

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
No

108
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes

109
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:26,720
I got it.

110
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,960
I happened to pass by the warehouse that day.

111
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,960
I saw someone sneaking around.

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,440
So I recorded a video with my phone.

113
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,840
Go forward.

114
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,680
Be careful.

115
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,360
Go over there.

116
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,360
It's over if he's here.

117
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,520
Okay, I'll go ahead.

118
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,480
Okay, go ahead.

119
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,000
You're the one who's in charge of the post-mortem.

120
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,720
What?

121
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,680
It's not me.

122
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,560
It's not me.

123
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,160
Run.

124
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,720
It's not me.

125
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,560
It's not me.

126
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,120
Don't move.

127
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,840
Where are you going?

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,120
It's not me.

129
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,000
It's not me.

130
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,680
It's the Commander.

131
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:03,920
Mr. Li.

132
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Who's the one who's stealing Han Zhuo's money?

133
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,400
It seems that it's a dragon.

134
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,920
I'll let the police investigate this person.

135
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,720
But considering the safety of the project,

136
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,560
Jin Yu's current mental condition

137
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,600
is indeed not suitable for managing Hailangang.

138
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,840
Hello, everyone.

139
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,480
I'm Yang Bingzheng, Li Jin Yu's chief doctor.

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,960
Here,

141
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,480
I use my professional experience

142
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,320
and professional diagnosis to prove

143
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,400
that Mr. Li Jin Yu's mental condition

144
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,720
is normal.

145
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,920
It won't affect his work.

146
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:53,960
Dr. Yang.

147
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,280
Mr. Li.

148
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,760
This is the current diagnosis result of Li Jin Yu.

149
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,160
If you have any doubts,

150
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,280
you can ask a professional psychologist

151
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,160
to diagnose again.

152
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,200
Dr. Yang has said

153
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920
that Li Jin Yu's mental condition is normal.

154
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,280
Li Jin Yu was originally in charge of this project.

155
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,040
I think the best solution

156
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,520
is to let Li Jin Yu come back and continue to be in charge

157
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,880
and give an explanation to the public.

158
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,200
Mr. Li.

159
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,480
Or do you want to continue to insist

160
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
that your son is sick in public?

161
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,040
How can I hope that my son is sick?

162
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,560
Which mother doesn't love her child?

163
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
Please be responsible for your words.

164
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,720
Bullshit.

165
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,680
Li Bai, shut up.

166
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,160
This is...

167
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,800
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

168
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,160
Let go.

169
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,920
Grandma, why are you here?

170
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
Grandma.

171
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,840
Every mother

172
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,360
is the biggest misfortune

173
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,160
to have a mother like you.

174
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,400
Don't make a fuss.

175
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
You dare to talk nonsense.

176
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,360
What am I afraid of?

177
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,200
Listen.

178
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,120
A cruel woman

179
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,760
threw her own son

180
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,240
who is less than seven

181
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,440
outside.

182
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
The big leaves

183
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,160
were scared by the storm

184
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,280
and even got thunder.

185
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,440
You want her to die, right?

186
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,360
Why didn't you know

187
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,800
that you are a mother?

188
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,760
Tell me.

189
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,600
It's true, mom.

190
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,600
I'm so angry.

191
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,280
What truth is this?

192
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,600
Li Jingli

193
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,720
has no psychological change at all.

194
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,840
This cruel woman

195
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,280
forced my baby grandson

196
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:36,640
to find a psychologist.

197
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,760
She watched him every day

198
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,480
and locked my baby grandson

199
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,080
in a small dark room.

200
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,200
She even found a lot of people outside

201
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,400
to brainwash him

202
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,120
and said that my baby grandson

203
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,840
is sick.

204
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:50,640
You are the one who is sick.

205
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,800
I told you

206
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,440
that I warned you

207
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,880
not to hurt my baby grandson again.

208
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,680
I...

209
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,680
I will never let go of you.

210
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
I'll kick you out.

211
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,920
Where are you going?

212
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,080
I haven't finished talking.

213
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:12,320
Grandma.

214
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Li Li.

215
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,280
Don't be angry.

216
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,280
Don't be angry at that woman.

217
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,000
That's her biological son.

218
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,520
Press the news today.

219
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,480
Don't spread

220
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,440
bad rumors to the company.

221
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay, let's go.

222
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

223
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,920
We won't accept

224
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,520
this bad deal.

225
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,760
You want to take me as your pawn.

226
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,520
You shouldn't be so arrogant.

227
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,200
This is a human Consumer Protection Regulation.

228
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,440
A military management agency

229
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:45,160
after the military guards

230
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,000
Betrayed my family

231
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,640
Are you thinner?

232
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,640
Do you feel uncomfortable?

233
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,560
I'm asking you.

234
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,120
Do you feel uncomfortable?

235
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,280
I'm not uncomfortable.

236
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,040
I'm just thinking

237
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,760
that I've married a great wife.

238
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,960
All right.

239
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,280
I'm fine now.

240
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:15,840
Don't worry.

241
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,080
I'm fine now.

242
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,800
Let's go home.

243
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,680
All right.

244
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,320
All materials for construction

245
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,760
are in accordance with the regulations.

246
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,560
Miss Lin,

247
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,080
you can testify for us.

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,960
What?

249
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
It says

250
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,360
Miss Chao A

251
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,560
is the CEO of Hanhai Group,

252
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,960
and she's thin and pretty.

253
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,960
She's really a human being.

254
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,200
All right. Stop it.

255
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,200
Are you shy?

256
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,120
No.

257
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,920
You're still shy.

258
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm so busy

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,440
at the press conference.

260
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,520
Actually, I'm really scared to death.

261
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,760
I'm really worried

262
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,360
that you'll be taken away by the police.

263
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm not worried at all.

264
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,120
Because I know

265
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,560
that my wife is the most powerful person in the world.

266
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,520
She'll be like a hero

267
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,960
who steps on seven colors to save me.

268
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,640
What?

269
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,120
Are you playing a movie with me?

270
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:40,640
All right.

271
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,440
It's my fault.

272
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,560
I made you worried.

273
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,440
Go to sleep.

274
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,000
Okay.

275
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,160
Lin Jing Yu.

276
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,600
I'll protect you from now on.

277
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,040
All right.

278
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,080
Mom, I'm going out.

279
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,160
Where are you going?

280
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,560
The school is holding a performance.

281
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,960
Brother Kai will pick me up later.

282
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,720
He'll come later?

283
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Yes.

284
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,120
Call him quickly.

285
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,040
Don't let him come.

286
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,080
I'll send you later.

287
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,760
Don't bother others.

288
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,840
Yang.

289
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,120
I'm here to pick up Jiayu.

290
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,440
Brother Kai, let's go.

291
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,120
Kai Kai.

292
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,560
No need.

293
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
There's no sound in my store today.

294
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,640
I'll send him later.

295
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,880
I've agreed.

296
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,160
Don't think too much.

297
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,200
No.

298
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm free today.

299
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,280
I'll send him.

300
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
You can do your work.

301
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,080
Yan.

302
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,920
I'll take my friend to see around.

303
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Okay.

304
00:13:58,680 --> 00:13:59,640
Get busy.

305
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,240
You can't leave at once.

306
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,120
I've promised to send you home today.

307
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,480
Thank you.

308
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,160
Let's go.

309
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,360
Jiayu.

310
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,640
Do you want to call your dad for your performance?

311
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,680
I'll call him.

312
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
I'll call him.

313
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,600
Mom, don't worry about these things.

314
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,360
We're late. Let's go.

315
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:19,760
Let's go.

316
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,520
Bye.

317
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,320
We'll go to the old house later.

318
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,160
Bye.

319
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,840
Do you know that

320
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,360
Chen Jiayu's parents are divorced?

321
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,040
Really?

322
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,640
Chen Jiayu is so poor.

323
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,520
How can I be poor?

324
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,000
Although my parents are divorced,

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
my mom is still my mom.

326
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,760
My dad is still my dad.

327
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,040
They're all the same.

328
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,880
What's wrong?

329
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,880
What's wrong with the divorce?

330
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,360
He has parents and me.

331
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,560
Who are you?

332
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,040
He's my brother Kai.

333
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,160
This is my brother Yu.

334
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,600
Smile.

335
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,360
Go.

336
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,560
I'll go with you.

337
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,280
Go.

338
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,600
Do you have any more plays?

339
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,680
Little Red Riding Hood.

340
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,920
The War of Wolf and the Worm.

341
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,520
Little Red Riding Hood.

342
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,160
The War of Wolf and the Worm.

343
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,160
Now Little Red Riding Hood

344
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,320
is so strong.

345
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,200
It can fight with the wolf and the worm.

346
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,400
What?

347
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,920
It's six to one.

348
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,360
Six to one?

349
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,320
Who's so unlucky?

350
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,880
Acting as the wolf and the worm.

351
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,600
I know them.

352
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Xu.

353
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,440
We're waiting for you.

354
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,760
Go and try our Grandma's costume.

355
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,200
Let's get into the acting.

356
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,040
Me too.

357
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,120
Stand well.

358
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,960
Stand up.

359
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,600
Go stand well.

360
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,680
Stand in your positions.

361
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
Jia Yu, knock on the door and say something

362
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:12,240
Is Little Red Riding Hood home?

363
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
I'm a grandma

364
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,360
Jia Yu, you have to make a louder voice

365
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,680
Otherwise, the audience below the stage

366
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,840
won't hear what you say

367
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,280
Is Little Red Riding Hood home?

368
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm a grandma

369
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:21,920
Come on

370
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,640
I'm a grandma

371
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,480
I'm a grandma

372
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm a grandma

373
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,320
I'm a grandma

374
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm a grandma

375
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,800
I'm a grandma

376
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,560
Stop

377
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,520
We're not right

378
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,640
Come on, come to me

379
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,920
Are you okay?

380
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm fine

381
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
I think you have a headache

382
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm fine

383
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,160
Why did you ask me to send you here today?

384
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,960
Do you know that you have to play this

385
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,080
grandma?

386
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,120
I don't want my mom to see

387
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,640
my grandma who plays A-SOUL

388
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,920
But in the end, when the show is over

389
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,200
my mom will find out

390
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,880
Jia Yu, let's rehearse again

391
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,040
Let's stand here

392
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,880
Hello, teacher

393
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,040
Hello

394
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,280
I want to ask

395
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,640
You rehearse this play

396
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,560
to improve the child's

397
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,920
self-defense, right?

398
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
Yes

399
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,520
Jia Yu, the image of a grandma

400
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,680
is not suitable for her

401
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,080
I think it's not suitable for any child to play

402
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,680
It will make them not united

403
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:24,400
What do you mean?

404
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,680
I mean

405
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,080
I have a suggestion

406
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,000
Suggestion?

407
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,000
Next, please enjoy

408
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160
the play of the second year and three classes

409
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,320
Seven Little Red Riding Hoods

410
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,360
Battle Wolf Grandma

411
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,800
Long, long ago

412
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,280
In the fairy tale village

413
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,200
lived a group of cute little red hats

414
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,680
They lived happily

415
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,000
Until one day

416
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,280
a guest came to the village

417
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,720
I heard that

418
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,960
this family can have a baby

419
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,640
Seven Little Red Riding Hoods

420
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,440
I can eat enough food for a year

421
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,560
Little Red Riding Hoods

422
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,880
Are you at home?

423
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,160
Yes

424
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:17,920
Who are you?

425
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:20,720
I am the grandma who played the video just now

426
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,360
Yes, yes, yes

427
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,160
Open the door

428
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,320
Let us see who is it

429
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,600
Grandma, why are your ears

430
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,800
so red?

431
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,400
Why are your ears so big?

432
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,280
Yes, why are your ears

433
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,080
as thick as bubbles?

434
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,880
Are you the stupid wolf in the forest

435
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,560
who caught our grandma?

436
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,680
I... I am really

437
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,360
the grandma who is lovely and kind

438
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,560
in the show

439
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
Mom Jiayu

440
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,320
Your big nephew is quite good

441
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,000
He is not my nephew

442
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,960
He is my brother

443
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,040
I just saw Jiayu

444
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,040
calling him brother

445
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,200
He is good to Jiayu

446
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,480
Jiayu is unwilling to play

447
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,960
the grandma who was beaten

448
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,960
He asked for the position

449
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,680
of the top

450
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,040
It's rare that parents

451
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,160
will cooperate with children like this

452
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,680
I am going to open the door

453
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,600
You step back

454
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,240
OK

455
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,200
I am coming in

456
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,560
Why is there no one?

457
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,720
Kill

458
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,040
Now the little red

459
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,040
is more powerful than the red

460
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,720
It's really more powerful than the red

461
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
Kids

462
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,600
You must learn from the little red

463
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:49,320
Don't bully strangers

464
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,000
In the internet world

465
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,840
1,700,000

466
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,760
The price of the house must increase

467
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,760
I am going to the forest

468
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,200
I will go to the forest

469
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,560
I will go to the forest

470
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,080
I will go to the forest

471
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,560
I will go to the forest

472
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,000
I will go to the forest

473
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,520
I will go to the forest

474
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,920
I will go to the forest

475
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,520
I will go to the forest

476
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,080
I will go to the forest

477
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,520
I will go to the forest

478
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,120
I will go to the forest

479
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,520
I will go to the forest

480
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,000
I will go to the forest

481
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,400
I will go to the forest

482
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,000
I will go to the forest

483
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,400
I will go to the forest

484
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,000
I will go to the forest

485
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
I will go to the forest

486
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,240
I will go to the forest

487
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,160
She coins

488
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:52,960
Respect

489
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,680
Nude

490
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,480
América

491
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,720
especially

492
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,920
Me

493
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,640
Love

494
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,360
is it true

495
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,560
or false

496
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,600
No

497
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Mr. Carlos

498
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,160
You

499
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,440
I'm the one who got hit.

500
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,000
Play the song.

501
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,720
You're here.

502
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,320
It was decided temporarily today.

503
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,520
I didn't tell you.

504
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,080
You two acted so well.

505
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,960
You're so tacit.

506
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,200
Jiayu,

507
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,760
mom will act, too.

508
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,440
If there's a good chance like this in the future,

509
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,560
remember to think of me.

510
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,480
Forget it.

511
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,640
I don't want to play the role of being hit in the future.

512
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
I want to act like a little red hat.

513
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,960
Strong and smart.

514
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,240
Strong.

515
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,320
Brother Kai, can you teach me how to punch?

516
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:56,080
Then I can protect my mom.

517
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,040
Hard work can't solve any problems.

518
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,160
We have to use knowledge to arm ourselves.

519
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:02,880
Brother Kai,

520
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,600
I think you've changed.

521
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,040
You taught me all this.

522
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,320
I...

523
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,320
I'm...

524
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,920
Okay, I won't tease you.

525
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
From tomorrow on, I'll teach you how to punch.

526
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,200
But I have to say something ugly.

527
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,520
It's hard to play boxing.

528
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,840
You should be prepared.

529
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,760
I won't be merciless even if you cry.

530
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,000
Okay, you can come over.

531
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,120
I'm not afraid of you.

532
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,520
I'll give you a punch.

533
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:31,680
Brother Kai, send me back.

534
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,040
I have something to do later.

535
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,360
I'll go first.

536
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,200
By the way,

537
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,640
I forgot to tell you two

538
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,720
that my bar

539
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
has been changed to a restaurant.

540
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,680
Li Jingyu, Ye Meng and I have told you

541
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:47,600
that you'll come to the venue

542
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,680
for the opening ceremony.

543
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,960
Why is the bar

544
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,080
changed to a restaurant?

545
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,440
Well,

546
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,720
Jiayu is still a kid.

547
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,960
He can't go to the bar.

548
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,040
Brother Yu, my buddy.

549
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,680
Don't worry, I'll definitely come to the venue.

550
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,200
I'm leaving.

551
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,360
Bye.

552
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:06,720
Bye.

553
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,480
Brother Kai, bye.

554
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,280
Bye.

555
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
Why do I feel a little sad when Brother Kai comes?

556
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,160
Jiayu,

557
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,560
do you like Brother Kai?

558
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,720
He really likes me.

559
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,240
I really like him, too.

560
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,880
Little kid, you're so cute.

561
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,000
Your adult world is so complicated.

562
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,680
It's not as simple as our kids.

563
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,080
Okay, okay, stop talking about adults.

564
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Let's go back to the hotel.

565
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,880
I'm going to sleep.

566
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm going to sleep.

567
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,400
I'm going to sleep.

568
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,160
I'm going to sleep.

569
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,760
I'm going to sleep.

570
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm going to sleep.

571
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,200
I'm going to sleep.

572
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:43,920
I'm going to sleep.

573
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,600
Let's go home.

574
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Take your time.

575
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,760
Okay.

576
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,480
Little chicken.

577
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,840
It's interesting.

578
00:23:59,200 --> 00:23:59,920
It's time to eat.

579
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
Where are you going?

580
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,280
I have something to do at the company.

581
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,120
I'm going out.

582
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,000
You can cook for yourself.

583
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,440
I'm leaving.

584
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,120
Bye.

585
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:11,680
Bye.

586
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:14,800
Lu Mepirou!

587
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:15,880
Take your time.

588
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,120
I'm on a business trip.

589
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,840
Good night.

590
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,160
Coming.

591
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:47,500
You can bother her yourself bring me fallen flowers

592
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,520
come

593
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,500
sit

594
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,100
Thank you

595
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,420
approximately

596
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:04,840
Come

597
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:05,440
Thank you

598
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,120
Sister Ye Wang

599
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,440
In fact, I came today

600
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
I don't even know who used me.

601
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,280
But you're fine.

602
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,160
I almost forgot.

603
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I still have the knife of Tan Huang.

604
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,120
I'm kidding.

605
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,440
Thank you for helping us

606
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,480
at the press conference.

607
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,680
If you want to say thank you,

608
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,240
we should thank you.

609
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,200
No, no, no.

610
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,320
Don't worry, Sister Yimeng.

611
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,480
I won't do that again.

612
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,840
I'll work hard

613
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,240
to take care of

614
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,520
the younger siblings of the welfare home

615
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:45,680
and set a good example for them.

616
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,520
I believe you.

617
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,600
You can do it.

618
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,920
Right.

619
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,320
I'm here to give you something.

620
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,880
I found some photos of your mother

621
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,440
when I was a kid in the welfare home.

622
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,800
I think I should keep it as a souvenir for you.

623
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,080
Thank you.

624
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,960
Have some tea.

625
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,080
Thank you.

626
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,200
Wake up.

627
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:19,680
I'm nervous.

628
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,040
It's my father.

629
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,280
I'm not nervous at all.

630
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,320
Let's go.

631
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:24,720
This way.

632
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,000
Sister Meng.

633
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
Is this your mother?

634
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,680
The one with short hair.

635
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,600
in the welfare home.

636
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,880
There was a man called

637
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,440
Li Lingbai.

638
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:46,920
They were fighting.

639
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
They were very fierce.

640
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,080
Why did you do that?

641
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,840
I didn't do anything wrong to you.

642
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,560
I hate you.

643
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,480
I want you to feel my pain.

644
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,280
Why?

645
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:07,360
What's wrong with you?

646
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,640
Aren't we good friends?

647
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,040
Nice to meet you.

648
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,480
How is this?

649
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,720
I made a trip to see you.

650
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,280
Hope you like it.

651
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,720
I'm here to go by lord hermit.

652
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,760
You asked me to give it to you.

653
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,360
It's good.

654
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,440
It's just that at first you've Inter enormously.

655
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,280
But too bad that

656
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,320
I always have an empty stomach

657
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,480
for be there for me.

658
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:35,240
I also used it to

659
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,040
help herきます my feelings

660
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:08,880
I'm sorry.

661
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,000
We used to call your mother Yi.

662
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,320
This is Xiaobai.

663
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,000
This photo

664
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,600
seems to be taken on the day Xiaobai was adopted.

665
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,760
In my memory,

666
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,040
they were very close.

667
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,360
They were always together.

668
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,280
Later, Xiaobai was adopted by Xianyuan.

669
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,200
The adopter

670
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,160
wanted to adopt your mother at first.

671
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,840
But later,

672
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,160
your mother gave the opportunity to Xiaobai.

673
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,280
What's up?

674
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,680
You put so much effort

675
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,440
to plan such a big plan

676
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,800
not just to get back my equity,

677
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,960
but also to avoid the scandal between you and Mr. Wang

678
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,480
in Tianhui City that year

679
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,200
being exposed.

680
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
So you were in a hurry to let Lin Shi take over.

681
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,320
What's your relationship with Ye Meng's mother?

682
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,520
Li Jingyu,

683
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,520
you have a bad taste.

684
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,680
You like a

685
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,640
fraudster's daughter.

686
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,720
She has been a fake since she was a child.

687
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,240
She pretended to be a model and made people like her.

688
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,840
Everyone was fooled by her appearance.

689
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,160
She is the real fraudster.

690
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,360
You are back.

691
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,160
You are back.

692
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,600
You went out?

693
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,200
I went out for a while.

694
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,360
Take a nap.

695
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,560
Fraudster?

696
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,680
Is she a fraudster

697
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,120
or the victim of this case?

698
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,520
I'm the victim

699
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,760
of what you did

700
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,280
at the press conference, right?

701
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,200
She knew Mr. Wang.

702
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,280
She was set up.

703
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:16,880
It must not be a coincidence.

704
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,800
It must have something to do with you.

705
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,800
Next time,

706
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,760
bring evidence to me.

707
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Okay.

708
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,320
Okay.

709
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,240
Hello?

710
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,680
Miss Ye,

711
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,600
I'm Fat Head Tuo.

712
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,520
Mr. Wang

713
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,400
is missing, right?

714
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:58,960
How do you know?

715
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,480
He left me a USB drive.

716
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,920
He said if he didn't show up this month,

717
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,360
he would let me contact you.

718
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,400
You must be very interested in this USB drive

719
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,480
and you will be very surprised.

720
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,640
Where are you?

721
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,560
I'll go find you right away.

722
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,280
Hurry up and tell us where you hid the stuff.

723
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,960
We don't want to bother you.

724
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,080
Mr. Fang...

725
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
Mr. Fang was strawberry.

726
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,800
lens in his pocket.

727
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,520
Yeah.

728
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,400
If you kill me,

729
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,880
dalang aga,

730
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,680
you people

731
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,800
will be felt like

732
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,400
rightfully identified.

733
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,560
You really want some death, don't you?

734
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:58,600
Here.

735
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,560
Han.

736
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,880
Your Highness. Your Highness.

737
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,680
Your Highness.

738
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,640
Your Highness. Your Highness.

739
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:55,440
Your Highness.

740
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
Let... let these two guys out.

741
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,600
I... I have something to tell you.

742
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Li Jun...

743
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Bai...

744
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Zhe...

745
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,600
This...

746
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,600
How can I...

747
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,600
How can I...

748
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:24,600
Xiao Xiao.

749
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:29,600
I'm sorry.

750
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,600
I think there's something following us.

751
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,600
It's Li Lin Bai.

752
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
He might have a right-hand man.

753
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,600
Let's split up.

754
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:31,480
The

755
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,600
Squat down.

756
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Let's see where they're going.

757
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,600
Okay.

758
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,600
I'll go.

759
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,600
Be careful.

760
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,600
I'll go.

761
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,600
Did Mr. Wang disappear?

762
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,600
He left me a USB drive.

763
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,600
This USB drive must be very interesting.

764
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
And it will be very expensive.

765
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,600
Stop right there!

766
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,600
I'll go.

767
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,600
This way.

768
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,600
It's that way.

769
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
Thank you.

770
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,600
Thank you.

771
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,600
I'll go.

772
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,600
Please open the door and take out the goods.

773
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,600
Close the door.

774
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,600
I'll put the USB drive in the hotel's courier.

775
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,600
After I get the account,

776
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,600
I'll give you the password.

777
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,600
Okay?

778
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,600
How are you? Are you hurt?

779
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,600
I'm fine. Where's the USB drive?

780
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,600
It's with me.

781
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Why is there nothing on the USB drive?

782
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,600
It's empty.

783
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,600
I'll call him.

784
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,600
Hello.

785
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,600
The number you have dialed cannot be connected for the moment.

786
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,600
We might have been fooled.

787
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,600
It seems that this Fat Head

788
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,600
has left a message for himself.

789
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,600
No.

790
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
We have to find Fat Head

791
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,600
before we find out that our USB drive is fake.

792
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
What's wrong?

793
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,600
Are you in a bad mood?

794
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
No.

795
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:51,600
I'm a little tired.

796
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:52,600
I'll take a shower.

797
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:04,600
I'm sorry.

798
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,600
I'm sorry.

799
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,600
I'm sorry.

800
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,600
I'm sorry.

801
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,600
I'm sorry.

802
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,600
I'm sorry.

803
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:10,600
I'm sorry.

804
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,600
I'm sorry.

805
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:12,600
I'm sorry.

806
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:13,600
I'm sorry.

807
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm sorry.

808
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:41,600
A free USB drive

809
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,600
and you're still in the same group.

810
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,560
You can't even do such a small thing.

811
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,200
What do you think you can do?

812
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,760
Is it useful for me to bite you?

813
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,240
I'd rather raise a dog.

814
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:53,920
A dog can also help me

815
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,280
guard the door and bite people.

816
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,600
You

817
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:14,600
I saw you

818
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:17,600
I thought of you

819
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,600
I heard any news about you

820
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
The love that was reflected in my heart

821
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Enclosed my thoughts

822
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:36,600
Go

823
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:39,600
Where to go

824
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:44,600
How to avoid

825
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,600
Those memories about you

826
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:55,600
I'm so addicted to you

827
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Can't stop

828
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:05,600
I'm silent

829
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,600
Put the flowers in the back yard

830
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:14,600
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

831
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:19,600
Pretend to be firm

832
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,600
But still in the distance

833
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,600
The most perfect lie

834
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:33,600
Deceive yourself

835
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,600
If love is letting go

836
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,600
Let us lose the connection

837
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
Why is this

838
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:45,600
The moment of tears

839
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,600
Heart still

840
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Falling

841
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:05,600
The most perfect lie

842
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,600
Deceive yourself

843
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
If love is letting go

844
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,600
Let us lose the connection

845
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
Why is this

846
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
The moment of tears

847
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Heart still

848
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,600
Falling
