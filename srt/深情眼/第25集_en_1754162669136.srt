00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The heart that can't be hidden

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
When the breath gradually disappears

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Where is Ye Mengjie?

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She hasn't come yet

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
She is not here

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Ye Meng has been kidnapped

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Call the police

23
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,200
Zhu Xuan,

24
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,800
we won't get a car but a rescue for you.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,640
Okay?

26
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,920
Just leave me alone.

27
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:44,720
łam.

28
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,760
P luggy.

29
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,200
P luggy,

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,960
I'm back.

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,740
Go.

32
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,380
Go.

33
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,360
Do you know what you are doing?

34
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,760
You do care about him.

35
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,840
But it doesn't matter to me.

36
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,920
At worst, we all die together.

37
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,040
Are you crazy?

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,920
I am crazy.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,060
You guys are forcing me to be crazy.

40
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,860
Lei Jingyu, you are quite bold.

41
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,460
and even joined forces with your grandpa to deal with me?

42
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,660
You don't even know what Han Han means to me.

43
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,560
He used my happiness and my life to fight for me.

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,060
Don't even think of taking him away!

45
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,060
Didn't you just want my shares?

46
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,160
I'll give them to you.

47
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,360
You've already hurt Ye Meng's mother.

48
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,060
Don't hurt her anymore.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,060
That woman ruined my life.

50
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,760
What right do you have to judge me?

51
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,460
Calm down!

52
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,260
I'll go right now.

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:14,260
Don't come after me again.

54
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,460
Ye Meng! Ye Meng!

55
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,060
But we only have one child.

56
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,060
We want to give him the best.

57
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,060
So after I gave birth to my daughter,

58
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,060
I'll put all my attention and care on him.

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,460
The show has just started.

60
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,660
Why are you leaving so soon?

61
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,960
Ye Meng! Wake up, Ye Meng!

62
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,460
Wake up!

63
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,060
Ye Meng!

64
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:39,460
I'm the one who hurt Li Lin.

65
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:42,860
Don't you plan to leave a good path for yourself?

66
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:44,860
I still have a piece of money.

67
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,460
I have to pay it back.

68
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,060
I'll give you all these money.

69
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:54,660
Don't forget what you said.

70
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:05,260
Ye Meng!

71
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,260
Ye Meng!

72
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,960
Ye Meng! Wake up!

73
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,480
She has a 먼저 omette.

74
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,480
Further more.

75
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,560
Was it out of time for you?

76
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,780
Wrong.

77
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,940
Make it in time!

78
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,960
Yes!

79
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,020
Wait till she's right inside you.

80
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:16,860
If you want to blame, blame your useless mom.

81
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,860
I'm sorry.

82
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,860
Ye Meng.

83
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,860
Ye Meng, wake up.

84
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:31,860
Ye Meng.

85
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,860
Don't scare me, okay?

86
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Ye Meng, don't scare me.

87
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,860
I unconsciously fell in love.

88
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:51,860
Those things that are not easy to forget.

89
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,860
If you know how I feel,

90
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,860
and want to escape,

91
00:08:56,860 --> 00:09:02,860
it's because you care too much about the courage to be thrown away.

92
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,860
How to lose it?

93
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:11,860
I'll use all my strength to hug you.

94
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:14,860
Don't doubt.

95
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:45,860
Ye Meng.

96
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:14,860
Do you want to see my joke?

97
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,860
I came to tell you.

98
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,860
Don't worry about Li Zhuofeng.

99
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,860
When he recovers,

100
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,860
I'll take him back to Ningxue and give him to grandma.

101
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:35,860
I haven't experienced your pain.

102
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,860
So I have no right to advise you not to hate him.

103
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,860
But someone told me,

104
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,860
the world is not mean to me.

105
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,860
It's the same to everyone.

106
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,860
When people are in pain,

107
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,860
they see the world as dark.

108
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,860
Do you want to hear my story?

109
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,860
I was brought abroad by my foster father.

110
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,860
Who knows,

111
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:27,860
but his business partner Chen Guo gave birth to medicine.

112
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,860
I'm sorry.

113
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,860
I'm sorry.

114
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,860
I was still young.

115
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,860
I didn't dare to tell anyone.

116
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,860
Who knows I was pregnant a month later.

117
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,860
I had the courage to tell my foster father about it.

118
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:03,860
He forced me to marry Chen Guo Sheng for the sake of interest.

119
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,860
I'm sorry.

120
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,860
So,

121
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,860
you hate me so much.

122
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,860
What about Ye Mengwan?

123
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,860
Why?

124
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
He...

125
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:36,860
He's so lucky.

126
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:49,860
Xiao Bai.

127
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,860
Xiao Bai.

128
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,860
After many years,

129
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,860
we met again.

130
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:06,860
We were best friends in the welfare home.

131
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:09,860
But we lived a different life.

132
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,860
Xiao Bai, have some fruit.

133
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,860
You've been doing well these years.

134
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:19,860
That's it.

135
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,860
I'm just lucky.

136
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Actually, you've always been very fond of me.

137
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,860
I remember when my father went to the welfare home,

138
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,860
the first person he liked was you.

139
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,860
Do you like it?

140
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,860
I like it.

141
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,860
Okay, then wait for me here.

142
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:43,860
Shuyi, are you leaving?

143
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,860
Then I'll be alone from now on.

144
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,860
I don't really want to go to Jiangbei.

145
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:54,860
Don't you want to leave here?

146
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,860
This is for you.

147
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,860
If you hadn't rejected him,

148
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:05,860
I guess he wouldn't adopt me.

149
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:11,860
Then my life would be completely different.

150
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:18,860
Actually, I really wanted to agree to it.

151
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,860
Then why did you reject him?

152
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,860
Because I think you like that little bear very much.

153
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,860
And I promised you

154
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,860
I wouldn't leave you alone in the welfare home.

155
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,860
I hate him for giving me this kind of life.

156
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,860
So I started to take revenge.

157
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:46,860
Wang Qingsheng, you're a liar.

158
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
I'm going to the police station to report.

159
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
Okay, go ahead.

160
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,860
I'll tell the police then.

161
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,860
You're my colleague. Don't forget.

162
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,860
You asked me to go to the welfare home.

163
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
Those people in your town are willing to invest.

164
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:58,860
It's your credit.

165
00:14:58,860 --> 00:14:59,860
You're a colleague.

166
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,860
I didn't. You lied to me.

167
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,860
I didn't lie to them.

168
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,860
Will they believe you if you tell them?

169
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,860
Don't you care about your life and your baby girl the most?

170
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
If this thing goes out,

171
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,860
they will be defeated because of you.

172
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,860
Your daughter is in high school.

173
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,860
You'd better shut your mouth.

174
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:19,860
If I go in that day,

175
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:23,860
I'll drag you in and do it together.

176
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:31,860
I just wanted him to feel the pain like me.

177
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,860
I didn't expect he would kill himself.

178
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:46,860
You can return the money to me.

179
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,860
This money is the entire life's salary

180
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,860
of the welfare home.

181
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:56,860
You don't know how important it is for my family.

182
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,860
Have you ever thought about how I've been living these years?

183
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,860
I did what I wanted and exchanged my life for it.

184
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,860
You pushed me into a pit of fire. Do you know that?

185
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:16,860
I thought that I did that because I was doing that for your sake.

186
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,860
That sounds great. It's for my sake.

187
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,860
For my sake.

188
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,180
Drove away of her ordinary life

189
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:44,180
That Геs all, but you

190
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,820
Secure that

191
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,380
To be honest

192
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:01,380
I want you to know that you are a scumbag who was betrayed by someone.

193
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,380
I want your family and your child to live a life of shame because of you.

194
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,380
Don't do this, Xiao Bai.

195
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,380
I want you to feel all the pain that I feel.

196
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,380
I want you to...

197
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,380
This is what you owe me.

198
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:20,380
Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai.

199
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,380
Xiao Bai!

200
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,380
Xiao Bai.

201
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,380
There.

202
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,380
There.

203
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,380
Xiao Bai.

204
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,380
It Right top of your head.

205
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
We went over the test.

206
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,920
I will...

207
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,040
Or I will Malaysia,

208
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,600
There are good places,

209
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
But where can you find us?

210
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Just wait and see.

211
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,600
I was very lucky.

212
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,600
Listen.

213
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Really?

214
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,600
Really?

215
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
I'll listen.

216
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Who is the person outside?

217
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,600
I don't even know him.

218
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Are you an annoying dad?

219
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,600
If it wasn't for that car accident back then,

220
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
I wouldn't have become like this.

221
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,600
But it's too late to say anything now.

222
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Let's go.

223
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,600
Just pretend that

224
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,600
I'm not there.

225
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,600
Let's go.

226
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,600
I'll just pretend that I don't have a father.

227
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,000
Don't come see me again.

228
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Take care.

229
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,600
I'll just pretend that I don't have a father.

230
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
I'll just pretend that I don't have a father.

231
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Meng Meng.

232
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,800
Ye Meng.

233
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,600
Meng Meng.

234
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
Ye Meng.

235
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,200
Meng Meng.

236
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
Meng Meng.

237
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,000
Ye Meng.

238
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,800
You're finally awake. You scared me to death these past two days.

239
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Are you feeling better?

240
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,000
You didn't tell Grandma, right?

241
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,800
I didn't say anything.

242
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,200
You... don't move.

243
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,800
You need to pick up the bed.

244
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
Slowly. Don't move.

245
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,800
You asked her where she was.

246
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,400
Did she say anything uncomfortable?

247
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,800
Meng Meng.

248
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,600
How is she?

249
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,000
Where's Li Qi Yun?

250
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,800
You can't contact her after you're discharged?

251
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,000
I can't contact her.

252
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,200
I gave her my phone.

253
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,000
I can't contact her.

254
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Give me your phone.

255
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,200
It's here.

256
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,200
Here.

257
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,800
Don't think about it. Rest for a while.

258
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,400
Rest for a while. Don't think too much.

259
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,600
I'll go and call the doctor.

260
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Refuse to give me a ride?

261
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,000
You don't have to give me a ride.

262
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm just here to talk to you.

263
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,800
Okay.

264
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,000
That day...

265
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I was too harsh that day.

266
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,400
It's mainly because I was angry.

267
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
Don't mind it.

268
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,400
I forgot everything you said.

269
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,800
After all, he's your biological son.

270
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,600
I understand.

271
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,200
I admit,

272
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,000
I do have feelings for you.

273
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
But...

274
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
I just walked out of a very unfortunate marriage.

275
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:24,600
And I don't have much confidence in love.

276
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:29,200
I did treat you as my brother from the beginning.

277
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:33,200
But you didn't treat me

278
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,000
as your brother.

279
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
You treated me and Jiayu

280
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
very well.

281
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,400
I'm very grateful.

282
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
But I'm just...

283
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I'm just very confused.

284
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I don't have an answer.

285
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,200
Plus,

286
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,200
he's very complicated right now.

287
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
Our relationship...

288
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,200
has nothing to do with Ye Meng.

289
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,200
Yes, it has nothing to do with me.

290
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
But I do think a lot about it.

291
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:28,800
Can you give me some time?

292
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,800
Let me figure it out first.

293
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,800
I don't want to need your time.

294
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,600
I'm leaving now.

295
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,800
Leave?

296
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,800
Of course, I need to.

297
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,800
Leave now.

298
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,600
I'm going to meet Xiaoxiao tomorrow.

299
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,200
Wait for me at the place I've thought about...

300
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
until I call you.

301
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,400
I'll call you.

302
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:53,120
Go back to data front in a qiue

303
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:59,120
I can't make up for everything she did to your mother.

304
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:07,120
I think that everything about the tragedy is related to me.

305
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Too many people were hurt because of what happened back then.

306
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,120
I can't pretend that nothing happened.

307
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,120
I'm so happy to have met you.

308
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,120
I want you to be free and happy.

309
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,120
Instead of being burdened with these things with me.

310
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,120
Please give me some time.

311
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:32,120
I will draw a symbol for this.

312
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,120
The End

313
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,120
Dad,

314
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,120
you were the one I relied on the most in this world.

315
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:22,120
But I didn't expect that I was the one who caused you to be in this situation.

316
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,120
I've been very self-contained for the past few years.

317
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:35,120
Until I met Ye Meng,

318
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,120
I had only one hope.

319
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,120
But now,

320
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,120
I feel that I owe her more and more.

321
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:51,120
I can't even count myself as Shen Zhen.

322
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,120
The End

323
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Hello.

324
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:17,120
Have you ever been here when you were 27 or 28 years old?

325
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I have an impression. I went to the back hill. I couldn't stop it.

326
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,120
The End

327
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:00,120
Li Jing Yuan!

328
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Li Jing Yuan!

329
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Li Jing Yuan!

330
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,120
What's going on?

331
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,120
You didn't reply to my message.

332
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
And you wrote the last sentence to Yuan Hua.

333
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
What should I do?

334
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,120
I was asked to investigate the phone.

335
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
And those words

336
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
are not real.

337
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
I'm sorry.

338
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
I'm sorry.

339
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,120
I'm sorry.

340
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I'm sorry.

341
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
And those words,

342
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,120
I don't know how to tell you.

343
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:48,120
I just wrote a letter.

344
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,120
You made the content of the post?

345
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
Yes.

346
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,120
I can't let your mom

347
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
be blamed by Feng Mu Xun.

348
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,120
Ye Meng,

349
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
I won't run away again.

350
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
Do you know

351
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,120
I love you?

352
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,120
The End

353
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,120
Grandma was right.

354
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
You're like a duck.

355
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
When spring comes,

356
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,120
the duck will grow.

357
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,120
People are the same.

358
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
As long as you're alive,

359
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,120
there will always be hope.

360
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,120
I'm sorry.

361
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,120
I made you worry.

362
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Ye Meng,

363
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,120
thank you.

364
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
What else?

365
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,120
I love you.

366
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,120
I love you too.

367
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
Let's go home.

368
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,120
I didn't think about you.

369
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,120
Wait for me.

370
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
Let's go together.

371
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Do you know it's a long way?

372
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,120
It's not easy to go.

373
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,120
I've been looking for you for so long.

374
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,120
I'm sorry.

375
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,120
What should you do?

376
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:57,120
I'll go home with you.

377
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,120
No, what if you fall down?

378
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
If you want to fall, you can fall first.

379
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
You think I can't do it?

380
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
When you fall, you can't help me.

381
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:12,120
I'll go.

382
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:14,120
Okay.

383
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,120
Let's go.

384
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,120
Okay.

385
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,120
I'm going home.

386
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,120
What should I do?

387
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
I'll go.

388
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,120
Wait for me.

389
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:28,120
I'll go.

390
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:30,120
I'm going with you.

391
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,120
I'm going.

392
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
I'm going.

393
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,120
I'm going.

394
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm going.

395
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:43,120
I'm here to thank you for your hard work.

396
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,120
I believe that everyone has heard about the news about Tianhui City project.

397
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:52,120
And I, as the largest shareholder of Hanhai,

398
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,120
will take on the responsibility of my own responsibility for the recent negative situation.

399
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,120
So I will take out my shares' net profit

400
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:04,120
and give it to you.

401
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,120
So I will take out my shares' net profit

402
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:13,120
and make up for the individual and family of the financial fraud victims.

403
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:18,120
In the future, there will be more professional people to take over the company for me.

404
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
I only have one request.

405
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:26,120
It's the plan of the Three Seasons of Hailangang.

406
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:29,120
You must keep the original appearance of the small fishing village.

407
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
I'm sorry.

408
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
You don't want to be the boss anymore?

409
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm not that kind of person.

410
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,120
I'd rather go back and continue to be a steward.

411
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,120
Our young people are not in this mess.

412
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,120
Then let's stay here for another night or go back tomorrow.

413
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,120
Go home directly.

414
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:07,120
We can catch up with the opening of the restaurant.

415
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,120
Let's go.

416
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Go.

417
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,120
Thank you.

418
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,120
Boss Zhang, the time is up.

419
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,120
Let's cut the ribbon.

420
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
Come on.

421
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,120
Come on.

422
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:28,120
Three, two, one.

423
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,120
The opening of the restaurant is a big hit.

424
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:37,120
Thank you to all the new customers for their support for me.

425
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,120
Today is the first day of the opening of my restaurant.

426
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,120
The opening of the restaurant is 80% off.

427
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,120
All the members can participate in the free lottery.

428
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,120
I've seen the big prize.

429
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,120
Cheng Le is going to be a student.

430
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,120
What are you waiting for?

431
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,120
Hurry up.

432
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,120
Come on.

433
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,120
Come on.

434
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,120
Come on.

435
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
Come on.

436
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Come on.

437
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,120
There are so many people.

438
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,120
Let's go and see.

439
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,120
Stop looking.

440
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:14,120
Stop waiting.

441
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,120
Ya'an took Jiayu to the city to participate in the activity.

442
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,120
Take someone to give you a flower basket.

443
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,120
It's okay.

444
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,120
It's okay.

445
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,120
Maybe he'll be here soon.

446
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Hurry up.

447
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:53,120
Do you think there are any adjustments to be made to the dishes?

448
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
No, it's good.

449
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,120
All of them are good, right?

450
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,120
Yes.

451
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,120
Help me promote the circle of friends online.

452
00:36:58,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Okay.

453
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,120
Bring your friends if you have a chance.

454
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,120
Okay.

455
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,120
Bye.

456
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Bye.

457
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,120
Let's start.

458
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Come and see this.

459
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Why hasn't he arrived yet?

460
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,120
I'm a little nervous.

461
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,120
I don't know.

462
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,120
The bar changed the table.

463
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:23,120
It's a dead end.

464
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
He hasn't come yet.

465
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,120
He hasn't...

466
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,120
What's wrong?

467
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
You bought three new dishes?

468
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:42,120
We have something to tell you.

469
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,120
I'm sorry.

470
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,120
What are you doing?

471
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
Enough.

472
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,120
Do you know I'm going to open a business?

473
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,120
No.

474
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,120
You're a member of the club.

475
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,120
Tell me.

476
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,120
How much did he pay you?

477
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,120
I'll double it.

478
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:25,120
He's still in the club.

479
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:30,120
If you really have no money to spend,

480
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,120
give it to me.

481
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:32,120
I'll share some of it with you.

482
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,120
Don't talk about money.

483
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,120
It's not about money.

484
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,120
Actually,

485
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Ye Meng's husband

486
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,120
has always been me.

487
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,120
Do you think I'll believe you?

488
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,120
Can you send it to me first?

489
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,120
What are you doing?

490
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,120
Look.

491
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm going to the club.

492
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,120
I'll send it to you first.

493
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
Is it true?

494
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
Is it true?

495
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,120
I just came back from abroad.

496
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,020
You guys.

497
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,860
You guys are really disappointing me.

498
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,560
What should we do with demands?

499
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:37,960
Go.

500
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,520
She even cried.

501
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,720
Really.

502
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,380
I feel so bad for her.

503
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:45,960
What can we do?

504
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,280
Fatal love.

505
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,920
You really understand me now?

506
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,640
Do you want me to go?

507
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:10,480
Or are you the one

508
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,860
that left?

509
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,780
Kitty is awake now.

510
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,440
Are you still watching the sea?

511
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,120
But the situation was very special.

512
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,120
I was afraid that Yimeng would be in danger.

513
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,120
You always think that way.

514
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,120
You hide everything from me.

515
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:36,120
You hide your marriage from me.

516
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,120
You also hide your retirement from me.

517
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,120
Do you know that the competition

518
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,120
was not only your competition.

519
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,120
I also gave my all.

520
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
I know.

521
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,120
I caused you to lose the competition.

522
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,120
I need an apology from you.

523
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,120
I'm not angry because I lost the competition.

524
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,120
But because you can't leave me forever.

525
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,120
I treat you as my brother.

526
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,120
What do you treat me as?

527
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Actually, my dad passed away during that time.

528
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,120
I always wanted to tell you.

529
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,120
But I don't know how to say it.

530
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,120
You know that I

531
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,120
always closed myself

532
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
and kept my distance from anyone.

533
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,120
The only one who can open up is my dad.

534
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,120
But my dad died because of me.

535
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,120
I really couldn't compete at that time.

536
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,120
People also became a leg down.

537
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,120
Later, I completely broke off contact with you.

538
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,120
I lost my money.

539
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,120
At that time, I thought

540
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:59,120
I might be like this in my life.

541
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,120
Until Yue Meng appeared,

542
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
I was reborn in my life.

543
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:11,120
So, I can stand here

544
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
and tell you these words.

545
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
I've been hiding it from you.

546
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,120
I'm sorry.

547
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,120
But in my heart,

548
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,120
I cherish the time we used to be together.

549
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
I always treat you

550
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:25,120
as my best brother.

551
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:27,120
I'm sorry.

552
00:42:28,120 --> 00:42:29,120
I'm sorry.

553
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,120
I'm sorry.

554
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
Whether it's about Yue Meng

555
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,120
or about that time.

556
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:57,120
I'm sorry.

557
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,120
You

558
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,120
I saw you

559
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:34,120
I thought of you

560
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:40,120
I heard any news about you

561
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:47,120
The love that was reflected in my heart

562
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:51,120
Enclosed my thoughts

563
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:54,120
Go, go, go

564
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,120
Where to go

565
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,120
How to avoid

566
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,120
Those memories about you

567
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,120
I want to be far away, but I'm addicted

568
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,120
Can't stop

569
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:19,120
I'm silent

570
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Put the flowers in the back

571
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:29,120
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

572
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:33,120
Self-proclaimed, pretending to be decisive

573
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,120
But still in the distance, obsessed

574
00:44:38,120 --> 00:44:43,120
The most perfect lie

575
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,120
Deceives yourself

576
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,120
If you love, let go

577
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:53,120
Let us lose the relationship

578
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:59,120
Why is it just the moment of tears

579
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,120
Heart still remains

580
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:13,120
I want to be far away, but I'm addicted

581
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,120
Can't stop

582
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:21,120
I'm silent

583
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,120
Put the flowers in the back

584
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:31,120
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread
