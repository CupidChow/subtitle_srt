1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excited to say how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I can't forget

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have everything

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is still a if

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
This promise will be kept

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The Love by Hypnotic

21
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hello, is anyone here?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Hello

23
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Hello, Brother Jiang, right?

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm Ye Meng, Cheng Kai Ran's friend

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Kai Kai's friend?

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
They are all friends, sit

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I want to ask you about an old thing

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Have you seen this ring?

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I didn't do it

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
But it looks familiar

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I remember

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
About a few years ago

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
A middle-aged man came to me

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Asked me to set a price for this ring

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I think this ring is very good in color

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I asked him a few times

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But he refused to do it

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I think it's a good ring

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
He refused to do it

40
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Do you know what his name is?

41
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Or do you have his contact information?

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Not clear

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I know he came from Jiangbei for business

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Not a local

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Nothing

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Then we add a contact information

47
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
OK

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
If you remember anything

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Just send me a message

50
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
OK

51
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Nothing

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Then we are disturbed, we go first

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
OK

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Thank you

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Bye bye

57
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
The seller he said

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Could it be the man who went to my mother?

59
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's possible

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
How about this

61
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll let my friends in Jiangbei

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Help you inquire

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I also asked my friends in Jiangbei

64
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Friends in Jiangbei

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
That money boss

66
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Not Taiming Xiao

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My former former colleague

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Your tone is strange

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Are you jealous?

70
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What am I jealous of?

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
No good

72
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
After all, my CP is handsome and kind

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's a battle friendship with me for many years

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If you are jealous

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There is no way

76
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What CP?

77
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Me and Taiming Xiao

78
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ye Xiao Tan CP

79
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It seems that sister is very rich in Jiangbei

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
What about CP?

81
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Just say it when you are jealous

82
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Want to be shameless

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I said no

84
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Really

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Now the spring festival is over

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's almost the season of no return

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Even safe

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Only don't go home every day

89
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Go out to find a girlfriend

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You really want to be an old man

91
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Don't go home safely

92
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Maybe help me find a job outside

93
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't believe

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Then we make a bet

95
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
She must be going out to find a girlfriend

96
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ping An is not good at talking

97
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How to bet

98
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I do

99
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Ok

100
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sister, Beilei is really not responsible

101
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Put a travel recorder for Ping An

102
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Don't underestimate the desire of women

103
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
And conquer

104
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I don't want to

105
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
What are you betting

106
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then bet

107
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
If you lose

108
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Just admit that you were jealous just now

109
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
And you want to be a fool

110
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Just bet

111
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Ping An is so pitiful

113
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This love is still monitored

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Remember to call her girlfriend

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother, can you give up so soon?

116
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What if Ping An is looking for a job?

117
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Are you deliberately not going with me today?

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
No

119
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I think it's very fun when I'm teasing you

120
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Brother

121
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Your ears are very red

122
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm cold

123
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
What cold?

124
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm not cold even in shorts

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You are a stinky beauty, different

126
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
How do you use this thing?

127
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No

128
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
No

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You want to bet

130
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You bet

131
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I just want to make a bet

132
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You bet

133
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You bet

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This is a new year's gift

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
New year

136
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I really have to go

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You also have a new year's gift

138
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mr. Wang, you are too polite

139
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I have to take care of you more in the coming year

140
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Happy New Year

141
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I'm not polite

142
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Shut up

143
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Mr. Li, Happy New Year

144
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
The health care product I sent you

145
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You received it

146
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Remember to eat

147
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Mom, I'm making a video with my dad.

148
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
A video with your dad?

149
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Let me see.

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Brother.

151
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,200
Brother.

152
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
Dad, have you eaten the sweet potato balls?

153
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm going to cook them.

154
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,200
I sent them to the bank.

155
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
I said you bank

156
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,400
is just you.

157
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,600
Why do you do this every year?

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,400
Mom, I'm really not going to do it this time.

159
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,400
I'll go to the ball street in the New Year.

160
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,000
Let's meet up immediately.

161
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,200
Really?

162
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Then it's a deal.

163
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I'll wait for you.

164
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Okay.

165
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
Mom, I have something to do.

166
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Take care of grandma and grandpa.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Okay.

168
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Take care of yourself.

169
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,000
Happy New Year.

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,800
Happy New Year.

171
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Happy New Year.

172
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Bye bye.

173
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,200
Bye bye.

174
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,600
Your dad is so funny.

175
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
Who is taking care of whom?

176
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Your dad's company is finally a little bit humane.

177
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,200
There are old people and people from the lower class.

178
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,200
Finally, he's back.

179
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
And you.

180
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Move back quickly.

181
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,800
There are so many rooms in the house.

182
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,200
You don't have to live alone.

183
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Isn't that the old house?

184
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,000
No one lives there.

185
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,200
The house is going to be ruined.

186
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,800
Grandma said before.

187
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
There must be someone to live in the house to be able to raise it.

188
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,400
Did I say that?

189
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,600
Grandma.

190
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,000
What is this stuffing?

191
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Didn't you say it was peanut stuffing?

192
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,000
By the way, boss.

193
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,800
Get him some peanut stuffing.

194
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,800
There's no peanut stuffing at home.

195
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Then I'll go buy it.

196
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,600
I'll go.

197
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,400
You go.

198
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,000
Go back quickly.

199
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,600
Mom, look at him.

200
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,000
He doesn't do anything. He's lazy.

201
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,400
I'm lazy.

202
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,400
He's sitting there.

203
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,200
He has a conscience.

204
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,000
You two.

205
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
You two want to see each other.

206
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
You two will fight when you see each other.

207
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,200
Boss, how much is this?

208
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,800
Ten yuan.

209
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
Then two jin.

210
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,600
Okay.

211
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,400
Hold on.

212
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,600
What are you doing?

213
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,000
I know where your house key is.

214
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,600
I was trying to sneak attack you.

215
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,000
No.

216
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,800
Why are you here?

217
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,400
I'm here to stick the spring curtain.

218
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Your house is so bright.

219
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
It's not a little festive.

220
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's not necessary.

221
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
Why not?

222
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Come on, big brother.

223
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Stick the red envelope.

224
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Can you help me see if these two sides are even?

225
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,200
A little bit down.

226
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,200
Down?

227
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,400
Are you sure?

228
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
I'm sure.

229
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
Are you sure?

230
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,500
Yes.

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,200
What about mine?

232
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,200
I'll use a little bit.

233
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,800
Okay.

234
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,800
Stick a little bit more to the left.

235
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,200
I've done it.

236
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,400
Okay, okay, okay.

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I just left the house.

238
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,200
Fifteen minutes later.

239
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,200
Keep the good cards.

240
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,200
Don't come over.

241
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,600
We're here to fight.

242
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,800
It's so lively.

243
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,520
I've eaten in the hospital.

244
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,840
The food is very good.

245
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,560
By the way,

246
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,040
if you stay home alone and feel bored,

247
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,560
I'll arrange it for you.

248
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,200
What are you going to arrange?

249
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm going to Ye Meng's house.

250
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
They're going to celebrate the New Year.

251
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,880
Okay.

252
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,280
Here.

253
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll give you a soup of four dishes.

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,760
That's it.

255
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm done talking.

256
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,400
I'm playing mahjong.

257
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,240
Okay?

258
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,840
No need.

259
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,360
I...

260
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,240
I've received the big red envelope from grandma.

261
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm going to take it to her.

262
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,640
Then...

263
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,640
Go and buy something.

264
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,080
I have to buy something too.

265
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,600
Let's go.

266
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:05,880
Zimo.

267
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,520
You're so lucky.

268
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,160
Come on.

269
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,160
Stop playing.

270
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm back.

271
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,120
Have you finished the soup?

272
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,240
Mengmeng,

273
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,840
you've ordered food for me.

274
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,280
Where's your peanut sauce?

275
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,800
Did you buy it empty?

276
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,640
Yes.

277
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,560
I'll get it for you.

278
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,400
Call someone to get it together.

279
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Okay.

280
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,280
Okay.

281
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,080
Goodbye, Mr. Li.

282
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:29,720
Someone's here.

283
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,200
Who is this?

284
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,960
Come on.

285
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,840
This is...

286
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:35,320
Grandma,

287
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,480
I'm a senior.

288
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,560
Nice to meet you.

289
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,080
Nice to meet you too.

290
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,200
This is my friend.

291
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,480
They're not at home tonight.

292
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,280
I'll bring her back to celebrate the New Year.

293
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,840
Welcome.

294
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,160
Friend?

295
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
What kind of friend?

296
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,760
Boyfriend?

297
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,040
What do you do?

298
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,400
No.

299
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,960
We're just friends.

300
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,960
Can you be more friendly?

301
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,960
Don't scare me.

302
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,080
This is Mengmeng's friend.

303
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,840
Come on.

304
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,360
Come in with me.

305
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,040
Come on.

306
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,480
Come in.

307
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,560
She's so tall.

308
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,440
What are you doing?

309
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Sister.

310
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,160
Why are you so heavy?

311
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,680
You're so heavy.

312
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,120
Pour some water.

313
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,640
I think you look familiar.

314
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,000
I was right then.

315
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,040
What?

316
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,040
How did you know each other?

317
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,280
What's your last name?

318
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:24,880
My last name is Li.

319
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,920
Just call me Li.

320
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,520
Okay.

321
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:27,240
Li.

322
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,040
Li is nice.

323
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,480
Many of my clients call me Li.

324
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,920
I'm rich and rich.

325
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,760
How old are you?

326
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm 27.

327
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,000
27.

328
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,520
You're two years younger than Mengmeng.

329
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,560
You're a good kid.

330
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,880
I like my brother too.

331
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,680
You're so childish.

332
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,720
What do you do?

333
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,480
I don't have a fixed job.

334
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,040
I do everything.

335
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,520
You can do everything.

336
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,120
That's good.

337
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,320
You can take good care of Mengmeng.

338
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,640
Money is not important.

339
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,360
As long as you two are happy.

340
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,000
Why do I look familiar?

341
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
I think I've seen you before.

342
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,280
Really?

343
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,280
I just said I looked familiar.

344
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,280
Who did you see?

345
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,680
When we were in the old house.

346
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,320
You.

347
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,720
Fixed job?

348
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,880
Grandma.

349
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,040
I was joking.

350
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,560
He's my great-grandma's grandson.

351
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,440
We met in the pavilion.

352
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,640
He came to help fix it.

353
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,160
No.

354
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,520
You're the grandson of the peach blossom.

355
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,360
Yes.

356
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,040
No wonder you don't go home.

357
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,000
You're dating.

358
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,080
Li.

359
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,280
What does your parents do?

360
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,560
My dad passed away.

361
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm living with my grandma now.

362
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,640
Sorry.

363
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,560
It's okay.

364
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,080
I'm so hungry.

365
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,240
Is the soup not ready yet?

366
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,440
My boiling water.

367
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:44,800
Second sister.

368
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,360
It's New Year.

369
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,400
Can you call your grandma?

370
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,560
I'll help you.

371
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,240
No, grandma.

372
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,080
I'll help you.

373
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,440
What's wrong with me?

374
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,040
Yes.

375
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,800
Go.

376
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,640
What?

377
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay.

378
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
You two talk.

379
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,000
Eat the melon.

380
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,160
Eat the melon.

381
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,560
Don't be scared.

382
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
That's our family.

383
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,840
No.

384
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,440
Eat.

385
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,000
Thank you.

386
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,960
I'll give you an orange.

387
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,400
No need.

388
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,880
Today is New Year's Eve.

389
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,280
Wish us

390
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,760
a new year

391
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,760
full of happiness.

392
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,880
Okay.

393
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,520
The dumplings are good.

394
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,040
You all try it.

395
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,760
It's delicious.

396
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,840
Eat more.

397
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,800
Slow down.

398
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,960
Okay.

399
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,480
Try it.

400
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,520
Give a toast to your big sister.

401
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,480
Give a toast.

402
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,280
Give a toast.

403
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,280
Mom should give you a toast.

404
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,440
Mom, come on.

405
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,800
Stop.

406
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,240
My plate is full.

407
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,040
You have to eat.

408
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,760
You have to eat.

409
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,240
I have some here.

410
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,080
I have some.

411
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,120
Next,

412
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,440
I'll give you a red envelope.

413
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,080
I'm looking forward to it.

414
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,440
You have a red envelope.

415
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,320
What's the relationship between you two?

416
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
You can have my clothes.

417
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,520
You all have a red envelope.

418
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,680
Okay, let's start.

419
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
Let me see.

420
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,240
Good on you

421
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,700
Mom told you.

422
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,440
Looks delicious.

423
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,760
Your mom will like it.

424
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,280
Feel free to praises you

425
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,680
after you finish eating.

426
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,840
Let's see your looks

427
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,400
to see if that makes you happy

428
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,840
This red envelope

429
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,880
looks so delicious.

430
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Let's have a look.

431
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,920
It looks so tasty.

432
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,560
You can put some mean words

433
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,640
into it.

434
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:43,480
That's right.

435
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:43,920
Yes.

436
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,000
This is for your health.

437
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,280
Let me show you.

438
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,680
It's a kind of recognition, right?

439
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,760
I think

440
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,600
your family is quite cute.

441
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,720
It's totally different from what I thought.

442
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,880
But

443
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,920
I think it needs a family

444
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,520
to cultivate your character.

445
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,880
So you've imagined me before.

446
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:06,520
It's cold. Get up.

447
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,400
I have to go to the hospital to see my grandma.

448
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,440
Then after you see your grandma,

449
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,720
do you want to put fireworks with me?

450
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,360
I prepared a lot for your birthday.

451
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,160
I put them in the warehouse.

452
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,200
I didn't have a chance to use them.

453
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,920
What should I do after your birthday?

454
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,160
Should I arrange something else?

455
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,320
When?

456
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:32,040
We can talk later,

457
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,080
I have to go later.

458
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,280
Li Junyu!

459
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,120
I'm sorry.

460
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,840
What did you say?

461
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,080
I said happy new year.

462
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,360
Go up now.

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,520
Bye.

464
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,360
Bye.

465
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000

progressive

475
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,120
How could you

476
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:22,200
be spoken by

477
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:23,760
handsome

478
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,720
But you don't go to work

479
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,320
economy is most important

480
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,640
Great grandpa havent reminded you

481
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
I want to tell you about

482
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,920
your sister

483
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,520
Yes

484
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
I think things about her

485
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:33,960
are all Jie

486
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,560
We are rich

487
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,360
Although we are so simple

488
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,320
I'm tired.

489
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,520
I'm still listening.

490
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,400
If you say bad things about Li Junyu again,

491
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,280
I'll be really angry.

492
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,480
I'll put the flowers in the back garden.

493
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:54,200
Maybe it will make the sadness stop spreading.

494
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,240
I pretend to be firm,

495
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:03,480
but I'm still obsessed with the source.

496
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,680
What's the point of saying?

497
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,080
It seems that you've knownbye forever in the past.

498
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,600
Naturally,

499
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,680
nothing will affect Li Junyu from the moment he become an efficient man.

500
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,920
whether to say or not.

501
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,520
Now you finally say no.

502
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,520
Come on, son.

503
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,320
Happy New Year!

504
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Wait.

505
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,520
For the new year,

506
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,720
I wish you health,

507
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
peace,

508
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,320
and a high growth.

509
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,120
Thank you, mom.

510
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,920
I also wish you to make more money.

511
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,720
Sure.

512
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,920
Don't worry about me.

513
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
No way.

514
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,320
I don't care about you.

515
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,520
I don't care if you don't go to heaven.

516
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
Have some meat.

517
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,520
Put it down, okay?

518
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,920
I'm not going to eat it.

519
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,320
I'm not going to eat it.

520
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
I'm not going to eat it.

521
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,520
I'm not going to eat it.

522
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,520
I'm not going to eat it.

523
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
Who is it?

524
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,320
It's the New Year.

525
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,320
I'll go take a look.

526
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Coming.

527
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,120
Who is it?

528
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,120
Kai Kai.

529
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,320
Sister Yang.

530
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,320
Happy New Year.

531
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,720
Happy New Year.

532
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
You're not at home for New Year's Eve.

533
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
Why are you here?

534
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,720
I brought a gift for my client.

535
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,920
I brought you one.

536
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,520
Thank you.

537
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,520
You're welcome.

538
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,520
And this.

539
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,120
A red envelope for Jiayu.

540
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,120
I don't want this.

541
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,120
It's for the child.

542
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
Keep it.

543
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,520
I'll thank you for Jiayu.

544
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,520
It's nothing.

545
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,520
This.

546
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,120
I don't know what Jiayu likes.

547
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,120
So I picked this.

548
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,120
You're too polite, Kai Kai.

549
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,520
It's for the New Year.

550
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,520
Then go up and give it to him.

551
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:16,520
Okay.

552
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Let's go.

553
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,520
Jiayu.

554
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,520
Look who's here.

555
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,520
No need to change shoes.

556
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,520
It's okay. Just go in.

557
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,520
Come in.

558
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
Happy New Year, kid.

559
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,720
Mom, why are you in debt?

560
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,920
This uncle is here to ask for money.

561
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,120
How can you talk like that?

562
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
Give me half a year.

563
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I'll give him half a year.

564
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,120
Happy New Year, uncle.

565
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,920
You too.

566
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,120
Look.

567
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,120
This.

568
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
This is a gift I picked for you.

569
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,520
See if you like it.

570
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,520
Thank you, uncle.

571
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,520
This suits your temperament.

572
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,120
I like it.

573
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,320
It's good that you like it.

574
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,920
If you like any toy in the future, tell me.

575
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,320
I'll buy you everything you had when you were 18.

576
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
No need.

577
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,520
It's not easy for anyone to make money.

578
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
You must not waste money.

579
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,120
Mom, I'll put this down first.

580
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,120
Go ahead.

581
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
What is this?

582
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,120
You're more emotional, right?

583
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,120
Follow me.

584
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Follow me.

585
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,720
Come on, eat something.

586
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
I'll go back first.

587
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,320
Don't. It's New Year.

588
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,920
Have a drink.

589
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,520
It's good that you tasted my cooking.

590
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,920
This is useless.

591
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,920
It's leather.

592
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,920
You've changed a lot these years.

593
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,520
I haven't changed much.

594
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,320
See?

595
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,120
My son thought you were here to ask for money.

596
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,520
Do you know what image you're in the kid's heart now?

597
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,920
I'll go and make it for him after New Year.

598
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
That's it.

599
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,120
Something's wrong with you.

600
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
You asked me to fix your makeup a few days ago.

601
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,920
You're going today, right?

602
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,320
Do you have a girl you like?

603
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
No.

604
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,720
No?

605
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,520
I... I really don't have one.

606
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,720
You tell me if you have one.

607
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,320
Wait.

608
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,120
Let me see.

609
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:23,920
You're so serious.

610
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,920
Who do I like?

611
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,720
What can't you say?

612
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,120
We don't have a real pretty girl yet.

613
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,720
You can't even see one.

614
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,920
She's so pretty.

615
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,120
I'll go back first.

616
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,320
My dad is waiting for me to cook soup.

617
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,520
After New Year,

618
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,320
I'll ask Ye Meng to cook for me.

619
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,120
We'll have a small table.

620
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
You haven't eaten yet?

621
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,720
This book is for you.

622
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,720
You're so good at it.

623
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,920
You're a martial artist.

624
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,520
Isn't it strange?

625
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm so good at culture.

626
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,520
I can have a son who's so good at it.

627
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Right?

628
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,720
Dad, you're a loser.

629
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,120
That's why you married my dad.

630
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,920
You can eat everything.

631
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,120
I'm a good son.

632
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,320
Yes, you're right.

633
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,120
We're the same.

634
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,120
I'll be a good son when I go back.

635
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:15,720
I'll go now.

636
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,120
Call me if you need anything.

637
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I'll walk you out.

638
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,920
I'll walk you out.

639
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,720
Okay.

640
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,720
Bye, uncle.

641
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:21,520
Bye.

642
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
I like him a lot.

643
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,120
He likes you a lot.

644
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:25,520
Really?

645
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,320
Really.

646
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I'll go now.

647
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,120
Go to your room.

648
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:29,720
It's cold outside.

649
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
Okay, I'll walk you out.

650
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,320
It's New Year.

651
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
What are you doing here?

652
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,320
I'll ask you later.

653
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,120
Why are you here?

654
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,920
I'm here to see my son.

655
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:38,720
Why should I come?

656
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,720
We're a couple.

657
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,120
Can you not be so mean?

658
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,120
Then,

659
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,320
bring the food to uncle and aunt.

660
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,920
Okay, I'll go now.

661
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,320
Okay.

662
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:49,920
Happy New Year.

663
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,520
Happy New Year.

664
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:52,720
It's New Year.

665
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,720
We should have a family meal together.

666
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
Do you know that?

667
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,120
What do you want to eat?

668
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,520
I'm done.

669
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Is it cooked by your son?

670
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,720
Yes.

671
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,920
I think he's too boring.

672
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,520
And he's very thoughtful.

673
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,320
Look at how simple our mom is.

674
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
Hello.

675
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,520
Are you home?

676
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,320
Yes.

677
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,320
I just arrived.

678
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:05,920
That fish?

679
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
Do you remember the black goldfish

680
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:16,520
you said you looked like me?

681
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
Of course.

682
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
I'm not a goldfish.

683
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,520
I'm a black fish.

684
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,520
I'm a black fish.

685
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I'm a black fish.

686
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,520
I'm a black fish.

687
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,320
What's wrong?

688
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,720
You've figured it out.

689
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,520
You want to look like your goldfish

690
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,920
and find a partner?

691
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,520
That goldfish

692
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,520
wasn't black.

693
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,720
It didn't cry at all.

694
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:43,920
It was

695
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,120
as red as a normal goldfish.

696
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,920
The black you saw

697
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,520
was because it had black spots.

698
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
Black spots?

699
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:57,920
Yes.

700
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,520
It's a infectious disease.

701
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I just found out

702
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,720
that a goldfish

703
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,120
was infected.

704
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,120
What do you want to say?

705
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,320
A catfish.

706
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,720
If you meet a sick goldfish,

707
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,120
the best thing you should do

708
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,520
is to stay away from it.

709
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,520
Don't get close to it.

710
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,120
Don't pull it in.

711
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,920
Because it will only

712
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,920
pull you into the darkness.

713
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,720
The people standing by you

714
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,520
shouldn't be like me.

715
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,320
Even if they play fireworks with you,

716
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,920
or spend the New Year with your family,

717
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,920
they won't be able to do it.

718
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,320
Oh, you

719
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,920
whispered softly

720
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,520
those

721
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,320
unwavering conversations

722
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,020
Maybe you were lost

723
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,520
and were afraid of losing

724
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:40,620
That's why

725
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,420
I was blinded

726
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:45,420
Ye Meng.

727
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,420
Li Jianye!

728
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
I really don't understand

729
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,420
why you can't be brave once.

730
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:56,420
I asked you to come 99 steps.

731
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Just take your step.

732
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,420
Li Jianye, I really don't want you anymore.

733
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,420
It's me.

734
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,420
I'm afraid to say it.

735
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,420
I've said too much.

736
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:27,420
How can I make you understand me?

737
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,420
The promise I gave you.

738
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:35,420
The love I still remember.

739
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:38,420
Don't forget me.

740
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,420
I'm afraid to say it.

741
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,420
I shouldn't have been so stubborn.

742
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
I can't fly.

743
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:54,420
I'm still in love with the love in the ground.

744
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:01,420
If I'm just a small flower in the summer night.

745
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:11,420
Remember I'll be there for you.

746
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,420
The year is over.

747
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
I'm tired.

748
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,420
Chen Jian came to me every other day.

749
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,420
He's so annoying.

750
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:33,420
What do you want to do?

751
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,420
Who knows?

752
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:37,420
I guess I have a good business in the store.

753
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,420
So I don't want to divorce.

754
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Chen Xi.

755
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,420
You just came to me after the year is over.

756
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
Why don't you go to your neighbor?

757
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,420
I won't look for it anymore.

758
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:52,420
What's the situation?

759
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,420
I'm tired.

760
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,420
I want to chase.

761
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,420
Didn't you tell me the other day

762
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:00,420
that you were doing well?

763
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,420
He rejected me.

764
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
Li Jianyu.

765
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
Bai Xiazi.

766
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
Where's your stuff?

767
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
He rejected you?

768
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
You're so rich.

769
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
You're chasing a beautiful girl.

770
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
He didn't burn the incense.

771
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
He rejected you?

772
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Interesting.

773
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:22,420
He said he thought I was going to save him.

774
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,420
He was afraid to drag me into the water.

775
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:26,420
He asked me to find someone more worthy.

776
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,420
Why is he so hard to serve?

777
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
He's even harder to raise than Jin Yu.

778
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
He can't be cold or hot.

779
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
You take care of him.

780
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
He said you're his mother.

781
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
You don't care about him.

782
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
He just died in the corner.

783
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
I'm really tired.

784
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
What do you think?

785
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
You give up?

786
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,420
What if I don't give up?

787
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
He's talking about that.

788
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,420
I support you, sister.

789
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:53,420
Isn't a man with two legs a lot of things?

790
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,420
That's just a trick.

791
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,420
He has nothing to do with me.

792
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,420
Does he come here often?

793
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:14,420
I suspect he knows you and Li Junyu are not in a relationship.

794
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,420
And he doesn't know how to pursue you.

795
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,420
He wants to get to know my best friend.

796
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,420
Why don't you say he wants to pursue you?

797
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
Are you crazy?

798
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,420
Really.

799
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
I don't know.

800
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Really.

801
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
Kai Kai.

802
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,420
Kai Kai.

803
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,420
Come in.

804
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:36,420
What a coincidence.

805
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
I'll call you right away.

806
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
I'll hang up first.

807
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,420
You're so unnaturally.

808
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
What a coincidence.

809
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:47,420
There's a cup of hot milk tea in the car.

810
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
It's sugar-free.

811
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Have a try.

812
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,420
Thank you.

813
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:57,420
Oh, there's another cup.

814
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,420
Thank you.

815
00:33:59,420 --> 00:34:00,420
What a coincidence.

816
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,420
Why are you two here?

817
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,420
You have something to say or not?

818
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Am I dumb?

819
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
You should be here.

820
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:13,420
Li Junyu.

821
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,420
I asked him to come back to work.

822
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,420
You told me this.

823
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Didn't you say a few days ago that you should be generous?

824
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,420
Don't be so petty.

825
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
It used to be the past.

826
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Now it's the present.

827
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
I said it.

828
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:29,420
And Li Junyu and I are not stupid.

829
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
We're brothers.

830
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Why are you telling me?

831
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
What does Li Junyu have to do with me?

832
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,420
I didn't say it has to do with you.

833
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Then you saw what I said.

834
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
What's wrong with my eyes?

835
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,420
I saw you.

836
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,420
Kai Kai.

837
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
I have an appointment with a beauty.

838
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,420
No one is watching the store for me.

839
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Yang Jian.

840
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,420
Yang Jian.

841
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,420
I don't have time to pick up Jiayu.

842
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,420
You...

843
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,420
Kai Kai, you're so nice.

844
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,420
I'm going.

845
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,420
You're so nice.

846
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,420
Let's go.

847
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:04,420
Thank you for the milk tea.

848
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,420
Thank you.

849
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,420
You're all leaving?

850
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
Listen, she's a bad girl.

851
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:11,420
Don't tell a scary story in the middle of the night.

852
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,420
Really.

853
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
Thanks.

854
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Have this.

855
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
How about

856
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,420
the new representative stand in the night market?

857
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,420
Okay.

858
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,420
Dr. Gao.

859
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,420
You're so handsome.

860
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,420
You're dating?

861
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,420
Yes.

862
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,120
You'reRAISING

863
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,440
THE LE

864
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,760
Ye Mang.

865
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,200
That's the princess.

866
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,480
No, this is not a date.

867
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,480
I need your help.

868
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:05,440
Lady Tong. Let me see your legs.

869
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,620
Does it hurt?

870
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,400
No.

871
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,040
Lady Tong, your legs

872
00:36:11,220 --> 00:36:12,300
are almost해요 good.

873
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,080
I can go home now.

874
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,720
Pay attention to your legs.

875
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,720
Go ahead

876
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,320
What's going on with Ye Men

877
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,000
Why don't you know how to take that opportunity

878
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,040
Catch

879
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,200
Forget it

880
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,680
Ye's family is different

881
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,400
This is a little bit

882
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,840
What's the difference

883
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,800
It's the old lady of their family

884
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:40,920
Dislike you

885
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,280
Jumping on you, right

886
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
I don't care how he jumps on you

887
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,160
Look at my grandson

888
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,400
White and soft

889
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,400
So handsome

890
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:52,240
What are you doing

891
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:52,760
Think about it

892
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,360
I'm a real man

893
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,960
You see you

894
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,560
I can't be happy

895
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,280
Handsome

896
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,920
Why are your legs good

897
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,640
It's on the mountain

898
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,240
Like a

899
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,960
Okay, see you at the hotel at seven o'clock

900
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:12,800
Ok

901
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:14,400
Who

902
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Dr. Gao

903
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,960
Why are you two on a date

904
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,280
What are we going to do

905
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,640
We are just ordinary friends

906
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,920
I asked my nephew to find an internship in Jiangbei

907
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,840
I'll help you

908
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,560
That man and woman relationship

909
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:29,200
Isn't it from you to help me

910
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,040
Did I help you start

911
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:31,760
Just right

912
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,040
Don't you think Li Jin Yu's golden fish is hard to raise

913
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,440
Then you change to Tao Yang

914
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,480
I think Dr. Gao is not bad

915
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,120
I really have no feelings for him

916
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,000
You just can't let Li Jin Yu go

917
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,440
You still say it to me

918
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,600
Give up

919
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,720
I suggest you

920
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,960
If you don't want to give up Li Jin Yu

921
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,360
You'd better ask him out

922
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,520
Meet and talk

923
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,520
Otherwise you will have some misunderstandings

924
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,160
You know

925
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:54,160
You will regret it later

926
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,920
Okay, don't talk about me

927
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
Think about yourself, okay

928
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,440
What do i have to think about

929
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,800
I thought about it

930
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,640
Men are more realistic than women

931
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,680
I have one piece of paper now

932
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,200
This is a piece of paper

933
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,800
Is to stay away from men

934
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,320
Otherwise it will become unfavorable

935
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,800
Why did I do it wrong again

936
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,880
What's wrong, Jia Yu

937
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,000
When will my mother and godmother come back

938
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,320
I have a question that I don't know

939
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,520
Why are you waiting for them

940
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,680
Ask brother if you don't know

941
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,200
This one

942
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,000
Is this a question for you two

943
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,640
I'm in the Olympic Games

944
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
Uncle, if you really don't know how to do it

945
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,560
Don't make it hard for yourself

946
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,160
I'm kidding

947
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,640
I've been in the Olympics since I was a kid

948
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,920
There's no question that I can't solve

949
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,280
This one

950
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,400
I think

951
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,360
Did you figure it out

952
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,000
Two minutes, two minutes

953
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,360
I think his idea is more clear

954
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,080
I think it's better to be honest

955
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,600
I think it's better to be honest

956
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,200
I think it's better to be honest

957
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,480
I think it's better to be honest

958
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,960
I think it's better to be honest

959
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,080
I think it's better to be honest

960
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,240
I think it's better to be honest

961
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,360
This, this

962
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,200
Uncle, if you really don't know how to make it

963
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,600
It's okay

964
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,080
Nothing will be difficult in the world

965
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,160
As long as you give up

966
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,520
You, you

967
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,000
You can do anything in the world

968
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,240
As long as you leap

969
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,160
You, you go

970
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,680
I go to the bathroom

971
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,200
OK, I'll tell you after you're done

972
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,200
What are you doing?

973
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,200
You're not my type.

974
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,200
You're looking for someone to do something?

975
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,200
To send flowers?

976
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,200
Let's go.

977
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
Dr. Gao.

978
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,200
Sister Fang He's leg is recovering well.

979
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,200
Then we should thank

980
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
our medical team for their professionalism.

981
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
Just take it as I don't exist today, Dr. Gao.

982
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:11,200
I just came to give you a meal.

983
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,200
You two should talk.

984
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,200
I don't know what flowers you like.

985
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
I just bought it myself.

986
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,200
Just for your flowers,

987
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,200
I will do my best for your niece.

988
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
Thank you.

989
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,200
Can you see what you want to eat?

990
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,200
You can see what you want to order.

991
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,200
Why don't you recommend it?

992
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,200
We haven't been to this restaurant.

993
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,200
Then I'll go.

994
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,200
You're the chef?

995
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Yes.

996
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,200
This one.

997
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,200
Okay.

998
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,200
And this shrimp.

999
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,200
Okay.

1000
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,200
Why are you standing in the back?

1001
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,200
Why did you agree to meet me?

1002
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,200
Ye Meng doesn't want you?

1003
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,200
Didn't you ask me out?

1004
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,200
Look at what you said.

1005
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,200
Fang Ya'en is here.

1006
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:12,200
He's here to test this man

1007
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,200
as his best friend.

1008
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,200
That means

1009
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
their relationship is going to develop further.

1010
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,200
You're in danger, bro.

1011
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
Ye Meng has always liked handsome guys.

1012
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,200
He chased after whoever he liked.

1013
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,200
He ran away when he was chased.

1014
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,200
He used to have a boyfriend.

1015
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,200
When everyone was chased,

1016
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,200
they were all cold.

1017
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,200
But every time Ye Meng left,

1018
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,200
he cried and cried and begged him to come back.

1019
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,200
Now,

1020
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
you're still young.

1021
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
You're still younger than some people

1022
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,200
who don't know who they like.

1023
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
I...

1024
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,200
Do you think I can like him?

1025
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,200
You...

1026
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Let's go.

1027
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,200
Why is Li Qian Yi here?

1028
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,200
Sorry, bro.

1029
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:15,200
Why are you two sisters here?

1030
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,200
What a coincidence.

1031
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Long time no see.

1032
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Enjoy your meal.

1033
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,200
What would you like to eat?

1034
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,200
What a coincidence.

1035
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,200
We can eat a lot.

1036
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I'm sorry.

1037
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,200
What did you see?

1038
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
It's a coincidence.

1039
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
We met a familiar person when we ate.

1040
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,200
We just met.

1041
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,200
We're not that familiar.

1042
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,200
By the way,

1043
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
send me the information about your niece

1044
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,200
so that I can ask for help.

1045
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,200
Thank you for your help.

1046
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
You're welcome.

1047
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:51,200
I hope what I said to you

1048
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,200
won't cause you any strange pressure.

1049
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,200
It's okay.

1050
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,200
Ye Meng was just on the road.

1051
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
I'm not praising you, Dr. Gao.

1052
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
Really?

1053
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
What did you praise me for?

1054
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,200
You're gentle,

1055
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,200
and you're upright.

1056
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:08,200
And you're a stable income.

1057
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,200
It's a good choice for many girls now.

1058
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,200
I think many girls you mentioned

1059
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,200
may not be you.

1060
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
I heard from Miss Fang

1061
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
that you like girls younger than you.

1062
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,200
I used to like girls younger than me.

1063
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,200
After the end of the year,

1064
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,200
I'll go back to the reality.

1065
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
You.

1066
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,200
I saw you.

1067
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
I thought of you.

1068
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,200
I heard from you

1069
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
all the news.

1070
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,200
The love that was created in my heart

1071
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,200
occupied my mind.

1072
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,200
I went to the end of the world

1073
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:34,200
but I couldn't find my way back.

1074
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,200
All the memories about you

1075
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,200
are like a deep grudge.

1076
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,200
I can't get rid of them.

1077
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:55,200
I stayed silent

1078
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,200
and kept the words in my mind.

1079
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:04,200
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading.

1080
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,200
I pretended to be stubborn

1081
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,200
but I was still obsessed with you.

1082
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,200
I lied to myself

1083
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:23,200
about the most perfect lies.

1084
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,200
If we can't let go of love,

1085
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,200
we'll lose our relationship.

1086
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,200
Why is it that

1087
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,200
my heart still yearns

1088
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,200
for the moment when I cry?
