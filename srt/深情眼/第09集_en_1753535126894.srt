YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, I forget

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath disappears at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is me who loves you more than anyone

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Let's go

15
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Go

16
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait for me to go back

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Why

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
My mom let godmother pick me up because my dad is back

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He doesn't want me to see them quarrel

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
You are really strange

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Just mix yourself with Ye Meng

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Let him bring his son

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Aren't you afraid that the child will be brought bad

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I warn you

25
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You can't talk about Ye Meng anymore

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He is not normal, can't you see

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm afraid my son can't be taught normally

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He is not normal, you are normal

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I warn you

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Don't threaten me with your son

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm not threatening you

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I just think that we are only remarried now

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Giving the child a complete home is the best choice for him

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Right

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are really funny

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Are you talking to me

37
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are really a bad person

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I will send you back to your cage

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Can't you hear

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Chen Jian

41
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You have forgotten what you have done, right

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Why did I divorce you

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You don't remember, right

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's because you are married

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
From the moment you hit me

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Our marriage has ended

47
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
That's it

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I have changed

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
If you didn't hit me just now

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I wouldn't have done this, right

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm used to it

52
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
They met

53
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There is no time to be quiet

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You are almost done

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I warn you

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Even if you get a divorce

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The right to raise your son must be mine

58
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Are you dreaming

59
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Who are you talking to

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are in the way

61
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm talking to you

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You can't say anything, right

63
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can't say anything

64
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
It's you again

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Fang Xiao'an and I haven't divorced

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are in such a hurry to get together with that little girl

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
You really owe me a lot

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I owe you a lot

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I come to see my wife and my son

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I owe you a lot

71
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
How can you see

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
What are you looking at

73
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm looking at you

74
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
What are you looking at

75
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't touch

76
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Son is back

77
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Dad, if you want to see me in the future

78
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can call me

79
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My mother bought me a phone watch

80
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You can call or video

81
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Ok

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
That's it

83
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Just find me in the future

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll find you another day

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Ok

86
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Did I scare you, baby?

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You have been arguing for so many years

89
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm used to it

90
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why are you here

91
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Ye Meng and Li Qingyu are in love

92
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I took Jiaxiaoyue back first

93
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She said you didn't eat at night

94
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Then she didn't eat

95
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I brought you something delicious

96
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I went back first

97
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Eat together

98
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Together

99
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Let's go

100
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
What do you see

101
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What's delicious

102
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
They are all your favorite

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Really? Thank you

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Go

105
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm home

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I went to rest early

107
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You don't go in and sit down

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
This

109
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just sat in my house

110
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Less than fifty meters in the middle

111
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Go to your house and sit down

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'll go to my house

113
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Ok

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I will go to my house

115
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'll go to my house

116
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll go to my house

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ok

118
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'll go to my house

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'll go to my house

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'll go to my house

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll go to my house

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Less than fifty meters in the middle

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Go to your house and sit down

124
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I doubt

125
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Do you have any other thoughts

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
What are Li Jingyu thinking

127
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In your heart

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I think about this every day

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Isn't it

130
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes, that's right

131
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Baby understands me

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Go to bed early

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Cold blood

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Go or not

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
No

137
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Three

138
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm tired

139
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Two

140
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is the first day we fall in love

141
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
One

142
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I know

143
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
We'll go now

144
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
See you tomorrow

145
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Ok, stop it

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Good night

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Good night

148
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Good night

149
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Good night

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't stay up late

151
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Good night

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Good night

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Sleep

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm tired

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm tired

156
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I'm tired

157
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm tired

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I'm tired

159
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Jiayu

160
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Today

161
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Because of some misunderstandings

162
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Mom and dad

163
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm a little unhappy

164
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
But this doesn't affect

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
My love for you

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Do you understand

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
So don't be

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Because of this

169
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Not happy

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Ok

171
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Mom, you are happy

172
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I am happy

173
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm happy to have you

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Mom, I'm sleepy

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't want to sleep

176
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Go to bed

177
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you asleep

178
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Yes

179
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Are you in a hurry to go home

180
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I am not going to sleep

181
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'll take it

182
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Ok

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Cheers

184
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Drink slowly

185
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Sister Yangyuan

186
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You drank a bottle

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My alcohol tolerance is good

188
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
And let me tell you

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,600
People who are mothers can't get drunk.

190
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,800
Because as long as you think of your child,

191
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,920
you can't get drunk.

192
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
Pour me some more.

193
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,480
What's wrong with you?

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I'm fine.

195
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Ye Meng,

196
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,160
I know him the best.

197
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,120
Back then,

198
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,320
he didn't save you.

199
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,560
It wasn't Ye Meng.

200
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,400
Now,

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,200
I just treat him as a friend.

202
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,880
Ye Meng?

203
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
That's good.

204
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,400
We're good friends.

205
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:45,960
Let's do it.

206
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,020
Let the unhappy past

207
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,040
pass.

208
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,880
What about your past?

209
00:10:58,800 --> 00:10:59,720
Is it the past?

210
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,320
normally I can't take advantage of you.

211
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
Do you

212
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,840
despise me

213
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,240
after all?

214
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,320
Now you're in a serious relationship.

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,480
Now you're in this situation.

216
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,240
I don't know why.

217
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,880
Why is a good person

218
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,520
so cowardly

219
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,120
in a marriage?

220
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,560
Not cowardly.

221
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,960
You're crying again.

222
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,880
I'm sorry.

223
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,320
What are you going to do

224
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,760
next?

225
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,680
I don't know.

226
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,160
We have a child.

227
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,840
I can't stop him from seeing Jiayu.

228
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,480
So the marriage must be

229
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
very smooth.

230
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,920
There's a saying that goes very well.

231
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,400
If you meet the right person,

232
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,760
even if you're in hell,

233
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,680
he will take you back to the mortal world.

234
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,520
If you meet the wrong person,

235
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
even if you're in heaven,

236
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,360
he will torture you

237
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,520
and drag you back to hell.

238
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,400
I'm not that lucky.

239
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,880
I've missed it since I quit school.

240
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,920
So it's normal

241
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,400
to meet the wrong person.

242
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,320
Don't go with her.

243
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,240
We made up.

244
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,680
Oh.

245
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,880
Jelai.

246
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,440
It's the counterfeits.

247
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,480
You're not coming back.

248
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,920
You want to save me.

249
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:23,960
And you hang on.

250
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,560
I-I can send you to the death sentence.

251
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,280
No, alone.

252
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:30,280
Sister Yang Yang, why don't you just quit?

253
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,280
I have no interest in going to school.

254
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,680
I'm going out to have a try.

255
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,480
Why are you leaving so suddenly?

256
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
Aren't you going to have a college entrance exam soon?

257
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,280
I'm going to drop out of school.

258
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
I didn't have good grades in school.

259
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,680
Instead of playing with you today,

260
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,480
I might as well go out to find a job early

261
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,080
and get more work experience.

262
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:50,480
Let's talk about it after the exam.

263
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,680
It's only a semester.

264
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:54,280
Anyway, I can't get the exam.

265
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,080
I'm different from Yan Meng.

266
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,680
My family doesn't have any requirements for me.

267
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,080
I might as well go out to find a job early

268
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,880
and share some burden with my family.

269
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,480
What if you leave?

270
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,480
What about the three of us?

271
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
If Yan Meng knows you're leaving,

272
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,680
he will definitely stop you.

273
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,480
He knows.

274
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,480
I'm the only one who knows.

275
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,880
Have you ever treated me as a brother?

276
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,280
Mrs.

277
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,080
Don't play anymore.

278
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,280
Study hard and stop playing.

279
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,280
Be good.

280
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,280
Alright.

281
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,480
I'm leaving.

282
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,280
What are you doing?

283
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,280
Well, your mom...

284
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,880
Your mom is drunk.

285
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,680
I...

286
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:13,880
I'm leaving.

287
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:14,880
Stop.

288
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,680
Do you like my mom?

289
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:19,680
Don't talk nonsense.

290
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,480
How could I like you?

291
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,280
I'm not your mom.

292
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,480
I'm your mom.

293
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
I'm your mom.

294
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,880
I'm not your mom.

295
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,680
How could I like your mom?

296
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I don't hate you,

297
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,080
but

298
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,280
my parents are not divorced yet.

299
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,280
And I don't want a new dad that soon.

300
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,680
You should think about it first.

301
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,680
Don't be so anxious.

302
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,280
I didn't expect you to be my new dad.

303
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,480
I don't need to think about it.

304
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,280
I'm leaving.

305
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,280
Cover your mom's quilt.

306
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,080
Take off your shoes.

307
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,080
Take care of your mom.

308
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,280
Wait.

309
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,680
You're leaving again?

310
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:51,880
Turn off the light.

311
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,080
Lock the door.

312
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,080
I know.

313
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,680
I know.

314
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,480
I know.

315
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,080
The light is broken.

316
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,480
Little rabbit.

317
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
How could I like your mom?

318
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,080
Chen Kai Ran.

319
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,880
He likes Fang Ya'en.

320
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,080
Chen Kai Ran likes Fang Ya'en?

321
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,280
Is it possible?

322
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:31,880
Brother Ran.

323
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
Tell me.

324
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,880
Can you like Fang Ya'en?

325
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,880
We've been together for so many years.

326
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,480
He is really...

327
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,080
Is No.1 in 90?

328
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,480
Hello, I'm the driver you asked for.

329
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
Where is the winter vacation?

330
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,280
Okay.

331
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,080
Thank you.

332
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
The electrician's office.

333
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Mai Mai, this way.

334
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,880
Li.

335
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,280
Did you give the 50,000 yuan to Nami?

336
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
I gave it to her this morning.

337
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,480
The live broadcast is coming soon.

338
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,280
Be more energetic.

339
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,480
Mai Mai, sit here.

340
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Okay, let's change the position.

341
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:24,680
Okay.

342
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,480
Get a cup of coffee.

343
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,480
Okay.

344
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,880
Brother, is it so profitable to be a web celebrity?

345
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,480
Nami just became a celebrity.

346
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,880
It's just a part of the advertisement.

347
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,880
That's a lot of advertisement.

348
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,480
Not much.

349
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,680
There will be more in a few days.

350
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,880
There will be at least a few more by the end of the year.

351
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,480
There will be only a few hundred thousand at the end.

352
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,080
Thank you.

353
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:49,280
Brother, I don't have a big dream.

354
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,280
I just want to leave this small city.

355
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,880
I want to sing and be seen by more people.

356
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,680
I want to have my own stage.

357
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:57,880
That's okay.

358
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,080
First, you need to train.

359
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,280
After you debut, you will have your own stage.

360
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,080
Really?

361
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,080
How long do I need to train?

362
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,480
That's just a small amount.

363
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,680
Overall, it's less than two months.

364
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,880
But now you need to pay a training fee.

365
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
How much is it?

366
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,480
100,000 yuan.

367
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,880
That much?

368
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,080
Not much.

369
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,880
You said you need to train your own body,

370
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,880
style, and professionalism.

371
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,880
Is the training fee that much?

372
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,080
Then we can talk about business and cooperation.

373
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,080
Right?

374
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,480
But don't worry.

375
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,880
You saved tens of millions of netizens.

376
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,280
You will earn the money back in a few days.

377
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,880
How about it?

378
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,480
But I already have 50,000 yuan.

379
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:40,280
It's okay.

380
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,280
Then you can think about it.

381
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,280
I'll go back to work.

382
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,080
Okay.

383
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,480
Let's talk about this.

384
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Brother,

385
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,080
I'll teach you.

386
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
Help me get more endorsements.

387
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,880
It's a small problem.

388
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,280
You need to work hard.

389
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,480
I'll work hard.

390
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Director,

391
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,280
here's your contract.

392
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:57,080
Okay.

393
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:57,880
You can sit down.

394
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,280
Thank you, Director.

395
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,080
I'll get back to work.

396
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,080
We'll have a live broadcast later.

397
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,080
I'll be in charge of the atmosphere.

398
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:04,480
Okay.

399
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,080
Okay?

400
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:05,680
There are two models.

401
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,280
You need to pay attention when you shoot.

402
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,280
You really don't want me to visit Grandma?

403
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,280
You want to visit Grandma

404
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,680
or to visit Dr. Gao?

405
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,280
Yes.

406
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,480
I want to see if Dr. Gao

407
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,480
will be sad without me.

408
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,280
Do I need to comfort him?

409
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,280
Okay.

410
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,280
Then you comfort him.

411
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,480
By the way,

412
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,680
think about how to comfort me at night.

413
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,280
Brother, you've improved.

414
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,680
You've learned how to fight back.

415
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,080
Sister Ye Meng.

416
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,280
Sister Ye Meng.

417
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,080
Brother, you're together.

418
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,080
Why are you here?

419
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,480
I'm here to visit Grandma.

420
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,480
Hello.

421
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,080
This is...

422
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,280
This is my agent, Brother Wang.

423
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,080
Brother Wang, this is my brother and his girlfriend.

424
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,680
Your agent is very good.

425
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,480
Is it okay?

426
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,480
Do you have a private account?

427
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,280
I'll take it.

428
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,480
Now, the pit fee

429
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,680
is 50% of the live broadcast fee.

430
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,080
We're doing MCN.

431
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,880
This is for creating artists and netizens.

432
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,680
I think you two have good points.

433
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,680
You'll definitely make it.

434
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
You'll make a lot of money.

435
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,080
Do you want to consider it?

436
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,280
No.

437
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,680
You don't have to refuse so soon.

438
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,880
How about this?

439
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,480
Here's our business card.

440
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,880
Thank you.

441
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,080
You can keep it.

442
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,880
Our live broadcast is very popular.

443
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,280
We're not kids anymore.

444
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,680
We can still be netizens.

445
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,880
Wang.

446
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,480
I have something to tell you.

447
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,680
Sorry, I have to go.

448
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,480
If you need anything, call me.

449
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:46,880
Sister, you can go first.

450
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Okay, Brother.

451
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,880
Amy.

452
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Okay, Amy.

453
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,080
Okay.

454
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,280
Get on your job.

455
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,080
Don't be a daydreamer.

456
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,280
It's up to you.

457
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,080
It's settled.

458
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,280
Okay.

459
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,280
Is it better?

460
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,680
Come on.

461
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,480
What are you practicing?

462
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,280
You don't make money.

463
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
Don't bring it next time.

464
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,280
It's okay.

465
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,280
We're about to make money.

466
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,080
Don't worry.

467
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,080
What do you make?

468
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,080
Take your phone.

469
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,080
Let me see.

470
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
I'll help you.

471
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
Hurry up.

472
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,680
Let me see.

473
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,080
I see.

474
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:27,880
Grandma.

475
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Grandma.

476
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,680
My wife is here.

477
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,280
I didn't dream about it.

478
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,080
You're together.

479
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,080
Dad Li mentioned it.

480
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,880
You're finally awake.

481
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,880
I'm so happy to see you together.

482
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:53,880
Don't move.

483
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,280
Let me take a picture for you.

484
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
Grandma.

485
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,880
Turn around.

486
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,880
Okay.

487
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,880
It's so beautiful.

488
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,080
You don't have to take a picture.

489
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,480
It's really

490
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,680
a perfect picture.

491
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,680
Look at them.

492
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,680
It's okay.

493
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,080
She hasn't said

494
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,480
we're a perfect couple.

495
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:15,680
By the way,

496
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,480
someone asked me

497
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,880
to rent the flower pot.

498
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,080
Go back and take my business license

499
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,080
and the book

500
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,680
to my cabinet.

501
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,680
Take it back with you.

502
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,480
You said you're a good person.

503
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Why did you ask for rent?

504
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,080
I asked for it.

505
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,480
It's a good price.

506
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,480
50,000 a year.

507
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,280
400,000 a year.

508
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
200,000 a year.

509
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,680
You don't need money for marriage.

510
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,280
You don't need money for raising kids.

511
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:41,280
Right?

512
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,880
I can't have kids.

513
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,280
You're a bad kid.

514
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
But it's okay.

515
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,280
If you feel uncomfortable,

516
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,880
this medicine is well-treated.

517
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,480
Don't worry.

518
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,280
I'm fine.

519
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,080
What are you talking about?

520
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,080
I didn't plan to have kids.

521
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Stop laughing.

522
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,280
You're really...

523
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,880
No.

524
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,080
If you want to have kids,

525
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,280
I'll find you

526
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,880
a good person to marry.

527
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,680
Look at Ye Meng.

528
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,280
You're really...

529
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,280
Grandma.

530
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,680
We just got married.

531
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,280
We haven't planned for so long.

532
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,680
We're going to have kids, right?

533
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,080
Girls shouldn't be impulsive when they get married.

534
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,480
Especially when they have kids,

535
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,080
they should think about their relatives.

536
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,080
Miss Tao Juhua.

537
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Look at the name.

538
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
It's called a double-edged sword.

539
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
What are you talking about?

540
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:30,880
Manman.

541
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,880
Go back to your grandma.

542
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,680
Get more clothes for the change.

543
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,080
Okay.

544
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:36,880
If you want to eat fruit,

545
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,680
I'll wash it for you.

546
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,880
Aunt, don't forget.

547
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,480
Okay.

548
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,080
Eat your food.

549
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,480
Okay.

550
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Pay the Bastle.

551
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,680
That's not yours.

552
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,880
Put it down.

553
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:38,880
The agency told me

554
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,280
that I have to work hard beforehand for my debut.

555
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,080
I have nothing at hand these days.

556
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,120
I'll print it out and borrow it.

557
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,080
I'm borrowing it.

558
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I'll return it to you once I make money.

559
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
Brother, don't worry.

560
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,080
Just help me this time. I'm begging you.

561
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,240
Put it down now.

562
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,680
I'll pretend nothing happened.

563
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,680
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

564
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,800
Why are you so selfish?

565
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,960
Li Jingyu, you have your sister

566
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,680
to pay you now.

567
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,080
You're not going to take it.

568
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
What about me?

569
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,880
You know I love singing.

570
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,560
But I can only beat around the bush at the bar every day.

571
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,160
I don't even have a chance to sing.

572
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,960
Then you're stealing my things.

573
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,560
I'm different from you.

574
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,760
You're willing to stay in this small place for a lifetime.

575
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
I'm not.

576
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,560
I just want to make a living.

577
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,360
I want to go to the big city like Sister Ye Meng

578
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,960
to make big money and build a big market.

579
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,360
You want to make big money and build a big market.

580
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,360
No one stops you.

581
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,360
But you can't use my things to exchange.

582
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,760
Don't call me your grandma.

583
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,760
You're not her biological grandson.

584
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,560
What are you doing?

585
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,760
Put it down.

586
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,160
What are you doing?

587
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,160
Manman.

588
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,760
Where's the drawing?

589
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,560
I bought dog food for Ping'an.

590
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,560
It's fish flavor.

591
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,960
It smells so good.

592
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
Look.

593
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,960
I want to thank you for Ping'an.

594
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,760
I just saw Manman going out.

595
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,160
What?

596
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
Did you two have a fight?

597
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
I'm sorry.

598
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,760
I'm sorry.

599
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,760
I'm sorry.

600
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,760
I'm sorry.

601
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,760
I'm sorry.

602
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,760
I'm sorry.

603
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
I'm sorry.

604
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,360
I want to eat seafood these two days.

605
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,360
Can I get some crabs at your uncle's store?

606
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,960
I'm not hungry.

607
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,760
Go ahead.

608
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
Are you not hungry?

609
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
I don't have much appetite today.

610
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,200
All right.

611
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,440
I'll go now.

612
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,560
You can take your time.

613
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,120
I'll be back soon.

614
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,440
A drawing.

615
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,000
You can go there with a drawing.

616
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,040
deliberately

617
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,240
Where's my drawing?

618
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,640
What drawing?

619
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,760
You still want to play tricks on me?

620
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,560
Then kiss me.

621
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,360
You don't have any feelings for me now.

622
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,760
You're too mechanical.

623
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,760
Don't push me too hard.

624
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,360
You were so cold just now.

625
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,760
I was so sad.

626
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,360
What's wrong with me if you're mad?

627
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:36,560
Okay.

628
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,960
I was wrong.

629
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,760
I'm sorry.

630
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,560
Here you are.

631
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Is this okay?

632
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,360
I'm leaving.

633
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,760
I was wrong.

634
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:55,560
I shouldn't be so cold to you.

635
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:55,960
Let's go.

636
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
Let's go eat.

637
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,760
Really? Are you sure?

638
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,960
If you regret it,

639
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,360
you'll never be able to get rid of the picture you've memorized.

640
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
I know.

641
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,160
Let's go.

642
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,360
Help me take my bag.

643
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:10,560
Okay.

644
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,160
And the key.

645
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,960
And the lock.

646
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Let's go.

647
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,960
Here you are.

648
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,360
Be careful.

649
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,360
Mengmeng, eat more.

650
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,360
Give Mengmeng more.

651
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
What's wrong?

652
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,760
Are you still mad?

653
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,360
Because your sister...

654
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
Eat something, okay?

655
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,360
You have to eat more.

656
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,760
That way, your grandma will be happy.

657
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,560
Actually,

658
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,160
I'm not her grandson.

659
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,560
I'm not her grandson.

660
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:08,960
I'm not her grandson.

661
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,160
What's the matter?

662
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,460
What?

663
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,520
You come to Magic Rope

664
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,560
to beat me up?

665
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,560
You.

666
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,360
Where did you get this?

667
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,360
My grandma...

668
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
Everything is okay now.

669
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,760
Go hug your grandpa.

670
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
Can I put this here?

671
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,980
Aren't you the one looking for me?

672
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,540
But your sister so Diana

673
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:42,580
Dry?

674
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,740
Generations

675
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,860
Int蓄

676
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,220
In grandma's heart

677
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,380
You are her grandson

678
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,860
Your sister took you very close

679
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,300
Are you a family?

680
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,260
Who is a family with her?

681
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,900
It's because she was sticking with me

682
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,660
일� Renae called me my head

683
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,140
Can't throw away

684
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,940
Brother, did you have lunch?

685
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,620
I know you haven't ride yet

686
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:08,060
I'm at home.

687
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,940
Go to the secret room with me later.

688
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,820
My friend's new store is free.

689
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,060
I'm not interested.

690
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,660
Do you hate me?

691
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,860
Every time I call you,

692
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,940
you're either not interested or not.

693
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,860
I'm begging you, brother.

694
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,100
Just go with me.

695
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:28,020
What are you doing?

696
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:28,780
Get up first.

697
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,700
Let's talk when you get up.

698
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,140
Get up.

699
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,540
Stand up.

700
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,580
Let's go.

701
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,020
Go.

702
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,100
Change your shoes.

703
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,580
That's right.

704
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,580
Let's go.

705
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,900
This is the prison in the office.

706
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:48,460
Yes.

707
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,140
One person is in charge.

708
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,140
Come on, show yourself.

709
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,340
How is it?

710
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,420
What are you doing?

711
00:32:52,420 --> 00:32:53,180
What's wrong?

712
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,340
Why are you touching me?

713
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,660
What's wrong with touching you?

714
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,860
What's wrong with you?

715
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,540
What do you mean?

716
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,460
Say it again.

717
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,100
How dare you hit me?

718
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:00,500
Come here.

719
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,340
What are you doing?

720
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,620
What are you doing?

721
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,260
Open the door.

722
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,860
What?

723
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:06,900
Wait for me.

724
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,580
Brother.

725
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,900
Li Jinyu.

726
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,340
Brother, someone bullied me.

727
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,860
Come and help me.

728
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,820
What's wrong?

729
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:13,780
He's a rogue.

730
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,100
He dared to touch me.

731
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,220
Are you his brother?

732
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,460
Don't make trouble.

733
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,980
Were you a rogue just now?

734
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,380
What's wrong with being a rogue?

735
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,060
How did you...

736
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,980
Cheng Kairan

737
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,740
No wonder Cheng Kairan said you were a lunatic

738
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,780
and knocked him out of the hospital.

739
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
That's the first time.

740
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,220
I think so.

741
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,460
You said you despise your sister.

742
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,180
You really love her.

743
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,340
She's close to you.

744
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,060
Okay.

745
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,740
Smile.

746
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,780
You're so annoying.

747
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,460
Maybe

748
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:58,340
you can call me brother.

749
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,340
I'll be fine.

750
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,300
Okay.

751
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,180
Brother.

752
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,700
Brother, come here.

753
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,700
I'll feed you.

754
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,140
Brother, open your mouth.

755
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,500
Brother, is it delicious?

756
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,620
You look so beautiful when you smile.

757
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,820
You're so annoying.

758
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,020
Eat.

759
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,820
You too.

760
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,060
Li Jinyu.

761
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:29,060
Li Jinyu.

762
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:32,060
Li Jinyu.

763
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,060
What?

764
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,660
I want to ask you a question.

765
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,260
Go ahead.

766
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:39,060
Why does Haicheng always smile?

767
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,260
He doesn't smile.

768
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,060
This is the biggest lie in the world.

769
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,260
I'm just kidding.

770
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,860
Can you stop laughing?

771
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,060
I'm not laughing.

772
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,260
I'm just kidding.

773
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,260
I'm not laughing.

774
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,260
I'm not laughing.

775
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
I'm not laughing.

776
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Can you cooperate with me?

777
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,260
Okay.

778
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,060
Tell me.

779
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,260
Why does Haicheng smile?

780
00:34:58,860 --> 00:34:59,860
Because

781
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,860
the smile in the sea is all fake.

782
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
It's a little cold.

783
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,260
Why is it cold?

784
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,860
What's wrong?

785
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,060
I have a night blindness.

786
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:15,060
Turn on the flashlight on your phone.

787
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,060
Are you really blind?

788
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,260
Yes.

789
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,060
Turn on the flashlight on your phone.

790
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,860
You can't see the road.

791
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,860
No.

792
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,060
Because I suddenly found

793
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,660
that someone was sending a message with a smile on his face.

794
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,860
So you like this kind of thing.

795
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,860
Then I should have

796
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:35,460
held it in my arms

797
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,460
when I first saw you.

798
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,460
That's not okay.

799
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,860
Look at the flash.

800
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:47,860
Does it look like the day you and Mai Mai were in the secret room?

801
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,860
How did you get out of there?

802
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:52,860
The flash rate of this light

803
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,860
is the password of the moth, right?

804
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,860
Do you want to try it?

805
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Do I use this?

806
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
B

807
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:02,860
H

808
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,860
P

809
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
G

810
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,860
G

811
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,860
Z

812
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,860
What does it mean?

813
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,860
You want to hear it?

814
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,860
Don't be afraid.

815
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,860
I'm here.

816
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
You are much colder than me.

817
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,860
I'm leaving.

818
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,860
Brother, where are you going?

819
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
I'm going home.

820
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
Brother, you look so handsome.

821
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,860
Thank you.

822
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,860
Brother.

823
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
I'm already a brother.

824
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,860
Just look around.

825
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,860
Sister.

826
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,860
Look, why are you here?

827
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:17,860
I brought you some delicious food.

828
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,860
Thank you.

829
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,860
And the main reason is that I bought a suit a few days ago.

830
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
It's a little big.

831
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,860
I want you to help me change it a little.

832
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Okay, you can.

833
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:28,860
You put it there. I'll help you look at it later.

834
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:35,860
What else?

835
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,860
Yesterday

836
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:45,860
Didn't we drink too much?

837
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,860
Then you...

838
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,860
That...

839
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,860
What's wrong with this time?

840
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
Oh my god.

841
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,860
This time is bad.

842
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
You said...

843
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
But I didn't take it to heart.

844
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
I'm just afraid of that Jia Yu talking nonsense.

845
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,860
And then you have some kind of misunderstanding about me.

846
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,860
Let's pretend nothing happened.

847
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,860
Pretend nothing happened to me.

848
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:17,860
From now on, you are my sister.

849
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,860
I'm your brother.

850
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:23,860
Oh my god.

851
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:28,860
KK.

852
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,860
That...

853
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,860
I really drank too much last night.

854
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,860
And then it's broken.

855
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,860
If sister really takes advantage of you

856
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,860
I can't be responsible for you.

857
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:43,860
Can you understand this?

858
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
No, no, no.

859
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
I'm not...

860
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
I didn't mean that.

861
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,860
I mean, I can continue.

862
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
I understand.

863
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,860
Mom, don't drink too much.

864
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,860
Last night, Uncle Cheng Kai Ran

865
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,860
hugged you on the sofa.

866
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:01,860
And then he...

867
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,860
I...

868
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
He even turned off the light.

869
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,860
And then...

870
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:12,860
I...

871
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:13,860
He left.

872
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,860
Oh, okay.

873
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
Thank you, KK.

874
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
It's my pleasure.

875
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Well, then...

876
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,860
I'll leave first.

877
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Okay, okay.

878
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,860
I'll do it another day.

879
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:29,860
By the way, I asked you last night.

880
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Did you not think it through?

881
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
What is it?

882
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,860
I don't know.

883
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,860
What is it?

884
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
Well, Jiao Yu said yesterday

885
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,860
I can teach her boxing.

886
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
She doesn't like boxing.

887
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,860
She'll like it in the future.

888
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I...

889
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:47,860
Is this garbage real?

890
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,860
I'll take it away for you.

891
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Thank you, thank you.

892
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Yiman, I'll ask her

893
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:51,860
the result of her consideration.

894
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:52,860
Who...

895
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,860
Stop.

896
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Are you guilty?

897
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,860
I... I'm guilty?

898
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
Then why didn't you tell me?

899
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
Mom, yesterday...

900
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,860
Shut up.

901
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Your mom and I

902
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:04,860
are in the revolutionary movement.

903
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,860
You know?

904
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:06,860
Stop talking about it.

905
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,860
Otherwise, our 15-year-old

906
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
friendship is a small thing.

907
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
It's embarrassing.

908
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:13,860
I don't know if my mom is embarrassed.

909
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
But I think you're embarrassed now.

910
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,860
Keep your voice down.

911
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
My Yu, my brother.

912
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
I'm begging you, okay?

913
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:25,860
Don't tell your mom about this.

914
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
If you have any problems in the future,

915
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
just tell me.

916
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,860
I'll do as you say.

917
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,860
Okay.

918
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
I'll promise you

919
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,860
to turn it into a secret between us.

920
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,860
But you called my brother

921
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,860
because you were wrong.

922
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,860
Do you want to fight with me?

923
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:46,860
Okay.

924
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,860
Then it's settled.

925
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,860
You call me Yu,

926
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,860
I call you Kaige.

927
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,860
Okay.

928
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,860
I'm Yu.

929
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
You should think about

930
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
boxing.

931
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,860
I'll call you Yu.

932
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,860
I'll teach you how to be a martial arts master.

933
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Then you can protect your mom.

934
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,860
No.

935
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,860
It's just a temporary problem.

936
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
It's a long-term thing

937
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:10,860
to use knowledge to disguise yourself.

938
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Okay.

939
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
And now you can protect my mom.

940
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,860
Go back.

941
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,860
Go.

942
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
It's no use to do this every day.

943
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
I don't want to do it.

944
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:52,860
Keep doing it.

945
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,860
There are 20 minutes left.

946
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:56,860
I don't want to do it.

947
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,860
Just go.

948
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,860
It's even worse.

949
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
Look at their family.

950
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
They are so warm.

951
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:08,860
Look.

952
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,860
I encourage you to work hard.

953
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:13,860
You are in a good mood.

954
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
He can recover quickly.

955
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,860
Right?

956
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,860
People who don't know

957
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,860
think you are looking at criminals.

958
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,860
Criminals are better than you.

959
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,860
Hurry up.

960
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,860
I'm writing you a watch.

961
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
I feel a little dizzy.

962
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,860
I need some sugar.

963
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,860
Get me some food.

964
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:35,860
I'll go after I finish it.

965
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,860
What are you doing?

966
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:39,860
Looking at criminals.

967
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:40,860
Right.

968
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,860
Look.

969
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,860
Girls are waiting for girls.

970
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:45,860
Hurry up.

971
00:42:45,860 --> 00:42:46,860
Grandma.

972
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:47,860
I'll help you.

973
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,860
I'll play some music for you.

974
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:51,860
We have more motivation.

975
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:52,860
Play a song.

976
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:54,860
I'll choose one for you.

977
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,860
This song.

978
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,860
Hurry up.

979
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,860
Look.

980
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,860
The manager is coming.

981
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,860
Look.

982
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,860
Look.

983
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,860
Hurry up.

984
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,860
I'll go first.

985
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,860
Bye.

986
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:17,860
Stinky girl.

987
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:18,860
Just pretend to be a girl.

988
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:19,860
Right?

989
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:20,860
Good.

990
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:21,860
Not bad.

991
00:43:21,860 --> 00:43:22,860
I'll play it for you.

992
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:23,860
Really.

993
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,860
What a bad attitude.

994
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:26,860
Right.

995
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:53,860
You

996
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:56,860
I saw you

997
00:43:57,860 --> 00:43:59,860
I thought of you

998
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:02,860
I heard you

999
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,860
Any news

1000
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:11,860
The love that was raised in my heart

1001
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:15,860
Occupies my mind

1002
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:17,860
Go

1003
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:20,860
Where to go

1004
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:23,860
How to avoid

1005
00:44:24,860 --> 00:44:29,860
Those memories about you

1006
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,860
I am so addicted to the deep

1007
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:38,860
Can't cut off

1008
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:44,860
I am silent

1009
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,860
Put the flowers in the back

1010
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:54,860
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

1011
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,860
Pretend to be determined

1012
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,860
But still in the origin

1013
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,860
Obscure

1014
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,860
The most perfect lie

1015
00:45:10,860 --> 00:45:12,860
Deceive yourself

1016
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:15,860
If love is let go

1017
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,860
Let us lose the relationship

1018
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,860
Why is this

1019
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:25,860
The moment of tears

1020
00:45:26,860 --> 00:45:29,860
The heart is still

1021
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,860
The most perfect lie

1022
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:50,860
Deceive yourself

1023
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:53,860
If love is let go

1024
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,860
Let us lose the relationship

1025
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,860
Why is this

1026
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:02,860
The moment of tears

1027
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,860
The moment of tears

1028
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,860
The most perfect lie

1029
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,860
Deceive yourself

1030
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:14,860
If love is let go
