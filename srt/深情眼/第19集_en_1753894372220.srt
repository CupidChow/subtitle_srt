1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Of Your Res shi

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks that are burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the road of farewell

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath is gradually missing at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is me who loves you with all my heart

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Even if it has never changed

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that every song has my dream

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The ad for the live broadcast has been put on the air

15
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The preparation for the opening of the live broadcast

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Including venue arrangement, equipment testing, guest reception, etc.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It has been given to all departments

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
And this week will prepare the media draft for the day of the event

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The PR team will also further explore potential customers from the marketing perspective

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Okay, that's it for today

21
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Okay

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Ye Meng

23
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Let's do this plan after lunch

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I think it's a little bit

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Go, I think so too

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Go

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
We know

28
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Go, go

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Go, Li

30
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thank you, brother

31
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Thank you for your hard work

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No one

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
No one

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
No one at all

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Honey, how are you?

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Are you tired today?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Brother

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Go, go, go

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
No

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I want to go to the toilet

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I want to go to the toilet

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
No

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You said you wanted to go with me

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I

46
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'm so nervous

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Go, go, go

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Go

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
No one noticed

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What's the situation with you recently?

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Let you cover us

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Not let you be a thief

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't always stare at me

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You go watch Gao Kai

55
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
As long as he doesn't watch me and Ye Meng

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Nothing will happen

57
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It makes sense

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Makes sense

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you still going?

60
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm not going

61
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Then you go

62
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
This Tan Mingxiao

63
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
It's really too much

64
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
By the way, wife

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Give me more advice on that plan

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Mr. Li

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mr. Li needs me to give you advice

68
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You don't know if others don't know

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm a bachelor

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You should be the real master

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll give you advice when I get home

72
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Ye Meng

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Why did you leave yesterday?

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I had something to do yesterday

75
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
So I left

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I was thinking

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I should have a good talk with you yesterday

78
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Go away

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've been talking to you for a long time

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I have a contract and I want to sign it

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What?

82
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Sign it

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
What do you want?

84
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Tan Mingxiao told me this morning

85
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What are you doing?

86
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
You are so rude

87
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What?

88
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
There are good things in the world

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You are still protecting me like a house

90
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Do you have any brothers like you?

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You have a problem

92
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Stop it

93
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I'm very afraid

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Mr. Gao

95
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Mr. Gao

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
You want to know what I did yesterday, right?

97
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I went to see my husband

98
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
We made up

99
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
No

100
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You and him

101
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Enough

102
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
They said they made up with their husbands

103
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Don't talk about it

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Go away

105
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

107
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Why does it have anything to do with you?

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Stop it

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are both useless

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Go away

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

113
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You have a problem

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It has something to do with you

115
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Don't look at me

116
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Does it have anything to do with you?

117
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Go away

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Mr. Gao, give it to me

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Gou

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Where are you going?

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Gou

122
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Are you leaving?

123
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm going back to Jiangbei

124
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I have something to tell you

125
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I didn't mean to hurt you

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I always see you as a brother

127
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
But now I can't help you

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I can't help you

129
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You don't have to confess your failure

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You can go back to Jiangbei

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
You don't have to confess your failure

132
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You don't have to confess your failure

133
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Shut up

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You don't have to confess your failure

135
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I haven't started yet

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You haven't started yet

137
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Forget it

138
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You should keep watching Ye Meng

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
And those who want to get close to her man

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Especially you

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Ok

142
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Don't be angry with me

143
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You will understand one day

144
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Do you understand?

145
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Gou

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Gou

147
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Manager Ye, come to my office

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Ok

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What's the matter?

150
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Don't look for Ye Meng

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's the same to look for me

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Mr. Bai, it's almost enough

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Go

154
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
What are you doing, Li Jinyu?

155
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Gou Kai is gone

156
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
We can't be too public now

157
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
What's the big deal?

158
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Can you go back to your home and endure it?

159
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
What if so many people see you?

160
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I can't stand it

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Especially you look so handsome when you turn to Gou Kai

162
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think it's sexy

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why are you so happy? Li Jinyu

164
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You are so good

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Where is Mr. Li?

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Inside

168
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Li Jinyu

169
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't

170
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Come in

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hello

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Brother Jinyu, long time no see

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Lin Yangyang

174
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's me

175
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm back

176
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Why are you hiding from me?

177
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't welcome me?

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Why are you here?

179
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I'm here to talk about the project

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I met Mrs. Li the day before yesterday

181
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
She said you accepted the project of Hailangang

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
My dad asked me to take over the hotel business

183
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Aunt asked me to come here to check

184
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Maybe we can cooperate

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You can talk first

186
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll go to work

187
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Pick up the phone

188
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Hello

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Jinyu, is Yangyang with you?

190
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I remember you had a good time in college

191
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She always misses you

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
She has a business now

193
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's quite compatible with our Hailangang

194
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
You can talk

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Okay, I got it

196
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And

197
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
She went to the big prison

198
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You should treat her well

199
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Invite her to eat and have a walk

200
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Okay

201
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
The one you just met

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
is the manager of our project, Mr. Ye

203
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
How about this?

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I'll take you to have a walk

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
If you don't understand anything, you can ask me directly

206
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Okay

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Manager Ye

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I need you to go to the construction site with me

209
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay

210
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
It's not good

211
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
This is our residential area

212
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We can finish the construction next year

213
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll go to the construction site

214
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay

215
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll go to the construction site

216
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Okay

217
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I'll go to the construction site

218
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Okay

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'll go to the construction site

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Okay

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll go to the construction site

222
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Okay

223
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Help me open it

224
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Thank you

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I'm sure they are innocent

226
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
They are innocent

227
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm not angry

228
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Tell me what you want to say

229
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Go

230
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's all sand over there

231
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
It's not safe

232
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Let's stop here today

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'm tired after walking

234
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I finally came back to China

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Let's have a meal together

236
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay

237
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Let's go together

238
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It's been a long day

239
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Okay

240
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Together

241
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay

242
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay, let's go

243
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
This way

244
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Okay

245
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I'm happy to be here

246
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Thank you for walking with me

247
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Cheers

248
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It's my pleasure

249
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Cheers

250
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Cheers

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
How is it?

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I took this wine out of my dad's wine cabinet

253
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
He really hid it

254
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He doesn't want to drink it

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
We don't know how to drink

256
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's a waste to give it to us

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Right

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
You said it

259
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
So should we drink it or not?

260
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Why are you polite to me?

261
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Besides

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm happy to see you

263
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
A bottle of wine is nothing

264
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Thank you for your cooperation

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Miss Lin, Mr. Li

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Are you familiar with each other?

267
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Well

268
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I chased Jin Yu when I was in school

269
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm familiar with this kind of relationship

270
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
When did this happen?

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Why can't I remember?

272
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Right

273
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's been years

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Besides, you've been abroad for so many years

275
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I've never seen any foreign men

276
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
If you still like White Sweet

277
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can't stand it

278
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The moon abroad is more round than China

279
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
On the contrary

280
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I've refused her

281
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I've believed in myself

282
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I've always liked Li Jin Yu

283
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Ye Qinglin

284
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
What do you think?

285
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Miss Lin is sincere, dedicated and beautiful

286
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
It's Mr. Li's honor

287
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You're the same

288
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Come on

289
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Come on

290
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm not a man

291
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I...

292
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's drink together

293
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Come on

294
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Come on

295
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Thank you

296
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Ye Qinglin

297
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Miss Lin

298
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Miss Lin

299
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Ye Qinglin

300
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I want to ask you something

301
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Does Li Jin Yu have a girlfriend now?

302
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I don't know

303
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm not familiar with her

304
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'll pretend she doesn't have one

305
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Since she doesn't have one

306
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll start to pursue her again

307
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm not sure

308
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
if she likes me

309
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
or not

310
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Ye Qinglin

311
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Do you think I'm too shameless?

312
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I admire Miss Lin's directness

313
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
When I was chasing my husband

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I was like that

315
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
You're married

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can't tell at all

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
You must know how to

318
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
understand men

319
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Ye Qinglin

320
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Let's add each other on WeChat

321
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I don't often stay with you

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
A man like Li Jin Yu

323
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
will never be

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
taken over by others

325
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Please be my undercover

326
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
If you find someone who likes him

327
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Forget it

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He doesn't like most people

329
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
If you find

330
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
he's different from others

331
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
please tell me

332
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Who?

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Help me

334
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Okay

335
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Let's add each other on WeChat

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'll send you a gift

337
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Thank you

338
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll ask the driver to go back

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
You can send me home

340
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Let's go together

341
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Ye Qinglin

342
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
How can you go home?

343
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I won't go with you

344
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have friends to pick me up

345
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Ya'en

346
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Let me introduce

347
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Ya'en

348
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Let's go, Jin Yu

349
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Bye

350
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Bye

351
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Take care

352
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm leaving

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Bye

354
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Let's go

355
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Bye

356
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Bye

357
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why do you

358
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
ask me to pick you up?

359
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's going on?

360
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Let's have a drink

361
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Okay

362
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I won't see you off

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Have a good rest

364
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
No hurry

365
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
It's still early

366
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I have many questions

367
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
about the project

368
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I want you to answer them

369
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
It's too late

370
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
about the project

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
How about tomorrow

372
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
we have a meeting in the company?

373
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Li Jin Yu

374
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
How are you doing these years?

375
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm fine

376
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I've been missing you

377
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
So I came

378
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
when aunt asked me to come

379
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
You must know

380
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
what it means

381
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Although you are good

382
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
you are more suitable

383
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
for a brighter city

384
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I remember you went to university

385
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
and participated in WMC

386
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You were so excited

387
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
while playing racing

388
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I think no one

389
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
is more suitable than us

390
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You must be mistaken

391
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I thought you came

392
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
to talk about cooperation

393
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Cooperation is also cooperation

394
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
If we are together

395
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
it's a one-on-one

396
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
and a two-on-one cooperation

397
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Besides, people with

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
this kind of identity

399
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
don't have the right

400
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
to love freely

401
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Cooperation

402
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's too crazy

403
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I don't have any identity

404
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You are overestimating me

405
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
If you have nothing to do

406
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
have a good rest

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Do you have someone you like?

408
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
This...

409
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Oh my god

410
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
See?

411
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
This wheel

412
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
this car

413
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
this bag

414
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
It's useless to have money

415
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
If he has money

416
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
he will be more careful

417
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
and more careful

418
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
than you

419
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
He has too many

420
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
flowers and plants

421
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
You know

422
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
he has many flowers and plants

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
and you play hide-and-seek with him

424
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You can tell him

425
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What?

426
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You think

427
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
the underground love

428
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is more exciting?

429
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
A little bit

430
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
A little bit

431
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Just a little bit

432
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Really?

433
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
A little bit

434
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What are you talking about?

435
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So happy

436
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
You are having fun

437
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,000
with the underground love

438
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
between a couple

439
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Can you

440
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
tell me

441
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,000
about the underground love?

442
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I am using

443
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
my reputation and reputation

444
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
to maintain your relationship

445
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You know?

446
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
If it goes on like this

447
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
how can I find someone

448
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
in the government?

449
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Yan Lang

450
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You have your reputation and reputation

451
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,760
You are acting quite

452
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,760
attractive

453
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Five million, five million

454
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Yes

455
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I have five million, five million

456
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
for whom?

457
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
You touch Liang Jing

458
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You tell me

459
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
For whom?

460
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
OK

461
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
It's really for

462
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
us two

463
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll toast to Kai

464
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
OK?

465
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's more like it

466
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Cheers

467
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Come on, Kai

468
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Cheng Kai Ran

469
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
But Kai Kai is right

470
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
You are going to

471
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
keep acting with Li Jin Yu

472
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
like this?

473
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How is the investigation going?

474
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Don't ask him

475
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Cheng Kai Ran

476
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
How is the thing

477
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
that Li Jin Yu asked you to investigate

478
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Zhou Yu?

479
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Cheng Kai Ran

480
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
What?

481
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
What are you pretending?

482
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Zhou Yu's thing

483
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
How is the investigation going?

484
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Dong Yu?

485
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
What Dong Yu?

486
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
What?

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Cheng Kai Ran?

488
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I didn't order

489
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Cheng Kai Ran

490
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Wait

491
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You are fine

492
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
No

493
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Li Jin Yu is my brother

494
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
in my heart

495
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
But I'm not that kind of person

496
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
I'm loyal

497
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
We have made up

498
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You tell me

499
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
It's really OK

500
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Really

501
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Really

502
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You two are playing tricks on me

503
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
This bottle is mine

504
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Li Jin Yu and I

505
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
make up

506
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
It sounds so unbelievable

507
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
He is a fool

508
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Can we get married tomorrow?

509
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Finally

510
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
The single era of my Fang Ya'an

511
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
is coming

512
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm a little nervous

513
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I beg you, Chen Jian

514
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Don't go tomorrow

515
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Don't make any trouble

516
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Don't worry

517
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Even if he doesn't go

518
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I will tie him up

519
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
We will get married

520
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You said it

521
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I said it

522
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Come with me tomorrow

523
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I have to

524
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
I will come tomorrow

525
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I will

526
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
What's the matter with you?

527
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Go away

528
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We are schoolmates

529
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I have to be there tomorrow

530
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
for the sake of schoolmates

531
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
In such a happy moment

532
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Come on

533
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Let's go

534
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Let's drink

535
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Let's drink

536
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Cheers

537
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What about Zhou Yu?

538
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Men

539
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
are really

540
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
cool

541
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Not reliable

542
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Mr. Li

543
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Welcome

544
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
to Han's Club

545
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Why are you back so late?

546
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I brought you

547
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
the flowers and flowers

548
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I just went abroad

549
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I was busy

550
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I dare not come back early

551
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I don't want to

552
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
delay your date with Miss Lin

553
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I'm sorry

554
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I'm sorry

555
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I'm sorry

556
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm sorry

557
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I'm sorry

558
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I'm sorry

559
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'm sorry

560
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm sorry

561
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm sorry

562
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'm sorry

563
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'm sorry

564
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry

565
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
This peach blossom cake

566
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
is sold by Miss Lin's hotel

567
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
You have worked hard

568
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
and sent Miss Lin back to her room

569
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I didn't send her up there

570
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
I waited until

571
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
she went up there

572
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I bought it on purpose

573
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I swear

574
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I didn't

575
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Come on

576
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Come in

577
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Why are you going in?

578
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I'm asking you to come in safely

579
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The dog comes in, you go out

580
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Wait

581
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Wait

582
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I'm not as good as safe

583
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
She is a heartless person

584
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
She didn't call me

585
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
even if I didn't come back for half a month

586
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I'm so nervous

587
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I came back to send you food

588
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You can't let me in

589
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
What should I do?

590
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Call me sister

591
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
You said it wrong

592
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Sister, please

593
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm sorry

594
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Let me in

595
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
You are so...

596
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,740
Piggy

597
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,780
Sorry

598
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,400
Don't be appointment

599
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,400
After the desk divorce

600
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:57,820
Ping An

601
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,500
I'm afraid you'll get angry.

602
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,940
Honey, I'm sorry.

603
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,140
I really had no choice today.

604
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:08,220
I apologize to you.

605
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,460
You've seen the situation today.

606
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,340
It's like...

607
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:17,140
I...

608
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,140
I'm sorry.

609
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,140
I'm sorry.

610
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,140
I'm sorry.

611
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
I'm sorry.

612
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,140
I'm sorry.

613
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,140
I'm sorry.

614
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,140
I'm sorry.

615
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
I'm sorry.

616
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,140
I...

617
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,140
Enough. Stop acting.

618
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
Sit down.

619
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:41,060
I'm not angry.

620
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:43,100
I think Lin Yangyang is cute.

621
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,740
Really?

622
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,740
Really.

623
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:46,340
You're quite a man.

624
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,740
Of course.

625
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,940
But today, when he was in the toilet,

626
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,060
he added my WeChat account.

627
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,260
He asked me to be his undercover.

628
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,860
You really added it?

629
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,580
If he knew the truth,

630
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:58,980
he would be so angry.

631
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,940
I can't help it if I don't add it.

632
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,300
We're the only ones left in the toilet.

633
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,180
He kept begging me.

634
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,180
What should I do?

635
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
But this person

636
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,180
is one of my mother's kind.

637
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,460
He values interests more than love.

638
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,580
He said he liked me

639
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:16,260
not because he liked me,

640
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,380
but because he values the business value of Li's family.

641
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
We should

642
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
keep an eye on him.

643
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
Okay.

644
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,860
Are you jealous today?

645
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,660
Why would I be jealous?

646
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,540
You're good at acting.

647
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,900
I can tell.

648
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,820
I'm not jealous.

649
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,460
Why are you looking at me like that?

650
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,460
Just practice.

651
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,620
You look cute when you're jealous.

652
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,020
Stop it.

653
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,020
I'm not jealous.

654
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,580
I'm stopping you.

655
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,060
Didn't you say I'm not jealous?

656
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:49,900
Why can't I be jealous?

657
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,460
No, you can't.

658
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
No.

659
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,540
You can be jealous in 15 minutes.

660
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:55,900
Okay.

661
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,660
Hurry up.

662
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
WeChat is coming.

663
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,260
Who is calling so late?

664
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,660
Who is it?

665
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Li Jin.

666
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,020
Zheng Canran.

667
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,460
What's up?

668
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,380
Bro,

669
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,540
I'm telling you.

670
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,140
Ye Meng and Fang Ya'en

671
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,220
came to my bar.

672
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:18,220
They gave me a question.

673
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,300
They stabbed me in the neck.

674
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,220
You know what?

675
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,700
But I didn't say anything.

676
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,700
I just remembered

677
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,460
we're brothers who can live together.

678
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,940
I didn't say anything.

679
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,260
Isn't that kind of you?

680
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,740
Zheng Canran,

681
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,340
tell me the truth.

682
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,580
When did I

683
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:34,900
stab you in the neck?

684
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,180
What's wrong with her?

685
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,180
She hung up.

686
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,660
I went to her place today

687
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,980
and told her we got back together.

688
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,420
I also asked her about Zhou Yu.

689
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,260
She didn't say anything.

690
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,540
She's really kind.

691
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:54,700
Bro,

692
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,940
I've had enough.

693
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,180
I've been the only one

694
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:59,380
who cares about our friendship for half a day.

695
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,700
You make me feel so cold.

696
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,100
My vision is lost.

697
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,220
Do you know?

698
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,700
Let's just do this.

699
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,580
I don't have any feelings for her.

700
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,100
I only have love.

701
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,980
I don't have any feelings for her.

702
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,580
I only have love.

703
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:20,580
What?

704
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,700
15 minutes have passed.

705
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,900
15 minutes have passed.

706
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,740
No.

707
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,220
It's passed.

708
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,500
It's three minutes.

709
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,180
No.

710
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,420
You can't see it.

711
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,820
Don't eat it.

712
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,820
I'll eat it.

713
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,220
You're not eating it, right?

714
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,460
No.

715
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,060
I didn't eat it.

716
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,860
Then...

717
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,660
Do you want to taste it?

718
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,300
I only bought these two.

719
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,540
I didn't give them to others.

720
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,900
You can see it, right?

721
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:48,980
These four.

722
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,700
Okay.

723
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,300
How could you buy them for others?

724
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,380
Okay.

725
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,420
Taste it.

726
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,380
Trans chicks

727
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,760
Trans chicks

728
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,540
Pat English help?

729
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,700
We have work today.

730
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,860
I can't send you to the school.

731
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,500
It's okay, mom.

732
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,460
I can go to school alone.

733
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:50,980
Okay, I'm going.

734
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,380
Ai Jiayu.

735
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:58,980
I want to tell you something.

736
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,820
Okay.

737
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm going to divorce your father today.

738
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,460
Mom, have you made up your mind?

739
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Actually, I'm very confused.

740
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
I'm mainly worried about you.

741
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,380
Mom, you don't have to feel sorry for me.

742
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,380
Because this is your life, your choice.

743
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:35,380
As long as it's your choice, I'll respect it.

744
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,980
Just like you respect me.

745
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:41,980
Don't be afraid.

746
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,980
Thank you, Jiayu.

747
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,980
Go to school.

748
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,380
Don't be late.

749
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
Bye.

750
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,980
The case is over.

751
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
According to the investigation,

752
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,980
the defendant Chen Jian and his family

753
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,980
have been found guilty.

754
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
According to the report,

755
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,980
according to the People's Republic of China's

756
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Civil Code of 1984,

757
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,980
the defendant is most likely to be

758
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:38,980
convicted under the principle of

759
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,980
not having a child.

760
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
First, he is likely to divorce.

761
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
Second, Chen Jiayu, the biological son of Kun,

762
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,980
was brought up by his defendant, Ya'en.

763
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,980
The defendant Chen Jian was brought up by the court.

764
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
Third, the defendant Chen Jian

765
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
can be visited by the law.

766
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,980
The premise is not to harm the health of the child.

767
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,980
We get divorced.

768
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
How about this?

769
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,980
Why would we tell me like that?

770
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,980
Sister, I was successfully divorced.

771
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,980
parties celebrate.

772
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,980
Is it a good bond, sister?

773
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,820
And?

774
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:49,780
Yes.

775
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,860
Umm.

776
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,540
Plan B is working.

777
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,420
Tomorrow?

778
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,500
The day after tomorrow.

779
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,220
Every morning post성 あの日朝から前uous jetlag.

780
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,820
See you.

781
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,420
Own media companies?

782
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,620
Let's make it powdered.

783
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:24,100
Stuck in.

784
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,180
I just signed my contract.

785
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,020
Always sold out.

786
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:36,460
Can't you do my first meeting?

787
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,300
New story.

788
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:39,780
Sakuraia.

789
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,740
What's the subject?

790
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,460
Oh.

791
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,740
The president's...

792
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,900
Mr. Li?

793
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,700
When will Yang Yang come?

794
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,620
Ye Meng just sent a message

795
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,780
saying they won't come.

796
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,900
He wants to go out alone.

797
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,700
Su Zheng Shan, get divorced!

798
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,500
I'm so happy!

799
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,780
Ye Meng, look.

800
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:09,900
Those young boys

801
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:12,100
are really energetic.

802
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:15,820
I wasted so much time before.

803
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:18,820
I gave up the whole forest for one person.

804
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:23,140
Young and ignorant,

805
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,220
I'm a bad boy.

806
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,860
I'm talking about you!

807
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,020
Yes!

808
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:28,980
I'm the only lucky one.

809
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,940
I have Jiayu.

810
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,340
Otherwise, I'll lose a lot.

811
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,580
Now, I'm single.

812
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,420
I have to experience

813
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,540
the happiness of a brother.

814
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:39,060
Are you happy?

815
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,780
Yes.

816
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:49,900
You're so serious.

817
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,180
Are you going to confess your love today?

818
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,940
No.

819
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,340
We're friends.

820
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,740
I just want to

821
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,540
celebrate her leaving the bitter sea.

822
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,180
That's good.

823
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,580
In case you fail,

824
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,940
you have to find me to comfort you.

825
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,660
What do you mean by failing?

826
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:10,780
Can you talk?

827
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,860
She just divorced

828
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,140
and is afraid of the pitfall.

829
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,940
She's going to jump into another pitfall.

830
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,780
Do you think it's possible?

831
00:34:19,780 --> 00:34:21,020
No.

832
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,220
Just recovering from being single

833
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:24,260
is the time when you need someone around you.

834
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:26,140
You'll be taken advantage of later.

835
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,020
Be bold and love her.

836
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,820
Don't hesitate to take the opportunity.

837
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,620
Believe me.

838
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,780
Women know women best.

839
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,660
What are you doing?

840
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,980
Don't be a fool.

841
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:36,620
Don't be a fool.

842
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,060
Man Man, sit down.

843
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,380
Women know women best.

844
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,540
I'm Man Man.

845
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,500
You don't know women, do you?

846
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,860
I don't know women.

847
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,260
I'm a rich man.

848
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:52,300
How can I not know women?

849
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,340
You know women.

850
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,020
You know women.

851
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:56,620
You made Lin Yang Yang

852
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,620
to be so poor that he couldn't bear to leave.

853
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,180
He couldn't live without his soul.

854
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,900
Tell me.

855
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,500
Is there any good way?

856
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,180
Let's just

857
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,140
blow him up.

858
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,580
Let's cooperate with the play

859
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,020
and get him out of the game.

860
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,460
Man Man.

861
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,380
You'd better be a man.

862
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,140
Look at me.

863
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,500
Brother Jing.

864
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,300
Hello.

865
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,580
This is...

866
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:41,460
Are you Jing Yu's friend?

867
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:43,740
What are you doing recently?

868
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,140
Aren't you here for the play?

869
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,300
I'm not here for the play.

870
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,980
She ordered a card for you.

871
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,940
Here.

872
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:51,340
Let's sit and talk.

873
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,540
Please sit.

874
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:54,860
She arranged all these flowers.

875
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:57,660
She also picked pears for you this afternoon.

876
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,380
What would you like to drink?

877
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,580
Let's make a girl's heart for this lady.

878
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,180
Okay.

879
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:05,340
Is this pear?

880
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,060
Yes.

881
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,740
She said it's from Kuale.

882
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,740
It's sweet.

883
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,860
Say something.

884
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,020
Okay.

885
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,780
Say something.

886
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,140
She's here for a long class.

887
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,420
We'll keep in touch.

888
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:17,220
She comes to my place

889
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,820
for four or five hours every day.

890
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,540
She'll lose her sleep if she goes home.

891
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,380
I want to tell you something today.

892
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,580
I've been working for her for three years.

893
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,220
She stays in my store when she's free.

894
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:29,660
Look at the women's stockings.

895
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:30,140
Look.

896
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:31,260
They're holding hands.

897
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,300
They're holding hands.

898
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,300
This is my most hateful behavior.

899
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,540
And that old lady Li, you know?

900
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,660
Her hair is white.

901
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,260
She doesn't even let me go.

902
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,660
She's so mean.

903
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,580
And that girl in the bathroom.

904
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,540
She's drinking with a girl.

905
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,020
She's drinking with a girl.

906
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,420
I can't even listen to her.

907
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,700
I'm shy.

908
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,140
I'm so shocked.

909
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,540
Look at her.

910
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:57,780
By the way,

911
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,900
she said she prepared these flowers

912
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,540
especially for you.

913
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:04,860
I don't know what this pear means.

914
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:06,940
I like it.

915
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,860
How is it?

916
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,540
Don't be angry.

917
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,700
This...

918
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,060
I didn't catch it.

919
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:12,860
Really.

920
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,860
Two, one.

921
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,260
You caught me.

922
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:19,860
I'll take a picture.

923
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,860
Come on.

924
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,060
Don't be so stingy.

925
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,460
Hello, sister.

926
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:30,860
Hello, sister.

927
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:31,740
What's wrong?

928
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:32,860
You look so good.

929
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,660
Let's have a drink together.

930
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,860
Drink?

931
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,460
Yes.

932
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,660
How old are you?

933
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:39,460
You two look so good.

934
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,460
We're in the same age.

935
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,260
Yes.

936
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:42,260
You're so sweet.

937
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,460
Let's have a drink together.

938
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,460
Okay.

939
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,060
Let's have a drink together.

940
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,260
What do you want to drink?

941
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Shake your head.

942
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,060
How about it?

943
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,060
Do you know how to play?

944
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,060
Okay.

945
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:53,060
We'll compete with the number of points.

946
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,060
Take a drink?

947
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:54,460
Yes.

948
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:54,860
Come on.

949
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:55,260
Come on.

950
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:55,660
Come on.

951
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:56,260
Come on.

952
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:56,860
Come on.

953
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:58,860
Come on.

954
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,660
I'll open it.

955
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,260
It's over.

956
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,460
Let's drink.

957
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,260
Okay.

958
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,660
Come on.

959
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,060
Let's drink.

960
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,860
Drink.

961
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:07,660
Let's drink.

962
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,460
Here you are.

963
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,060
Come on.

964
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,060
For sister.

965
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
What are you doing?

966
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,660
Are you crazy?

967
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,660
It's okay.

968
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,260
Sister.

969
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,060
For sister.

970
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,660
Okay.

971
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,460
For sister.

972
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,260
Li Xin Yu.

973
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,460
After we finish drinking,

974
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,460
we'll have a meeting.

975
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Look at Li Xin Yu.

976
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
Where is this bar?

977
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,460
You don't have a bar

978
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,860
that I don't know.

979
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,860
Come with me.

980
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:48,460
Let's go.

981
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,660
Excuse me.

982
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,260
Excuse me.

983
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:50,860
Sorry.

984
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,860
What?

985
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:05,860
Okay.

986
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,660
Open it.

987
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
You lose again.

988
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,660
Okay.

989
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:10,260
I'll drink.

990
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,060
You lose again.

991
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,860
It's the first time.

992
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,460
Okay.

993
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,460
Sister, you can't drink like this.

994
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,460
You can't raise fish.

995
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,060
Yes.

996
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:17,860
Again.

997
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,660
You have to drink more.

998
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:19,260
Come on.

999
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
No wine.

1000
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,460
Waiter, this way.

1001
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:24,660
What do you need?

1002
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:25,460
This.

1003
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,260
This.

1004
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:26,860
Okay.

1005
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,660
Go.

1006
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,660
What do you mean?

1007
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:29,460
Why is it

1008
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,660
their place?

1009
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,460
What do you mean?

1010
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,460
What do you mean?

1011
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,060
What do you mean?

1012
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,060
Why is it their place?

1013
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,260
Let's pretend we are the big fish.

1014
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,260
Let's leave.

1015
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:39,660
Leave.

1016
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,860
Sister, don't go.

1017
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
It's just the beginning.

1018
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:45,060
It's just the beginning.

1019
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,660
Yes.

1020
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:46,660
Don't be anxious.

1021
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,660
Let's go.

1022
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,260
Let's go.

1023
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
Let's go.

1024
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Let's play for a while.

1025
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,260
Let's play for a while.

1026
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
I don't want to drink.

1027
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,260
I don't want to drink.

1028
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I don't want to drink.

1029
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,260
I don't want to drink.

1030
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,860
Come on.

1031
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,260
Come on.

1032
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,260
Drink with me.

1033
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,260
Let's play together.

1034
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,260
Drink with me.

1035
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,260
Together.

1036
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,260
Come on.

1037
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,260
Drink with my wife.

1038
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Are you happy?

1039
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,260
I'm sorry.

1040
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,260
I'm sorry.

1041
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,060
Why are you here?

1042
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,260
My friend opened this store.

1043
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:31,660
Let me come and sit here.

1044
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,260
I just celebrated your divorce.

1045
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,260
You drink first.

1046
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,060
I'm leaving.

1047
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:37,660
I'm leaving.

1048
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,660
Bye.

1049
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,660
You miss us too early.

1050
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:45,060
You are so angry.

1051
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,260
It's okay.

1052
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,060
But you drove away the brothers.

1053
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,260
Who will drink with us?

1054
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,060
We will drink with you.

1055
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,260
Yes.

1056
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:56,460
We are not bad.

1057
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,860
The brothers are only twenty years old.

1058
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,460
You are old.

1059
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,260
I'm old.

1060
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,860
We are friends.

1061
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,860
You are...

1062
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:07,860
They say you are old.

1063
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
It's okay.

1064
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,060
I'm married.

1065
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,260
Otherwise, I will be single like you.

1066
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:16,860
You can't mention that.

1067
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,860
Come on.

1068
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,860
How can the brothers understand us?

1069
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:21,860
Come on.

1070
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:22,860
Let's play.

1071
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,660
I don't believe you.

1072
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,460
I've been playing for a long time.

1073
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:25,260
I'm going to dance.

1074
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,860
Honey, I'll go with you.

1075
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,460
Come on.

1076
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,260
You are...

1077
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,260
Wait for me.

1078
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,460
Come on.

1079
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,060
Let's drink first.

1080
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,260
I don't drink.

1081
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:36,660
You don't drink.

1082
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,860
Why are you here?

1083
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,660
I'll send Yang'an home later.

1084
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,460
Okay.

1085
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:42,860
Open something.

1086
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,260
I'll go to see Ye Meng.

1087
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:46,060
Waiter.

1088
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:50,260
Help us to see something.

1089
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,060
Okay.

1090
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,060
Come on.

1091
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Come on.

1092
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:04,660
Come on.

1093
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:05,260
Come on.

1094
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:05,860
Come on.

1095
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,660
Come on.

1096
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,060
I'll send you home later.

1097
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
What?

1098
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:19,060
I'll send you home later.

1099
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,260
I'm not in a hurry.

1100
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,460
I'm divorced today.

1101
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,660
I'm happy.

1102
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:24,660
Okay.

1103
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,860
I'm happy with you.

1104
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:28,260
Only you drink with others in the theater.

1105
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,060
I can't dance with the brothers.

1106
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,660
I'm cooperating with Cheng Daren.

1107
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,860
You are a scumbag.

1108
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,660
You forced Lin Yangyang away.

1109
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,060
Do you believe me?

1110
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,260
I'm rich.

1111
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,060
I have this confidence.

1112
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,860
No matter how good you are,

1113
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:49,060
I only like you.

1114
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,060
I'm not in a hurry.

1115
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,660
I'm happy with you.

1116
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:35,060
I'm happy with you.

1117
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,660
I'm happy with you.

1118
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,260
I'm happy with you.

1126
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,460
I'm happy with you.

1127
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:52,060
I'm happy with you.

1128
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,660

Let go of my memories

1139
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260
I want you

1161
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,860
I want you

1162
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:03,260
I'm a star in the sky

1163
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:27,460
You

1164
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,460
I saw you

1165
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:31,460
I thought of you

1166
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:37,460
I heard any news about you

1167
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:43,460
The love that is reflected in the heart

1168
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:45,460
I want you

1169
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:47,460
I want you

1170
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,460
I want you

1171
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,460
I want you

1172
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:53,460
I want you

1173
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,460
I want you

1174
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:59,460
Take over my thoughts

1175
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:04,460
Where to go

1176
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:08,460
How to avoid

1177
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:14,460
Those memories about you

1178
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:18,460
I'm so addicted to it

1179
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:24,460
Can't be cut off

1180
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:28,460
I am silent

1181
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:31,460
Put the flowers in the back

1182
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:37,460
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

1183
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:42,460
Self-proclaimed, self-proclaimed, pretending to be determined

1184
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:47,460
But still in the distance, obsessed

1185
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:52,460
The most perfect lie

1186
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,460
Deceive yourself

1187
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:01,460
If you love, let go, let us lose the relationship

1188
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,460
Just why

1189
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,460
Tearful moment

1190
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:12,460
Same heart
