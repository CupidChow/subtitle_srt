1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,720
Someone is not innocent.

2
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:03,900
No one is.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,200
No one will be guilty.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,180
Everyone has it's own president and president.

5
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,720
Whoever Tu ship use it to destroy,

6
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:12,020
One can destroy himself.

7
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:14,800
Who will be remembered by students?

8
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,420
Tell me.

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,520
你說我被掷入活種

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,980
Who will be blamed for children's death?

11
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,660
No, I don't believe it.

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,620
No one will be blamed.

13
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:28,860
NO, me.

14
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:29,940
Workshop needs you.

15
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:32,940
Walking, walking, forgetting

16
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,940
The promise is forgotten in the story

17
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,940
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

18
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,940
When I turn around and leave

19
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:49,940
If time can return to the door of farewell

20
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,940
I won't let go of your hand

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:01,940
The promise that can't be kept

22
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,940
Is empty at the edge

23
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,940
When the breath gradually disappears

24
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:13,940
There is someone who loves you more than me

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,940
Actually, it has never changed

26
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,940
If there is still a promise that will be kept

27
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:26,940
Please remember that dream of mine

28
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:55,940
I haven't been so happy for a long time

29
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,940
Yes

30
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,940
What's your plan after this?

31
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,940
No plan

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,940
I think life is very relaxed now

33
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
And there are no more bad things

34
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,940
Let's take a step forward

35
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,940
I'm ready to start a new life

36
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,940
Don't you want to have a new relationship?

37
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,940
I'm old

38
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,940
I can't do it

39
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:24,940
But I still think

40
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:27,940
Men are very troublesome to manage the East and West

41
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,940
I enjoy my freedom now

42
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,940
Look, time is free

43
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,940
And choice is free

44
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,940
The most important thing is freedom of emotion

45
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,940
So I don't want to go back and eat that kind of bitter

46
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,940
I'm not talking about all men

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,940
Look, you are a good person

48
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,940
I'm fine

49
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,940
And I really appreciate

50
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,940
your care and help

51
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,940
to me and my family

52
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
What are you doing?

53
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,940
The seat belt

54
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,940
The seat belt

55
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:23,940
I… I… the seat belt

56
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
What's wrong with the seat belt?

57
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,940
It's broken

58
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,940
What's broken?

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:27,940
Your seat belt is broken

60
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,940
It's broken?

61
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,940
It's okay

62
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
It's okay now

63
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:31,940
Just go

64
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
Okay

65
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,940
Bye

66
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,940
Take care

67
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,940
Fang Yun

68
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,940
Happy New Year

69
00:03:55,940 --> 00:03:56,940
Go

70
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,940
Happy New Year

71
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:47,940
Happy New Year

72
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,940
Happy New Year

73
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Brother Jingyu

74
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,940
You are here

75
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,940
Didn't you say

76
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,940
we should talk about the Hai Lang Geng project?

77
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,940
Why are you alone?

78
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,940
There is another person coming later

79
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,940
But before we talk about the formal matter

80
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
I have something to tell you

81
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:53,940
What's the matter?

82
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:56,940
Brother Jingyu

83
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,940
I like you

84
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,940
In order to get closer to you

85
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,940
I gave you a cheer when you drove the race car

86
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,940
You played until midnight

87
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
I was with you until midnight

88
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:10,940
I have never changed

89
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,940
since I like you

90
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,940
Don't you like me at all?

91
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,940
I am here to talk about the project

92
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,940
If it's something else, just go

93
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,940
No

94
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Aunt asked me to come

95
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
just to let us get together

96
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Brother Jingyu

97
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
I know you like to play

98
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
and want freedom

99
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:29,940
I have figured it out

100
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
After we get married

101
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,940
I will never interfere with your freedom

102
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Be a good and considerate assistant

103
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,940
as long as you can be with me

104
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,940
The marriage is my mother's decision

105
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
It has nothing to do with me

106
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,940
I have something to do, I have to go

107
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,940
No

108
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,940
Let go

109
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
Brother Jingyu

110
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,940
This is Yekang, the bank manager

111
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,940
of our project cooperation

112
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,940
What a coincidence

113
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:01,940
Yekang's daughter works in Hainan Port

114
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,940
She is Ye Meng, the manager of Ye

115
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
She accompanied me and Mr. Li

116
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
to go shopping with us two days ago

117
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,940
Yekang, the bank manager

118
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,940
This is Mr. Li, Jingyu

119
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,940
He is the person in charge of our project

120
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
Hello

121
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:18,940
Don't worry

122
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,940
I need to go to the bathroom

123
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Lin Haiyang

124
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,940
You are smarter than I thought

125
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:36,940
Brother Jingyu

126
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:37,940
What are you talking about?

127
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,940
But it's useless to be a little smart

128
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,940
You should focus more on

129
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
understanding the project

130
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
You have been to all the places you can find

131
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,940
I have found it

132
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
How is it?

133
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,940
You are here

134
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:04,940
You are here

135
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
Any clues?

136
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
He is too good at anti-inspection

137
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
He has nothing

138
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,940
Brother Jingyu is here

139
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,940
You two keep looking

140
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Call me if you need anything

141
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
OK

142
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
Why are you crying again?

143
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,940
You quarreled with Ye Meng again?

144
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,940
Can you be a little nicer to me?

145
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:39,940
Ye Meng's father is back

146
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,940
He happened to run into me today

147
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,940
and had dinner with Lin Haiyang

148
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
The key is in front of Lin Haiyang

149
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,940
I can't explain to him

150
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,940
So he took me as

151
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,940
a scumbag who cheated his daughter

152
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Ye is really accurate

153
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:06,940
You are in a dilemma now

154
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,940
You can't even wash the Yellow River

155
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,940
It's hard to do

156
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,940
What do you mean?

157
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
You came to me today

158
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
just to let me, the military counselor

159
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:30,940
give you some ideas

160
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,940
You are so rich now

161
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,940
You can't provide free services anymore

162
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
Why are you so confident?

163
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,940
You are always in a dilemma

164
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,940
Think about it

165
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:42,940
I often ran to Ye Meng's house when I was a kid

166
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,940
I saw Ye's uncle often

167
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,940
My combat experience is very good

168
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,940
If you can't do it, I'll find a Goukai

169
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
He gave me 250

170
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
OK, here you are

171
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,940
I'm done

172
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,940
Why are you so stingy now?

173
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
You are so rich

174
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
You gave me 8.8 yuan

175
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:11,940
I'll take it back

176
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,940
OK, I'll teach you

177
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,940
Ye's uncle works in the bank

178
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:23,940
You can't use money

179
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
You don't have to say that

180
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,940
Are you done? Say it

181
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,940
Ye's uncle likes

182
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,940
a graduate from a smart university

183
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:34,940
He likes to study well

184
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:38,940
You can't do it in high school

185
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,940
You can find a 985211

186
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,940
to get your university degree

187
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,940
Is this your idea?

188
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,940
Can I rely on you?

189
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
It's so reliable

190
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
If you can't do it, I'll take you there

191
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,940
Forget it, I found it

192
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:55,940
Ye Meng's father doesn't like you

193
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,940
It has nothing to do with his education

194
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
You said

195
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,940
You can ask Ye Meng directly

196
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,940
She must know her father

197
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,940
She is having dinner with her father

198
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,940
I hope

199
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,940
I can go to her house tonight

200
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
You are my brother

201
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,940
You can ask for more

202
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
What do you mean?

203
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Give me back the money

204
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,940
We are not friends

205
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,940
You are so funny

206
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,940
Hello

207
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,940
Why are youué?

208
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Plain

209
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
warrior

210
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
This 택 allerdings

211
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,940
We do not carry

212
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
any évidemment

213
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
You can beat me

214
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
or fire me

215
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
Dont play a suspect

216
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,940
You dare not

217
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,940
Come on

218
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
the end

219
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,940
founders

220
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,940
The ego

221
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,540
Thank you for being so kind

222
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,740
I just brought some fruits back

223
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,540
Come on, have a try

224
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,740
Here

225
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,620
Durian?

226
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,540
You don't usually eat durian

227
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,140
Why did you buy this?

228
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,740
Your father-in-law asked me to bring it back

229
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,140
He said we need this

230
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,740
Honey, this

231
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,140
We have a cutting board

232
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,540
It's not good to use a keyboard

233
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,540
It's not good to use a keyboard, right?

234
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,140
This is not necessary

235
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,540
It's not good to use a keyboard

236
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,340
This is good

237
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:37,140
Did dad tell you?

238
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,540
He told me the scene was very wonderful

239
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,740
Not only the confession and the romantic relationship

240
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,340
Although my dad doesn't watch TV series

241
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,340
But he said it was much more wonderful than TV series

242
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,140
This

243
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,740
The old man watching the son-in-law

244
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,140
Is the enemy of the revenge of the woman

245
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,540
I'm done this time

246
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,940
Honey, can you

247
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,340
I'm wrong

248
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,340
Can you help me?

249
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:06,540
Let me show my image in front of my dad

250
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Otherwise, he will be too far away from you

251
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,140
No way

252
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:17,340
I, Liu Yuanyan, will arrange it

253
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,340
Hello

254
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,140
I put it down

255
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm going to the police

256
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,740
Why don't you stop it?

257
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,140
What can I stop?

258
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,340
Where does it hurt?

259
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,340
My hand hurts

260
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,140
Are you okay?

261
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,740
I'm wrong

262
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,140
Where is it wrong?

263
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,140
I'm wrong everywhere

264
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,140
Help me

265
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,340
Okay

266
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,740
If you want to get my dad

267
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,140
You have to start with his hobby

268
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,940
Hobby

269
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,540
Dad

270
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,740
Dad

271
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,740
I heard from Ye Meng

272
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,340
You like fishing very much

273
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,740
I prepared some fish for you

274
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:02,740
Would you like to try?

275
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,340
Sorry

276
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,740
We have rules in the bank

277
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,940
Can't take it

278
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,140
We are a family

279
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:15,940
This is the love my son-in-law has for my father-in-law

280
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,740
He's such a little tw мыl

281
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,240
You take it

282
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,340
Okay

283
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,740
Let me take a break

284
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,740
I'm a professional diver.

285
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,740
I'm a good diver.

286
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:57,940
Well,

287
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,140
fish won't go to the center of the nest easily.

288
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,340
I'm using

289
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,740
black rice and red worms.

290
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,740
Would you like to try it?

291
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,540
Black rice and red worms?

292
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,140
Try it.

293
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:13,940
Come on.

294
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,740
Try it.

295
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,740
I'll try it.

296
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,540
Dad.

297
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,140
Yesterday, you saw Miss Lin.

298
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,340
She's just a partner

299
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,340
my mom arranged for me.

300
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,140
I never thought

301
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,140
she would be my partner.

302
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:41,540
It's just that

303
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,740
I'm in a state of privacy

304
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,940
with you.

305
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,140
It's not convenient for me to make a decision.

306
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,740
Marry?

307
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,540
What do you think of Ye Meng?

308
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,140
You misunderstood.

309
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:54,540
I'm sincere about her.

310
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,740
It's just that I just got into the company.

311
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,740
If this news is spread out,

312
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,540
it will cause a lot of rumors.

313
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,540
I'm afraid it will hurt her.

314
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,340
All right, no need to explain.

315
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,140
I've seen a lot of rich second-generation people like you.

316
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,540
I think I got it.

317
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,140
It's not small.

318
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:27,540
Here.

319
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,540
Come on, dad.

320
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,340
I'll give you the bag.

321
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,140
I'll take it.

322
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,940
How is it?

323
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:40,740
Here.

324
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,540
Dad, the fish is not small.

325
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:44,940
It's not small.

326
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,740
It's not small.

327
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:46,540
What's wrong?

328
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:49,140
I didn't expect it to be so big.

329
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,140
Come on, come on.

330
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,340
Come on.

331
00:17:58,340 --> 00:17:59,140
Mengmeng.

332
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,740
Look, the fish.

333
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,740
I'm finally back.

334
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,140
It's getting dark.

335
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,140
Look.

336
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,540
How do you eat this fish?

337
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,740
Li Junyu.

338
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,740
What's wrong with my pants?

339
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,140
Why are your shoes wet?

340
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:16,940
It's okay.

341
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,740
Dad, you let it jump into the river?

342
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,740
How can I let it jump into the river?

343
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,140
My fishing rod fell into the river.

344
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:24,540
It's on its own to help me catch the fishing rod.

345
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,140
Right, Li?

346
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,140
Yes.

347
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,740
I'm on my own to help dad

348
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
catch the fishing rod next time.

349
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,540
It has nothing to do with him.

350
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,140
Yes, it has nothing to do with me.

351
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,140
I'll go and get some fish.

352
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,140
Okay.

353
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,340
Hurry up and change your pants.

354
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,140
It's all wet.

355
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,940
I found that my dad is afraid of you.

356
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,340
He's not only afraid of me,

357
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,540
but also my three aunts

358
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,740
and my wife.

359
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,740
After you join the family,

360
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,940
you'll be the only one in the family who's not afraid.

361
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,740
So,

362
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,340
my family is the lowest in the world.

363
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,540
You can understand it that way.

364
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,340
So, don't worry.

365
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,540
He won't be displeased with you.

366
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,740
Because you're a double.

367
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,940
After you said that,

368
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,540
I don't know how to be happy.

369
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:10,940
I'm getting sad.

370
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:11,940
Mengmeng.

371
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,940
How do you eat this fish?

372
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,140
Let me see.

373
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,140
Hurry up and change your pants.

374
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,940
Don't catch a cold.

375
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,740
It's all dirty.

376
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,340
I'll take it off later.

377
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:31,340
You're lying, right?

378
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,340
You're a water fish.

379
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,540
No problem.

380
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,740
Go to rest.

381
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,340
Go to rest.

382
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,340
I'll call you when you're done.

383
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,140
No, I can help.

384
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,540
You two are a couple.

385
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,140
I'll call you when I'm done.

386
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:43,540
Come on.

387
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,740
Come on.

388
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,340
Dad, I'll do it.

389
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,340
I'll take a towel.

390
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,940
Do it well.

391
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,340
Clean it up.

392
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,940
Otherwise, it'll smell fishy.

393
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:06,940
Don't worry, dad.

394
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,740
When you slice it,

395
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,540
slice it thinly.

396
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:12,740
Then it'll taste better.

397
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,940
No problem, dad.

398
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,140
Why don't you rest first?

399
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,540
I'll tell you when I'm done.

400
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,340
No need.

401
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,540
I have to teach you.

402
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,540
Wait a minute.

403
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,340
Okay.

404
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,340
From this point on,

405
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,140
try to slice it as thin as possible.

406
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,340
No problem.

407
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,940
Slice it a little thinner.

408
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,140
Yes.

409
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,140
Look, it's beautiful.

410
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,140
Yes.

411
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,140
You try it first.

412
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
Thank you.

413
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
I'll try it.

414
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,940
I'll taste it for you.

415
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,340
It's delicious and delicious.

416
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,940
And your knife work is so thin.

417
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Of course.

418
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,140
It's a small thing.

419
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,940
Dad, don't be modest.

420
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,940
Look, you slice it thinly and evenly.

421
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,540
Your knife work is not for it.

422
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,740
Besides,

423
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:14,740
I'm not showing my knife work.

424
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,340
I'm showing my love.

425
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,140
You can do whatever you want.

426
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,940
No need to be modest.

427
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,340
You learn to be like my dad so fast.

428
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,140
Okay, I'll be modest.

429
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,140
Dad, thank you.

430
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:28,140
Thank you, dad.

431
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,540
As long as you think it's delicious,

432
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,940
we're willing to work hard.

433
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,540
Come on, Li.

434
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,340
You eat, too.

435
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,540
Thank you, dad.

436
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
I'll get you some wine.

437
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
I forgot.

438
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,940
What did you mean by that?

439
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,140
I meant it.

440
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,140
No, I meant it.

441
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,340
Yes.

442
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,140
Then I'll tell you.

443
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,540
Ye Meng grew up

444
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:07,340
with the support of our family.

445
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:09,740
I only have one request to his husband.

446
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:10,940
Tell me.

447
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,940
Be nice to him.

448
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,340
Don't worry. I'll do it.

449
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,940
Okay.

450
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,540
You'll have to live in a different environment.

451
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:22,740
Your environment and your life

452
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
are different.

453
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
As long as you support each other

454
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,940
and tolerate each other,

455
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,140
things will get better.

456
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,940
If Ye Meng

457
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,540
does anything wrong,

458
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
tell me.

459
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,940
I'll teach him.

460
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,940
As for this house,

461
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,940
I won't bother you young people.

462
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,540
Dad, here you are.

463
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,540
What kind of good wine is this?

464
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:45,940
It's not good.

465
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:46,940
It's new. Try it.

466
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
It's delicious.

467
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,540
Look.

468
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
What did I find?

469
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:03,540
No wonder I couldn't find Zhou Yu.

470
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,940
Because he's been hiding,

471
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,340
in our welfare home.

472
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,140
He's from the welfare home?

473
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,940
I heard that

474
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,740
his parents passed away when he was a child.

475
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:12,940
Before he was 18,

476
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,940
he had been living in the welfare home.

477
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:18,140
Before that, he was not adopted

478
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,340
because of Wang Xinsheng.

479
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
When Wang Xinsheng came here,

480
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,940
he bought a piece of land in Hailangang.

481
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,140
He wanted to invest.

482
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:26,540
But he's a foreigner.

483
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,940
No one here believes him.

484
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,740
So he found the welfare home.

485
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,540
He used charity as a pretext

486
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,940
to make money everywhere.

487
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,940
He invested a lot of money.

488
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,740
But soon, he was put into prison.

489
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:39,340
He ruined the reputation of our welfare home.

490
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,540
He wanted to adopt Zhou Yu.

491
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,940
But he gave up.

492
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,940
What's wrong?

493
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:57,140
This is the welfare home in Ningxue's old neighborhood.

494
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,540
My mom grew up there when she was a kid.

495
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,740
Find Zhou Yu and your kids!

496
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,940
Zhou Yu brought many sentries.

497
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:23,140
Got one?

498
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:24,940
No.

499
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,140
Come here.

500
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,140
Give me one.

501
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,740
Brother Zhou Yu, I want one too.

502
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Give me one.

503
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,740
Here, here is your messages.

504
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,740
I want it.

505
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,460
I want it.

506
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,820
Why are you still here?

507
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,900
Don't be nervous.

508
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,180
We have something to know.

509
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,580
I have nothing to say to you.

510
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,180
Zhou Yu.

511
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,180
You know Mr. Wang, right?

512
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,780
It's because of him that you've been targeting us.

513
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,260
You just want to win.

514
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,380
Just because of your stupid project,

515
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,580
so many children in the welfare center

516
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,820
lost their chance to be adopted.

517
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,060
What do you mean?

518
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,020
Our project has nothing to do with the welfare center.

519
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,420
Let go.

520
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,340
Make it clear.

521
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,020
Let go.

522
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,900
Zhou Yu.

523
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,860
What happened?

524
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,460
Did you break in again?

525
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,340
Zhou Yu.

526
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,940
We are from Hailangang.

527
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,220
I know.

528
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,860
This kid has done a lot of wrong things recently.

529
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,580
I didn't help him.

530
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,940
If it wasn't for the Hailangang project,

531
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,100
he would not have done these things

532
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,980
if he had been admitted to the welfare center.

533
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,020
It would not have happened.

534
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:35,180
He gave me orders from other market Egg Groups.

535
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,780
Do you know

536
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,460
how much about it,

537
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,780
Ω,

538
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,180
Hailangangbusiness,

539
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:52,020
Mr.Wang who is an other company's investor,

540
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:53,980
he wants us to get the trip contract.

541
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,740
Found it.

542
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,820
I'm sorry.

543
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:01,980
That partner

544
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,940
is also a child who grew up here.

545
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,220
We are very confident

546
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,580
in the project we introduced to him.

547
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,580
But we didn't expect

548
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,460
he would use our business

549
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,100
to invest in fraud.

550
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,820
Until he was exposed.

551
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,580
He also ruined

552
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,260
the life of the welfare home.

553
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,660
Zhou Yu

554
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,380
was also the victim at that time.

555
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,860
Shu Yi.

556
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:27,900
Shu Yi is my mother.

557
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,020
Do you know how he met

558
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,980
Mr. Wang?

559
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,220
I don't know the details.

560
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,460
I only know

561
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,860
they are quite familiar.

562
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,500
Oh.

563
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:40,940
Why are you here so late?

564
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,660
Have you eaten yet?

565
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:52,860
Cui Brother's house

566
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:02,300
and his Finance Department

567
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,620
are nearby.

568
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,780
I think

569
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,940
people from China

570
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,940
What did you eat outside?

571
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Do you want me to make you a bowl of noodles?

572
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,940
No, Grandma.

573
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,940
Grandma, do you know Wang Xing Sheng?

574
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,940
What Wang Xing Sheng?

575
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,940
I don't remember.

576
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,940
What about this?

577
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,940
I want to know if my mother's suicide

578
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:41,940
has anything to do with this project.

579
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:49,940
Grandma, I'm not a child anymore.

580
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,940
I'm not a child anymore.

581
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,940
I'm not a child anymore.

582
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,940
I'm not a child anymore.

583
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Grandma, I'm not a child anymore.

584
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,940
What are you hiding from me?

585
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Why can't you tell me the truth?

586
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,940
You little girl,

587
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,940
why are you so stubborn?

588
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,940
It's all in the past.

589
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,940
Why do you ask her?

590
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,940
She's my mother.

591
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:16,940
I don't know the truth.

592
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,940
I can't live my life.

593
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,940
Meng Meng,

594
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:23,940
not telling you the truth

595
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,940
is to protect you.

596
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,940
Protect me?

597
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,940
Okay, I'll go check it now.

598
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,940
If I can't find it, I'll never come back.

599
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,940
Meng Meng.

600
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,940
Your mother said

601
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:45,940
she had an old friend

602
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
who introduced an investment project

603
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,940
that made money.

604
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,940
You have to invest so much money.

605
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:55,940
Mom, you don't understand.

606
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,940
The more you invest, the more you earn.

607
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,940
Is your friend reliable?

608
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Mom, this project has a backup.

609
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
The government and the bank are cooperating.

610
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,940
It's definitely reliable.

611
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,940
I got it.

612
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,940
Wait a minute.

613
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,940
Mom, I won't tell you yet.

614
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:15,940
Trust me.

615
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:18,940
I'll make the money back soon.

616
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,940
The investor suddenly

617
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:28,940
couldn't reach me.

618
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,940
How is it?

619
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,940
Sorry, the number you have dialed is busy.

620
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,940
I can't reach her.

621
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,940
I'll send her a message.

622
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,940
I think this is a scam.

623
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,940
She might have run away with the money.

624
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,940
It's impossible.

625
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,940
Your mother thought of many ways

626
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:58,940
but couldn't get any news from that person.

627
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,940
In a few days,

628
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:04,940
the investor went to the welfare home.

629
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,940
She also cheated my money.

630
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,940
There was no other way.

631
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,940
Your mother was anxious too.

632
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,940
She didn't tell us anything.

633
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,940
She went to Jiangbei alone

634
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:22,940
to find that man.

635
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,940
Why did you keep this from me?

636
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:36,940
I told them to keep it from you.

637
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,940
Mom.

638
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,940
Meng.

639
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,940
I don't want you to see your mother

640
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:55,940
in a bad state.

641
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:57,940
I don't want you to see your mother

642
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,940
being criticized and tortured.

643
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,940
And Mr. Wang

644
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,940
has been arrested and sentenced to death.

645
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,940
So I think

646
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,940
this should be the end of it.

647
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,940
Do you know how I've been living these years?

648
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:25,940
I've been blaming myself and crying every day.

649
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:27,940
Because I think my mother

650
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:30,940
won because I didn't do well.

651
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:33,940
I don't know what to do.

652
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:36,940
I think I hid it from you

653
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,940
for your own good.

654
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,940
Yes.

655
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,940
You all think it's for my own good.

656
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,940
But you really think about me.

657
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,940
Meng.

658
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,940
Don't worry.

659
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,940
I'll go find him.

660
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,940
Why are you playing games alone?

661
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,940
I'm just playing.

662
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:25,940
Put on some clothes.

663
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,940
Don't catch a cold.

664
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,940
No one is playing this game anymore, right?

665
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:39,940
No one is playing it anymore.

666
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,940
I used to play this game with my mom.

667
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,940
As long as we're in the same team,

668
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,940
the winner will be the winner.

669
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,940
As long as we're in the same team,

670
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,940
the winner will be the winner.

671
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,940
It's cool to have your own partner.

672
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:58,940
We used to play games together

673
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,940
on this rooftop.

674
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,940
We used to chat about gossip.

675
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,940
My mom knows a lot of my secrets.

676
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:09,940
But she never taught me as a mother.

677
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,940
She didn't ask me anything.

678
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,940
She always said

679
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:22,940
that nothing is important to Meng.

680
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,940
What's important is that you're happy.

681
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,940
To you,

682
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,940
she's not just your mother.

683
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,940
She's your best friend.

684
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:42,940
That's why you blamed your dad

685
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:45,940
for not telling you the truth.

686
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:49,940
But I can see that

687
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,940
your dad loves you very much.

688
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Maybe

689
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:57,940
he just wants you to live happily.

690
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,940
And more, he wants you to run away.

691
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,940
How about

692
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,940
we find a chance to eat together?

693
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,940
You sit down with dad and have a good chat.

694
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm done.

695
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,940
I have nothing to talk about.

696
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,940
We're a family.

697
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,940
A family doesn't have a grudge, right?

698
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:43,940
No.

699
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,940
Why are you suddenly

700
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,940
standing with my dad?

701
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,940
How is that possible?

702
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:51,940
I'm always on your side.

703
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,940
I'm always on your side.

704
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:53,940
Look,

705
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:54,940
you're good,

706
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,940
and dad is good,

707
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,940
and I'm good.

708
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,940
Of course,

709
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,940
you're the most important person.

710
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
All right.

711
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,940
Don't cry.

712
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,940
It's time to cook tomorrow.

713
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:17,940
Thank you.

714
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,940
Why thank me?

715
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,940
Let's go.

716
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,940
All right.

717
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,940
You won't look pretty if you cry tomorrow.

718
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,940
I know.

719
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:43,940
How was your chat with Jing Yu?

720
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,940
He is like this.

721
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,940
He's cold to people.

722
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:49,940
It's okay.

723
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,940
I'll be with you soon.

724
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,940
I'll scold him.

725
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
Okay, that's it.

726
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,940
Director Li,

727
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,940
Miss Ling's progress is not smooth.

728
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,940
Will the marriage between the two families in Lingling

729
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:00,940
be affected?

730
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:02,940
What marriage?

731
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,940
I want to give the Hainan Port

732
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:05,940
to the market as soon as possible.

733
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,940
Dr. Yang,

734
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,940
long time no see.

735
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
Director Li.

736
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,940
Jing Yu,

737
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,940
this is the budget of

738
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,940
the Hainan Port 37.

739
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,940
Take a look.

740
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,940
If there is no problem,

741
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,940
we will push forward.

742
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,940
First, we will disassemble the fish village.

743
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,940
Jing Yu,

744
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,940
the fish village is the best location for you.

745
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,940
We are willing to cooperate with

746
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:37,940
Hanhai Group

747
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,940
to develop the 37 together.

748
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
We also take a good look

749
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
at the location of the fish village.

750
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,940
How about

751
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,940
we stop here today?

752
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:48,940
About the Hainan Port 37,

753
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,940
I will discuss it with my team

754
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,940
and then we will talk.

755
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,940
I'm sorry.

756
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,940
I'm sorry.

757
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Okay.

758
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:03,940
Bye.

759
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,940
I won't see you off.

760
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,940
See you off.

761
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:07,940
Okay.

762
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:08,940
Director Li, please wait.

763
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:09,940
Bye.

764
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:17,940
Dad,

765
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,940
don't forget to eat dinner at home tonight.

766
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,940
The dishes are here.

767
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,940
And a soup.

768
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,940
I have made the choice.

769
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
Don't work too hard.

770
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:37,940
Change it.

771
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,940
I'm not tired.

772
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:40,940
Dad should be here.

773
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,940
I'll open the door.

774
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,940
Coming.

775
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
Dad, you are here.

776
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
Jing Yu.

777
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:50,940
Where is Meng Meng?

778
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
She is waiting for you in the restaurant.

779
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:58,940
Meng Meng,

780
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,940
Meng Meng.

781
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:19,940
Dad,

782
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Ye Meng asked me to prepare

783
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,940
your favorite wine.

784
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:24,940
Please have a try.

785
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,940
Okay.

786
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,940
I know you are still angry with me.

787
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:52,940
Do you know?

788
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,940
It happened suddenly.

789
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
I was not prepared at all.

790
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,940
I just wanted to protect you.

791
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:07,940
Maybe I also wanted to avoid it.

792
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,940
To be honest,

793
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,940
your mom's sudden departure

794
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:16,940
was a big blow to me.

795
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,940
I thought that

796
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:21,940
as long as I didn't mention it,

797
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,940
the scar would never be removed.

798
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:30,940
Now I know

799
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:34,940
I was wrong.

800
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,940
Meng Meng,

801
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,940
I apologize to you.

802
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:45,940
I'm sorry.

803
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,940
I can't blame you.

804
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,940
Even if you told me at that time,

805
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,940
I might not accept it.

806
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,940
After all, I'm too young and immature.

807
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,940
I'm easily impulsive.

808
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:13,940
Then you won't be angry with me now, will you?

809
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:17,940
Let go of the past.

810
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,940
Be good.

811
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:22,940
Trust me.

812
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,940
Dad,

813
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,940
you too.

814
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:32,940
You have to look forward

815
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:34,940
to see what mom wants to see.

816
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,940
Okay.

817
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,940
Let's have a toast.

818
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,940
Come on.

819
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:50,940
Come on, dad.

820
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,940
Dad.

821
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,940
Yanyu,

822
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:03,940
I'm relieved to leave Meng Meng to you.

823
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:06,940
Thank you for your recognition.

824
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:08,940
You cooked all these dishes.

825
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:11,940
Try her cooking.

826
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
Come on.

827
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,940
I'll wash my hands first.

828
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,940
Okay.

829
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,940
Congratulations on successfully winning the old man.

830
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:25,940
Not bad.

831
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,940
Take off this.

832
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,940
You look handsome in a scarf.

833
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,940
Really?

834
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:36,940
Then wear more.

835
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,940
Yes.

836
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,940
You said so.

837
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
Don't send it. It's cold outside.

838
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Then I'll send it. You go back.

839
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,940
Dad.

840
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:51,940
Dad,

841
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,940
I actually want to talk to you about something else.

842
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,940
Go ahead.

843
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,940
The third phase of Hailangang will be completed soon.

844
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,940
We're going to dismantle this fishing village.

845
00:42:03,940 --> 00:42:04,940
Do you know about this?

846
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,940
Yes, I agree.

847
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,940
I don't understand.

848
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,940
This fishing village is the biggest feature of Ningcui

849
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,940
and the charm of the folk.

850
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:17,940
The beginning of Hailangang was also a big battle.

851
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,940
It was developed on the basis of the current ecological circle.

852
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:21,940
It's not to remove the original ecological circle.

853
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,940
You're right.

854
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:29,940
Our small fishing village is really not very good.

855
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:31,940
But you know,

856
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:33,940
it can't be big or strong.

857
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,940
Why did the government use commercial investment

858
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,940
to call our fishing village Hailangang?

859
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,940
Isn't it just to drive the tourism industry

860
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,940
and promote the tourism development here?

861
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,940
But this is where the Yemeng is growing.

862
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,940
It also carries many beautiful memories.

863
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,940
Dad, do you agree to dismantle this?

864
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,940
Don't talk about me.

865
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:57,940
Look at what Yemeng said.

866
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:58,940
You have to look forward.

867
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:00,940
For the development of our village,

868
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,940
some things should be put down.

869
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:04,940
Okay, go to accompany Yemeng.

870
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,940
Be careful on the road, dad.

871
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:13,940
Okay.

872
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,940
Yemeng

873
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,940
Grandma

874
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:44,940
Wake up. What's wrong with you?

875
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,940
Grandma

876
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:46,940
Grandma

877
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:55,940
Look.

878
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:56,940
Yes.

879
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:58,940
It can be confirmed that it is a brain tumor.

880
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,940
As for whether it is malignant,

881
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:02,940
it should be checked after the operation.

882
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,940
The patient's condition is not stable now.

883
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,940
Your family should discuss it as soon as possible.

884
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,940
Is it conservative treatment or surgery?

885
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:14,940
Two five five

886
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:27,940
The oldest person is old.

887
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,940
Actually, we don't mind the surgery.

888
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,940
The risk is very high.

889
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,940
But if it's successful,

890
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,940
it's likely to survive another ten years.

891
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:38,940
But you also know.

892
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:39,940
It's not easy to say.

893
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:40,700
Say it.

894
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,740
We'll decide after your family discusses it.

895
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:11,740
You.

896
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,340
I saw you.

897
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,540
I thought of you.

898
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:23,940
I heard news about you.

899
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,940
The love in my heart is overflowing.

900
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:36,940
It occupies my mind.

901
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:41,940
Where should I go?

902
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:50,940
How should I avoid those memories about you?

903
00:45:51,940 --> 00:46:01,940
I'm so addicted to you that I can't stop.

904
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:05,940
I'm silent.

905
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:08,940
I put the flowers in the back.

906
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,940
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading.

907
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:19,940
I pretended to be determined.

908
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:24,940
But I'm still obsessed with the source.

909
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:29,940
The most perfect lies.

910
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:32,940
They all deceive themselves.

911
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:39,940
If we can't let go, we'll lose our relationship.

912
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,940
But why do tears fall?

913
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:49,940
My heart is still yearning.

914
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:59,940
I'm still obsessed with you.

915
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:04,940
I'm still obsessed with you.

916
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:09,940
I'm still obsessed with you.

917
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:16,940
I'm still obsessed with you.
