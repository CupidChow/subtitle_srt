1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, I forget

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise was forgotten in the story

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I turn around and leave

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

7
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

8
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath is gradually missing at the edge of space

9
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have everything

10
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, it has never changed

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is still a if

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The promise will be kept

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 16

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm leaving, Sister An

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you for your hard work today

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Li Jin Yu

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I apologize to you

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I made you lose your job today

21
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll tell Kai Kai

22
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's okay

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I just want a quiet life

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I don't want to do so many things

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
What do you mean

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I want to take good care of grandma now

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I don't want to borrow the job

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Don't tease me

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I know you just want to play

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm leaving

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
What's wrong with Chen Jian

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Didn't you say you were going to divorce

33
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
He doesn't have a good time when he's together

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
If you want to divorce, you have to live there

35
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Disagree

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm not considerate of him

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Or let me help you

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
No need

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm sorry

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm sorry

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm sorry

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Jiayu

43
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What do you want to eat today

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Godmother will show you

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Don't

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Godmother

47
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Your cooking is unforgettable

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Let's order takeout

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You made a meal for my son

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm so happy

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Okay

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'll treat you

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'll order

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Thank you, Godmother

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry

57
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
What about your baby

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't care about anything

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Jiayu is my everything

60
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Chen Jian doesn't want to steal my baby

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Then let's eat that crab noodles

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Okay

63
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Godmother doesn't want to be a bug

64
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
My mom is convenient, right

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Yes

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This is Li Jinyu's phone number

67
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Sister

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can only help you here

69
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
It's good to go now

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Look, I can run

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Be more careful

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
After you send me home

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You go to the market and do your business

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Can your leg work

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I can

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You go first

78
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'll be back

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I'll be back

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll be back

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll be back

82
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'll be back

83
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Why is he here again

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Just say you didn't see me

85
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I'll go first

86
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hurry up

87
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Kai Kai

88
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sister Yang

89
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Why are you alone

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm alone

91
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
That

92
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where is Ye Meng

93
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
He didn't come today

94
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I'm leaving

95
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Don't

96
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Don't

97
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What happened

98
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
We will send you

99
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You go, I'll send you

100
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No, no, no, my legs are fine

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Don't, don't, don't

102
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
You can go with me

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll give you a ride

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go, go, go, go

105
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll send you

106
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Don't worry, don't worry

107
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Don't worry

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Grandma

109
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you out

110
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Lying on the bone, sore and sore

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Uncomfortable all over

112
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Isn't this out

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Take a walk in the sun

114
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes, the weather is good today

115
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Come out and walk

116
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You go over there first

117
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You find them to play

118
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then you call me

119
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Go, go, go

120
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Go, let's sit down

121
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Where is Li Jingyu

122
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why didn't you accompany you

123
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You sit

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Are you familiar with Bado

125
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Not too familiar

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Or you can see it with him

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I can't do anything else

128
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
That hard price is definitely over

129
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
No.1

130
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Don't you have a family

131
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I've been looking for

132
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is it my son-in-law

133
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Yes

134
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Bado is the most suitable

135
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can meet all your family's requirements

136
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Grandma

137
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What's the matter with our family

138
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Everyone in town must know

139
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You are not afraid of your family

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You are not afraid of your family

141
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Bado is being criticized

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
No, what's the matter

143
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This Li Bado is with his mother

144
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't look at him

145
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Now a little bit

146
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
That still works

147
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
By the way, you must like to see that

148
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Foreign love

149
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Romantic

150
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What is it called

151
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What movie

152
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Bado

153
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Bado

154
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
At that time

155
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Bado

156
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Just give you one person

157
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm so happy

158
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I really don't know

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Li Bado

160
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Still grew up abroad

161
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Grandma

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Okay, okay, I know

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Time is almost up

164
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We're going back

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's talk again

166
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I'll talk with Grandma

167
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay

168
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Don't worry

169
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
coming

170
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You take me

171
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Let's go to the bath together

172
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Go to the desert

173
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll buy you a coffee

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Not bad

175
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I treat guests

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Come and take a bite

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Take a bite

178
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
go

179
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up

180
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Hello, what to drink

181
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Two cups of oatmeal latte

182
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Two cups of 50% real mulberry

183
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I come

184
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
No need, I was just kidding you

185
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Then I'll give you a turn later

186
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You must think I'm stingy

187
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You don't bother our Bado

188
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
How can it be

189
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Thank you

190
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Thank you

191
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Grandma

192
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Why are you like my grandmother

193
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Coffee is here

194
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Take it for you

195
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Thank you

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Sister Li

197
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Can the price be higher

198
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Two thousand and one

199
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Two thousand and one is the highest price

200
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
If you don't believe it, go out and ask

201
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Sorry, I have to answer the phone

202
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hello, where are you?

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Li Jinyu

204
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
How dare you do this behind your grandmother's back

205
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What are you talking about

206
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What are you talking about

207
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What am I talking about

208
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I have already seen you

209
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I didn't expect you to be in this place

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I can accept two thousand and one

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But I hope I can work together for a long time

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Brother

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Your condition is really rare

214
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
If you behave well

215
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I will definitely work with you for a long time

216
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Brother

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I really think you are the material of this industry

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Two thousand and one is not less

219
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Our town is small and poor

220
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
What are you thinking

221
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
While you are young

222
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
When you get old, you will be the eyes of your cousin

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Sister is so good

224
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You know each other

225
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I

226
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You are right

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
You are right

228
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
If you work together for a long time

229
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You can't talk about it

230
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
After all, it's an old client

231
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The relationship is different, right

232
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Brother, you have to seize the opportunity

233
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
You are so popular, sister

234
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I will tell your grandmother now

235
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What are you thinking

236
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Young people are always so reckless

237
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
First, you don't think about anything, then

238
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You are still young and look back

239
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't want to make any money, okay

240
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Bad words

241
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Can you be a little bit more kind

242
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
What are you doing

243
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you think I'm doing with him

244
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Sister is a serious businessman

245
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
What do I want to do with him

246
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Be a boyfriend

247
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Sister has a boyfriend, okay

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Look, model economic contract

249
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
If there is no problem, sign it

250
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Sister also made an appointment with the nursing home

251
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Sister Li

252
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If it's convenient

253
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Can I take this contract back

254
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll contact you after I read it

255
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
No problem

256
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Come on, happy cooperation

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Why are you here

258
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Why didn't you find this scar just now

259
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Sorry, our hand mask

260
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
First of all, clean hands

261
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No holes

262
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You

263
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
How about this

264
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
You go back and deal with it first

265
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
If you are interested in it, you can find me again

266
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
OK, I'm sorry today

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm leaving first, bye

268
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What are you doing here

269
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
No

270
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Why did you kidnap the old lady

271
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
What are you talking about

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I met grandma in the hospital

273
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Grandma asked me to take her for a walk

274
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
How about coffee

275
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Too bitter, so expensive

276
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Gua Dou, why are you here

277
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm getting bolder and bolder

278
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I ran out secretly

279
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come come

280
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
What happened

281
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
This girl is more beautiful than Xiao Jiang

282
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
And sensible

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
OK, OK, I'll send you back

284
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I finally came out

285
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll take a picture and send it to my friends

286
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
OK, then you stay here and I'll go

287
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You silly girl

288
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Why are you out here

289
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Hurry up and go

290
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The nurse will pick me up later

291
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
OK, grandma, I'll go first

292
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
OK, don't worry

293
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Li Junyu

294
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you want to take on this model job

295
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I can help you

296
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You are so nice

297
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
After all, you lost the job of the bar because of me

298
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I have to be responsible for you

299
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Let's go

300
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Where to

301
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You'll know when you go

302
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
OK

303
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Actually, when she was a kid, she was very poor

304
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Her mother

305
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
When your father was so young

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
She was thrown abroad

307
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you think she was good for father

308
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
She doesn't like it

309
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
She just like a cow

310
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
She is a cow with horns, you know

311
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
She is a cow with horns

312
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
She is a cow with horns

313
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
She is a cow with horns

314
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
She is a cow with horns

315
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
She is a cow with horns

316
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
She is a cow with horns

317
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
She is a cow with horns, you know

318
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Her father is good to her

319
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
So when her father died

320
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Little Badou almost followed her

321
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Her dead mother and father's father died

322
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If I didn't go to Jiangbei

323
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Badou would have died

324
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I feel so sorry

325
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry

326
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry

327
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry

328
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry

329
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry

330
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry

331
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry

332
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry

333
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry

334
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry

335
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry

336
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry

337
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry

338
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry

339
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry

340
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm sorry

341
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry

342
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry

343
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry

344
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry

345
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry

346
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry

347
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry

348
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
I'm sorry

349
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry

350
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I'm sorry

351
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry

352
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I'm sorry

353
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry

354
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I'm sorry

355
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'm sorry

356
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm sorry

357
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'm sorry

358
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'm sorry

359
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'm sorry

360
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I'm sorry

361
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000

00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm sorry

363
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm sorry

364
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry

365
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm sorry

366
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
I'm sorry

367
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm sorry

368
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I'm sorry

369
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'm sorry

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I'm sorry

371
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm sorry

372
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm sorry

373
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm sorry

374
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000

00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry

377
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm sorry

378
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'm sorry

379
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm sorry

380
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I'm sorry

381
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm sorry

382
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm sorry

383
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm sorry

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
What brings you here?

385
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
You'll know when you get in

386
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Let's go

387
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
don't stand on your sister

388
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
What floor?

389
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
Second floor

390
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
You're back so long

391
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Finally don't remedy me

392
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I just received your call

393
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,480
I thought you were a master

394
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:47,000
I just came to see you

395
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,160
The whole thing is ready for you

396
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
I'm going out

397
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,080
You can do whatever you want

398
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,000
We go first

399
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,320
Sit here

400
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,760
Take off your watch

401
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,720
Why are you looking at me?

402
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,200
Look

403
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,160
Your heartbeat is slower than that of the average person

404
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,040
Doctor Ye

405
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Have you sold the pulse?

406
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,680
I'm a little nervous now

407
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,240
Tell me the truth

408
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,320
Will you do it?

409
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,520
I will

410
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,520
I used to work here

411
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,800
Later, if it wasn't for the exam

412
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,760
I went to Jiangbei

413
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,320
I was going to go back to the town

414
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,640
To open a studio

415
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,240
You are quite free

416
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,800
I'm not free

417
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:46,920
I failed the college entrance examination

418
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,440
Didn't I fail the college entrance examination?

419
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,360
I worked here during the vacation

420
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,440
Apply it

421
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,160
Are you nervous?

422
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,840
No

423
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,640
Thanks

424
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,280
I'm sorry

425
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:12,760
Ok

426
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:13,780
Pikachu

427
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,920
It begins

428
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,120
Hm

429
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,200
A little pain

430
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,000
I...

431
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,640
Does it hurt?

432
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,840
Go on.

433
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,080
How did you do this?

434
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,160
Because of my mom.

435
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,200
Go on.

436
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:12,600
Yes.

437
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,400
You love him.

438
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,920
But he hates me.

439
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,720
My mom loves me very much.

440
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,520
Mom Ye Meng.

441
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:33,640
I can't control your kid anymore.

442
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,600
She just gave the test.

443
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,200
She's the only one who can't do it.

444
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
She's about to take the college entrance exam.

445
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,560
She's a student.

446
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,120
If you keep doing this,

447
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,040
I don't think she can even take a special class.

448
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,640
What's wrong?

449
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,600
You're not happy just by saying a few words?

450
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,200
Is this your ability to bear it?

451
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,400
Mom, I'll just bear it.

452
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,600
Don't cry.

453
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,960
Have some sweets.

454
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,640
Have a good sleep.

455
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,040
Right now,

456
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,440
you choose this question with me.

457
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,040
Do you think it's a good choice?

458
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,960
Well, he's actuallyilah prosecuting.

459
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,200
White.

460
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,200
This is the English name I gave my mom.

461
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,200
Have you seen the movie called Evidence of the Gods?

462
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
There is a character called White in it.

463
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,200
It's mysterious and powerful.

464
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,200
I insisted on my mom calling that English name.

465
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
And it's very important to let my sister make me a necklace.

466
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,200
She has been wearing it all the time.

467
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,200
I hope I can be like her.

468
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,200
Live with energy.

469
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200

Fine.

565
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,980
I'll give it to you if you want it.

00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,260
You have so many girls.

585
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,820
I just need a top-class one.

586
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,740
It's good if I don't delete you.

587
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,660
Okay.

588
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,540
I didn't expect you...

589
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,980
Go with me to do something.

590
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,260
Where are you going?

591
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,860
Why do you have so many questions?

592
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,980
Why are you walking so fast?

593
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,780
I like walking fast.

594
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,740
Then walk faster.

595
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,380
Hurry up.

596
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,180
Li Jin Yu.

597
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,020
You go ahead. I'll wait for you.

598
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,260
Are you busy?

599
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,300
Are you busy?

600
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm not busy.

601
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,300
Be careful of the steps.

602
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:07,820
Okay.

603
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,340
Thank you.

604
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,620
Jiayu is doing a course nearby.

605
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,140
I'll wait for him here.

606
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,060
You've been following me all day.

607
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,340
Go ahead.

608
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,140
Sister-in-law.

609
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,740
What would you like to eat?

610
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,580
Not this.

611
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,500
Call me sister.

612
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Sister.

613
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,820
90 degrees bow.

614
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,740
Sister.

615
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,780
Who is sister?

616
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:33,900
Am I that old?

617
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,900
Hurry up.

618
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,700
This is Sister Tian Yang's.

619
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,300
Eat.

620
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,620
I'm sweating.

621
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,460
This hasn't changed at all

622
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,740
since we went to school.

623
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,060
Why?

624
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:53,820
Has it changed?

625
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,140
I haven't changed at all.

626
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,500
Although we haven't seen each other

627
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,380
much these years,

628
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,940
I still think of you

629
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,380
as my sister.

630
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,700
You've done so much business

631
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,780
and become the big boss.

632
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,380
Why do you talk like

633
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,500
a child?

634
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,620
I'm the same.

635
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:19,100
I've always treated you as my brother.

636
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,140
And Ye Meng too.

637
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,260
Why do you say this

638
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,220
for the first two years?

639
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,220
So Kaikai.

640
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,780
Can you not fool around with Ye Meng?

641
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,020
Do you still remember the words?

642
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:48,180
No one is to bully Kaikai

643
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,820
ever again.

644
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:52,980
Kaikai.

645
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,500
He has moved a lot,

646
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,780
but haven't been talking to me for a day.

647
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,980
You two

648
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,820
What's wrong?

649
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,500
Ye Meng...

650
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,340
What's the relationship between you and Li Jingyu?

651
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,660
Here's the key, Miss Ye.

652
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,620
Call me if you need anything.

653
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,660
Okay.

654
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,220
Why don't you leave?

655
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,540
You don't know how to drive?

656
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,980
I do.

657
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,260
It's just that I haven't touched the car for a long time.

658
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,740
I'm not used to it.

659
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,660
Let me think about it.

660
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,300
What's the first step?

661
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,820
Put on your seat belt.

662
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,540
Of course I know to put on my seat belt.

663
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,700
I mean the first step to start the car.

664
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,260
The first step to start the car?

665
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,460
Do you have a driver's license?

666
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,340
I've been driving for ten years.

667
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,580
I said I need to get familiar with it.

668
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,140
Why do you talk so much?

669
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,420
I'm collecting the technology.

670
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,380
Which one is the technology?

671
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,780
The one in the middle?

672
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,140
The one on the left.

673
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,140
You're quite serious.

674
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,940
Light the fire.

675
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,420
Be careful when you drive later.

676
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:50,540
Be quiet.

677
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,740
Don't disturb me, okay?

678
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,260
I need to focus now.

679
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:53,940
Okay.

680
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,020
Why are you in a rush?

681
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,660
The window is so dirty.

682
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,060
You don't need to wipe it.

683
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,780
It's safe to drive, you know?

684
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,340
How can you go home if you can't see the road clearly?

685
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,500
Don't fart.

686
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,420
I said your farting is too loud.

687
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,500
It's affecting me.

688
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,540
You're coughing again.

689
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,660
You're coughing again.

690
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:27,060
I told you not to cough.

691
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,700
Okay.

692
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:37,300
Let's see how many hours I can sleep before I get home.

693
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,220
What do you mean sleep?

694
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,780
You can fall asleep if I drive.

695
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:43,420
Let's go.

696
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,700
Come on.

697
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,300
Can you help me to go back?

698
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,100
What should I do?

699
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
I can't go back.

700
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,900
I can't go back.

701
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:50,700
I can't go back.

702
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,580
I can't go back.

703
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,420
I can't go back.

704
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,420
How can I...

705
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,420
You didn't even let go of your hand.

706
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,540
You didn't let me talk.

707
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,660
Okay, okay, okay.

708
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,140
I'm sorry.

709
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,340
Why don't you drive?

710
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:05,860
I...

711
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,420
I can't.

712
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,660
You can't?

713
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,940
Let's go, Guadao.

714
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,300
Okay.

715
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,900
How can I drive in this workshop?

716
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,100
I don't know.

717
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,020
Wow, it's so beautiful.

718
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,900
Give me your phone.

719
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,940
I'll take a picture for you.

720
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,020
I don't like taking pictures.

721
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,100
Why?

722
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,740
Because I think it's meaningless.

723
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,420
The sun is so beautiful in my hometown.

724
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,100
It's much better than Jiangbei.

725
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,020
Chen Jian said

726
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,580
you couldn't sleep in Jiangbei.

727
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,020
I guess so.

728
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,140
Why didn't you stay in Jiangbei?

729
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,020
Who told you I came back from Jiangbei?

730
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,940
Your grandma told me.

731
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,140
Who told you that?

732
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,620
No matter what you do there,

733
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,700
you can't get recognition.

734
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,500
No matter how perfect it is,

735
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,300
it's meaningless.

736
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,540
It's meaningless.

737
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,180
It's others' problem

738
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,420
if others don't recognize you.

739
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:33,220
Don't always fight with yourself.

740
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,700
Is the sunset not beautiful?

741
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:37,500
Isn't it meaningful?

742
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,460
But it's too short.

743
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,460
Then you should live in the moment.

744
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,060
You'll know when you see it.

745
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:57,940
Li Junyu,

746
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,820
can you stop

747
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,660
destroying the atmosphere

748
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:00,620
when you're romantic?

749
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:02,980
You're the best

750
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:04,500
at dealing with Cheng Kaoran.

751
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,660
I found that you care about Cheng Kaoran.

752
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,220
I'm telling you,

753
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:11,060
Cheng Kaoran treats me as his sister.

754
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,980
He has no feelings for me.

755
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,380
Don't worry.

756
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,740
I've been in love with Ye Meng for more than ten years.

757
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,700
Do you know that?

758
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,780
More than ten years.

759
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,940
Do you know how I've been

760
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,820
for the past ten years?

761
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:36,260
Stop it.

762
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:37,700
Stop it.

763
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,420
There's only one window between us.

764
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,420
Do you know that?

765
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,140
I don't want to be

766
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,380
his brother.

767
00:33:44,380 --> 00:33:45,980
I can't open the wine bottle.

768
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,140
You...

769
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:52,940
Cheng Kaoran,

770
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,540
you're serious.

771
00:33:53,540 --> 00:33:54,540
Don't drink too much.

772
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,420
You've said it

773
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,660
a dozen times.

774
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:58,020
I'm so sick of it.

775
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,060
I want to find Ye Meng.

776
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,340
I don't want to revenge.

777
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:02,820
Right.

778
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,220
No revenge.

779
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,740
I just want to see him.

780
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,420
I just want to see him.

781
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,580
You've been in high school

782
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,780
for so many years.

783
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,980
You're almost there.

784
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,260
Stop it.

785
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,780
I have no choice.

786
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,620
I owe him.

787
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,220
I was the one who owed him in the past.

788
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,980
Right?

789
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,100
Without him,

790
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,380
without me now,

791
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,380
I would have appeared in front of him every day.

792
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:34,900
But...

793
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,180
But I...

794
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:38,980
I don't dare to say those words of confession.

795
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:41,340
I'm afraid that when I open my mouth,

796
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:45,340
he will have an affair with me.

797
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,900
Cheng Kaoran,

798
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,780
Ye Meng is just like

799
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,460
treating his brother.

800
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:51,580
What about Li Jin Yu?

801
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:56,420
What does he mean by Li Jin Yu?

802
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,900
I just want to...

803
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,900
Tell me.

804
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,540
What does it have to do with you?

805
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,420
No.

806
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,220
Just tell me.

807
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,740
Does he like her?

808
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,820
Right?

809
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:06,700
Tell me.

810
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:09,980
What's the difference between me and Li Jin Yu?

811
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,980
I'm just a little bit of a

812
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,900
I'm just a little bit of a

813
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,540
Right.

814
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:15,780
I'm handsome.

815
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,580
That's great.

816
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,460
Then I'm nothing.

817
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,500
Then I'm nothing.

818
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,020
Look at you now.

819
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,260
You said you were the boss.

820
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,300
I don't believe you.

821
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,660
You're just like a love-hate relationship.

822
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,940
Ye Meng likes you.

823
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,700
I'm looking at you.

824
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,460
Oh my god.

825
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,180
I'm so worried.

826
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:31,780
I want to be with you for a day.

827
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,300
Mom.

828
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,500
I want to go to the bathroom.

829
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:34,260
Son.

830
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,540
Yes.

831
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,580
This is my son.

832
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,060
This is Cheng Kaoran's uncle.

833
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:38,500
Say hello to uncle.

834
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,620
Hello, uncle.

835
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,300
Jiayu.

836
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,340
Right, Jiayu.

837
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,180
Where are you going?

838
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:46,140
Jiayu.

839
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,460
Your school.

840
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,820
Position.

841
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,900
Give it to me.

842
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,820
I'll ask someone to step on it tomorrow.

843
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:52,940
What are you doing?

844
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,620
Someone's going to bully you.

845
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,740
I'll do it.

846
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,420
Stop.

847
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:57,540
What era is this?

848
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:58,660
Still playing big brother.

849
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,580
It's just a game.

850
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,060
You're a tough guy.

851
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,380
Who's son are you?

852
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,540
It's up to you.

853
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,420
Mom.

854
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:07,980
Let's go.

855
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,620
It's a waste of time to talk to the drunk.

856
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,140
Right.

857
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,820
Let's go.

858
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:12,420
You...

859
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,060
I'm leaving.

860
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,740
Yang Yang.

861
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,540
What?

862
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,340
One day, big sister.

863
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,940
A lifelong big sister.

864
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:19,540
Come on.

865
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:19,980
Get on.

866
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,900
What do you mean?

867
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:23,340
I'll carry you home.

868
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,980
Carry you.

869
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,580
Cheng Kaoran, come on.

870
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,700
Get up.

871
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,460
Stand up.

872
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:30,420
I'll carry you.

873
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,300
Stand up.

874
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,540
You're a good drinker, right?

875
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,220
Let me tell you.

876
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,020
Don't let them hold me.

877
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,340
I'm going to lose my mind.

878
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,700
Jiayu.

879
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:49,940
Say goodbye to uncle.

880
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,060
Say goodbye to uncle.

881
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:53,660
Bye.

882
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,220
Bye.

883
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,940
Bye.

884
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:55,660
Bye.

885
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,540
Bye.

886
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:57,260
Bye.

887
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:57,980
Bye.

888
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:58,860
Bye.

889
00:36:58,860 --> 00:36:59,340
Bye.

890
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,300
Bye.

891
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:00,940
Bye.

892
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,500
Bye.

893
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,340
Bye.

894
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,180
Bye.

895
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,660
Bye.

896
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:04,380
Bye.

897
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,220
Bye.

898
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:05,980
Bye.

899
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,620
Bye.

900
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,140
Bye.

901
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,860
Bye.

902
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,500
Bye.

903
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,100
Bye.

904
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:10,820
Bye.

905
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:11,420
Bye.

906
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,100
Bye.

907
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,260
Mom, be careful.

908
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,180
Bye.

909
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,380
And

910
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,140
don't forget to call Li Jiayu back.

911
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,460
Don't be so careful with big men every day.

912
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,260
You'll be annoyed.

913
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,820
Let's go.

914
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:22,380
Let's go.

915
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,780
Well...

916
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,660
Don't talk.

917
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,420
Come on.

918
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:26,900
Be careful.

919
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:27,860
Hold mom.

920
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,020
Why is the light still on?

921
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,340
You don't know how to drive,

922
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,620
but you know how to drive.

923
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,500
You're very skilled.

924
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:03,740
Let's go.

925
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:10,100
You're back.

926
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,340
Why are you back together?

927
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,380
Then you should get together with your brother.

928
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,540
I'm leaving.

929
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,780
You're talking nonsense.

930
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,780
I'm leaving.

931
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
I'm leaving.

932
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:32,780
I'm leaving.

933
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
I'm leaving.

934
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,780
I'm leaving.

935
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,780
I'm leaving.

936
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,780
I'm leaving.

937
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,780
I'm leaving.

938
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,780
I'm leaving.

939
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:40,660
Come here.

940
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:42,860
Come here.

941
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:47,540
Do you want to see me beaten by Chen Kanchen

942
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,300
or see us fight?

943
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,380
I mean...

944
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,580
I mean, you...

945
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,580
When did you two get together?

946
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:56,380
When you were in the bar.

947
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,420
Ye Meng.

948
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,060
There are so many men in our town.

949
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,060
Why don't you find one?

950
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,940
You have to find a poor man,

951
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:04,740
a poor man,

952
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,860
a poor man, right?

953
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,500
Yes.

954
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,780
I have no choice.

955
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,700
I like him.

956
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,700
I won't choose him.

957
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,380
I always thought

958
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:19,020
you would act silly.

959
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,340
Today,

960
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,780
now,

961
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,620
you're going to make a fool of us

962
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,140
for this man,

963
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,740
for Li Jin Yu, right?

964
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:28,740
Yes.

965
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,740
Because he doesn't want to offend you,

966
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:32,060
he always makes fun of us.

967
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,660
Do you have anything else?

968
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,420
If you have nothing else,

969
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:40,420
can you stop bothering me?

970
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,980
Okay.

971
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,660
Okay.

972
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,980
Now that he's gone,

973
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:53,340
I can be the best

974
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,300
at blocking the arrows, right?

975
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,780
Not all of them.

976
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,540
If you love to fight because of me,

977
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,020
I will marry you.

978
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,660
Don't move.

979
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:10,100
Get up.

980
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:10,700
Okay.

981
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:35,900
High Snow 10

982
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:36,780
bride Groom 5

983
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,620
As long as you're willing.

984
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,060
You're sitting on the balcony again.

985
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,740
As long as you're willing to do it.

986
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:42,220
Master Li.

987
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,100
Do you want to work tomorrow?

988
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:54,580
I'm very hardworking.

989
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,620
I'm very rich.

990
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,100
I'm afraid that when we grow up

991
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:11,140
we can only keep living like living.

992
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,900
Just take good care of yourself

993
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,700
and wrap it up tonight.

994
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:35,700
Enjoy.

995
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:36,460
Thank you.

996
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:39,780
Do you have any other talents?

997
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:41,780
I can play the guitar.

998
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:43,780
What about the drums?

999
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,780
I can't.

1000
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:48,780
So handsome.

1001
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Are you the main singer of this bar?

1002
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:52,780
You can even debut with this look.

1003
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
Handsome, can I add you on WeChat?

1004
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,780
Sorry, I won't.

1005
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:57,780
I'll buy you some wine.

1006
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
No need.

1007
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:00,780
Hey, ladies.

1008
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,780
Can I add you on WeChat?

1009
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,780
No need.

1010
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,780
You...

1011
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Smile.

1012
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,780
Okay.

1013
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,780
Tomorrow,

1014
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:18,780
you can come to work.

1015
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,780
But there's a KPI.

1016
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,780
Add me on WeChat every day.

1017
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Send me the ad on WeChat.

1018
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:26,780
I have a small drinking mission every month.

1019
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:28,780
Is that okay?

1020
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Okay.

1021
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,780
Well...

1022
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:41,780
Rong Yan

1023
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:43,780
is really good at surpassing me.

1024
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,780
You...

1025
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,780
I saw you

1026
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,780
I thought of you

1027
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:14,780
I heard your news

1028
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:20,780
The love that was reflected on my heart

1029
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:25,780
It's like I'm breathing

1030
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:30,780
The love that was reflected on my heart

1031
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,780
It's like I'm breathing

1032
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Where should I go?

1033
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:43,780
How should I avoid

1034
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:49,780
those memories about you?

1035
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:53,780
I want to be with you

1036
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:58,780
But I can't

1037
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,780
I keep silent

1038
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,780
And put the flowers in the back

1039
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:12,780
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading

1040
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:17,780
I pretend to be firm

1041
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:22,780
But I'm still obsessed with the origin

1042
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:27,780
The most perfect lie

1043
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:30,780
Deceives yourself

1044
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:32,780
If we love, let go

1045
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,780
Let us lose the connection

1046
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,780
Why is this?

1047
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,780
The moment of tears

1048
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,780
The heart still yearns
