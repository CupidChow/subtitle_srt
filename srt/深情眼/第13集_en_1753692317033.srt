1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excited to say you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Only memories of fireworks burning

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Unable to hide the promise

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is no me

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Who still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
If there is still a promise

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Will be kept

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
One month

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I give you one month

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
If you don't come back

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I won't wait for you

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Li Jinyu

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Can't you leave me

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I can't leave you

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I can't leave you

28
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I can't leave you

29
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Can't you leave me

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I don't know

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Is it yes or no

33
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
In arms and in face

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I'm drifting

35
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm drifting

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't move

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Wait for me

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:02,500
Making hearts

39
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,000
Yuan Zころ

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,300
Yuan Zchlossen

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,760
You're exaggerating.

42
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,480
Gao Kai asked you to pick me up?

43
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,280
How could it be him?

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,440
We're in a relationship.

45
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
It's my honor to pick up a beauty.

46
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,080
Look.

47
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,560
She's mature.

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,920
She's flattered.

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,360
Why is the weather better than ours?

50
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,720
The light is shining more and more.

51
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,840
You're really getting more oily.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,400
Over there.

53
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,360
I'm getting off the plane.

54
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
A friend is picking me up.

55
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,240
Are you up?

56
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,440
Remember to have breakfast.

57
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,880
Are you up?

58
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,680
What's wrong with you?

59
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,000
Are you hugging Nan Fan?

60
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,360
How sad will you be

61
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,280
if you see Gao Kai

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,720
being so passionate?

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,080
I need to correct you.

64
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm not being passionate.

65
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,280
I'm being passionate.

66
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,040
I'll get the license.

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,480
I've had breakfast.

68
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,440
Everyone is enjoying it.

69
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,760
You've only been in the public.

70
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,880
How can I believe you?

71
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,960
How did you know her?

72
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,520
I'm not telling you.

73
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,680
Tell me.

74
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,880
Tell me.

75
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,760
T offset.

76
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,320
Formal.

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,680
Pi Yan.

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,120
Between partners,

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,120
what is the most important thing?

80
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:23,960
Tell me.

81
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,800
Yes.

82
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,500
Right to trust.

83
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,220
I will go.

84
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,120
Sister Yellow.

85
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,960
Sister Yellow.

86
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,880
You're back?

87
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,800
Sister Yellow.

88
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,640
Boss.

89
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:55,240
Boss.

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,000
Boss.

91
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Boss.

92
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,120
That's your bag.

93
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,400
How are you?

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,720
Same as usual.

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,640
Boss, since you left,

96
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,280
our workload has increased by a hundredfold.

97
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,720
I'm so tired.

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,400
Boss.

99
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,840
Are you coming back?

100
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,280
No.

101
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,560
I just came back to talk about something.

102
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
It's like

103
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,080
I and Gou Kai

104
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,520
treat you like we treat you.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,320
Take the coffee.

106
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,720
Sister Meng bought it for you.

107
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,520
Thank you, boss.

108
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,040
Thank you, boss.

109
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:19,720
Thank you, boss.

110
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,320
I love you.

111
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,720
Okay, I'll go in and talk about something.

112
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,400
We'll talk outside.

113
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:22,920
Okay.

114
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,480
Let's sit down.

115
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,760
Our boss is here to have coffee.

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,480
Okay.

117
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,440
Ye Meng.

118
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,160
Welcome home.

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,840
What's wrong with you?

120
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:45,600
Sit down.

121
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
You look beautiful when you came back.

122
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,800
You look much better.

123
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,640
The weather is nice.

124
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,120
The weather is nice.

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,320
It was quite lively outside just now.

126
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,400
You bought coffee, right?

127
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,120
It's nice.

128
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,760
How long are you planning to stay this time?

129
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,920
A long time.

130
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,120
This is the information you wanted.

131
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,080
Take a look.

132
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,280
Do you think I can lie to you?

133
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,960
When can I see him?

134
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,640
Don't be so anxious.

135
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,440
If you're busy,

136
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,920
just contact me.

137
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,160
I'll go see him myself.

138
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,320
I told you not to be anxious.

139
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,160
Have some water.

140
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,400
Where's the problem now?

141
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,960
It's just that

142
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,360
you're not an employee of the company.

143
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,040
You're a client.

144
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,160
You're not a client.

145
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,040
You're not a client.

146
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,040
You're not a client.

147
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,160
You don't have to give me

148
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,080
any client information.

149
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,160
Right?

150
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,400
Right?

151
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,120
Actually, I've arranged it.

152
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,960
I'll meet you at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

153
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll follow you there.

154
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,400
Is that okay?

155
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
Thank you.

156
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,120
It's been a long time

157
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,800
since we met.

158
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
Come on, don't be so cold.

159
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Take a picture.

160
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,040
Three, two, one.

161
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,200
Take a picture.

162
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,400
Send it to your friends later.

163
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,160
You're really not going to meet him?

164
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,440
Cut!

165
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,560
Look.

166
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,000
Your shirt.

167
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,080
This Trumpeter is Ye Mung's ex-boss.

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,600
Why ask him to go to Jiangbei

169
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,760
to drink coffee with others?

170
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,960
I'm not frightenging you.

171
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,440
to the place where he's from.

172
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,840
You trust him so much?

173
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,640
Yes.

174
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,800
I'm not trying to make you two fall out.

175
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,480
You must be better-looking

176
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,800
than his former boss

177
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,640
from your temperament and appearance.

178
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,080
But his big office

179
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,000
must be very rich.

180
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,360
Besides, they've been friends for years.

181
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:16,640
It's dangerous.

182
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,560
Are you sick?

183
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,200
Don't take it for granted.

184
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm too familiar with this.

185
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,640
Wang Hai Leng hates his ex-husband.

186
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,960
He hates him so much that he's even biting his teeth.

187
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,600
He promised to divorce me.

188
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
But he's not doing it now.

189
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,440
You should be more careful.

190
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,160
I'm not like you.

191
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,600
I have a certificate.

192
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,120
You have a certificate?

193
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,400
Fine.

194
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
You have a certificate.

195
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,840
You're here with me,

196
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,720
waiting for me to be free.

197
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,640
I'll teach you a trick.

198
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,840
I'm sure Ye Meng will

199
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,320
turn your heart back to you.

200
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,560
What trick?

201
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,320
Look over there.

202
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,480
Those two guests.

203
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,600
We're very close.

204
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,040
I'll say hello to them

205
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,800
and take some close-up photos.

206
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,920
Take a photo of their bodies.

207
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,880
Ye Meng can send it.

208
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,720
We can send it too.

209
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,640
You can try it.

210
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,560
It's boring.

211
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,320
Go ahead.

212
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:09,720
Try it.

213
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,560
It's not like you're a good cook.

214
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:10,960
Go.

215
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,800
Go.

216
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,720
What if they divorce?

217
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,440
Try it.

218
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,200
Try it.

219
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:16,600
Boss Chen.

220
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,560
Jiang Wu Zhi?

221
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,120
Why are you here?

222
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm here to introduce you to a big business.

223
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,840
Some new businessmen who live in Hailan Port

224
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,360
are looking for a place to form a team.

225
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
I recommend you here.

226
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,280
Thank you, Boss Jiang.

227
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,400
I'm sure I'm interested in making money.

228
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,520
But how can I remember

229
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,600
you and Ye Meng didn't deal with each other?

230
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,160
And you're still

231
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,520
enemies.

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,880
Right?

233
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,920
How can you think of me

234
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,800
when you do such a good thing?

235
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,800
You're so sweet-hearted.

236
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,320
I think you're men.

237
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,080
Can you be more open-minded?

238
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,640
I recommend you here

239
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,200
because it's a good place.

240
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,840
I can be kind to you.

241
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
Do I have to be hard on myself

242
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,440
for Ye Meng?

243
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,480
Boss Jiang,

244
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,520
I'll get you a drink.

245
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm driving. I don't want to drink.

246
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,600
I'll get you a bottle of wine.

247
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,400
Sit down.

248
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,640
Ye Meng, stay away from me.

249
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,280
You're pretending to be unfamiliar with me.

250
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,440
How long will you pretend to be?

251
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
It's not that long.

252
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,240
I thought you broke up long ago.

253
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,160
I didn't expect to see him

254
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,240
in the circle of friends a few days ago.

255
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,160
But I rarely see him

256
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,440
so serious.

257
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,200
I sincerely wish you

258
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,520
to be together forever.

259
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,360
It's better if you're more attractive

260
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,000
and can keep him in your heart forever.

261
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,360
Are you so worried about him going back to Jiang Mei?

262
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,000
Aren't you?

263
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,280
Well,

264
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,440
please check your work first.

265
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,240
I'll be right back.

266
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,480
I'll answer the phone.

267
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,600
Xing Jing.

268
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,080
Hello, Mom.

269
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,560
I'm working overtime at the company.

270
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:22,240
Jiang Wu Zhi's parents are teachers.

271
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,680
They're a female tutor.

272
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,520
They're like Ye Meng's parents.

273
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,920
They all want to find a local boy to marry.

274
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,080
Otherwise, they wouldn't have been in a blind date with you.

275
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,960
What are you taking?

276
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,320
You mean the photo?

277
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,120
Let me see.

278
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,520
If Jiang Wu Zhi appears in the photo,

279
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,040
will it double the effect?

280
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,280
Look, you two are so close.

281
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,400
It's not a big deal.

282
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,080
Let me see.

283
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,680
It's been sent.

284
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
Don't touch me.

285
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,440
Look at you.

286
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,400
It's...

287
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,320
It's so big.

288
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,560
Ye Meng will be back soon.

289
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,800
You're welcome.

290
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,160
It's comfortable.

291
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,720
Your expression is so funny.

292
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,920
Look.

293
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,800
Many people have liked it

294
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:14,960
and wished you could come back.

295
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,760
It's not just me who wished you could come back.

296
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:21,760
Also, Taiming Xiao

297
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,640
has been telling me that new projects are hard to do.

298
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,560
Without you, the PR department can't be opened.

299
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,280
Especially, there are more and more projects this year.

300
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,720
Didn't you want to buy a house in Jiangbei?

301
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,840
I think this is a good opportunity.

302
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,600
Think about it.

303
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,400
The company is doing well.

304
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,960
I'm happy for you.

305
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,200
But I'll just forget it.

306
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm not going to buy a house in Jiangbei.

307
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,160
I'm going to live in Jiangbei.

308
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,280
I'm going to live in Jiangbei.

309
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,400
I'm going to live in Jiangbei.

310
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm going to live in Jiangbei.

311
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,840
But I'll just forget it.

312
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,600
I'm used to the pace of life in my hometown.

313
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,600
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

314
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Wait a minute.

315
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm helping you with such a big favor.

316
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,040
Eat dinner tonight.

317
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll just forget it.

318
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,400
I'm really not in the mood now.

319
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,440
Let's talk about it next time.

320
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,360
Is it because of Wang Xingte

321
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,440
or your so-called boyfriend?

322
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,840
At most, you can tell him.

323
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,520
It's not that petty, right?

324
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,120
You know a big man, right?

325
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,720
I'm sorry.

326
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,520
I'm afraid he'll be jealous.

327
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,960
But he's not my boyfriend.

328
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,720
He's my husband.

329
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,520
I've already got the certificate from him.

330
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,880
When we hold the wedding,

331
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,000
I'll send you the invitation.

332
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm leaving.

333
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,280
Bye.

334
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,600
Bye.

335
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,000
What?

336
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,920
What's going on?

337
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,840
It's true.

338
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,280
I confirmed it on the way.

339
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:38,280
It's true.

340
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
I confirmed it.

341
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,640
What was that?

342
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,640
Come back.

343
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,600
Are you looking for me?

344
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,680
Be quick.

345
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,520
What don't like to shut up?

346
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,400
Everything.

347
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,440
Trying to kill me?

348
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,600
I'm leaving.

349
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,760
Take this away.

350
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,640
сам기이 드라이

351
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,520
You shouldn't drink!

352
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,100
It might be healthy for our health.

353
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,840
bear all-round drink in question.

354
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,760
Jong Horn, S政 shy

355
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
Sorry, sorry. I'm going to block the wind.

356
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:22,080
Brother, are you sure you want to do this?

357
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
How can this be called doing this?

358
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,080
This is called love test.

359
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,120
A woman who really loves you,

360
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,760
within five meters of you,

361
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,920
if there's an epidemic,

362
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,320
she'll start to be nervous.

363
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,760
If the thing that appears is your ideal type,

364
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,280
she'll take out eight times of energy

365
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,480
and get sick at any time.

366
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,720
You know so much?

367
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,160
Of course.

368
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,280
When a woman gets jealous,

369
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,800
she'll turn from a single cell creature

370
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,000
into a brainless human being like a phoenix.

371
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,120
If you don't eat this,

372
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,320
either this woman is lazy,

373
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,920
or she doesn't like you at all.

374
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,920
You should reflect on yourself,

375
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
this mother.

376
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,560
Okay, okay, okay.

377
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
Brother Li.

378
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,480
I'm going upstairs.

379
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,320
Wait, wait, wait.

380
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,280
Grandma, why are you here?

381
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,480
Jinyu,

382
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,840
I heard that your grandma is out of the hospital.

383
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,080
I'm here to see her.

384
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
She's in the room. Let's go in.

385
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
I'll hold it for you.

386
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,080
Okay.

387
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,040
Let's go.

388
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,840
Grandma.

389
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,040
The house is still the same.

390
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,720
It hasn't changed at all.

391
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,920
Qi Ke.

392
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,600
Who do I take you as?

393
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,720
I heard that your leg fell and you just got out of the hospital.

394
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,320
I'm here to see you.

395
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:39,400
I've been in the hospital for more than two months.

396
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,560
I just got out of the hospital.

397
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,680
You're so smart.

398
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,320
Grandma.

399
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,920
Badou, look at your cowardly face.

400
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,720
You look like you're holding a dead body.

401
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,920
Did your leg break?

402
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,280
Are you okay?

403
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,360
Grandma, sit down first. I'll get you a cup of tea.

404
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,080
Okay.

405
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,480
How can a relative

406
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,520
drink tea that our people drink?

407
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,480
In the past,

408
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,000
the elderly lady would drink tea outside.

409
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,440
If something happens to her,

410
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,800
she'll be in trouble.

411
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,400
We can't afford it.

412
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,280
Her life is precious.

413
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,640
Jin Yi,

414
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,040
just get me a cup of water.

415
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,400
Juhua,

416
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,480
you've been so yellow since you were young.

417
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:30,520
You should drink less tea and smoke less.

418
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,040
What brand of lipstick

419
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,720
did you use?

420
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,600
It doesn't match your face.

421
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,160
On the contrary,

422
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,800
you look so yellow and haggard.

423
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
It doesn't look good.

424
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,520
At our age,

425
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,120
we should learn to love ourselves.

426
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,280
Xu Meilan,

427
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:57,480
are you here for something?

428
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,680
Tell me what you want to say. I'm busy.

429
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,520
How can I say anything?

430
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,920
I'm a unreasonable person.

431
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,400
Let me tell you.

432
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,120
If these two kids didn't secretly

433
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,480
get the marriage certificate behind my back,

434
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
I wouldn't come to see you.

435
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,760
But Jin Yi,

436
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,640
the first time I saw him,

437
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,040
I fell in love with him.

438
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,360
He's not like the kid you taught me.

439
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:23,760
I'm telling you,

440
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,840
Mengmeng is not like the kid you taught me.

441
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,040
She's not a little bit of a mischievous girl.

442
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,240
Jin Yi,

443
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,920
how did you

444
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,440
think of your marriage?

445
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,440
I...

446
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,280
It's about the wedding.

447
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,280
Tell me.

448
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
Right.

449
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,520
Ye Meng isn't home.

450
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,920
So I think

451
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,800
we should be patient.

452
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
How can we not be patient?

453
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,720
That's how young people do things.

454
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,240
Listen,

455
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
Ye's family is a big family.

456
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,560
The wedding process is complicated.

457
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,120
Xu Meilan, what do you mean by big family?

458
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:53,960
I'm telling you.

459
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm telling you.

460
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,640
You should believe me.

461
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,960
I'm telling you.

462
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,080
What are you talking about?

463
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,640
I'm telling you.

464
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,120
I'm telling you.

465
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,280
What are you talking about?

466
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,120
I'm telling you.

467
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,360
What did I say?

468
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,320
Did I say anything?

469
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,600
You said something.

470
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,960
You told me to do this.

471
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,240
Why did you say something?

472
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,680
What did I say?

473
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,800
Look at him.

474
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:10,760
What are you looking at?

475
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,920
What did you say?

476
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,040
Explain it to me.

477
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,280
You said we're a big family.

478
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:17,520
You said it.

479
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,640
You said it.

480
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,320
Okay.

481
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,440
I'll explain it to you.

482
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,360
I don't want to listen to you.

483
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,480
Okay.

484
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,520
I can't explain it to you.

485
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,640
I can't explain it to you.

486
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,360
You're a shrew.

487
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,640
I'm a shrew.

488
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,680
What shrew?

489
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,160
You think you can take away my shrew?

490
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,880
You're a shrew forever.

491
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,200
You're a shrew forever.

492
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,080
I'm willing to do it.

493
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,280
You don't deserve it.

494
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,880
You're a shrew.

495
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,040
You're a shrew.

496
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,920
Stop talking to me.

497
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:39,640
I won't talk to you.

498
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,440
Stop talking to me.

499
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,280
If you can do it, don't do it.

500
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,840
I'm tired of seeing you.

501
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,280
Get out.

502
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,080
Get out.

503
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,800
You're pissing me off.

504
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
What are you doing?

505
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,680
You finally remember me.

506
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm reading.

507
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,640
I don't dare to bother you.

508
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,040
I'm afraid I'll delay your

509
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,640
business talk with your ex-girlfriend.

510
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,000
What a coincidence.

511
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,040
I'm afraid I'll delay your

512
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,040
relationship with your old comrades.

513
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,040
We're just colleagues.

514
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,120
You're different.

515
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,240
Jiang Lu Zhi is your ex-girlfriend.

516
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,840
There's a secret.

517
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,440
You're my ex-girlfriend.

518
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,840
There's a secret.

519
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,040
Are you jealous?

520
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,640
It seems Chen Kai Ran's trick

521
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,840
is quite useful.

522
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
You're playing tricks on me

523
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,440
to make me jealous, right?

524
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:04,840
Honey.

525
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I've been with you for a day.

526
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
But I miss you so much.

527
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,040
Do you miss me?

528
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:16,440
I don't have time to think.

529
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,040
Your grandma came over today.

530
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,440
Two old ladies

531
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,440
discussed about

532
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,040
the wedding together.

533
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,240
When they were young,

534
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,440
did they have a problem?

535
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Are they enemies?

536
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,440
That's not true.

537
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,440
They should

538
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,440
have different opinions.

539
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:39,440
But the wedding

540
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,040
is going to be a big success.

541
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,040
I'm a perfect bride.

542
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,840
I should be prepared.

543
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,240
So,

544
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,440
when will you come back to the wedding?

545
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
I want to go back, too.

546
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
I haven't seen Wang Xing Sheng yet.

547
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,240
If you don't come back,

548
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
your lipstick

549
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,040
will be used up by grandma.

550
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,640
I can use it.

551
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,040
I can't use it up anyway.

552
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,840
Take a safe trip.

553
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:06,640
Okay.

554
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,840
Okay. As long as he's happy.

555
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,240
Coming.

556
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,840
I'll get the delivery.

557
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
You read the book first.

558
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,640
Okay.

559
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,840
Coming.

560
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:28,640
Yu Yan is always in a relationship.

561
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,840
Who is she dating?

562
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Jiang Zhu Hai.

563
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,440
Why are you so fast?

564
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,840
They said you married her for true love.

565
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,240
I've known you since you graduated.

566
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,040
I know what kind of person you are.

567
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,640
Even if you're angry with me,

568
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
you can't make fun of marriage.

569
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Do you think I'll believe this?

570
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,840
What's wrong with you, Gao Kai?

571
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,240
Are you crazy?

572
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
Do you think the whole world

573
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,640
should be around you?

574
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,640
I'm angry with you

575
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,440
for marrying someone.

576
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:56,440
You came here to tell me this?

577
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,640
Let's talk inside.

578
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,640
What?

579
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm engaged now.

580
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,840
Can you give me some advice?

581
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,040
You're engaged?

582
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,640
Okay.

583
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,440
How did you know your family?

584
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,840
What does their family do?

585
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,840
What did they do to you?

586
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,840
It's none of your business.

587
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,040
You can't make it up?

588
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,040
What?

589
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,840
Because there's no such person in this world.

590
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,840
Do you think you'll be irritated

591
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,440
if I tell you that you married

592
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,040
Professor Taiming after you posted a post?

593
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
I'm telling you.

594
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
I did it.

595
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
You...

596
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,440
Let me see.

597
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
What?

598
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,040
No, Jiang Luzhi is here?

599
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:36,840
Who are you acting with?

600
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:37,840
Ye Meng.

601
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,240
I've always liked you.

602
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
Didn't you notice it?

603
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,840
I didn't notice it at all.

604
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Is this how you like people?

605
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
I didn't tell you before

606
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,840
because we're too different.

607
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,840
So I tried to help you improve

608
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,240
and to break your status.

609
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
I want my parents to accept us.

610
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,840
Otherwise, we won't be together.

611
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,040
This is just a joke.

612
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,440
Let's start with the POA.

613
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,040
I don't want this.

614
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
This is the police's key.

615
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,840
Didn't you see that old man?

616
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,040
He bought it.

617
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,040
Ye Meng, as long as you stay,

618
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,640
I'll give you everything you want.

619
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
Are you the one who's

620
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,040
watching too much

621
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,240
of the second half of the show?

622
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,040
Now you're telling me

623
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,440
the story of the Princess and the Prince?

624
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,640
If you don't have anything to say,

625
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,440
just leave.

626
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
I have to see Wang Xing Sheng tomorrow.

627
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,640
Okay?

628
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,040
You know you have to see him tomorrow?

629
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,040
Can you do it without me?

630
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:40,840
Can your family

631
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,040
help you with this?

632
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,640
He can't.

633
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,840
Gao Kai, listen.

634
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,240
I can go see Wang Xing Sheng myself.

635
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,040
I can investigate my mom's case.

636
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,440
If you don't want the surveillance camera

637
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,240
to record us

638
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,640
and send it to the company tomorrow,

639
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
get lost.

640
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
It's fake, right?

641
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,440
What fake?

642
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,240
It's fake.

643
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
It's fake.

644
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,040
Cancel the meeting with

645
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,040
Mr. Wang tomorrow.

646
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,040
This is the police's key.

647
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,040
As long as you stay,

648
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,640
I'll give you everything you want.

649
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,840
Ye Mou,

650
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,040
I've always liked you.

651
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,840
Haven't you noticed it?

652
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
I'm sorry.

653
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,640
I'm sorry.

654
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,840
I'm sorry.

655
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,240
I'm sorry.

656
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,440
I'm sorry.

657
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,840
I'm sorry.

658
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm sorry.

659
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,640
I'm sorry.

660
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,040
I'm sorry.

661
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,440
I'm sorry.

662
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,840
I'm sorry.

663
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,440
I'm sorry.

664
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,040
I'm sorry.

665
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,840
I'm sorry.

666
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,440
I'm sorry.

667
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,840
I'm sorry.

668
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,440
I'm sorry.

669
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,040
I'm sorry.

670
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,440
I'm sorry.

671
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,040
I'm sorry.

672
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
I'm sorry.

673
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,640
I'm sorry.

674
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,040
I'm sorry.

675
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,640
I'm sorry.

676
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
I'm sorry.

677
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,640
I'm sorry.

678
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,240
I'm sorry.

679
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,840
I'm sorry.

680
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,640
I'm sorry.

681
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,240
I'm sorry.

682
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,840
I'm sorry.

683
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,240
I'm sorry.

684
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,640
I'm sorry.

685
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,040
I'm sorry.

686
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,640
I'm sorry.

687
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,240
I'm sorry.

688
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,840
I'm sorry.

689
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,240
I'm sorry.

690
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,640
I'm sorry.

691
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,840
Don't be sorry.

692
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,840
I'm sorry.

693
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,560
Honey,

694
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,840
keep your birthday seven times.

695
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,440
I hope you can do some calculations

696
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,940
to set a date for your birthday.

697
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,540
The wedding is going to be sold.

698
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,840
That baby

699
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,540
is a ancestor.

700
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
Ping An.

701
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,300
Ping An.

702
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,260
Eat.

703
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,780
You'll eat all the cakes.

704
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,180
This is my last breakfast.

705
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,700
Anything else?

706
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:12,780
You're in a good mood.

707
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,180
You can still eat.

708
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,900
I find you're a real dog.

709
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,820
Is he really a dog?

710
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,220
Can he achieve something?

711
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:26,820
Then,

712
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,740
has your passages of the career

713
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,980
changed non-stop?

714
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:33,620
I don't know.

715
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,460
Hey.

716
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:51,820
How's it going?

717
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,300
Did there go any discussions?

718
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,700
Is he crazy again?

719
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,380
Don't worry.

720
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,220
Leave it to me. I'll handle it.

721
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Hello, Lin.

722
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,180
I want to ask you something.

723
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:14,220
The hotel where Mr. Wang lives.

724
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,500
I got the information from Kokesi.

725
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,900
Thanks. I'll treat you to dinner another day.

726
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,380
One, two, three.

727
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
Be gentle.

728
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,420
Let me show you a move.

729
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:34,900
Grandma, you're getting married.

730
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,060
You're even dancing.

731
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,860
Of course.

732
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,580
I'm a man. I'm good at acting.

733
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,220
I'm energetic.

734
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:44,220
Brother.

735
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,540
You've been reading for a long time.

736
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,300
You haven't turned over a page.

737
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
Are you crazy?

738
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,220
What do you know?

739
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,220
This is called learning from the Palace of Memories.

740
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,300
What Palace of Memories?

741
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,060
Stop it.

742
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,540
You miss Sister Ye Meng.

743
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:00,860
I'm done.

744
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,740
I'll wear a red high-heeled dress when your brother gets married.

745
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,940
Enough, grandma. Take a break.

746
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,940
I'll get you some water.

747
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:21,860
Hello.

748
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,340
Hello.

749
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,460
Can you help me find a guest named Wang Xing Sheng?

750
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,900
Sorry, we have a rule.

751
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,060
You can't leak the information of the guest.

752
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,860
Here's the thing.

753
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,220
I asked him to meet me at 2 p.m.

754
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,020
But I can't get through his phone.

755
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,780
He has a heart attack. I'm really worried about him.

756
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,900
Do you know his room number?

757
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,020
I don't know.

758
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,580
Just help me contact him.

759
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,140
Okay?

760
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:38,740
Wait a minute.

761
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,180
Your friend's name.

762
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:42,180
I'll call you later.

763
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:42,780
Okay.

764
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,660
I'll call you later.

765
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,180
Okay.

766
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,180
I'll call you later.

767
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,740
Okay.

768
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,540
I'll call you later.

769
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,140
Okay.

770
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:48,140
I'll call you later.

771
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,780
Okay.

772
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:49,780
I'll call you later.

773
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,380
Okay.

774
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,980
Please tell me your friend's name.

775
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,100
Wang Xing Sheng.

776
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Xing is Xing Longxing.

777
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,580
Sheng is Sheng Yi's Sheng.

778
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,940
Sorry.

779
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:59,940
Your friend has left the room early.

780
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,060
Left the room?

781
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,620
Why don't you ask him again?

782
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,140
Thank you.

783
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,380
You're welcome.

784
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:22,540
UNIVERSITY

785
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,860
You got Mr. Wang wants?

786
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,740
You can help me,

787
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,580
but isn't it too much to destroy it?

788
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,780
I made an appointment with Mr. Xu,

789
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,580
but didn't you tell me

790
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
You'll find Wang Xing Sheng.

791
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:57,140
Lin Meng, you'll regret it.

792
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,340
I'll help you with Wang Xing Sheng.

793
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,620
I've never changed my mind.

794
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,700
Mo�

795
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,380
You may leave Zuo Ton Li to practice for a few daysrollo ave.

796
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
I'm not in a good mood today.

797
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,580
Can you coax me?

798
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,580
I don't really want to coax you right now.

799
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,580
What do you mean?

800
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Nothing.

801
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:36,580
Li Qianyu, do you want to change your wife?

802
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,580
Why can't you coax me?

803
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I'm not going to change my wife.

804
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I'm going to change my husband.

805
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,580
I'm going to change my husband.

806
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,580
I'm going to change my husband.

807
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
Why can't you coax me?

808
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,580
Because I'm going to hug my wife later.

809
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:58,580
So I don't have time to coax you.

810
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
I'm going to change my husband.

811
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,580
I'm going to change my husband.

812
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,580
I'm going to change my husband.

813
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,580
I'm going to change my husband.

814
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,580
I'm going to change my husband.

815
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,580
I'm going to change my husband.

816
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,580
I'm going to change my husband.

817
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:32,580
I'm going to change my husband.

818
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,580
I'm going to change my husband.

819
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,580
I'm going to change my husband.

820
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,580
I'm going to change my husband.

821
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,580
I'm going to change my husband.

822
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,580
I'm going to change my husband.

823
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,580
I'm going to change my husband.

824
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Just like fire that burns everything to the ground.

825
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:55,580
Can you slowly turn when you lay me down?

826
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
I've been waiting so long.

827
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,580
Look at me in the eyes.

828
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:07,580
I can give you more than what you really want.

829
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:13,580
This crazy love, our crazy love.

830
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,580
Take me to your heart.

831
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:20,580
Through the nights, noses and loves.

832
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:24,580
Between our just crazy love.

833
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:28,580
Our crazy love.

834
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,580
Why are you here?

835
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,580
I've been thinking about the chorus.

836
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,580
Like light up in this crazy love.

837
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:38,580
I have something to explain to you.

838
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:40,580
What is it?

839
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:46,580
I told you not to be angry.

840
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:48,580
And don't be jealous.

841
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
I can be not angry.

842
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:53,580
But I have to think about being jealous.

843
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:56,580
After I posted a video yesterday,

844
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,580
I'm coming.

845
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:00,580
I know.

846
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,580
That phone call didn't hang up.

847
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,580
I heard everything you said.

848
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,580
Then you know I kicked him out, right?

849
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,580
You won't regret it?

850
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:10,580
He's right.

851
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,580
I can't give you anything.

852
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:15,580
What you can give,

853
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:17,580
others can't give.

854
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:19,580
For example?

855
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:23,580
For example,

856
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:28,580
I think you're sexy.

857
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:31,580
What about compared to Tan Qi?

858
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,580
Tan Qi is the first,

859
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,580
this is the third.

860
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
What about the second?

861
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:41,580
The second is the wedding night.

862
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,580
It's about my wife.

863
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:49,580
Or you can combine these two.

864
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,580
Maybe you can be the first.

865
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,580
Wife.

866
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,580
I'm going crazy thinking about it.

867
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,580
Come.

868
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,580
What's up?

869
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,580
Are you at the hotel?

870
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:24,580
I have something to see you.

871
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:27,580
No need, I don't want to see you.

872
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,580
I didn't mean anything else.

873
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,580
I want to apologize to you.

874
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:33,580
I drank some wine last night.

875
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,580
I said some things.

876
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,580
Don't mind.

877
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,580
I'll help you with the wedding.

878
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,580
No need.

879
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,580
My husband is here.

880
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,580
He'll help me.

881
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:46,580
Your husband is here?

882
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,580
Ask him to go downstairs

883
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:54,580
and have dinner with you.

884
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,580
See you in the old place.

885
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,580
We're busy.

886
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:58,580
Stop talking.

887
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,580
You three are in the old place.

888
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Isn't my attitude not correct?

889
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,580
I have no tolerance for

890
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
destroying our marriage.

891
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
I swear.

892
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,580
What are you doing?

893
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
I'm going to take a shower.

894
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,580
I'm hanging up.

895
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:31,580
I advise you to accept the fact.

896
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,580
I didn't believe he was married.

897
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,580
Now he has a husband.

898
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:39,580
How can he find an actor?

899
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,580
It's possible.

900
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,580
We haven't seen the husband.

901
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,580
Have you seen him?

902
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,580
I haven't seen him either.

903
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,580
It's possible.

904
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,580
I'm convinced.

905
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:06,580
I'm convinced.

906
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
You're like this.

907
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,580
I didn't think you liked Ye Meng so much.

908
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,580
Why did you go to his house?

909
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,580
Are you so angry?

910
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,580
I know someone who is better than me.

911
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,580
But I don't care if he's married or not.

912
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,580
Acting.

913
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,580
Hello.

914
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,580
I found out, Jin Yu.

915
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,580
What?

916
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,580
Fat Head is back in Jiangbei.

917
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,580
Are you sure he's back in Jiangbei?

918
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,580
Yes, I heard from Old Chen.

919
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:53,580
Fat Head was just a fake antiques dealer.

920
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,580
He didn't really make any transactions.

921
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,580
He was detained by the police

922
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:59,580
because of the car and the fight.

923
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:01,580
He was arrested by the police

924
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:03,580
because of the car and the fight.

925
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,580
He was detained for a while and just came out.

926
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:07,580
He has a teahouse in Jiangbei.

927
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
I'll send you the address.

928
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Okay, thank you.

929
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:15,580
Are you two out?

930
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:17,580
I'm looking for him to help.

931
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,580
Can I ask Fat Head?

932
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:22,580
We just sent him in together.

933
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,580
Can I?

934
00:42:24,580 --> 00:42:26,580
I have to try.

935
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:32,580
It's been a while.

936
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
I can't see you that much.

937
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,580
I'll send you back to Jiangbei.

938
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Okay, thank you.

939
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:40,580
I'll send you back to Jiangbei.

940
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:42,580
Okay, thank you.

941
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,580
I'll send you back to Jiangbei.

942
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,580
I'll send you back to Jiangbei.

943
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:58,580
You.

944
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,580
I saw you.

945
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:32,580
I can't remember

946
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:43,580
I'm so deep in love that I can't get rid of you

947
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,580
I'm silent

948
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,580
I put the flowers in the back garden

949
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:56,580
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

950
00:43:56,580 --> 00:44:00,580
I pretend to be firm

951
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:05,580
But I'm still obsessed with the origin

952
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:11,580
The most perfect lie

953
00:44:11,580 --> 00:44:14,580
Deceives yourself

954
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:20,580
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

955
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:31,580
Why is it that the moment I cry, my heart still yearns

956
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:55,580
The most perfect lie
