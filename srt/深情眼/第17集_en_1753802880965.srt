1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excited to say how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, I forget

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks that are burning and scattering

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Unable to hide the promise

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
There is still if

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The promise will be kept

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Please remember that dream of mine

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Come in

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Wait, I'll turn on the light first

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes, turn on the light

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Come in

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Jun Hua, come and help

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
OK, I'm coming, I'll help you

26
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
What are you doing

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I told grandma

28
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I found a new job in Hailangang

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's not convenient to tell them my position

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You shouldn't want them to know

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What we quarreled about

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Hello

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Have some soup

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Have some soup

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hurry up

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Sit down

37
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Go, sit down

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Sit there and wait

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Come on, sit down

40
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You go, sit inside

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Mom, sit down

42
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sit down

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Here, Mengmeng

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Have some soup

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Mengmeng

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You've lost weight in a few days

48
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You must have gone to Jiangbei for a job

49
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Look at your face

50
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
So pale

51
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
No

52
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
That's made of powder

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
My granddaughter was white

54
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Come on, Jin Yu, have some soup

55
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Drink

56
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thank you, grandma

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
This soup

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I asked your aunt to make it especially

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's nourishing

60
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Drink it

61
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Drink it

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Yes, drink it

63
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Grandma

64
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'm thirsty

65
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I ate a lot at night

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't finish it now

67
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I have a job to do

68
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll finish it when I finish

69
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
What job

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You're off work now

71
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Your Zhou Bapi

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
The leader

73
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You have to work overtime

74
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Yes

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You said your health is important

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Or your job is important

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Family is important

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yes, family is important

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll teach your leader a good lesson

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Yes

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
At worst, we'll make him angry

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, grandma is right

83
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
He should be taught a lesson

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He's not a thing

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He's not a thing

86
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Come on

87
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Drink, drink, Mengmeng

88
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Drink it

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Good

90
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Have some more

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
No, no

92
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Do you have anything else?

93
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Do you want to go back and rest early?

94
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes

95
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
We're playing mahjong

96
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, we're playing mahjong

97
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You drink

98
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Put the porridge on it

99
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Come on

100
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Come on, come on

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Bring it back

102
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Some soup

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Shall we go in?

105
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Wait a minute

106
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Wait a minute

107
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What did grandma Ye tell you?

108
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
She said she would wait for her instructions

109
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You can't even understand

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What instructions?

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
She didn't say anything

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
She said she would call me when she's waiting

113
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
What time did she say?

114
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
She didn't say anything

115
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't know

116
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I don't know anything

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
What can you do?

118
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Shall we go in and listen to the phone?

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You go

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You go

121
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I'm recording the security

122
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Let's go

123
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Come on

124
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
My makeup

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Three

126
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You

127
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Grandma

128
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I really have to work overtime

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
We've played eight rounds

130
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Let's do this today, okay?

131
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Play two more rounds

132
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Just two rounds

133
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Just two rounds

134
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hurry up

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
By the way

136
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You are all here tonight

137
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Let's discuss about the wedding

138
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Yes

139
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yes

140
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Aren't you both now

141
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Employees of Hailan?

142
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
The water tower is in full bloom

143
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Yes

144
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What do you think about your wedding room?

145
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
We are not in a hurry about the wedding room

146
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Why are you not in a hurry?

147
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Mengmeng

148
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Don't worry

149
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The old woman's book is here

150
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
We can sell the flowers

151
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes

152
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
We can't wait

153
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We will go to see the house tomorrow

154
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yes

155
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Tomorrow morning

156
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Grandma

157
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm a little sleepy

158
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I want to get some rest

159
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You should go to bed early

160
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay

161
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I will call your aunt and Mai Mai

162
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Mai Mai

163
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I will call them

164
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
They live far away

165
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Don't bother them

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's okay

167
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Mom

168
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Grandma

169
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Call me earlier next time

170
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I have a lot of things to do

171
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You

172
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Why are you here?

173
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why are you here?

174
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
You called me

175
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and asked me to come to the toilet

176
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I didn't call you

177
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I just passed by

178
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Passed by

179
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You are so lucky

180
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I just passed by

181
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's fate

182
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Enough

183
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't stand there

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Hurry up

185
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You two go to bed

186
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Come on

187
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm going to sleep

188
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
We are going back to the room

189
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Okay, go to bed

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Dad, go to bed

191
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Dad, go to bed

192
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Dad, be careful

193
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
250 yuan

194
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You are sure to pay a lot of money

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm sure

196
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm sure

197
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm sure

198
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
You are sure to pay a lot of money

199
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You almost got hit

200
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It's cold outside

201
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We are almost having a cold

202
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
So cold

203
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
It's not important

204
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We will get this wedding done tonight

205
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
We will get this wedding done tonight

206
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Hurry up

207
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Honey

208
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't do this plan today

209
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You are so tired

210
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are so tired

211
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Go to bed early

212
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I won't do it, you do it

213
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You are so anxious to get me out of the game

214
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Li Jingyu

215
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Do you think it's useful to

216
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
play this game with your grandmothers?

217
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's not the grandmothers I'm looking for

218
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's them

219
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't laugh

220
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's them

221
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They saw you were too tired recently

222
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
So they want to see you

223
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Give you chicken soup

224
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Chunlong

225
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
No, honey, it's really not me

226
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm looking for

227
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Meilan, hurry up and get the cards

228
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The wine

229
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The wine

230
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I really don't understand

231
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Meilan

232
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Find me some wine

233
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Hurry up

234
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Meilan, I can't find it either

235
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Second brother, second brother

236
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You go to the second brother

237
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Brother, get me a cup of coffee

238
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The first brother

239
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Fatty

240
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Three, three

241
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Three

242
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
It's my turn

243
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,280
No, no, no.

244
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,400
What?

245
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,080
Out.

246
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,840
No, I'll do it.

247
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,560
Let me.

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,520
No.

249
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,280
Carefully....

250
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:08,740
Sorry.

251
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,300
They are going well.

252
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,140
What are you doing?

253
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,300
Wait for me.

254
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,080
I'm sleepy. I want to sleep.

255
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,520
Sleep. Sleep well.

256
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,800
Take your hands away.

257
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,960
You're so annoying.

258
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,440
I...

259
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,280
Why are you leaving? You're so shameless.

260
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,360
You're not even in the line.

261
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,560
I...

262
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,760
You're so annoying.

263
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,480
Hello.

264
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,640
Thank you.

265
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,280
Hello.

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,920
Mr. Ye qui,

267
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,660
if you think Mr. Ye is a bit powerful,

268
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,100
please think intensely about it.

269
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:43,880
Please.

270
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,560
Thank you, sir.

271
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,280
Yimeng,

272
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,920
there are uscharful reviews

273
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,320
about the propaganda video

274
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,200
which is on our Donkey.

275
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,080
And now,

276
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:54,820
it's appreciated in comments.

277
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,760
Mr. Li, this is done.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
If there's no problem,

279
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,040
just sign it.

280
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,760
I just read it.

281
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,480
Mr. Li.

282
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,320
But some data is not clear.

283
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,600
Okay, I'll modify it.

284
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,800
Wait a minute.

285
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,520
Mr. Li,

286
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,160
I have something to report to you.

287
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,240
Okay.

288
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,560
Okay.

289
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,240
In the third stage,

290
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,480
I will follow the data analysis of the first two stages

291
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,840
to adjust the marketing strategy

292
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,440
to form a copy mode.

293
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,720
You can take a look.

294
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,120
What's wrong?

295
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,840
What's going on?

296
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,000
You are in charge of this project.

297
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,680
Shouldn't you give us an explanation?

298
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,720
Now, there are all kinds of negative comments

299
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,160
about the fake rights and supercars on the official website.

300
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,360
According to this kind of public opinion trend,

301
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,440
it will continue to grow.

302
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,240
When everyone mentions Hailangang,

303
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,880
the first reaction is fake rights and supercars.

304
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,160
This is a big issue for Hailangang.

305
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,640
All the accounts have been

306
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,560
taken by you all these days.

307
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,160
You guys are the ones who are responsible for this.

308
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,400
You guys are responsible for this.

309
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,680
You guys are responsible for this.

310
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,760
You guys are responsible for this.

311
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,800
You guys are responsible for this.

312
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,720
You guys are responsible for this.

313
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,840
You guys are responsible for this.

314
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,640
All the accounts

315
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,120
are taken by your team.

316
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:39,800
If you pursue it,

317
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,520
you guys are the most responsible.

318
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,440
Mr. Li, don't you want the data to be beautiful?

319
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,520
You don't spend much money on the plan.

320
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,840
Take a look at my plan.

321
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,240
The official Weibo account of the environment control department

322
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,520
has forwarded our video

323
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
and also proved it to us.

324
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,080
The negative comment you just mentioned,

325
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,240
I found it when I was taking over this account.

326
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:03,920
Sister Ye Meng,

327
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,480
the promotional video of our project

328
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,240
has a negative comment about the copyright.

329
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,120
This comment has been posted on the internet.

330
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,680
You can read this comment anytime.

331
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,040
If you have anything, just tell me.

332
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,560
Okay.

333
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Since someone wants to save money for us,

334
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,160
change the account.

335
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:26,240
Now the trend of public opinion has changed.

336
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,040
Yes.

337
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:29,080
The trend has changed so fast.

338
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,120
With the official proof,

339
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,400
the negative public opinion is slowly decreasing.

340
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,520
And the trend has increased.

341
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,080
Mr. Li,

342
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,160
this is the plan I've been working on.

343
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,120
It's half less than the budget you gave me.

344
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,320
It seems that I have to sit down

345
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,440
in this position.

346
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,680
I admit defeat.

347
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,000
Ms. Ye is better than I thought.

348
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,000
Thank you.

349
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:04,880
It's done.

350
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,280
It's done.

351
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,080
It works.

352
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,280
Did I ask Chen to do some inspection?

353
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,160
I'll give it to you.

354
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,280
Zhou Yu.

355
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,280
Zhou Yu.

356
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,720
Zhou Yu.

357
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,800
Look.

358
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,120
Don't forget what I told you.

359
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,120
Is the IP address of this post here?

360
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,120
Isn't this Jiang Lu Zhi?

361
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,120
The eye mask is also here.

362
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
You go with Jiang Lu Zhi, I'll go with Ye Meng.

363
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,120
Okay.

364
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,120
Why are you following me?

365
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
I...

366
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Calm down.

367
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,120
Fake?

368
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
What?

369
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
How is it? Are you hurt?

370
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,120
Stop acting.

371
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,120
Isn't she your person?

372
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,120
My person?

373
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,120
This is all Jiang Lu Zhi's doing.

374
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,120
You called Jiang Lu Zhi in,

375
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,120
isn't it just to drive me away?

376
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,120
You think too much.

377
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,120
I think that with our current relationship,

378
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,120
there is no way to...

379
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Stop finding excuses for yourself.

380
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,120
If you are so afraid that the relationship will be exposed,

381
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
sign the divorce agreement quickly.

382
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,120
It's impossible to divorce. Don't even think about it.

383
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,120
Ye Meng.

384
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,120
Let go. Let go, Li Jing Yu.

385
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,120
Li Jing Yu.

386
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,120
What are you doing?

387
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Let go.

388
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,120
Let go.

389
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,120
Are you okay?

390
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:38,120
I'm fine.

391
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
Ye Meng is in my team.

392
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Aren't you just a fake?

393
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,120
What are you talking about?

394
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,120
What does our private life have to do with you?

395
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,120
Nothing private.

396
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,120
Ye Meng.

397
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,120
What else do you want?

398
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
What else are you doing?!

399
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,120
Ye Meng.

400
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Teacher Later.

401
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Lu Zhi, long time no see.

402
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
This is...

403
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
I'm visiting my mother.

404
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,120
Well,

405
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,120
you are free to have a walk inside the school.

406
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,120
OK, goodbye.

407
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,120
What are you doing here?

408
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,520
I should ask you.

409
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:33,800
What are you doing here?

410
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,600
This is Jiang Lu Zhi's house, right?

411
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:36,960
What?

412
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,280
What Lu Zhi?

413
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,600
What are you playing at?

414
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,040
Are you trying to

415
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:41,960
tell your good friend

416
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,920
about this?

417
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,000
No.

418
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,440
I was just thinking about him.

419
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:46,040
I...

420
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,040
Are you following me?

421
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,000
Didn't you say

422
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,200
we should keep in touch?

423
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:53,960
Yes.

424
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,200
I didn't contact you.

425
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,240
I was just passing by.

426
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,080
And I met you.

427
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,320
I said hello to you.

428
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,680
We were just following you.

429
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,440
When did you...

430
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,200
Well...

431
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,000
Well...

432
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,600
I'll leave after I say hello.

433
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,480
Wait.

434
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,080
Why do I see that you're a little guilty?

435
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:09,760
I...

436
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:10,840
I...

437
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,240
Why am I guilty?

438
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,000
You're guilty.

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,840
Tell me.

440
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,240
Did Li Jin Yu

441
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
forget about his ex-girlfriend?

442
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,680
You helped him to hide it.

443
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:20,560
What are you talking about?

444
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,640
I don't understand.

445
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,960
I'll call the bank now.

446
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,360
No.

447
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,600
I...

448
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,080
I saw Jiang Lu Zhi jumping the fence.

449
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,920
I think he's scheming.

450
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,440
I'll come and check it out.

451
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,920
You're making excuses.

452
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,320
I'll ask Ye Meng if he believes it.

453
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,440
No. Don't...

454
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,160
It's okay.

455
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,000
Ye Meng can call me.

456
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,760
I...

457
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm the boss here.

458
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,240
Don't make things difficult for me.

459
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,920
Cheng Kai Ran, let me ask you.

460
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,040
Do you take me and Ye Meng

461
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,240
or Li Jin Yu?

462
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,680
I...

463
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,320
I definitely take you.

464
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,480
But do you remember

465
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,320
this alley?

466
00:21:59,080 --> 00:21:59,800
What?

467
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,000
Don't...

468
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,320
Don't interrupt me.

469
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,040
Listen.

470
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,960
No matter what happens to Li Jin Yu,

471
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,600
you must inform me at once.

472
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,600
Don't keep it from me.

473
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,080
Am I

474
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,360
contacting you or not?

475
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,200
You can

476
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,120
contact me

477
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,000
and contact me in time.

478
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,240
I'm leaving.

479
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
Yang.

480
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,080
You really don't remember this alley?

481
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,000
What's wrong with you?

482
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,640
I'm home.

483
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,040
Why are you still following me?

484
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,000
What's your relationship with Li Jin Yu?

485
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Didn't I tell you?

486
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,480
Jia Fang's relationship.

487
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,320
Wait.

488
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,440
I've known him for so long.

489
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,160
He's always a public figure.

490
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,040
I've never seen him like that.

491
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,640
Are you two hiding something from me?

492
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,840
We're not on good terms.

493
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,720
It's Jia Yi Fang's relationship that we're not on good terms.

494
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm not kidding.

495
00:22:58,760 --> 00:22:59,640
I'm serious.

496
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:00,640
If there's nothing else, just go.

497
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,440
Wait.

498
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Well...

499
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,680
It's still early.

500
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,440
You've never been here before.

501
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,040
Go in and sit.

502
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,040
It's not convenient.

503
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
Sister-in-law.

504
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,080
Sister.

505
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
You're feeding the dog again?

506
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,600
What dog?

507
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,960
This is...

508
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:20,600
Ah.

509
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,600
Boss Wang.

510
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,440
Ah.

511
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,200
Hello, boss.

512
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,200
I'm Qiao Mai Mai.

513
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,040
I'm my sister-in-law's little aunt.

514
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,680
My brother is my sister-in-law's husband.

515
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,440
What can I do for you?

516
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,160
Oh, right.

517
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,280
My brother is at the ju-bao stone.

518
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,840
Would you like to go with me?

519
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,160
Ju-bao stone?

520
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,000
It's a bar here.

521
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,640
Ah.

522
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:41,600
Um.

523
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,360
I have something to do later.

524
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,440
You go ahead.

525
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,480
Ah, okay.

526
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,800
Tell me when you're done.

527
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
Bye.

528
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,360
What are you waiting for?

529
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,360
Let's go.

530
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,840
Sister-in-law, go in and sit.

531
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,960
Did you just hear it?

532
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,720
My husband is a social worker.

533
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
Do you still want to go in and sit?

534
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,600
Yan Meng.

535
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
What's wrong?

536
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,600
You really let me down.

537
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,640
Why are you like this now?

538
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,240
What's wrong with you?

539
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,320
…

540
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
Ah…

541
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,520
When you come and

542
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,720
ask me out,

543
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,920
I am not on purpose

544
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:44,000
to contact your «÷».

545
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,220
Tailor

546
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,200
This...

547
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,480
You don't look me this way.

548
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,160
It feels creepy.

549
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,720
I've just sent you

550
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,800
all the pictures.

551
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,440
You...

552
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,640
Look at it yourself.

553
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Jiang Muzhi went back to her parents

554
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,840
after meeting that man.

555
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,280
Nothing else is unusual.

556
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:28,320
Don't worry.

557
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,320
You must have been found out.

558
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,440
How could I be found out?

559
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,800
What I'm good at is to hide myself.

560
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:34,880
If I can't,

561
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,680
I'll follow her tomorrow morning.

562
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,320
You...

563
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:44,400
Li Yiyue, are you crazy?

564
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,520
Tell me.

565
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,440
When I was with Jiang Muzhi,

566
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,720
did I touch Fang Ran?

567
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,320
I think

568
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,160
it's because Ye Mo asked her to watch me.

569
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,520
Don't put me in the middle.

570
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,160
I'm a man on the left and right.

571
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,840
And this knife...

572
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,760
It's a toy knife.

573
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,240
I'll give you a shock.

574
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,160
You scared me.

575
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,560
Ye Meng was attacked.

576
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,960
The man who met Jiang Muzhi

577
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,520
used this.

578
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,720
What about Ye Meng?

579
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,920
He's fine.

580
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,960
The man who attacked him is Zhou Yu.

581
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:23,440
He's an intern

582
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,240
who hired us

583
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
from Hailangang some time ago.

584
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,360
I suspect that

585
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:27,280
the case of the official investigation

586
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,120
has something to do with him.

587
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,760
I've asked someone

588
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,560
to get his personal documents.

589
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,280
I've transferred his personal documents.

590
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,080
Check for me

591
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,320
what the origin of this person is.

592
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Jin Yun.

593
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
Why are you here?

594
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,160
I need to talk to him.

595
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,480
Boss Gao.

596
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,200
Who is it?

597
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,240
Let me introduce myself.

598
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
I'm Cheng Kai Ran.

599
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,160
This is my bar.

600
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,520
You're the boss here.

601
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:25,400
You're the boss here.

602
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
I'm the boss here.

603
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,400
I'm the boss here.

604
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I'm the boss here.

605
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,400
I'm the boss here.

606
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,400
I'm the boss here.

607
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm the boss here.

608
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,400
I'm the boss here.

609
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,360
This man

610
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,320
wants me to Chancellor.

611
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,720
You're taking the chosen one?

612
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:37,920
Alright.

613
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,560
My name is Chen Ywneng.

614
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,600
Older brother.

615
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,280
I know you.

616
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,040
Jue teaspoon,

617
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,000
I've heard that

618
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:54,440
you were very curious about me.

619
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,760
Although I don't know much about you,

620
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,240
of course I know what's in you.

621
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,320
Teresa Mei.

622
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
You grew up with Ye Meng.

623
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,800
Outsiders can't

624
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,800
know your feelings, right?

625
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,280
Goukai, you too.

626
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,640
Don't be jealous.

627
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,160
You're always digging into other people's feet.

628
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,320
If they don't like you,

629
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,360
find your own reason.

630
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,080
Yes.

631
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,680
Find your own reason.

632
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,560
Ye Meng has a good taste since he was a kid.

633
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,160
Normally, people can't get into his eyes.

634
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,440
He doesn't like

635
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,320
a man who is fake.

636
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,440
He likes me,

637
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:30,960
a real-life man.

638
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,560
I didn't say you.

639
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,600
Boss Cheng, right?

640
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,720
Yes.

641
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,720
I won't bother you anymore.

642
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,480
You're not suitable for Ye Meng.

643
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,320
And I heard that you two

644
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,280
are getting divorced.

645
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,720
Can I make a condition?

646
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,520
I know about the divorce.

647
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,160
I...

648
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I'm a little heartbroken.

649
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,440
Then I'll call

650
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,080
5 million.

651
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,320
Once the money is paid,

652
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,360
I'll never see Ye Meng again.

653
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,160
How much?

654
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,320
5 million.

655
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,400
I'll pay you back.

656
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,760
I'll pay you back.

657
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,640
I'll pay you back.

658
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,440
I'll pay you back.

659
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,320
I'll pay you back.

660
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,120
I'll pay you back.

661
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,960
You really dare to ask for it?

662
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,640
No.

663
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,760
It's all in the TV station.

664
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,640
You give me a check.

665
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,600
I'll fill it myself.

666
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,440
If you don't have that much money,

667
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,200
don't put in a lot of money here.

668
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,760
Or with our one-sided support,

669
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,480
I'll give you a discount.

670
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,520
250.

671
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,360
What does it mean?

672
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,880
200.

673
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,520
I...

674
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,960
Boss Gao has a big business.

675
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,960
I don't want to lose this money.

676
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,240
It seems that it's not true love.

677
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,680
What do you mean, Li Junyi?

678
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,320
That guy?

679
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,240
The guy who really loves that guy.

680
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,760
Okay.

681
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,000
I'll give it to you.

682
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,200
You really dare?

683
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,320
I'm kidding.

684
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,520
You think I'm kidding?

685
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:02,720
Do you think I'm

686
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,000
a little better than that guy?

687
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,880
We really love

688
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,080
priceless.

689
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:14,640
Okay.

690
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,640
Let me show you

691
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,800
what love is.

692
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:25,760
Okay.

693
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,400
The progress in Hailangang is smooth.

694
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,040
Thank you.

695
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,880
Come to Mingzui.

696
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,920
Relax your shoulders.

697
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,400
Is this guy

698
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,760
out of his mind?

699
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,040
Why does he think

700
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,480
I'm a couple with Ye Meng?

701
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,520
Can he really give me 5 million?

702
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,560
Your mind is in a mess.

703
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,680
Ye Meng is worth 5 million.

704
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,520
You didn't even have 5 million.

705
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,120
Now you're rich.

706
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,320
It's called

707
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,200
explosive mutual love.

708
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,480
Really.

709
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,880
When will you two

710
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,840
get married?

711
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,560
When Hailangang is almost done,

712
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,080
those people

713
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,040
will leave you at any time.

714
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,960
You owe me 5 million.

715
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,960
It's okay if you don't give it.

716
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,320
We're brothers.

717
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,280
You spent money

718
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,400
on those black companies' accounts, right?

719
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,720
Do you think work is a game

720
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,680
for you to play

721
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,480
with new tricks and tricks

722
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,600
against Ye Meng?

723
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
Did Ye Meng tell you to do it?

724
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,640
I just did what I wanted to do.

725
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,400
What do you care about me?

726
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,520
I just wanted to make a deal with you.

727
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:58,720
I didn't let you

728
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
joke about the company's credit.

729
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,480
If I find out again

730
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,720
that you play tricks, tricks,

731
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:05,840
tricks against Ye Meng,

732
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
our deal

733
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,400
will be completely terminated.

734
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,160
Bai Tian.

735
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,240
Why is she still here?

736
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,200
It's none of your business.

737
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,720
Why are you here?

738
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,240
We're here to see you

739
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,120
at the company's reunion.

740
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:35,600
Listen.

741
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,080
Ye Meng and her husband

742
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,360
are finally getting divorced.

743
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,800
Who told you that?

744
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,080
Gou Kai.

745
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:42,960
Otherwise, why did he

746
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,000
suddenly organize a reunion

747
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,360
and let me prepare

748
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,080
a confession scene for him?

749
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,240
Confession?

750
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,520
Where?

751
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,960
Ji Guang's car park.

752
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,800
You can go there later.

753
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,160
He'll pay for it anyway.

754
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,080
I'm still worried.

755
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,520
Confession scene?

756
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:02,800
How to arrange it?

757
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,880
It's so late.

758
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,160
Someone is not going back

759
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,280
to be a rich woman.

760
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,640
Why are you pretending to be a cow?

761
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,720
Could it be

762
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,160
you're having an affair

763
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,600
with your husband?

764
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,600
I'm working overtime here.

765
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,800
Isn't it because of you?

766
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
I don't understand what you're talking about.

767
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:45,840
Check WeChat.

768
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,120
My mom is so confused

769
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,240
about the background picture.

770
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,840
She can't even recognize my mom.

771
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,280
You're trying to frame me?

772
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,880
Frame you?

773
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,280
If I want to frame you,

774
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,240
when Zhou

775
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,280
stabbed me,

776
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,120
I should have given

777
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,160
the picture to the police.

778
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,200
It would be great if they called the police.

779
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
Zhou Yu attacked you?

780
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,880
How could it be?

781
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,680
I just said his name is Zhou.

782
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,280
I didn't say his name is Zhou Yu.

783
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,160
You're lying.

784
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,560
Zhou Yu really did it to me.

785
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,080
But I think

786
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,520
with your courage,

787
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,320
you should let him

788
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,440
have a bad reputation.

789
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
You wouldn't dare to do anything else.

790
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:40,800
What?

791
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,120
Give you a chance to apologize to me.

792
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,360
What? It's dry.

793
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,440
I can't do it.

794
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,400
I can't drink it.

795
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,560
I'll drink it.

796
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,920
I'm sorry.

797
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,720
You can do it, too.

798
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,920
I really don't understand.

799
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,440
You've been blaming me

800
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,640
since I was three years old.

801
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,200
I'm still nervous

802
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,720
because of you.

803
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,000
I haven't changed yet.

804
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,560
You really know me.

805
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
You know me well.

806
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,480
You think I want to?

807
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,640
You've been better than me

808
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,840
since I was a kid.

809
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,800
You don't care.

810
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,040
The teachers and classmates all praise me.

811
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,800
You don't care.

812
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,960
You're always pretty.

813
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,480
You're more beautiful than anyone else.

814
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,280
If I really don't care,

815
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,560
I might die

816
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,480
and quit my job at Gou Kai's company.

817
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,520
Do you envy me

818
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,880
for my pretty face?

819
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,720
I envy you more

820
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,840
for having a good brain

821
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,040
who can read.

822
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,080
I'm a good teacher.

823
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,200
I'm a good teacher.

824
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,720
Don't you have your own life?

825
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,400
Why are you staring at me every day?

826
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,960
You don't like Gao Kai.

827
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,400
You like me, right?

828
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,800
You're crazy.

829
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,720
But to be honest,

830
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:26,400
the reason why I jumped into Gou Kai's company

831
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,320
is because

832
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,320
I thought you liked him.

833
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,560
I wanted to make you sick.

834
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,480
I knew it.

835
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,000
You care about me the most.

836
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,280
You still don't admit it.

837
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,720
I didn't expect

838
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,720
that I'm the one who's the one.

839
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,840
Now?

840
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,280
Now?

841
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,000
Do you feel better?

842
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,080
I still remember

843
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,560
when you were in high school,

844
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,720
you were standing on the stage

845
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,960
and talking about your dream

846
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,680
when you were speaking.

847
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,600
You said

848
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,040
you worked hard to study

849
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,520
and went to the big city

850
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,520
to realize your dream.

851
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
It was for music.

852
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,840
Music.

853
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,600
Music.

854
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,320
I've forgotten

855
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,840
such a serious word.

856
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,760
I didn't expect you to remember it.

857
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,680
Because I've never helped other people.

858
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,240
Jiang Luzhi,

859
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,040
live for yourself.

860
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,400
I still hate you.

861
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,240
Cheers.

862
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,040
Let's go.

863
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,640
A company is digging me up.

864
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,520
Their salary is better than that of Hailan.

865
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,840
I don't need to work for you anymore.

866
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,520
Let's go.

867
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,240
Let's go.

868
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,400
Right.

869
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,480
Li Junyu asked me to come back

870
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,000
because

871
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,680
I threatened him with the news of your relationship.

872
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,720
He wanted to protect you.

873
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,160
But don't worry.

874
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,920
Even if I resign now,

875
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,280
I will still obey the contract spirit

876
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,520
that I should obey.

877
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,640
I will report to you.

878
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,360
Yan Meng.

879
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
I wish you happiness.

880
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,720
The

881
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,640
The

882
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,560
The

883
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:51,360
The

884
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,800
Free activity is the main topic today.

885
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,480
If you want to eat and drink, follow me.

886
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,800
If you want to lie down and rest, go over there.

887
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,080
Okay?

888
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,160
Today, the higher-ups will pay.

889
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,360
Okay.

890
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,000
Let's go.

891
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,280
This is also a project

892
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:03,440
that our company is about to operate.

893
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,000
Let me take you around.

894
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:06,960
I don't need to.

895
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,760
If you want to do a food factory project,

896
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,080
you, the future person in charge,

897
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,480
should feel it in advance.

898
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,400
Okay.

899
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,280
Why are you here?

900
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,200
Bai Mingxiao asked me to come here.

901
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,960
What's up?

902
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,960
It's been a long time since we played racing.

903
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,760
Bao Yiqiu.

904
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,720
How long have you not driven for?

905
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,480
You must have stepped back early.

906
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:50,960
Are you afraid of losing?

907
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,240
Get in the car.

908
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,200
Wait a minute.

909
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,120
Regarding the project,

910
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,240
I have some special ideas.

911
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,160
I want to talk to Manager Ye.

912
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,080
Why don't you

913
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,400
talk to me in my car?

914
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,720
What do you want to do, Manager Li?

915
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,480
And I just told you

916
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,680
what it means to wear clothes.

917
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,960
On purpose.

918
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,200
You don't mind

919
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,600
as the chairperson, right?

920
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,120
Lin Wo.

921
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:36,040
Be careful.

922
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,520
bullying

923
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:36,760
If I went to shake my sides,

924
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,080
you're watching, right?

925
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:15,720
You, I saw you

926
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,720
I thought of you

927
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,720
I heard any news from you

928
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:30,720
The love that was raised in my heart

929
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,720
Enveloped my thoughts

930
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:39,720
Where should I go?

931
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,720
How should I respond?

932
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Those memories about you

933
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:59,720
I was so deep in thought that I couldn't get rid of you

934
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,720
I was silent and ignored

935
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:07,720
The flowers were in the back of my eyes

936
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,720
Maybe it would make the sadness stop spreading

937
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,720
I pretended to be firm

938
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:23,720
But I was still obsessed with the original

939
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,720
The most perfect lie

940
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,720
Deceiving myself

941
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,720
If love is letting go, let us lose the relationship

942
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
Why is this?

943
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,720
The moment of tears

944
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,720
The heart is still lingering

945
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,720
The most perfect lie

946
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:01,720
The most perfect lie

947
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,720
The most perfect lie

948
00:45:07,720 --> 00:45:12,720
The most perfect lie
