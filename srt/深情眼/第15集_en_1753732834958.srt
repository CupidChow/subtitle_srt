00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
I can still remember the love

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Your eyes shined when you were young

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
You said you loved me so much

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
But I keep walking and forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise was forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
The memories are left, the fireworks are burning

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can go back to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The heart that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Is empty at the edge

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
There is me who loves you so much

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, it has never changed

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise to be kept

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Love by Hypnotic

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 2

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Brother Yu, we're here to pick you up today.

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Where do you want to go at night?

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Wait a minute

23
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You're not Chen Xiaoyu's parents, right?

24
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Who are you?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You are the one

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Don't come over

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll call the police

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Teacher, they are their own people

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Not human traffickers

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My mom knows

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
All right

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
But after you go home

33
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Be sure to call the teacher to call him

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Do you know

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Thank you teacher

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Wait a minute

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm worried

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Give me a call

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Free of charge

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you, thank you

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Goodbye teacher

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Bye bye

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
go

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Remember to wear a seat belt

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Thank you teacher

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Go home early

47
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
it is good

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Why did you come to pick me up today?

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Your mom has something to do today

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Let us come

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What about my godmother?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Happy

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Don't always blacken your face

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
This guy

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Your mother and their best friends today

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Then the three of us men

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Happy day

58
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Let's go out and play

59
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But I still want to go home and write homework

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What homework

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Play

62
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Come on, Yu Ge

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yu Ge, give me a little oil

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Give me some oil

65
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Give me some oil

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Give me some oil

67
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Yu Ge, Yu Ge, Yu Ge

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
My brother is wearing a white shirt

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Give me Yu Ge

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
This way, this way

71
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Look at the ugly face

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Ugly face

73
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Press it, press it

74
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's a ball

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Yu Ge, Yu Ge, Yu Ge

76
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
It's still you

77
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's take a circle

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Come on, let's take a circle

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Forget it

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
No meaning

81
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Let's take another circle

82
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Please, please, just one circle

83
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Please, please

84
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Let's take another circle

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Ok ok

86
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Just one circle

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Stop acting

88
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I can see it

89
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Since my mother doesn't want me to go back

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then I have to cooperate with my mother

91
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm hungry

92
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Let's go eat something

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Yu Ge, Yu Ge, Yu Ge, wait for me

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
What do you want to eat

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Fried chicken

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Come

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You must be tired after playing with me for so long

98
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Actually, you don't have to find excuses

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
My mother never let me go back

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's all because my dad came to make trouble again

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Jiayu

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You adults have adults' troubles

103
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Our children have children's troubles

104
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
This time, I got second place in the second round

105
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I can't forgive myself

106
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
It seems that life is really painful

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Brother Jing Yu, you are so handsome and smart

108
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What troubles do you have?

109
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Is it a trouble that my wife ignores me?

110
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
What trouble is this?

111
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Mobile phone

112
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come on, come on

113
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll give you a sample

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Wife

115
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Miss you

116
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Kiss kiss kiss

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You don't have to send me back

118
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's okay

119
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I'll help you clean up

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
This is messy

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You have to clean it up

122
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'll help you clean it up

123
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
No, no, no, I'll do it myself

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Don't touch it, come on

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm sorry

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm sorry

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'm sorry

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
This is all

129
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Cry

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Cry if you want to

131
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
You say

132
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I feel sorry for him a few days ago

133
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Or I won't talk to him anymore

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So silly of me

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Do you remember when we were young

136
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
When we were in Ningsui

137
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When we were eating and singing

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I was so happy

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I was so happy

140
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I was so happy

141
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I was so happy

142
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I was so happy

143
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I was so happy

144
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I was so happy

145
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
When we were young

146
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Who would have thought

147
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Will have such a day

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I tell you

149
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You choose men's taste

150
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Really very little

151
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
What do you say about women

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Just always soft hearted

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You say I'm married

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
It's been so many years

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I have a child

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Who would have thought

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I would be so soft-hearted

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes

159
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
What's wrong with you

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You and Li Jun are not right

161
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Did you go to Jiangbei

162
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
What happened

163
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Something is hiding from me

164
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I don't know

165
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I just feel that he is getting stranger

166
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's like I never really

167
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Known him

168
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Maybe I decided to marry him

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's a bit too hasty

170
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But your two families

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Don't you already

172
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Are you planning to have a wedding

173
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You won't regret it now, will you

174
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What are you going to do after that

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Both old people are very sad

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I also feel a bit confused

177
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Take it off first

178
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Can only be taken off

179
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Can it be taken off until when

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Until he can't keep it going

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
OK, don't sigh

182
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Xia Yu will be back soon

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
You go to the skin care shop

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Look at his eyes

185
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I'll pack my things

186
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
OK, I'll go

187
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Is the surveillance camera

188
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Damaged by the fool

189
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Xia Yu

190
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Xia Yu

191
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Mom, mom

192
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How was it? Happy?

193
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Happy

194
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Thank you

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
He is comfortable

196
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Ok, let's go

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
If there is anything later

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Call anytime

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'll treat you to dinner later

200
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Drive slowly

201
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Bye bye

202
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Bye bye, Xia Yu

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Bye bye, Xia Yu

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Bye bye

205
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Bye bye

206
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Bye bye

207
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Bye bye

208
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Bye bye

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Bye bye

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Bye bye

211
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then I'll go first

212
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Don't ignore him

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Take the initiative

214
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Well

215
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Go straight

216
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
A little bit

217
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Ye Meng

218
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Are you ok today?

219
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Nothing

220
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Next time you meet this kind of

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You should call me

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Nothing

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I just feel bad for Yan An

224
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
When he got married

225
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I thought he finally got the chance

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
To be a good husband

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But he didn't

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I thought he finally got the happiness

229
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Found a reliable one

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I didn't expect it to be like this now

231
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
You

232
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Are you still angry with me?

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Do you have anything to tell me?

234
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
In my heart

235
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Do you know

236
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Humans have a complicated heart

237
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,240
Jealous

238
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Blessed people

239
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,680
Can be in love inrying a whole life

240
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,620
And unlucky

241
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,620
You don't know your own love at all.

242
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm going back now.

243
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,140
Good night.

244
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,260
Mr. Li,

245
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,860
the Hanhai Group is too deep.

246
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:32,980
If we want to investigate,

247
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,620
we may have to do it from the inside.

248
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,900
Give it to me.

249
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,460
Who do you think he is?

250
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,620
I swear it's someone I've never seen before.

251
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,380
You're afraid it's him?

252
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,100
Make room for me.

253
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:03,220
Let me see.

254
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,220
It's like a necklace

255
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,940
It's like a rabbit

256
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,260
Besides, let me tell you

257
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,900
Young people nowadays

258
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,100
pay attention to

259
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
the green snake, you know?

260
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,540
How much does the green snake cost?

261
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:18,100
The more gold it has, the better it is

262
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,860
Right?

263
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,260
Besides

264
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,820
if they don't pass by one day

265
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,940
I'll take this

266
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,740
and pawn it

267
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,980
It'll become money, right?

268
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,940
You need to be smart

269
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,500
Right?

270
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,900
Yes

271
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,060
They're young and young

272
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,140
They're doing well now

273
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,660
You can curse them

274
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,100
It's dragon phoenix

275
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,340
It's a good term

276
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,420
Dragon phoenix is auspicious

277
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,900
Right

278
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,500
Take a break

279
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,820
What dragon phoenix is auspicious?

280
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,100
It's already past ten

281
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,540
Young people nowadays

282
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,420
like this

283
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,380
It's very smooth

284
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,220
You know nothing

285
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,900
You know

286
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,540
It's smooth

287
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:48,260
Right

288
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
You're a young girl

289
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,980
You're old enough

290
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,260
It's smooth

291
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,780
You're good

292
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,180
You're my beauty

293
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,220
What should I do?

294
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,100
What should I do?

295
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,820
I'm old

296
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,300
I can't wear

297
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,420
smooth things

298
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:03,820
I have to wear it

299
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,940
I'm so angry

300
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,980
Ma'am

301
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,500
Actually

302
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,220
we have many other styles

303
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,540
You can have a look

304
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,260
Right

305
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,220
Nowadays

306
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,820
the gold and diamond

307
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,740
are popular

308
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,340
Look

309
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,580
It's both precious and fashionable

310
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:20,460
You know nothing

311
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,500
Listen

312
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,860
You can be a rich man

313
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,820
Don't take my granddaughter

314
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,460
as a rich man

315
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,820
Why am I

316
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,620
rich and vulgar?

317
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,340
You're a young girl

318
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,820
You're too young

319
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,620
Right

320
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,460
Mrs. Liang

321
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,140
What's wrong?

322
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,060
Look

323
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,260
You two bought it for Xiaobei, right?

324
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,260
Why don't you ask her?

325
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,660
After all, you two like it

326
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,580
But your granddaughter

327
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,420
your granddaughter-in-law

328
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,300
doesn't like it

329
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,020
What should we do?

330
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:50,860
Right?

331
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,340
Pittsburgh

332
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,260
Hello

333
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,140
Grandma

334
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,620
Splat

335
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,220
Grandma is at home

336
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,540
I got you something

337
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,620
This is Hello

338
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,700
Aww

339
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,500
Why do you pay so other people USB

340
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,780
after Wen bring their noise

341
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,580
money

342
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,580
I work like a woman

343
00:16:32,340 --> 00:17:00,320
then the

344
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:02,980
Grandma.

345
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:04,300
Here.

346
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:04,780
Come on.

347
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:05,420
Come and have a look.

348
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,580
Nanny, come and have a look.

349
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,100
Come and have a seat.

350
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,460
I've chosen the right earrings for you.

351
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,180
They are fine.

352
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,860
They don't suit your temperament.

353
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,380
Okay.

354
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,140
Nanny, look.

355
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,580
These are the earrings I've chosen for you.

356
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:18,740
These are the bracelets.

357
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:19,900
Look.

358
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:21,300
I've chosen these.

359
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,780
And the rings.

360
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:24,980
Hurry up.

361
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,780
How is it?

362
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,500
Choose.

363
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:26,820
Look.

364
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:27,460
Hurry up, Nanny.

365
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,740
Don't let Nanny choose.

366
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,140
Hurry up.

367
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:29,620
Choose.

368
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,900
Come on.

369
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:32,500
Nanny.

370
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,340
The gold price is very high now.

371
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,660
It's a bit of a loss to buy it now.

372
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,980
How about we have a look?

373
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,660
Okay?

374
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,860
What's wrong with buying it for you?

375
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,140
Marriage is the foundation of marriage, right?

376
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,860
Besides, our eight-pack has money.

377
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,820
You can choose as you like.

378
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,180
We've been busy the past few days.

379
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,340
I have to get it done today.

380
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:50,900
That's it.

381
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,460
Okay?

382
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,260
Yes.

383
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,260
Nanny, whatever you like,

384
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,900
whatever I buy for you,

385
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,740
don't think it's expensive.

386
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,780
Right.

387
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,060
Nanny is rare.

388
00:17:59,060 --> 00:17:59,860
She's not a lucky girl.

389
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,860
Nanny.

390
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,340
I was just embarrassed to say

391
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,380
that these designs are quite old-fashioned.

392
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,860
Now they can be customized for customers online.

393
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,420
Nanny also hopes that

394
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,260
our wedding will be unique.

395
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,620
Of course.

396
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,540
Just put them away.

397
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:17,460
We'll see.

398
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:32,500
Let's postpone our wedding.

399
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,660
What do you mean?

400
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,620
I haven't figured out my mom's situation yet.

401
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,380
I don't have the mood for it now.

402
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,860
When I got the marriage certificate,

403
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,700
I didn't feel anything real about our marriage.

404
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,740
But now that Nannies are preparing for the wedding,

405
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,260
I started to feel

406
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,980
something about marriage.

407
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,940
I'm not sure if I can get married.

408
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:59,780
But now I'm getting

409
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,060
more and more real about marriage.

410
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,180
But I don't feel it that well.

411
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,300
I'm even a little scared.

412
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:13,940
I'm a little confused.

413
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,020
Ye Meng.

414
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,460
Do you regret it?

415
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,940
I'm going back.

416
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:31,020
Tao S accused her for telling the truth or for misunderstanding her.

417
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,700
But now she'sOf course, she's confused.

418
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,460
Because she refuses me every time she here.

419
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,660
Su Tony there.

420
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,620
I'm her!

421
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,940
No matter where I can find some inspiration or inspiration,

422
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:53,700
I can't help my uncle.

423
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,260
May the God of war with也可以

424
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Again?

425
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,260
Who did it?

426
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,260
Chen Jian.

427
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Why did he do this?

428
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,260
He must want to divorce me.

429
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,260
I'm the one who went the wrong way.

430
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
He can ask for more money.

431
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,260
Shameless.

432
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,260
How could he do this?

433
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
Look at this.

434
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,260
If Jiayu sees it,

435
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,260
how can he do it?

436
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,260
I'll help you.

437
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Don't worry.

438
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,260
It's okay.

439
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,260
Oh my god.

440
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,260
I'm so angry.

441
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,260
He can do anything.

442
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,260
What is this?

443
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,260
What's this?

444
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
When did you become

445
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,260
a celebrity?

446
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,260
You're so happy.

447
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Look at this.

448
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
It's a big explosion.

449
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
A big explosion.

450
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
I'm the only one.

451
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Open the clothing store.

452
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Why did he expose me?

453
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
I want to ask you.

454
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
What does it mean?

455
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
What's this?

456
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Look at my clothes.

457
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
They're so cold.

458
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
He took a picture of me

459
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
while I was there.

460
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
I'm so angry.

461
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
I'm so angry.

462
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Tell me the truth.

463
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Do you feel it?

464
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Don't mess it up.

465
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
How is it?

466
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Is it good?

467
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,260
How is it?

468
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,260
How?

469
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Get him.

470
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,100
That room.

471
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,140
I just thought about it.

472
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:02,220
We're both old.

473
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,620
If we get the illegal machine,

474
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,540
it won't look good.

475
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,220
You can't bear it if it's too much.

476
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,140
If something happens, I'll be in trouble.

477
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:13,300
Okay.

478
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,660
Give it to me.

479
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,420
Give me the phone.

480
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,460
The phone is inside.

481
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:22,780
Is it?

482
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,180
It's here.

483
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,220
Take this.

484
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,220
Let's go.

485
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:31,780
Go.

486
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,620
Go.

487
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,060
Why don't you go?

488
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,340
Let me see.

489
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:43,500
Look at it.

490
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,860
Okay.

491
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,500
Go.

492
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,100
Go.

493
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,340
Step aside.

494
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,260
I'll kill you.

495
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:54,940
What are you doing?

496
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,380
Are you crazy?

497
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,660
Don't make a scene.

498
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,380
I'll pay you.

499
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,660
Look.

500
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,260
This man is Chen Jian.

501
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,500
He's married.

502
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,540
He's rich and rich.

503
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,940
He even told me not to divorce him.

504
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,500
He threatened me with my son.

505
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,500
If he doesn't want to threaten me,

506
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,260
he can just report it to me downstairs

507
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,300
and slander me.

508
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,580
You said Cheng Tai Ran is my stepfather.

509
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,580
But you don't know what he's doing, do you?

510
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:16,940
You don't want to divorce him, do you?

511
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,660
Fine.

512
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,820
Let's just live like this.

513
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,340
I'll see if you can keep your mouth shut.

514
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,780
Step father, step daughter.

515
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,340
Fine.

516
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,300
I'll call the police first.

517
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,660
I'll catch you first.

518
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,820
Fine. Go to the police.

519
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,980
You're a scumbag.

520
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:30,340
If you're married, you'll be punished.

521
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,860
You'll be kicked out.

522
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,460
You should have died.

523
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,460
We'll talk about it later.

524
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,340
I'll go first.

525
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,340
No, Zhao Ge.

526
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,780
Zhao Ge is crazy.

527
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,380
Ignore him.

528
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,140
Zhao Ge.

529
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,580
Zhao Ge, don't be ridiculous.

530
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,620
He's crazy.

531
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,020
I don't know when he'll come back.

532
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,780
Is it recorded?

533
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,300
It's all recorded.

534
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:49,980
It's in the box.

535
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:50,580
Okay.

536
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,100
How do you feel?

537
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,140
I'm dizzy.

538
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,780
I'm so happy.

539
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,540
Look at her.

540
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,300
So cool.

541
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,900
I'm sorry.

542
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,220
We were a little impulsive today.

543
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,100
I'm sorry.

544
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,780
No, you're busy.

545
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,980
Don't do it here.

546
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,820
Look at what my package looks like.

547
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,100
I have to do business.

548
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,820
I'm so sorry.

549
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,220
I've caused you trouble.

550
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:14,740
Yes.

551
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,220
You can clean it up.

552
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:16,340
Let's go back and review it.

553
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,060
I'll give you a chance.

554
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,460
You two

555
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,780
can go home and discuss it.

556
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,100
Who are you talking to?

557
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,700
I'm done.

558
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,820
You're so nosy.

559
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,820
Be careful.

560
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
You're annoying.

561
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,140
No.

562
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,580
You're so clumsy.

563
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,140
Look where you're going.

564
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,220
No.

565
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,740
How can she be so cowardly?

566
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,420
She's so cowardly.

567
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,940
You're so cowardly.

568
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,900
How can you be so cowardly?

569
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:55,220
I don't want to see it again.

570
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,260
I'm so sick of it.

571
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,420
Without men,

572
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,660
we would be happier.

573
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,020
Come on.

574
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:00,780
That's right.

575
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,220
Why

576
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,980
were we so happy when we were kids?

577
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,180
We were so happy all the time.

578
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,540
Now that we're grown up,

579
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,780
we seem to have more and more things.

580
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,540
But

581
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,780
we're really less and less happy.

582
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:26,660
Right?

583
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,860
It's not that we've changed.

584
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,300
It's that we've been through more and more things.

585
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,380
So

586
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,660
we're getting smaller.

587
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,820
It's not uncomfortable. Come on.

588
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,260
I wish us two

589
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:52,140
a better future.

590
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,260
A better future.

591
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,900
I'll drink it up.

592
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:58,540
Cheers.

593
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,100
Tell me.

594
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,940
Why did you bring the wine here today?

595
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,780
Something's wrong.

596
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,660
Did Li Jingyu

597
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,500
make you angry again?

598
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,980
She...

599
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,860
Sometimes I think

600
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,060
she's even more horrible than Chen Jianan.

601
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,260
You're...

602
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,260
How is that possible?

603
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,180
Who can be more horrible than a family violence

604
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,780
and cheating?

605
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,140
What's the matter?

606
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:37,780
Tell me.

607
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,460
I'll listen to you.

608
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
She cheated me.

609
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,580
You...

610
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,020
But I don't know why.

611
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,340
I still want to believe her.

612
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,020
Do you think I have a kidney disease?

613
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:02,220
Do I have a kidney disease?

614
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,460
No, you don't.

615
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,260
You didn't treat others like that before.

616
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,540
Tell me.

617
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,620
You...

618
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,220
You...

619
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:12,860
You...

620
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,460
You...

621
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,100
You...

622
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:14,700
You...

623
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,260
You...

624
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,300
I don't know.

625
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,820
I'm so confused.

626
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,380
No, no.

627
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,540
Let's stop talking.

628
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,140
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

629
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:25,660
Okay.

630
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,820
You can tell me when you want to.

631
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,140
Remember, Ye Meng.

632
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,300
Do whatever you want.

633
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,100
No matter what happens,

634
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,980
no matter what decision you make,

635
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,940
I, Fang Ya'en, will always listen to you.

636
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:42,980
Okay.

637
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,500
Okay.

638
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:45,340
Okay.

639
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:51,820
Come on.

640
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:54,620
Drink it.

641
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
I don't care.

642
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,380
You're too drunk.

643
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,420
I'll carry you home.

644
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,500
You said it.

645
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,500
Hurry up.

646
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,420
Hurry up.

647
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,940
Come on.

648
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:25,780
Are...

649
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,220
Are...

650
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,420
Are you drunk?

651
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,540
Come on.

652
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:43,780
Take a look.

653
00:29:43,780 --> 00:30:06,580
よろしく Luxury

654
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:09,780
Living in a man's life,

655
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,460
even if he don't have a woman,

656
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,500
he should live just like a human being.

657
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,780
Come on, sit down.

658
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,220
Women are really cruel.

659
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,340
Are you talking about Fang Xiao En or Ye Meng?

660
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,340
Both.

661
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Sometimes I really don't understand

662
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,340
what's going on in this world.

663
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:36,940
Or what they're thinking.

664
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,140
So I asked her out to get yourself some sleep.

665
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:56,400
White knots are more visible when you sleep.

666
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,780
I want to talk to her.

667
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,700
Sorry.

668
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,700
and be a part of it?

669
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,820
Sure.

670
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,740
I don't know what happened to you,

671
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,620
but I'm afraid it'll be a big problem

672
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,180
if you're late.

673
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,740
Just tell me what you need

674
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,260
or what you need our help with.

675
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:25,460
Give me a few days off.

676
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:35,780
That's fine.

677
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,340
Y bei.

678
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,500
Y bei.

679
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,100
Thanks.

680
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:01,820
Ask me anything.

681
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:03,480
Still the same.

682
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,540
I even had a long night with 86 friends,

683
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,440
you know.

684
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,260
What about Lanka?

685
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,540
Why is it just you and me?

686
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,220
Come on, you speak too much.

687
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,220
Only you know we are apart.

688
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,480
Don't talk methodically at back room.

689
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,920
I know you said that,

690
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,100
but I am really very rubbing Leonaudience.

691
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,380
You have a funky ability in my eyes.

692
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,680
I really love him at that time.

693
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,420
We're still not happy with the thing you said.

694
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,260
This can only be my agreement,

695
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,500
right?

696
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,620
You had gone to see Mr. Wang that day too.

697
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
Still, you deleted the video,

698
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,020
Bye.

699
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,660
But now I'm tired.

700
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,940
If our relationship

701
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:11,060
is full of hidden and deceit,

702
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,220
there's no need to exist.

703
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:25,900
Ye Meng.

704
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:29,980
I...

705
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,540
Aren't you afraid that I'll take your bait

706
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,860
and get you bad evidence?

707
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,220
Actually, we didn't

708
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,860
have to be like this.

709
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,580
You know me best.

710
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,300
Give me what I want.

711
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,020
Don't bother me anymore.

712
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:01,220
Li Jian Yun.

713
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,460
You're so sick now.

714
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:05,900
You don't have the power to take the power.

715
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,900
Give it to me.

716
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,580
I'll keep it for you.

717
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,820
Li Jian Yun.

718
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,860
What do you want?

719
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,420
I want to get back what belongs to me.

720
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,660
The equity agreement you asked me to sign

721
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,300
is about to come.

722
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,260
I want to get back

723
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,060
15% of the equity of my company.

724
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,140
Hello?

725
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,020
Hello, Ye Meng.

726
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,740
I've been keeping an eye on

727
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:04,140
Wang Xing Sheng's whereabouts for the past two days.

728
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,140
I didn't find him.

729
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,180
But I found out yesterday

730
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,540
that your mother's confidant.

731
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,300
Do you know that

732
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,940
there's actually a witness in this case?

733
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,340
Witness?

734
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,540
Your mother committed suicide.

735
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,220
Someone saw her in the wine shop.

736
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,340
She said she was sitting in a car.

737
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,860
And there was another man in the car.

738
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,020
That person should be Wang Xing Sheng.

739
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,940
Why didn't anyone tell me?

740
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,860
I don't know.

741
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,900
I just know that

742
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,380
she's not the one who killed him.

743
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,260
I don't know.

744
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,580
Why didn't anyone tell me?

745
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Because she...

746
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,780
She went to work again.

747
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,860
She said she was in a car accident.

748
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:35,620
You...

749
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,180
Can you contact her?

750
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,020
I'll go find her.

751
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,220
No need.

752
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,140
I know her.

753
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,740
Isn't she a very small business?

754
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,820
That person is the one I told you about a few days ago.

755
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:46,900
Silly and sweet.

756
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,900
Li Jin Yu.

757
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,020
Who?

758
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,740
Li Jin Yu.

759
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,700
I mentioned her to you the other day.

760
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,540
You forgot about her.

761
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
It's not important.

762
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,380
What's important is that I know her.

763
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,900
Do you need me to ask her

764
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,900
what's going on?

765
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,420
Hello?

766
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,740
What's wrong with you?

767
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,500
I'm asking you if you need me to ask her

768
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,580
what's going on.

769
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,020
No need.

770
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,860
Don't tell her yet.

771
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Han Cai.

772
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Yan Meng.

773
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,060
Why didn't you tell me when you went back?

774
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,060
You followed me?

775
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,580
I heard from Taiming that the case of the mountain was deleted.

776
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,460
And then?

777
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
I didn't know.

778
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,460
I didn't know.

779
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
I didn't know.

780
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,460
I didn't know.

781
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,460
I didn't know.

782
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,620
Bye bye.

783
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
I'm sorry.

784
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,740
I didn't take time to meet Mr. Wang until now.

785
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:15,300
Now I've lost him,

786
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,380
I have a big responsibility.

787
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,940
But if you need me to look for him,

788
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,660
I can help you.

789
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,580
You helped me here?

790
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,820
How?

791
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,820
You know the Blue Bering's Hai Lan Gang project, right?

792
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,060
As long as you go back to the company,

793
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,900
you're the only one in charge of this project.

794
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,260
Why should I believe you?

795
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:35,180
I have no other choice.

796
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,860
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

797
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,500
Right?

798
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,220
Okay.

799
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:46,420
I'll join you.

800
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,380
Hello, do you have an appointment?

801
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,620
We're from the same field.

802
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,940
I just made an appointment with Mr. Li.

803
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,620
Okay, please register here.

804
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,500
I'll give you a card.

805
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,060
Go ahead, Mr. Gao.

806
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:04,820
I'll register.

807
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,260
Did you see the message I sent you?

808
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,740
The fool is back.

809
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:32,060
Do you believe that you're back?

810
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,020
Mr. Gao, this way, please.

811
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:43,900
Mr. Li,

812
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,220
Mr. Gao and his team are here.

813
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,580
Mr. Li.

814
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:57,620
Gao Ke is here.

815
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,420
When did Jing Yu come back?

816
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,700
Just now.

817
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,300
I brought her here to familiarize with

818
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,260
the company's business.

819
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,620
Why are you here today?

820
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,140
I'm here to sign a contract

821
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,500
with Mr. Li to change the project of Hailang Port.

822
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,700
By the way, let me introduce you.

823
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,220
This is Ye Meng.

824
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,700
She's the one who's been working on the project.

825
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:22,700
She's the one who's been working on the project.

826
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,700
She's the one who's been working on the project.

827
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,700
She's the one who's been working on the project.

828
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,700
This is Ye Meng.

829
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,340
She's my most trusted partner.

830
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,940
She's also the person in charge of our project.

831
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,380
Hello, Mr. Li.

832
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,500
Hello.

833
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,580
You're young and promising.

834
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,300
Thank you.

835
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,020
This is Mr. Li from Hailang Port Group.

836
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,820
Li Jing Yu.

837
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:42,940
What Mr. Li?

838
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,580
They're just friends.

839
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,900
Hello, Mr. Li.

840
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,780
Hello.

841
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,660
Please go ahead.

842
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:58,180
We'll go to the meeting room to prepare.

843
00:41:58,580 --> 00:41:59,820
Okay, take them there.

844
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,660
Okay.

845
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,380
See you later.

846
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:01,820
See you later.

847
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,780
This way, please.

848
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:03,820
Sister Yilu.

849
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,500
Don't worry, Mr. Li.

850
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,980
We'll definitely make her disappointed.

851
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:35,780
I think you're getting more and more thorough in your work.

852
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,180
The company is also developing so fast.

853
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,780
Jin Yu, go pick up more people.

854
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,780
I know, Director Li.

855
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:45,780
That's because you trust our company and are willing to give us a chance.

856
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
Jin Yu just returned to the company.

857
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:50,580
Ye Meng and I have to learn from him.

858
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,380
You're capable and humble.

859
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,780
I'm really relieved to hand this project to you.

860
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,780
There's a celebration party tonight. Everyone, come.

861
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,780
Okay.

862
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,780
Come to my office later.

863
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:17,780
You're back to the company?

864
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,780
Didn't you tell me before that you would never go back?

865
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,780
Is there a problem?

866
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,780
Didn't you also return to Ji Cheng's family business?

867
00:43:25,780 --> 00:43:27,780
You even pretended not to know.

868
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,780
You

869
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:05,780
I saw you

870
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,780
I thought of you

871
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:14,780
I heard any news from you

872
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:20,780
The love that's been reflected in my heart

873
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:25,780
It occupies my mind

874
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
Go

875
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,780
Where to go

876
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,780
How to avoid

877
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:40,780
Those memories about you

878
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:51,780
I want to be far away, but I can't get you to leave

879
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:54,780
I silence this page

880
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,780
Put the flowers in the back

881
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:03,780
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

882
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,780
I pretend to be firm

883
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:13,780
But I'm still obsessed with the source

884
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,780
The most perfect lie

885
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:21,780
Deceive yourself

886
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:27,780
If love is to let go, let us lose the connection

887
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:33,780
Why is this moment of tears

888
00:45:33,780 --> 00:45:38,780
Heart still yearns

889
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:56,780
I'm still obsessed with the source

890
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,780
Why is this moment of tears

891
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:04,780
Heart still yearns
