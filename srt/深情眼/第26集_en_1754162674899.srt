YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Unable to hide the promise

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one loves you more

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
In fact, it has never changed

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that dream of mine

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Brother

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
This is the small villa you told me about

19
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Is this the old house in the village?

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You lie to me

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You think too much

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You don't live here, you live over there

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Grandma, your grandson is here

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
coming

25
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
coming

26
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
My little brother

27
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Grandma misses you so much

28
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Grandma cleaned up that room

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
All toys

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Look at this rabbit

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Three-eyed

32
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Grandma killed him at night

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll make you a good soup

34
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Look at him, he's thin

35
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Just like a little monkey

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You are dirty

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I don't eat this

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Still dirty

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Little rabbit

40
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
What do you do

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
What's wrong with you

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Love to eat

43
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
sit down

44
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Go home

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Go home with grandma

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Go home with grandma

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What else do you eat?

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Brother

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
When will mom take me back?

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Don't like it here

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But it's also

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
When I first came

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm not used to it than you

54
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Really

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Then you also think grandma is fierce

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
She treats me more fierce than she treats you

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I was beaten by her

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
But she is

59
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's a bear on the mouth

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Actually, Cindy

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Loves us more than anyone

62
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
For you

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She just got out of the hospital

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I'll clean up the room for you

65
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I also learned your favorite dishes

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Before I kept urging me

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
When will I pick you up

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
But I still miss mom

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Although she made a mistake

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
She misses you too

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
But now

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
You have grandma

73
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And I have a brother

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Don't worry

75
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
We will be good to you

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But it doesn't matter

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Take your time

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Dad is here

79
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Zhuangzhuang

80
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
What are you doing

81
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Come back and eat

82
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
coming

83
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Hurry up

84
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let's go

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How's your brother?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Are you used to it?

87
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
OK

88
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Much faster than I was

89
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
What are you looking at

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
So happy

91
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'll show you something

92
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Look, look

93
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Look, this little cat is so cute

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Let's buy a German one

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Very beautiful and sticky

96
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Sticky

97
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
The key is that it doesn't get hairy

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
No

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
why

100
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
We are safe

101
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If you keep a cat

102
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It will be jealous

103
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ping An doesn't take care of it every day

104
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What is he jealous of

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You don't want to raise it

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Just say you don't want to raise it

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
And use Ping An as a shield

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It seems that you are too dedicated to Ping An

109
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm not in my heart

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are a big step

111
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It was you who said you wanted to raise a cat

112
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Not dedicated

113
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Are you jealous of a cat?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm married to you

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Li Jinyu

116
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Then I don't care

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
OK, OK, OK

118
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Then some other day

119
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Have time to go to the cat

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
That's right

121
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Pull the hook

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Pull the hook

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Pull

124
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look again

125
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So cute, look

126
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Not as cute as Ping An

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm the most beautiful

128
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You are beautiful

129
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Finally, let's entangle our wrists

130
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
This must be tight

131
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
That's it

132
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Before we officially learn boxing

133
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
We have to protect our body

134
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
The wrist must be locked

135
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Like this

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes, close to yourself

137
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Like this

138
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Yes, close to your own two three

139
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then two arms

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The first step is to stick your ribs

141
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Right?

142
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Yes

143
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
In case others hit you on both sides

144
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
And these two sides

145
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
OK, let's go to class today

146
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Ok

147
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Come on

148
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll take you home

149
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
No need

150
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
My mom will come to pick me up later

151
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Your mom is coming

152
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Jinyu

153
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mom

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That one

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Come to pick up Jinyu

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
You changed this into a restaurant

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
How is it?

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Business is good, right?

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
All some old customers

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's okay

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll pack up and we'll go

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
it is good

163
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Xiaocheng

164
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Why don't you answer the phone?

165
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I finally found you

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Sister Liu

167
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Ranran is also here

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Tomorrow noon

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
We have an appointment for a blind date

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Brother Kai, are you going to a blind date?

171
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
No, I don't know

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
What kind of blind date?

173
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
What kind of blind date?

174
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Your mom made it for me

175
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Besides

176
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Last time in your sister's store

177
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Didn't you also have the idea

178
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Introduce a girlfriend to you?

179
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I tell you

180
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This girl is very good

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's not a loss to go to see her

182
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You are right

183
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No, I

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yaonan

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You help me persuade

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your brother is shy

187
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I, my mom

188
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Right

189
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Right

190
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
See you

191
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Don't miss it

192
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Yes

193
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
What are you embarrassed about?

194
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Besides

195
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Your family has filled the card for you

196
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I tell you

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Your sister, I am

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But there are professional brewers

199
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Unlike those who only take money

200
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
A marriage that doesn't work

201
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
What is she?

202
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Yes

203
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Sister Liu is very reliable

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Let's go, Jiayi

205
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Mom, let's go

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'm leaving first

207
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
it is good

208
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Bye bye

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
No, my mom

210
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Didn't you tell me anything?

211
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Your mom filled the card for you

212
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
OK, I tell you

213
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Chaoxi restaurant tomorrow noon

214
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Don't be late

215
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Did you hear

216
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't be late

217
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Jiayu

218
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
You

219
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Go go go

220
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Don't be late

221
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
it is good

222
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
OK, I'm leaving

223
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't be late

224
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
it is good

225
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Goodbye, Sister Liu

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Mom, that one

227
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
There is a person called Sister Liu

228
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
What do you say

229
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You arrange a blind date for the people

230
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hello, Miss Fang who has seen it

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Please come in

232
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I also eat this restaurant

233
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why did you suddenly come here?

234
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I found it

235
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Dessert and shop

236
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Brother Kai, what a coincidence

237
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Sorry

238
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What a coincidence

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Friend

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
This

241
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
My parents said

242
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Know each other

243
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Blind date

244
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
No no

245
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Then you eat quickly

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We two are not at the shop

247
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Go quickly

248
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Hurry up

249
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
You order, Jiayu

250
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Thank you

251
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Then I'll take one

252
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Fried chicken wings

253
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
And potato salad

254
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Then this is called

255
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What is the autumn fish

256
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Sorry

257
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm drunk

258
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
It's okay

259
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
My situation

260
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Sister Liu, I told you everything

261
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Drink a vanilla milk tea

262
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then come again

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Apple cake

264
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Give

265
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
it is good

266
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Just introduce our blind date

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
That wedding ring, Sister Liu

268
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Didn't she tell you

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Is it that between parents

270
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
They communicated this

271
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Then I'll do it myself

272
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I am a teacher

273
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
My parents are teachers

274
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I have only one child in our family

275
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I have a car and a house

276
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I just want to find a condition in Ningcui

277
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Almost

278
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Hello Chen Jiayu

279
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Did you deliberately

280
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Bring me to this restaurant

281
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I didn't

282
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
How can you think so

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Your son

284
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
How can my son

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Call his mother so heartily

286
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
How can my mother

287
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
How can you be so ungrateful

288
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I said you

289
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What do you think of me

290
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Pretty good

291
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I also think it's quite suitable

292
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Exterior height

293
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
The economic conditions are good

294
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
It's rare to come out to a blind date

295
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I met a positive one

296
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Since we both think it's good

297
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Then try to get along

298
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You

299
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Try to end it

300
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
or

301
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Don't

302
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Not your problem

303
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
It's my problem

304
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I

305
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Have a lover

306
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Although he never accepted me

307
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
But i don't want to give up

308
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Come to see you today

309
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I also want to talk to you

310
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Say clearly

311
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Apologize to you

312
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
it's ok

313
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
It's good to have someone you like.

314
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,920
You should have told me earlier

315
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,960
in case he misunderstands.

316
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,720
Today, let's pretend to be friends.

317
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,000
Here.

318
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,960
I wish you success in your new dream

319
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,440
and success in your pursuit of love.

320
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,960
I wish you all the best.

321
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,600
Thank you for your understanding.

322
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,280
By the way,

323
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,560
I have a restaurant

324
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,720
on the beach.

325
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,640
You can take your little sister

326
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,800
to eat there.

327
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,520
Sure.

328
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,320
I will.

329
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,560
What are you doing?

330
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,720
I'm taking two photos for you.

331
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,200
The environment here is quite good.

332
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,520
Wait for me to pose.

333
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm cute.

334
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,040
No, no, no.

335
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,840
You're taking a photo outside.

336
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,800
The light is not good.

337
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,400
Mom,

338
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,600
I have something to tell you.

339
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,600
I'm sorry.

340
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,640
I'm sorry.

341
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
I have something to tell you.

342
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,320
I didn't want to tell you.

343
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,480
Because this is the secret

344
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
between me and Kai.

345
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,880
What is it?

346
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,600
Do you remember the last time

347
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,560
I fought at school?

348
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
Why not?

349
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,840
Actually,

350
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,120
they said bad things about you and Kai behind my back.

351
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,880
Otherwise, I wouldn't have done it.

352
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,960
Why didn't you tell him?

353
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,680
I didn't want you to blame yourself.

354
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,800
Kai is like that.

355
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,600
Eat it.

356
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
Don't let it get cold.

357
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,480
I never thought

358
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,960
there was anything bad

359
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,400
between you and Kai.

360
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,920
I'm happy

361
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,280
because there is one more person

362
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,960
who can protect you with me.

363
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,360
I see.

364
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
Hello, Mengmeng.

365
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,800
Where are you, baby?

366
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,680
I'm busy this afternoon.

367
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,880
I'm having lunch with Jiayu.

368
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,080
It's okay, Mengmeng.

369
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,760
You can go to the library with your godmother this afternoon.

370
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
I asked Wang Sisi to go to the library.

371
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,040
Okay, I'm free now.

372
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,920
Where are you?

373
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,600
See you at the cafe.

374
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,400
Okay.

375
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,680
What are you doing?

376
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,040
You're so angry.

377
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,120
Did you have a fight with someone?

378
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,440
Li Jinyu.

379
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,360
What's wrong?

380
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,440
He's learned to let me go.

381
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,920
Last night, we agreed

382
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,280
to raise cats in the cat room.

383
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:34,240
Now he's pretending to be busy with me.

384
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,960
I think he just doesn't want me to raise cats.

385
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
You two are arguing.

386
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,760
And you're flirting.

387
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
We're flirting.

388
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:45,520
But I really think

389
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,640
we're in the marriage zone.

390
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,880
You two?

391
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,840
How is that possible?

392
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,880
You two want to be together for 24 hours.

393
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,080
But you have to share a place

394
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,800
if you're more than 100 meters away.

395
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,480
It's not that exaggerated.

396
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,520
Let's just have a little romance.

397
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,640
But I have to tell you clearly.

398
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,720
What do you mean?

399
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,200
Li Jinzhen.

400
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:29,760
You're in bad mood today.

401
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,560
What's wrong with you?

402
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:32,480
Am I?

403
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:33,880
Nothing.

404
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,280
What is the relationship betweenМ me and this date?

405
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,240
A date?

406
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
Who's getting yelled at?

407
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,120
Chen Ka Flag's behind the scene of you going on a blind date?

408
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,640
Watch your words.

409
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,280
Mutual theorem

410
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,240
What do you mean behind my back?

411
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,560
What's my relationship with her?

412
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,760
What's the relationship?

413
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,280
Besides, it's a good thing

414
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,560
to have a blind date.

415
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,640
As a sister,

416
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,920
I should be blessing you.

417
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,560
Right.

418
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,840
And the girl is pretty.

419
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,840
I think she's pretty.

420
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:02,840
Who?

421
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,760
The girl in our town?

422
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,440
Do I know her?

423
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,480
I don't know her.

424
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,520
See if you know her.

425
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,000
She used to take a brick

426
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,120
to open a plough for the little rascal.

427
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,360
Now she's learned to take photos secretly.

428
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,040
She's a paparazzi.

429
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,400
What?

430
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,040
What do you mean?

431
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Give it to me.

432
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,520
I was taking photos for Jiayu.

433
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,480
And I brought it to her.

434
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
Give it to me.

435
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,120
Something's wrong with you.

436
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,200
You're so weird.

437
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,960
How?

438
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,520
You're so weird.

439
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:39,760
Am I?

440
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
Tell me the truth.

441
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,760
Have you been hiding from Kai Kai recently?

442
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,720
Why didn't you go to the restaurant

443
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,680
when the jewelry store was open?

444
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
I had something to do.

445
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,920
I didn't hide.

446
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,720
Fang Ya'en.

447
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,760
You should learn from me sometimes.

448
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:01,880
Look.

449
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,400
Li Junyu and I

450
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,000
were quite impulsive at first.

451
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,640
But we've become a good couple.

452
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,280
Don't be afraid of the police

453
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,000
for ten years.

454
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,760
If you like it,

455
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,800
just try it.

456
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,840
I'm so annoyed.

457
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,960
You look so innocent.

458
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,160
Are you shy?

459
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,560
No, I'm not.

460
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,280
I'm really...

461
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,240
Honey.

462
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,720
You're back.

463
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,880
Come on, come and sit.

464
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,800
Are you tired today?

465
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,520
You're going home so late.

466
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,120
You put me on the spot

467
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,720
and took me home at this time.

468
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,600
You don't want to see me, do you?

469
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
No.

470
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,600
I was wrong.

471
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,400
I didn't.

472
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,480
I don't want you to keep a cat

473
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,840
because you look at the cat's eyes

474
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,840
brighter than mine.

475
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,080
Why are you so close to a pet?

476
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,400
Do you think

477
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,000
you're a pet?

478
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:31,680
Don't look at me like that.

479
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,800
You're really like a big cat.

480
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,160
Don't think that

481
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,000
it can distract me.

482
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,760
I think you and I

483
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,320
are in the period of marriage.

484
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,280
Period of marriage?

485
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,880
What's the word?

486
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,000
Period of marriage.

487
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,520
I can't even look at you.

488
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,200
Then I'll show you

489
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,720
what period of marriage is.

490
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,640
What are you doing?

491
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,920
Who believes in period of marriage?

492
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,360
You're sick of seeing me, right?

493
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,720
No, no.

494
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,920
I'm really sick of it now.

495
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,800
Really?

496
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,080
Really?

497
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,560
Why did you buy so much?

498
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,120
I'm worried that it's not accurate.

499
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:36,920
You still don't understand?

500
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,040
It's written on it.

501
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,960
It's just a matter of one bar, two bars.

502
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,960
C'mon, let's get it on the internet.

503
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,920
Know you've seen the pictures.

504
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,840
Why didn't you speak?

505
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,760
When did you

506
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,520
start to see that辩onds?

507
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
Yes.

508
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,720
How... how is it?

509
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:41,320
If you have a baby, you will be a good father.

510
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:44,520
I will try to be a good father.

511
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,920
Congratulations on your promotion.

512
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,720
You are so excited. Is the baby okay?

513
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,520
The baby is fine. I am dizzy.

514
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,120
I am going to be a father.

515
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,720
You are so mean.

516
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,120
Come on. From now on, you can't move around.

517
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,720
You have to lie down.

518
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,920
Be careful.

519
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,920
I haven't taken off my shoes.

520
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,920
I will take them off.

521
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,120
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

522
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,920
Check. Check.

523
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,120
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?

524
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Hello? Come on.

525
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
Come on. Give it to me.

526
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,720
Slow down.

527
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:40,520
Don't be so weird. I can't even hold the wine.

528
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,320
Listen. You are pregnant.

529
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,520
You have to be careful. Don't be so hard on yourself.

530
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,320
I know.

531
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,520
Sit down. Tell us what you want to do.

532
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,320
You can't move at all.

533
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,520
Come on. Let's take a break.

534
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,320
Come on. Let's go.

535
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,920
I called you here today

536
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,520
because I have good news to announce to you.

537
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Come here, Jiayu.

538
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,920
Let's listen to the good news.

539
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:10,320
Mai has got the admission certificate of Jiangbei Music College.

540
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,920
She has got it.

541
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Good job.

542
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,120
Actually, the school can pay for the tuition.

543
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
But I have to pay for my own work.

544
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,920
Anyway, I, Qiao Mai,

545
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,720
have finally set foot on the path of pursuing my dream of music.

546
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,720
Thank you for your support.

547
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,320
Today, everyone, eat well and drink well.

548
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:32,120
I will definitely take the last position of the script writer and server.

549
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,120
That's great. Come on, Mai.

550
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
You are so good.

551
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
Good job.

552
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Good.

553
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Why are you so late?

554
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,520
I am so tired.

555
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,520
Forget it.

556
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:44,120
I have to come here.

557
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,120
I am here to check if I have got the admission certificate.

558
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,120
This place is normal.

559
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,920
There are no people and no special features.

560
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Okay.

561
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,920
I am leaving.

562
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:03,520
Stop acting.

563
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Do you have something to say to Ji Yun?

564
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:07,920
Yes.

565
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,520
You have to.

566
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
Come here.

567
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,720
I have been thinking about it.

568
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:21,520
I have my own mistakes.

569
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,320
I am not a little believer in go-kart.

570
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,520
Let bygones be bygones.

571
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Okay.

572
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:33,520
Come on.

573
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,320
This glass of wine is still a good friend.

574
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,320
If you drink it, you will be a good friend.

575
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,320
You don't take me to drink?

576
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,320
You are a man.

577
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,320
Look.

578
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,520
Acquisition.

579
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,120
If you have acquired it, you have to talk to me.

580
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,720
I have all the business card rights.

581
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,720
You don't have any special features here.

582
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,920
I don't have any special features.

583
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,120
Li Ji Yun.

584
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,120
The first row.

585
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,120
Man Man.

586
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I called you.

587
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,520
The future superstar.

588
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:15,720
You know?

589
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:19,120
I am going to make this restaurant a music restaurant.

590
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Guests can eat and listen to music.

591
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,520
It's called Live House.

592
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,720
You have heard of it, right?

593
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,920
It's called Live House.

594
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,120
It's a Chinese-style pronunciation.

595
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,720
Not bad.

596
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,720
I can invest in it.

597
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,720
But you lied to me before.

598
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,120
Perform a show.

599
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,520
Am I the boss here?

600
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,720
Why am I singing?

601
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,920
She is giving you a chance.

602
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,120
Women know women best.

603
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,520
This is really good.

604
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,720
Sing it.

605
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,120
Come on.

606
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,320
Give me a hand.

607
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,720
Sit down.

608
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:03,720
I will sing a love song for you.

609
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,720
Although this song is very touching,

610
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,720
when I first heard it,

611
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I thought it was because of the rhythm of the music

612
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,720
that my heart was beating fast.

613
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,720
But later I realized

614
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,720
that it was because

615
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
of the woman beside me.

616
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Which one?

617
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Wait.

618
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,720
Why is it...

619
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,720
This is so interesting.

620
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Wait.

621
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Wait.

622
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Chen Zhen'er, stop.

623
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
Stop.

624
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,720
Kai, sing.

625
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,720
I'm sorry.

626
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,720
I'm sorry.

627
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
I'm sorry.

628
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,720
I'm sorry.

629
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,720
I'm sorry.

630
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm sorry.

631
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,720
I'm sorry.

632
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,720
I'm sorry.

633
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,720
I'm sorry.

634
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm sorry.

635
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,720
I'm sorry.

636
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,720
I'm sorry.

637
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
I'm sorry.

638
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I'm sorry.

639
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
I'm sorry.

640
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,720
Stop.

641
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Stop.

642
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Why...

643
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
What's wrong?

644
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
You don't like this?

645
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,720
Get off.

646
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,720
I'm fine.

647
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,720
Ok?

648
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,720
Tell us again.

649
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
I don't like this.

650
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,200
What do you want to sing? Come on.

651
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,720
Come on. Why don't you sing?

652
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,920
You do it. You do it.

653
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:29,080
You're the lead singer. You have to sing with us.

654
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,040
Can you sing?

655
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,760
I can't.

656
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,640
Is my rhythm okay?

657
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,320
Does your throat hurt?

658
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,120
It's okay. It's okay.

659
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,280
Have some orange.

660
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:56,600
If you're not busy these days,

661
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,000
let's go have some coffee.

662
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,600
Go...

663
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,640
afternoon tea.

664
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,600
Which day?

665
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,000
What do you think about tomorrow?

666
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,800
Okay.

667
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:21,440
Good morning.

668
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,600
Morning.

669
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,600
Good morning.

670
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,200
Today is a miracle!

671
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,120
You say that your brakes are back.

672
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,240
K depend on castle building.

673
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,000
How to build?

674
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,360
Alter the brake lever.

675
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,720
Little browser.

676
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:42,920
WhileBT build a normal universalAreddar.

677
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,200
As a result,

678
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,200
I will be kept

679
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Please remember

680
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,200
Which one has my dream

681
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,200
When turning around and leaving

682
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:13,200
If time can go back to the road of farewell

683
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,200
I won't let go of your hand

684
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,200
The heart that can't be hidden

685
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,200
At the edge of time

686
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,200
When breathing gradually

687
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,200
Sit

688
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,200
Eat more, be safe

689
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,200
Don't be a father

690
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
I'm actually quite worried

691
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,200
We are the same

692
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,200
All abandoned

693
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
And then adopted

694
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,200
But I hope

695
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,200
He won't experience this

696
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I will work hard

697
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
Become a good father

698
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
I will be a good father

699
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,200
I will work hard

700
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,200
Become a good father

701
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,200
Let him have a good childhood

702
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,200
You will be an uncle in the future

703
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Take more care of the family

704
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,200
If the baby is not happy

705
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
You are responsible for the tail

706
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,200
If he wants to climb high

707
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,200
You are the meat shop

708
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,200
If he is a girl

709
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
He wants to be like his mother

710
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,200
To chase after boys

711
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,200
You will

712
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,200
Forget it

713
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,200
I will take care of this myself

714
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
In short

715
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,200
I only hope

716
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,200
He can be happy

717
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Be sure to help him grow up

718
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,200
Thank you

719
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,200
I said why today

720
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
Feed the dog for so long

721
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,200
It turned out to be here

722
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,200
Confess to the baby

723
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
Not only with the baby

724
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
Thank them

725
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Make me no longer lonely

726
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,200
What did you just say

727
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,200
What's the matter with girls chasing boys

728
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
I think it's pretty good

729
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,200
Otherwise, how can I be so beautiful

730
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,200
Right?

731
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,200
This thinking is fine

732
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
But if our child

733
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,200
Is a girl, no

734
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,200
You say another

735
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,200
Come in and rest

736
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,200
Come in

737
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,200
Mom

738
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,200
Your baby bought a gift

739
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,200
I'm waiting for you

740
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,200
Hurry up

741
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Thank you, I'm here

742
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,200
Don't let him go

743
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,200
You walk slowly

744
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,200
Don't worry, I'm fine

745
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,200
I'll wait for you in the third district

746
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
Why is this on the table as soon as it comes?

747
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,200
I'm embarrassed to get this

748
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,200
Come in quickly

749
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,200
My dad is waiting

750
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,200
Hurry up

751
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,200
Go

752
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,200
I don't know how to do it

753
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,200
I teach you

754
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,200
Can't you do it

755
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,200
Not impossible

756
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,200
I can't

757
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
Learn if you don't know

758
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,200
After you become a child's dad

759
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,200
This eighteen classes of martial arts

760
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,200
You have to know everything

761
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
understand

762
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,200
Don't look at this dry dumpling skin

763
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Simple

764
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
Actually

765
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,200
It's the easiest to handle

766
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,200
This is the same as our family

767
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,200
You have to maintain the happiness of the family

768
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,200
First of all, you have to use your strength right

769
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
As long as you use your strength right

770
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:03,200
This face is so beautiful

771
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
And willful

772
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,200
Dad teaches you

773
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:09,200
The dumpling skin you rolled is particularly willful

774
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,200
I put too much stuffing

775
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,200
Won't leak

776
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Let me tell you

777
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Uncle Ye

778
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:15,200
That one, take a break

779
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Drink some water

780
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
Don't just call your son-in-law

781
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
You also teach us

782
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
This

783
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:21,200
Yes, yes, yes

784
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,200
More stuffing

785
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Otherwise, it's all skin

786
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,200
Good

787
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Good

788
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:28,200
Stick it in the middle first

789
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,200
Correct

790
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Push in both sides

791
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Thank you dad

792
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
This back

793
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,200
Monthly meal, dumpling meal

794
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
You have to teach me more

795
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:44,200
You want to learn this too

796
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
Do you know

797
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:48,200
There are so many doors in here

798
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,200
You

799
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,200
Start from learning dumplings

800
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,200
Come and try

801
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,200
This is different from mine

802
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Come here

803
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
Brother, these dishes are all picked up

804
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Let's go out and play

805
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,200
What to play

806
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Go and wash some horseshoes

807
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
Your sister-in-law's favorite food is mushroom horse hoof stuffing

808
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,200
I don't even want to play with you

809
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
Let us help each other to work every day

810
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I knew it

811
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
I won't give you here

812
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,200
Keep it

813
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
Manman

814
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
When did you learn this

815
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I learned it last year

816
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,200
Thank you, sister-in-law

817
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,200
You are so good at this

818
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:30,200
Her fingers are not enough

819
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,200
And the toes

820
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,200
Grandma, I'm going to start school

821
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
I have to make some pocket money

822
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Don't worry, I have excellent skills

823
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,200
Grandma, don't worry

824
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Grandma, you choose one too

825
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
I'll make it for you later

826
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
This is a small pink pattern

827
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
With your red high heels

828
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
It's definitely suitable for me

829
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,200
You are not long enough

830
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,200
Grandma wants it to be longer

831
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Turn the night light

832
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,200
I have a long square in my hand

833
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
They all look dizzy

834
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
I can't

835
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,200
Just

836
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Put some fireflies on your nails

837
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
Ok, no problem

838
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
What do you know

839
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,200
Manman

840
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
You use this for grandma

841
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:05,200
This one, this one

842
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,940
French love,

843
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,200
I have to let my pet grandson

844
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
Feel in the womb

845
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,200
Her ancestors

846
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Demand aesthetic requirements

847
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Mengmeng

848
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,200
Don't forget to give me a pet grandson every night

849
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
This grandson

850
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,200
Langdusa is a ten-day master of the four-line poem in Biyang

851
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,200
Come on, we have a plan

852
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,200
To be the boss, right?

853
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Grandma

854
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
This kid is not yet

855
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,200
The yellow bean is too big

856
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,200
Are you thinking too far

857
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,200
No, the baby is called

858
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:41,200
Have to call from the baby

859
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
OK, let me teach him Chinese guocui

860
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Three hundred thousand

861
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,200
I'm red

862
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,200
I also have this one

863
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,200
I

864
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Double-thinking

865
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
Really

866
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,200
Of course

867
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,200
Really

868
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Who ordered

869
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,200
Mengmeng

870
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
It's the bubble packaging

871
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,200
How good

872
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,200
It's said that one month is three years

873
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,200
Really

874
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Our mom's brain was not good

875
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Now it's all absorbed by the baby in the belly

876
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Almost

877
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,200
Baobao

878
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,200
Although you follow our new hospital

879
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,200
But your brain

880
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,200
You have to follow your dad

881
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Can't follow your mother

882
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,200
This is uncomfortable

883
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,200
Come again

884
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Come again

885
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
You listen to the second aunt

886
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
Want the baby in the belly

887
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
You have to start replenishing in the pregnancy

888
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Just the second aunt has a batch here

889
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,200
The latest pregnant vitamin and fish oil

890
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,200
And the baby's DHA

891
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,200
Promote brain development

892
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,200
Thank you

893
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,200
Now I will send you the information

894
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,200
So good

895
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,200
Second sister

896
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,200
Your track is turning fast

897
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,200
Started selling mother-in-law products

898
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,200
You want to buy it before

899
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,200
The beauty products I sold

900
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,200
I ate it all

901
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,200
Be careful

902
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,200
You are in poor health now

903
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
What does it have to do with my product

904
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,200
I passed the national certification

905
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
Moreover, I am now

906
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,200
People sing the second and third child in the country

907
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,200
I am a big trend

908
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,200
What do you know

909
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,200
Yes yes yes

910
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
I understand now

911
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
Why are you with us today

912
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,200
Play mahjong

913
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Didn't go to that

914
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,200
What is Mr. Wang?

915
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,200
Mr. Li's birthday

916
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,200
The target client is here

917
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,200
Is it over, third

918
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:14,200
I'm doing this for Mr. Wang

919
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,200
What do you know

920
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,200
You are always arguing

921
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,200
I have no

922
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,200
Sit down sit down

923
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:19,200
Husband

924
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,200
The mother-in-law product sent by the second uncle

925
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,200
You take a good look

926
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,200
Okay

927
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,200
Already

928
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:29,200
Dad, I'm going to see mom

929
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,200
Stop being angry

930
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,200
How about the wife?

931
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,200
Tired

932
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,200
Not tired

933
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,200
I just started here

934
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I have to win her

935
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,200
I help you

936
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,200
Then your couple are united

937
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,200
If you lose later

938
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,200
Is it double?

939
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Can

940
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,200
Double

941
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,200
I also try to help you

942
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I help you

943
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
You two are really over

944
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,200
Who is the uncle?

945
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,200
Don't play

946
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:57,200
I help you

947
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,200
I help you

948
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,200
I have to call the husband

949
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Who is your master

950
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,200
Don't call

951
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Call me

952
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,200
You come

953
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,200
I don't have a big person

954
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,200
I help you

955
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,200
I help you

956
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,200
You two

957
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,200
I am not a woman

958
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,200
You come

959
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
You come

960
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,200
Everyone forget me

961
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,200
Come come come

962
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Come now you come

963
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,200
You come

964
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,200
You come

965
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,200
You two

966
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,200
You two

967
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,200

Don't play

970
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,200
Slow down

971
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,200
Don't pay so much attention

972
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,200
Come

I can't let it be

1037
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,200
more torn than the past

1038
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,700
Li Jinyuan

1039
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,240
I've long displayed

1040
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,200
a long-standing problem

1041
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:28,700
to ask you

1042
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,200
the moment

1043
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,200
we first met

1044
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,200
near your home

1045
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,200
you thought the I asked for your WeChat

1046
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,200
then who on earth

1047
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,200
are you calling

1048
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
I

1049
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,200
forgot

1050
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,200
not saying much

1051
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,200
how could guess

1052
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,200
have such a good memory

1053
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Actually, I didn't hit him.

1054
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
You didn't hit him?

1055
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,200
What happened to you?

1056
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,200
Did you get hurt?

1057
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:20,200
I have a bad feeling.

1058
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:22,200
I'll go to the hospital now.

1059
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
I'll go to the hospital now.

1060
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,200
I'll go to the hospital now.

1061
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,200
I'll go to the hospital now.

1062
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,200
I'll go to the hospital now.

1063
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,200
I'll go to the hospital now.

1064
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
How did it turn into a firewood stall?

1065
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
Wasn't it Nantang Xie Bao?

1066
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,200
Nantang Xie Bao moved out a long time ago.

1067
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,200
Do you know where he moved to?

1068
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,400
I was just watching you.

1069
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,040
Apparently

1070
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,520
what you've been trying to say

1071
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,760
has no prospects and potentials this time.

1072
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,800
As a townsman,

1073
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,880
my position in the political industry

1074
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,800
cannot be taken seriously.

1075
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:05,120
What's the sense of

1076
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,640
giving you sous-chef this time?

1077
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,520
But that is totally行作余手.

1078
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,800
Call someone or something.

1079
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,800
Li Jinyu.

1080
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,840
There's a saying.

1081
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,400
High-end hunters

1082
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,000
often appear as prey.

1083
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,720
You're really something.

1084
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,280
Ma'am, you regret it now?

1085
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,200
It's too late.

1086
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,120
No.

1087
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,000
Li Jinyu.

1088
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,120
I love you so much.

1089
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,480
The world loves you so much.

1090
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,520
Look at the clouds.

1091
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:43,760
Do they look like your eyes?

1092
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,480
Are you sure my eyes look like this?

1093
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,560
Yes.

1094
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,520
Did anyone tell you before

1095
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,760
that your eyes look like garbage cans?

1096
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,040
No.

1097
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,320
Actually,

1098
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,200
the world I saw before

1099
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:56,480
had no color.

1100
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,200
Until I saw you,

1101
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,000
I realized

1102
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,520
that my eyes can taste the sweetness of this world.

1103
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
For example,

1104
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,880
the sunset of the orange tree.

1105
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:07,720
I can feel the scent of orange.

1106
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,080
I can feel the scent of orange.

1107
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,080
I can feel the scent of orange.

1108
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,080
I can feel the scent of orange.

1109
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,560
And the man窿 of white bandsaw.

1110
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,880
That's enough.

1111
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,640
It'll be more sweet if we stay here any longer.

1112
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,920
Actually,

1113
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,080
from your eyes,

1114
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,840
I can still see something more.

1115
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:23,080
What's that?

1116
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,680
I can see your protection for family.

1117
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,920
And

1118
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:30,160
your passion for life.

1119
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,640
Anything else?

1120
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,960
And me.

1121
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,720
Who?

1122
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:36,920
Li Jinyu.

1123
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,080
I'm here.

1124
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I met you, I thought of you

1125
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:22,080
I heard any news from you

1126
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:28,080
The love that was reflected in my heart

1127
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:32,080
Enclosed my thoughts

1128
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:37,080
Go, where to go

1129
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:41,080
How to avoid

1130
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:46,080
Those memories about you

1131
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:57,080
I am so deep, but I can't get you out of my mind

1132
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:05,080
I am silent, putting the flowers in the back garden

1133
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:11,080
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

1134
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:20,080
Pretend to be firm, but still in the origin

1135
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:29,080
The most perfect lie, deceive yourself

1136
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:35,080
If love is letting go, let us lose the connection

1137
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,080
Why is this moment of tears

1138
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:46,080
Heart still remains

1139
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:04,080
The most perfect lie, deceive yourself

1140
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:11,080
If love is letting go, let us lose the connection
