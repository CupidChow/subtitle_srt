YoYo English Channel YouTube

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking, walking, forgetting

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The remaining memories are like fireworks burning and scattering

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
When I turn around and leave

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If the world can return to the intersection of farewell

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be kept

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath disappears at the edge of space

10
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I have everything

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I still love you

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually, it has never changed

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

14
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that my dream is always there

Episode 2

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Do you think everything is spinning here?

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I feel dizzy

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Why do I feel that this place is spinning?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Can you slow down?

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You are quite agile

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Are you drunk? Your face is so red

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
You are drunk

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Look at yourself

24
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Hello, I'm here

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm here

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Li Junyu

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You have a pair of deep eyes

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Very beautiful

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Hurry up and go inside

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ok

31
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Ok

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll find a place to open it

33
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Are you not going to open it?

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Stop it, you are drunk

35
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Go

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I told you to be strong

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What kind of alcohol do you drink when you are not drunk?

38
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm just a little bit of a return

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't go

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go

41
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Go

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm a little bit tired today

44
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Maybe another day

45
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Yang Shuang

46
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Jin Yu

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yang Shuang

48
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Jin Yu

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Yang Shuang, drink some water

50
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why are you so late?

51
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'm here to see you

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Come here

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
When I was a kid

54
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Ye Meng sent me a message

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He was in a hurry

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
He asked me to come and see a friend

57
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
How did you know each other?

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a long story

59
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A few years ago

60
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Our psychological counseling office

61
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
came to Ningcui for a public service lecture

62
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
At that time, the people in this town were very secretive

63
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
No one came to listen

64
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Only Ye Meng came every time he gave a lecture

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
And asked a lot of questions about depression

66
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Does she know about your past?

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
No

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
She just loves to be idle

69
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Unwilling to do anything

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I can't stop her

71
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I remember you came to Ningcui

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
A few girls like her

73
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You don't fall in love

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So I'm encouraging you to try to talk

75
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
By the way

76
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I heard your grandma tell me some time ago

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Found a girl in Jiangbei

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,400
I didn't expect you to be Xiao Meng

79
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,400
No

80
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
That's not a relationship

81
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,400
I met him just for my grandma's blind date

82
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
I think you are in good shape

83
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
It's not your fault

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
Don't blame yourself

85
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Anyway, as long as you don't mention him

86
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
it's easy to say

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Jinxue, do you know the white bear's smile?

88
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,400
The more people want to avoid things they don't want to mention

89
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
You don't have to be self-conscious

90
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I know it's not easy to forget the past

91
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,800
But don't worry

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
You don't have to avoid it

93
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
OK, if there's nothing else, I'll go back

94
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I'll see you off, uncle

95
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,800
No, no

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
If you don't want him to know about your past

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,800
I'll pretend I don't know you

98
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
See you, uncle

99
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
I'll go back

100
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,800
I'll go back

101
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I'll go back

102
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll go back

103
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
I'll go back

104
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I'll go back

105
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I'll go back

106
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I'll go back

107
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
I'll go back

108
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I'll go back

109
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I'll go back

110
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I'll go back

111
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
I'll go back

112
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,800
I'll go back

113
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,800
I'll go back

114
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,800
I'll go back

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:02,800
I'll go back

116
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,800
I'll go back

117
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,800
I'll go back

118
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
I'll go back

119
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
I'll go back

120
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I'll go back

121
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
I'll go back

122
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
I'll go back

123
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
I'll go back

124
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,800
I'll go back

125
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,800
I'll go back

126
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
I'll go back

127
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,800
I'll go back

128
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
Li Junyu

129
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Li Junyu

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,800
Li Junyu

131
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,800
I'm so sleepy

132
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,800
Thank you

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
Where's Zhao Yanshu?

134
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,800
He left

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
How is he?

136
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
He was my psychologist

137
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,800
I've been seeing him for years

138
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
But you

139
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
You don't have to see him

140
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
What's the matter?

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
Why are you asking yourself?

142
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
My grandma said my mom had depression

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,800
I just think

144
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,800
My mom is so cheerful

145
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,800
How can she have depression?

146
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
I just listened to a lot of Yang Shu's lectures

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:30,800
Li Junyu

148
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I know you think I'm very realistic

149
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,800
But I'm really afraid of you

150
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
Forget it

151
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,800
I just want to tell you

152
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
I hope you can open yourself

153
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,800
I'm used to it alone

154
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,800
In my past life

155
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,800
The worst time

156
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,800
I lived alone

157
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I've been through it alone

158
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,800
You have me now

159
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Look at me

160
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm stable, rich and fresh

161
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Think about it

162
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
What do you like about me?

163
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Just this face is enough

164
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,800
I'm the first person in my life

165
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,800
To be active and threatening

166
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Didn't you tell me

167
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,800
You wanted to ask the shopkeeper?

168
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,800
I didn't say anything

169
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,800
You'd better not annoy me

170
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
If I like someone

171
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,800
It won't change

172
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Really?

173
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Me too

174
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
You

175
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Are you still testing the evidence?

176
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
I shouldn't have let Yang Shu come

177
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
I just took you down

178
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,800
See the little water

179
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:02,800
Who is the principal?

180
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:04,800
You should thank me

181
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
For not taking advantage of others

182
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
Come on, you dare

183
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
What are you talking about?

184
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
It's still early

185
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
If I want to do something

186
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:19,800
There's still time

187
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Do whatever you want

188
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Anyway, it's not my fault

189
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:32,800
I'm sorry

190
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,800
Good night

191
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,800
It's quite deep

192
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I've been looking for you all night

193
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
You're here

194
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,800
What's up?

195
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
You're with Ye Meng?

196
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
What's the answer?

197
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,800
It's so important to you

198
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,800
You don't like me

199
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,800
But you want to show your affection to me

200
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
It's all for the sake of stimulating Ye Meng

201
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
You hate her so much

202
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,800
That's called very hate, okay?

203
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,800
From childhood to adult

204
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
My classmates like her more

205
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,800
The boys I like

206
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
They all like her

207
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
Even my parents

208
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
Say it all the time

209
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Look at Ye Meng

210
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,800
She's good-looking

211
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
I'm also very attractive, okay?

212
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
And I'm not bad-looking

213
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,800
Chen Ji dumped her a hundred thousand miles away

214
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,800
How could she become someone else's child?

215
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Maybe in her eyes

216
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,800
You're also someone else's child

217
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,800
Even so

218
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,800
I can't be with her

219
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
In a table for the rest of my life

220
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,800
We may hate each other for the rest of our lives

221
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:30,800
Sorry

222
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
I used you as a tool

223
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
We're still friends in the future

224
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,800
If you really like Ye Meng

225
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
I'll give you another advice

226
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,800
You must keep her in Ningcui

227
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,800
Don't let her go back to Jiangbei

228
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Ji Yu, you're here

229
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,800
He's here

230
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
Kite

231
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
I have something to tell you

232
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm going to Jiangbei

233
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
Go to Jiangbei

234
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Where are you going?

235
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,800
To see Li Lingbai

236
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,800
You went to find that woman

237
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,800
No, you don't know how to do it, do you?

238
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,800
I've bought the tickets

239
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
What do you think?

240
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
She seems to have a serious illness

241
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,800
She's dying

242
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
As her son

243
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,800
We have to go over and get a family property

244
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
I'll come back and raise you

245
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,800
Take you to eat delicious food and drink spicy food

246
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
Don't you always want to learn me to race and jump?

247
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
Let's take that world as the flying saucer

248
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,800
Where to stick, where to fly

249
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:24,800
I don't lack her money

250
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,800
I have money

251
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Stop being a laughing stock

252
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,800
What kind of attitude does she have?

253
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,800
You don't know

254
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,800
OK

255
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
Don't go anywhere

256
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,800
I won't stop you

257
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,800
When you land

258
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,800
Tell the doctor

259
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:44,800
I bought you a price insurance

260
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,800
If anything happens to you

261
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
I'll go to Li Pei

262
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Have a good year

263
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Don't even think about it

264
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I'll climb back before the Spring Festival

265
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,800
I'll climb back

266
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Eat fast

267
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Pour some oil first

268
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Then 125 ml of milk

269
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
And stir well

270
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,800
After that

271
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,800
We can add our flour

272
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,800
I said you are really good

273
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
My legs are just so busy

274
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Don't be tired

275
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Take a good picture of me

276
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:27,800
The homework of the home and school

277
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,800
Let's take a vlog

278
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,800
It's the power of love, okay?

279
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
OK, OK, OK

280
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,800
I'll take a thin face for you

281
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
45 degrees

282
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
OK, OK

283
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,800
Let me see

284
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
Here, take a look

285
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
How is it?

286
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
Good, good, good

287
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
Very good

288
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
Last night

289
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
You two drank

290
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
Went into the room

291
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
Nothing

292
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
This is a bit too uncooperative

293
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
City girls and girls

294
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm going to love

295
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
You two are too cooperative

296
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
They all said

297
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Women chase men, men kill

298
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
You two are all

299
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
One for one

300
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
Is it because you give him

301
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
Not enough hints

302
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Or he doesn't want to

303
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,800
If so

304
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
He's a bit too aggressive

305
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,800
I actually didn't want to

306
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,800
Do with him last night

307
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,800
Then why did you take others

308
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,800
To the room

309
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,800
You don't understand

310
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,800
You are really in the frame, sister

311
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,800
Don't say

312
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Good, good, good

313
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
You're done, Ye Meng

314
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Done

315
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Up

316
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:39,800
It's snowing

317
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,800
Where?

318
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Really?

319
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Really, really, hurry up

320
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
Be careful of your legs

321
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,800
It's snowing in Ningcui

322
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,800
I have to take a picture

323
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,800
I'm afraid

324
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,800
I'll fall down

325
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
You just asked me

326
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
Is it from Dong Zheng

327
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
I don't know

328
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
But my first reaction now

329
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,800
Is not to take pictures and post them on the web

330
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,800
What is it then

331
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm worried about the snow

332
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
Will Li Junyu bring an umbrella

333
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,800
Or will he fall

334
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
I don't know

335
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
You're like shooting an idol drama

336
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,800
You're really the same

337
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:53,800
But my first reaction now

338
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Is not to take pictures and post them on the web

339
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,800
What is it then

340
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm worried about the snow

341
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Will Li Junyu bring an umbrella

342
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,800
Or will he fall

343
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
Or will he fall

344
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:12,800
Where?

345
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,800
Hospital or home

346
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,800
Home

347
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,800
The snow is beautiful

348
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Are you cold?

349
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,800
Can you put the window on?

350
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,800
What do you know

351
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
This is romantic

352
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
It's the atmosphere

353
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:37,800
You're awake

354
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Li Junyu is going to celebrate his birthday

355
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,800
What do you think I'll give him

356
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:44,800
You don't have to give him anything

357
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Just give it to him yourself

358
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,800
Su, you say this every day

359
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
I don't have

360
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
I can't think about it

361
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
I'm not going to give it to you

362
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,800
I'm going to give it to you

363
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,800
I'm going to give it to you

364
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,800
I'm going to give it to you

365
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,800
I'm going to give it to you

366
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
I'm going to give it to you

367
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
I'm going to give it to you

368
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I can't think about it

369
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
You have a good power

370
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Teach me

371
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,800
Take it away

372
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,800
Don't you have it

373
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I don't want you to do it

374
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
I want me to do it

375
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,800
You don't understand the sense of ritual

376
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,800
OK, OK, OK

377
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
We don't understand

378
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
You are the people who came back from the big city

379
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,800
It's a sense of ritual

380
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,800
It's an atmosphere

381
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,800
I beg you, I beg you

382
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,800
I beg you, I beg you

383
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,800
You close the window first

384
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Why are you

385
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:24,800
fighting with this window

386
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,800
I don't understand

387
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
OK, I understand

388
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
Choose a color you like

389
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I don't believe you

390
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,800
You draw one first

391
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,800
Let me see what level you are

392
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
You draw it like this

393
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,800
Just like this

394
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,800
I was scared

395
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Just like this

396
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
Yes

397
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
It's good

398
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
Fang Yan

399
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
You are really good

400
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,800
You can do it yourself later

401
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,800
OK, OK, OK

402
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
I booked a ticket for you

403
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,800
The plane tomorrow morning

404
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
will let the driver pick you up

405
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,800
I may go to Jiangbei tomorrow

406
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,800
Come on

407
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:31,800
Hurry up

408
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
If Li Jun finds you

409
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,800
I'll be in trouble

410
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,800
No, sister

411
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
I am just

412
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,800
not able to stand up

413
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,800
You are so hard

414
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,800
to push me

415
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Sorry, sorry

416
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
I forgot about your leg

417
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,800
Come on, give me that

418
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
Give it to me

419
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,800
You see

420
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,800
You are a fireworks

421
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
and a cake

422
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
Aren't you afraid

423
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,800
your brother will get angry

424
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
and get angry

425
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
I'm not

426
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:50,800
I'm not

427
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,800
I'm not

428
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,800
I'm not

429
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
I'm not

430
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
I'm not

431
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:55,800
I'm not

432
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,800
I'm not

433
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm not

434
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
Aren't you afraid

435
00:21:58,800 --> 00:21:59,800
your brother will get angry

436
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
He has a good memory

437
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
and a good mouth

438
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,800
I don't want him to

439
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,800
say that

440
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,800
I made a cake

441
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,800
for his birthday

442
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:07,800
Give it to me

443
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,800
No, no

444
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
No, no

445
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Give it to me

446
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,800
It's okay

447
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
You are so considerate

448
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:13,800
Be careful

449
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,800
You two go out first

450
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Okay, Mr. Li

451
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,800
You have changed a lot

452
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,800
You are more and more

453
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
like a man

454
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:25,800
How is grandma

455
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,800
She broke her leg some time ago

456
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,800
She is in Fujian now

457
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:34,800
She is fine now

458
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Why didn't you

459
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
tell me about it

460
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
I know

461
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,800
you are still blaming me

462
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Those years

463
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I have let you down

464
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I have let your grandma down

465
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I have let you down

466
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,800
Why are you

467
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,800
sick all of a sudden

468
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Help me

469
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
I have lived here

470
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:17,800
for more than half a year

471
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I often had nightmares

472
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I dreamed

473
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,800
of a storm

474
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:30,800
You held my hand

475
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,800
and cried and shouted

476
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:33,800
and said

477
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,800
Mom, don't drive me away

478
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,800
Don't drive me away

479
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Now I think

480
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,800
I should call you

481
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I have checked the information

482
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,800
on my way

483
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,800
I need to do a physical examination first

484
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:03,800
and then do a bone marrow transplant

485
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,800
Are you willing

486
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,800
to donate your bone marrow to me

487
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
You came to me

488
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
just for this

489
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,800
The process is more complicated

490
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
It takes you a few days

491
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
to get here

492
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I will have someone

493
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
to move you to the hospital

494
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
to do the procedure

495
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,800
Mom, why are you at home

496
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Where is your brother

497
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
He is not here

498
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
I am feeding him

499
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Where did he go

500
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,800
He went to Jiangbei

501
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,800
He went to Jiangbei

502
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:05,800
so suddenly

503
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
He went to the blood bank

504
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Blood blood

505
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,800
No

506
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,800
I heard from grandma

507
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:12,800
that his mom was seriously ill

508
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,800
We don't know what disease she had

509
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Anyway, it is said that

510
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,800
it is a life-threatening disease

511
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:17,800
and she had to go to China

512
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
I am not sure

513
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I am not sure

514
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,800
I heard that it is a life-threatening disease

515
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,800
and she had to donate her bone marrow to me

516
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:26,800
That woman is afraid of death

517
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:27,800
and she knows that she has a son

518
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,800
My brother is stupid

519
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,800
When she heard that her mom was ill

520
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,800
she went to Jiangbei without saying anything

521
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
I guess

522
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
she still has hope for that woman

523
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,800
My brother is going to celebrate his birthday

524
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,800
He is going to celebrate his birthday

525
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
I guess he still thinks

526
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,800
that his mom can celebrate his birthday

527
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,800
I heard that Jun Gu was very sick

528
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,800
He is all alone now

529
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
There is no one around him

530
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,800
who can ask him if he is sick

531
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,800
It is so pitiful

532
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Hello

533
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,800

Jun Yu

568
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,800
Pull over

569
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,800
Mom

570
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
I want to ask you a question

571
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,800
Ask away

572
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,800
I am not your biological son.

573
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Fang Fang, you know you are the biggest hero in my heart.

574
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Super big hero.

575
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:53,800
I know you.

576
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
You can do it.

577
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
I believe you.

578
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,800
I know you are a very good kid.

579
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
I will be with you.

580
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
Don't be afraid.

581
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
I will be with you.

582
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,800
Hello. I want to find a patient named Li Jin Yu.

583
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
May I ask which room she is in?

584
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
Wait a minute. I will help you find her.

585
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
B39.

586
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Thank you.

587
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,800
It hurts.

588
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,800
What?

589
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,800
It hurts.

590
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,800
I am here.

591
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,800
I am here.

592
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Don't be sad.

593
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:34,800
That's why I choose silence.

594
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Hold me.

595
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Let time set a blinding outline.

596
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:52,800
How to live in the memory of the past.

597
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:57,800
Little by little, memories are mixed up.

598
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Buried in the fire of the past.

599
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,800
I am too persistent.

600
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:13,800
Too much talk.

601
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:20,800
How can you understand me?

602
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,800
The silence I gave you.

603
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:27,800
I still remember the name in my heart.

604
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,800
Don't forget.

605
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,800
Hello.

606
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,800
I am sorry.

607
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,800
I didn't have your phone with me.

608
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
I didn't get your call.

609
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,800
You didn't tell me.

610
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,800
You called me to let me go to Jiangbei to pick you up?

611
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:06,800
How is that possible?

612
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,800
It's because I dreamed of you.

613
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
I called you.

614
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I will go to Jiangbei to pick you up.

615
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I will go to Jiangbei to pick you up.

616
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
I will go to Jiangbei to pick you up.

617
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,800
It's because I dreamed of you.

618
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,800
I called you to ask if you like tofu cake.

619
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,800
When I was in Jiangbei,

620
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
there was a tofu cake shop.

621
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,800
We often went there. It was delicious.

622
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
If you want to eat it,

623
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I can take it back for you.

624
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,800
No.

625
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
Let's go together.

626
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:36,800
But forget it.

627
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,800
I finally came to Jiangbei.

628
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
There are many people who want to see me.

629
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
Even if you come,

630
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
I don't have time to see you.

631
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,800
You really don't want to see me?

632
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,800
No.

633
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,800
Okay.

634
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Okay.

635
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Yu Ziyang.

636
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,800
Mom.

637
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
Yu Ziyang.

638
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Yu Ziyang.

639
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
I miss mom.

640
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,800
My good son.

641
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:49,800
Let mom see you.

642
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,800
Are you thin?

643
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
You leave so soon?

644
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
You spent so much time acting in this art play.

645
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,800
There is no need.

646
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
I know.

647
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
Li Shuo Fang is sick.

648
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,800
You have a bad eye.

649
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,800
I practiced in front of the mirror for several days.

650
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,800
I will not let you go for nothing.

651
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,800
This is a compensation for you.

652
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,800
This is what I owe my dad.

653
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
This drum,

654
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,800
you can use it to whoever you want.

655
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,800
I don't want to know.

656
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,800
Okay.

657
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,800
As you like.

658
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,800
I will go.

659
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,800
Let's go home.

660
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,800
Mom made you spicy chicken.

661
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,800
And braised pork.

662
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,800
And...

663
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,800
Anyway, all your favorite.

664
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
Why are you here?

665
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Someone ran to Jiangbei without saying anything.

666
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
Why don't you allow me to come and block them?

667
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:47,800
My fault.

668
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I will eat tofu cake.

669
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
How is the thing in Jiangbei going?

670
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,800
Is it going well?

671
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,800
Not bad.

672
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
I will go to the hospital.

673
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,800
I will go to the hospital.

674
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,800
I will go to the hospital.

675
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
I will go to the hospital.

676
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
I will go to the hospital.

677
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I will go to the hospital.

678
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
Okay.

679
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
It's all over.

680
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
You went there.

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
You made a mess.

682
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,800
If you keep making trouble,

683
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,800
you will be in trouble.

684
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
Did you bring your seat belt?

685
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:42,800
Okay.

686
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,800
Let's go.

687
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,800
What's up, Lin Hui?

688
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,800
What's up, Lin Hui?

689
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,800
Nothing.

690
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
Come to my house.

691
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
This...

692
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
Mr. Li, please.

693
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,800
Are you ready?

694
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Happy birthday.

695
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,800
I was going to give you a grand opening.

696
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,800
But you went to Jiangbei secretly.

697
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:57,800
This is the only thing left.

698
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,800
But I made this myself.

699
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
And it's my first time making a cake.

700
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,800
You also bought me tofu cake.

701
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
So we are both good at it.

702
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,800
You are both good at it.

703
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,800
It's not the way to use it.

704
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I can use it however I want.

705
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Wait.

706
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:24,800
Come in.

707
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,800
Hurry.

708
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,800
This is the gift I gave you.

709
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Why did you give me a goldfish?

710
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,800
I'm trying to find a partner for your little black fish.

711
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
I'm also a role model for you.

712
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Little black fish won't be lonely in the future.

713
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,800
It's lively.

714
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,800
Next.

715
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,800
Come on.

716
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Come on.

717
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,800
Make a wish.

718
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,800
Li Jing Yu.

719
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,800
You haven't made a wish yet.

720
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
You haven't made a wish yet.

721
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Try this cake.

722
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
Although it's my first time making it,

723
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
I think it tastes good.

724
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Try it.

725
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,800
Xu Xiao Mei is looking for me.

726
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,800
Your sister told me

727
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
that you were afraid of being bitten by a mosquito.

728
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
So I made a wish.

729
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm afraid that you will be bitten by a mosquito.

730
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,800
I'm afraid that you will be bitten by a mosquito.

731
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,800
I'm afraid that you will be bitten by a mosquito.

732
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,800
I'm afraid that you will be bitten by a mosquito.

733
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,800
I'm afraid that you will be bitten by a mosquito.

734
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
I'm afraid that you will be bitten by a mosquito.

735
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,800
I'll go and check it for her.

736
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,800
I'll go and check it for her.

737
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,800
Why didn't you tell me?

738
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:39,800
Why didn't I tell you?

739
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,800
I called you, didn't I?

740
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,800
You said you didn't want to see me.

741
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,800
So you came back in time.

742
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:50,800
I went to Jiangbei myself.

743
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,800
Some people don't want to see me.

744
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,800
My heart is broken.

745
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,800
What if I don't come back?

746
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,800
What's wrong?

747
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,800
Do you still want to try it with me?

748
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,800
Yan Meng.

749
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:15,800
Do you still want to be with me?

750
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,800
Forget it.

751
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I didn't say anything.

752
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,800
I...

753
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,800
I...

754
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:35,800
I want to ask you.

755
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
The question you're asking me now...

756
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,800
Is it because you like me...

757
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
or because you're moved by something?

758
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I want to be with someone who likes me.

759
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
So I'm not in a hurry to answer.

760
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:54,800
You can think about it slowly.

761
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Eat the cake.

762
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:57,800
Try it.

763
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I don't know if it's big or small.

764
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:04,800
Look at this smile.

765
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:05,800
It's so like you.

766
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,800
You should smile more.

767
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
It's hot.

768
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Oh, she understands.

769
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:32,800
Fate is hard to avoid.

770
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
There's an accident.

771
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,800
It's just that at this moment,

772
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,800
she chose not to say anything.

773
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
She didn't think about the results.

774
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,800
It's worth it.

775
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,800
The flower that bloomed in the summer

776
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:58,800
Flows through the night

777
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:03,800
How bright the company is

778
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:11,800
Is it also a kind of answer

779
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:20,800
The flower that bloomed in the summer

780
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,800
Flows through the night

781
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,800
How bright the company is

782
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,800
Is it also a kind of answer

783
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:40,800
Is it also a kind of answer

784
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,800
I met you

785
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,800
I thought of you

786
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,800
I heard any news from you

787
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:58,800
The love that was raised in my heart

788
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,800
Occupies my mind

789
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,800
Go, where to go

790
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:11,800
How to avoid

791
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:16,800
Those memories about you

792
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,800
I'm so addicted to the abyss

793
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,800
Can't cut it off

794
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,800
I'm silent

795
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,800
Put the flowers in the back

796
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,800
Maybe it will make sadness no longer spread

797
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,800
Self-righteousness, pretending to be decisive

798
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:51,800
But still in the abyss, obsessed

799
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,800
The most perfect lie

800
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,800
Deceive yourself

801
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:05,800
If love is to let go, let us lose the relationship

802
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:08,800
Why is this

803
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,800
The moment of tears

804
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:16,800
Heart still yearns

805
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
The most perfect lie

806
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,800
Deceive yourself

807
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:42,800
If love is to let go, let us lose the relationship
