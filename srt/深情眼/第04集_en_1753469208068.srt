1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Love by Hypnotic

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Love can still remember

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
But your eyes are shining

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Excitingly saying how much you love me

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Walking and walking, forgetting

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,000
The promise is forgotten in the story

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's the remaining memories that are like fireworks burning and scattering

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
When I turn around and leave

9
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
If time can return to the intersection of farewell

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't let go of your hand

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The promise that can't be hidden

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
At the edge of space

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,000
When the breath gradually disappears

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
There is nothing

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Which one still loves you

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Actually never changed

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
If there is still a promise that will be kept

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please remember that one has my dream

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 16

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
The water pipe is old, it can only be replaced

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The roof can be repaired for the time being

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Thank you

23
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Then be careful

24
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I re-edited it last night

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I did skip it

26
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
If you blame me, it's okay

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
What blame?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
When Cheng Kai Ren was here last night

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I used you to hug you

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
If it was in the workplace

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's really harassment

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You know it's harassment

33
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I know it's harassment

34
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I apologized to you

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Or I'll make up for you

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
How to make up for it?

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I really don't believe you kiss me

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Come on, I'll give it back to you

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
What did you say?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Kissing is more cost-effective than hugging

41
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
This is cheap

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Don't wait for the cheap to buy fast

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on, kiss me

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I found out that you are

45
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
What kiss?

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mengmeng, who did you kiss?

47
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes

48
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
No, I said please

49
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I asked a maintenance worker

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Look at our wall

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's all leaking

52
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Are you in love?

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
No, you really listened to it

54
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Really please

55
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
You are very sensitive

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
This young man is quite handsome

57
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Master

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Please leave me a contact information

59
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
We two are also the boss

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go, go, go

61
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Come on, grandma

62
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's too dusty here

63
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I won't eat here

64
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
What are you anxious about?

65
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I haven't said you yet

66
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Are you lying to me?

67
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Didn't you tell me

68
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Go to Fang Ya'an's house?

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You are really a child

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You said this blind date party

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Dr. Gao is so sincere

72
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Expressed

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Why can't you?

74
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Don't like him

75
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Then who do you like?

76
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I like handsome

77
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
We are so here

78
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I tell you

79
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
It's not wrong to be handsome

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But we have to find a high-education

81
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Stable job

82
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The family environment is good

83
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I just came back to Ningsui

84
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You don't have to be so anxious

85
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Marry me, right?

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Of course I'm anxious

87
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are our old Ye family

88
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The only baby granddaughter

89
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Can you say I'm not anxious?

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Little girl doesn't work hard

91
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, yes

92
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Mom, okay

93
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I know all the things

94
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let's go

95
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Annoying

96
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Look

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
This new car

98
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Mengmeng

99
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Is this the new car you bought?

100
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Cool

101
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This car can't stop here

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Go over there later

103
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Enough, mom

104
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The time I booked the restaurant is up

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go to eat something delicious

106
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Hurry up

107
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Hurry up, go

108
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'll take you to eat something delicious

109
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Sorry

110
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Just said you are a repairman

111
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's because our family is in a hurry

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm afraid they will be in trouble

113
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Because of their busy schedule

114
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's okay

115
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I am a repairman

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Why do you feel strange?

117
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You are jealous of Dr. Gao

118
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Li Junyu

119
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
You are not just a repairman

120
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You have a lot of work

121
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I am a beautiful single woman

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You have to protect me

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can be my guardian

124
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
You mean me or Ping'an?

125
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What do you mean?

126
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I am not an outsider

127
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I am your closest neighbor

128
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
See, this place is just for us

129
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
We are living together

130
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You should protect me

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Are you done?

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You are packing

134
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm buying a monitor for someone

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm going to the house

136
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm going too

137
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm going too

138
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
He knows to blacken his face every day

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You deaf?

140
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You can't hear me

141
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll meet you at the door

142
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Boss, look at the monitor

143
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Just look at it

144
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Choose this one

145
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
This one is good

146
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Function is more important than appearance

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Who said appearance is not good?

148
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It looks good

149
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
This is the camera in the room

150
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No room for it

151
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
This one is good

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This one?

153
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
This one is big and the camera is high

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Our family is rich

155
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
One

156
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Okay, I'll take this one

157
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Okay, I'll hold it for you

158
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
The little bastard who is abroad

159
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You know this

160
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Tell me what you do abroad

161
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
So gossipy

162
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are a fool

163
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are a fool

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
A good handsome man

165
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Why does he have a mouth?

166
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you done?

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Yes, 620

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
So expensive

169
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've paid you 80%

170
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'm done

171
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Take care

172
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
For the sake of your shopping with me

173
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Boss, have a meal first

174
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I should be off work

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What's wrong with off work?

176
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
You have to pay for the meal?

177
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay

178
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'll pay you

179
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll pay for the money

180
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You can find a hotel

181
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Thank you, boss

182
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll choose the expensive one

183
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't have to save money for me

184
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
It's a quick battle

185
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I have to work at night

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You are a workaholic

187
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is it delicious?

188
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Boss, a bowl of noodles with ginseng, please

189
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Okay

190
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Manman

191
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Brother, Sister Ye Meng

192
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Why are you two together?

193
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I have an appointment

194
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Occasionally

195
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Occasionally

196
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
She asked me to

197
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Actually, I am happy to hire your brother

198
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Be a part-time job

199
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
And eat a work meal

200
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Work and love

201
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I understand

202
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You are cheated, right?

203
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You are cheated, right?

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Sister, tomorrow is the fish lantern festival

205
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
This is the last one this year

206
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You two go together

207
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I want to go

208
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Brother

209
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The noodles are ready, let's go

210
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Brother, you are already twenty-seven

211
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's time to find a girlfriend

212
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Go go go

213
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm leaving

214
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Bye bye

215
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Master Li

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Do you want to consider

217
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Add a class tomorrow

218
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Accompany me on the festival

219
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I don't need

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Now the money is very important

221
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Think about it

222
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Noodles are about to be thrown, eat it back

223
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You taste it

224
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Brother Jing Yu

225
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Are you okay last time?

226
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Nothing

227
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hello sister

228
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Last time we met in my brother's bar

229
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I haven't officially greeted Chen Jingjing

230
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Am I Ye Meng?

231
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Why are you here

232
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I've been looking for you these days

233
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why don't you care about me

234
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
The winter vacation is very short

235
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
There are many classes

236
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I want to find you to make up

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Make up

238
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are in high school

239
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
No, I am in college now

240
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I just got into Nanhu University today

241
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
That's a good thing

242
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You are really excellent

243
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Sister, you are beautiful

244
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you

245
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'm busy recently

246
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
And you have already entered college

247
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have nothing to make up for you

248
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'll pick you up tomorrow

249
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let's go shopping together

250
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's settled

251
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Bye bye sister

252
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Bye bye

253
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Teacher Li

254
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
The party is busy

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's really busy

256
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I have to install the monitor for the blind

257
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
The rules have changed

258
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Accompany me on the festival

259
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm not afraid of being a girl now

260
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Your eyes are better than the monitor

261
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
With you as a neighbor, I'm not afraid of anything

262
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Sleep in the car tomorrow

263
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Hurry up

264
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The festival is starting

265
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Hurry up

266
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I didn't expect you to come

267
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's the first time I see you in white

268
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
It's pretty

269
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you

270
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
What about me?

271
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Is my real body good-looking?

272
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Good-looking

273
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Is the dress good-looking or me?

274
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The dress is good-looking

275
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You are talking nonsense

276
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Brother Jingxing, you are here

277
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Do you think my dress is good-looking?

278
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Sorry, Jingxing

279
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Actually, I have an appointment today

280
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
After you finish playing, go home and rest early

281
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
We'll go first

282
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What do you mean, Li Jingyu?

283
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Take me as your friend

284
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I'm sorry

285
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'm sorry

286
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Li Jingyu

287
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Take me as your shield

288
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
You used to take me as your shield

289
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Then your holding hand posture is wrong

290
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It doesn't look like a real couple

291
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You should do this

292
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
What are you doing?

293
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
He can see it

294
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Do you know why Ning Sui has a fish lantern festival?

295
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I don't know

296
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There was a fisherman who went out to sea every day

297
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
His wife would wait for him here

298
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Until one day

299
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
He didn't wait for his husband to come back

300
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
He turned the lantern into a lighthouse

301
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Every time he went home, he lit a lantern

302
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Just to tell his wife

303
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm home

304
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So you know

305
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You are very touched, right?

306
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Go

307
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I'm touched, but it's just a legend

308
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Why are you so unromantic?

309
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Sister Ye Meng

310
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You are officially dating?

311
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
No

312
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm just working

313
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
So he's working

314
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Work, work, work

315
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Is it a love affair?

316
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Okay, don't be embarrassed

317
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You have to pick a fish lantern for Sister Ye Meng

318
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Your family is really hardworking

319
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
You don't have to be so formal

320
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm not

321
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Hurry up, okay, take one

322
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Sister Ye Meng, I'll pick you a fan

323
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Okay, thank you

324
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
And a wish card

325
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Take one for me

326
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
No, no, no, no

327
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Take one for me

328
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Think about what you want

329
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Then while you think about your wish

330
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just write your name on it

331
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Okay

332
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
My dear future sister-in-law

333
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Take my brother to the next level

334
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Qiao Mai

335
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Dear Jin Li

336
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Dear Jin Li

337
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I wish to meet a handsome brother

338
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:40,400
Don't be too

339
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you

340
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Your brother is really good

341
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Not bad

342
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Okay

343
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Here you are

344
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Is there anyone here?

345
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Coming

346
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Sorry, it's all my fault

347
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
You go ahead

348
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Brother, buy a flower for your girlfriend

349
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
She is not my girlfriend

350
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
She is not my boyfriend either

351
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Thank you

352
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
It's okay, bye bye

353
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Bye bye

354
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Li Jin Yu, you are really good

355
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You don't use people to pay

356
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You are so quick to draw a line with me

357
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Okay, I'll take it

358
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'll remember your surname now

359
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Li Jin Yu doesn't like to buy flowers for girls

360
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Okay, let's go see fireworks

361
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Second

362
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Brother likes to see fireworks with girls

363
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Let's go see fireworks

364
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
If my little notebook is full

365
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
will my wish come true?

366
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Li Jin Yu, I'm talking to you

367
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Can you react?

368
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Can't you hear it?

369
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Hello

370
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm a troublesome person

371
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm afraid you are not interested in it

372
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It's okay

373
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm very patient

374
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
It's so lively

375
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Is Jiangbei lively?

376
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Jiangbei is lively

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
It feels fake

378
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
But it's different here

379
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's real

380
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I tried my best to stay in Jiangbei

381
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I don't know who to prove I can stay

382
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I can

383
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Or I'm afraid that people will find out I can't

384
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But after I came back

385
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I found I was free

386
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
In a moment

387
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
In a moment?

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Why do you like to see fireworks?

389
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Maybe because

390
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I like the loneliness when it blooms

391
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Even if you are lonely

392
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
you can feel the warmth sometimes

393
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm not lonely

394
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm not lonely

395
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm not lonely

396
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm not lonely

397
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'm not lonely

398
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I can feel the warmth sometimes

399
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Master Li

400
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You came to my house for work so early

401
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
You are so good

402
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Give me your phone

403
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What?

404
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You look so beautiful

405
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You are shooting a video for me

406
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm sorry

407
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm sorry

408
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm sorry

409
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm sorry

410
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm sorry

411
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm so sorry

412
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm sorry

413
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm sorry

414
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry

415
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry

416
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,760
What?

417
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,640
You think I'm pretty?

418
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,640
You want to take photos of me?

419
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,880
Next mobile app.

420
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,680
Only then can you see the surveillance video.

421
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,400
Why are you so not humorous?

422
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,240
Okay, here you are.

423
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,760
Okay.

424
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,160
Done.

425
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
Thank you.

426
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,880
Li Jingyu.

427
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Ye Meng.

428
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,160
You finally see me.

429
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,720
I thought you were wearing sunglasses.

430
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,720
I couldn't see you.

431
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,520
You two know each other?

432
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,400
That's how big the town is.

433
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,040
Is it weird that we know each other?

434
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,840
I'm not sure.

435
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:37,840
I'm not sure.

436
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
I'm not sure.

437
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,840
I'm not sure.

438
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:40,840
I'm not sure.

439
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
I'm not sure.

440
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Is it weird?

441
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,000
So you told him

442
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,600
I have a boyfriend in Jiangbei?

443
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,400
You're trying to revenge me

444
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,680
for Gou Kai's thing?

445
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,760
You're overestimating yourself.

446
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,360
I just think

447
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,280
you're too cunning.

448
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:05,520
You're quite enthusiastic.

449
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,800
We grew up together.

450
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,320
Don't you know my personality?

451
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,200
My own person

452
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,560
can't be bullied.

453
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,840
Brother.

454
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,840
Make an old friendship with your ex-girlfriend.

455
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,320
Don't be soft-hearted

456
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,600
about your mental damage.

457
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,640
I've lost more

458
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,640
than I can.

459
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:26,160
Let's talk about our business.

460
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,600
You're really going back to Jiangbei?

461
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,120
Gou Kai asked me to bring you a message.

462
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,560
If you're willing to go back,

463
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,160
he'll come to pick you up

464
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,920
as soon as he comes back.

465
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,720
You can't stay at home all the time.

466
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,000
Don't start studying so early in the morning.

467
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Have fun.

468
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,160
Hello, what's up?

469
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,400
Jiang Luzhi is back.

470
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,640
What?

471
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,080
You're coming to my house right now?

472
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
Anyway,

473
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,520
that's the thing.

474
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,360
I didn't expect

475
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,080
he'd resign as soon as he was impulsive.

476
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,600
I didn't expect...

477
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:30,960
Thank you.

478
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,040
I didn't expect

479
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,080
he'd think that

480
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,360
I took his job by my relationship.

481
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,480
I didn't expect

482
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,240
I took his job by my relationship.

483
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,520
I couldn't explain it to you

484
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,520
on the phone that night.

485
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,360
I just wanted to

486
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,360
come back and tell you in person.

487
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,800
So,

488
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,560
you two have been in bad relationship

489
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,160
because of the person named Gou Kai?

490
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,000
That's what he told you?

491
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,080
No wonder you thought

492
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,800
I called you my new boyfriend.

493
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,320
It might be inhuman.

494
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
I was wronged.

495
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,680
Gou Kai and I

496
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,920
are just a simple relationship.

497
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,560
We've never been together.

498
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,680
The person he likes is Ye Meng.

499
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,840
After all, Ye Meng has been with him since he graduated from college.

500
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,880
They've been together since they were in college.

501
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,560
That relationship

502
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,240
is really incomparable.

503
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,800
When he asked me to join the company,

504
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,480
you don't need to explain it to me.

505
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,360
We're just

506
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,680
a couple.

507
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,400
What about Ye Meng?

508
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,720
You look familiar with him.

509
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,760
What's your relationship with Ye Meng?

510
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,400
It's none of your business.

511
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,080
I think he's interested in you.

512
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,000
Does he like you?

513
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,800
I don't know.

514
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,880
Then,

515
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,400
you like him.

516
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,840
Otherwise, why did you become so nervous

517
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,320
when you saw Lu Zhi come back?

518
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,560
I'm not nervous.

519
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,160
I'm afraid that he'll talk nonsense

520
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,440
and ruin my reputation.

521
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,880
Do you know what I've become

522
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,880
after he joined the company?

523
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,720
What?

524
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,360
He called me a sleepwalker.

525
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,360
What?

526
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
I have a strange thing.

527
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Do you think

528
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,960
Gou Kai is blind?

529
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,160
In terms of means,

530
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,160
Jiang Lu Zhi is a street-sweeper.

531
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,160
But in terms of appearance,

532
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,960
you're a street-sweeper, okay?

533
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,360
Didn't he like you before?

534
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,360
Why did he

535
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,560
get together with Jiang Lu Zhi?

536
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,760
Don't give him any clues.

537
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,960
What does he like about me?

538
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
He just wants to make

539
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,360
an adult's lover.

540
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,960
I think Gou Kai

541
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,960
is a very good person.

542
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,360
He's a very good person.

543
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,560
Gou Kai

544
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,360
just wants people around the world

545
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,760
to make fun of him every day.

546
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,960
After I went to the company,

547
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,960
he asked me to go to the wine bureau with him every day

548
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,960
to find a good person

549
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,560
and follow the company's development.

550
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I didn't want to.

551
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
Then I asked Jiang Lu Zhi

552
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,760
to stimulate me.

553
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,160
He's purely

554
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,360
trying to make fun of you.

555
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,360
Are you going back?

556
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,160
I asked

557
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,160
if you were going to go back to Jiangbei.

558
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,360
You tried so hard

559
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,960
to stay in Jiangbei.

560
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,560
What do you think now?

561
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,160
Are you really going to give up and stay here?

562
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:07,160
He can't stay with you.

563
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,360
Even if he likes you,

564
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,160
he's just a baby.

565
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,160
He has three aunts.

566
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,960
And an old grandmother

567
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,360
who hasn't been reborn from the past.

568
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
If you're with him,

569
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
you'll have to have a child.

570
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,560
Are you willing to do that?

571
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,560
I'm willing.

572
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,160
The conditions in the house are good.

573
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,960
It's no big deal.

574
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,360
Do you know

575
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,960
his mother committed suicide in her college entrance exam?

576
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,160
His father went abroad

577
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
since then.

578
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,760
He hasn't been back for so many years.

579
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,560
Are you sure

580
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,560
you can fit in

581
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,160
such a complicated family?

582
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,360
No problem.

583
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,360
I don't have to spend time with my old friend.

584
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,360
It's not bad.

585
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,160
Fine.

586
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,560
You're thinking it through.

587
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:53,760
When we first

588
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,360
met,

589
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,960
we should have a consensus.

590
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,160
You're not interested in me.

591
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,360
I don't like you either.

592
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,760
We're just trying to

593
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,160
deal with each other's parents.

594
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,560
We're just doing what we need to do.

595
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
You're a man.

596
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:12,960
Li Jing Yu.

597
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,160
If there's no Ye Meng,

598
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,560
will you break up with me?

599
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,160
Of course not.

600
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,960
Look at him.

601
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,360
If I don't...

602
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Eat.

603
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,760
You'll fall to the tree

604
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:30,960
and die.

605
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,360
No way.

606
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,360
We've been talking for so long.

607
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,160
What are we talking about?

608
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,360
Why aren't you coming out?

609
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,960
Didn't they say

610
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,560
70% of men

611
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,960
have ex-girlfriends and ex-girlfriends?

612
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:48,960
That's normal.

613
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
What's so good about

614
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,960
having a ex-girlfriend who treats her as a back-up?

615
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:53,960
If you keep talking to her,

616
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,160
you'll end up with a whole circle.

617
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
Look at your face.

618
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,560
You said you didn't like her.

619
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
Even if they're...

620
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
They're just having a little bit of fun.

621
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,360
They're definitely having some kind of relationship.

622
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,960
Who are you?

623
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,160
You're just a

624
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,960
neighbor who can only

625
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,360
sneak up on her through her own surveillance camera.

626
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,560
Let me help you.

627
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,560
It's okay. Just be direct.

628
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
You're so silly. Let me help you.

629
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,760
Sister Yang, you wanted to see me again?

630
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,960
I'm looking for you.

631
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,160
It's just that

632
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,560
Meng Meng

633
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,960
is afraid that you'll be

634
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,760
caught by the female police.

635
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,160
So you asked me to check her draft.

636
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Hurry up.

637
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:52,360
Are you satisfied?

638
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,360
Why should I be satisfied?

639
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,360
It's not me looking for you.

640
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
It's Ya Yan looking for you.

641
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,360
It's me looking for you.

642
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:04,960
It's my son looking for you.

643
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,560
Jia Yu, didn't you just know

644
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,560
that there's a

645
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,360
math question?

646
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,960
Ask this brother. He can do it.

647
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,360
I didn't.

648
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
Come here.

649
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,960
I do have a math question. I don't know how to answer it.

650
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,760
Right?

651
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,560
Look.

652
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:26,960
Come here.

653
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:27,960
Help me.

654
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Jia Yu,

655
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
which question can't you do?

656
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,960
Which question?

657
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,360
I don't know this question.

658
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,160
Let me see.

659
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,160
It's not the first grade.

660
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,360
It's the second grade

661
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,760
and other grade works.

662
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,960
It's not the second grade.

663
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,360
It's the first grade

664
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,360
and other grade works.

665
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,560
If you add them together,

666
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,160
it's the first grade plus the second grade

667
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,560
and the other two times of the second grade.

668
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
It's

669
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,560
21 plus 28 equals 49.

670
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,960
What's this?

671
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Open your eyes.

672
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
Look at this Ya Yan.

673
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,560
13 minus 36 equals 36.

674
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,560
Look at this.

675
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,560
Open your eyes.

676
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,560
The total is

677
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,160
36 divided by 2 equals 18.

678
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,760
Now let's verify

679
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,360
whether this result is correct.

680
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,560
Let's assume that

681
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,360
the first grade works are A,

682
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,160
the second grade works are B,

683
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,360
and the other grade works are C.

684
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,760
Look.

685
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,560
Oh my god. It's so beautiful.

686
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Right?

687
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
It's beautiful.

688
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Let's go over there.

689
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,760
Okay.

690
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,160
Okay.

691
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
This way, please.

692
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,560
It's so beautiful.

693
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,160
You two are still together.

694
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
We are married.

695
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,160
You don't know, right?

696
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,960
I haven't given you the red envelope.

697
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,760
Congratulations.

698
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,760
Ye Meng is here.

699
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,960
Thank you.

700
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:01,760
Thank you.

701
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,560
You are so high today.

702
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,160
How many hair clips have you ordered?

703
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,160
Not bad.

704
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,160
It's almost the same as yours.

705
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
Am I right?

706
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
You two have been friends since childhood.

707
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,760
You are now in the same field.

708
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,760
It's rare.

709
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,760
Our monitor is so generous.

710
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,160
Even Mr. Jiang invited him.

711
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,960
I heard that you are also in the project of South Bay Bay.

712
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:21,960
You are amazing.

713
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,360
Mr. Chen, don't hide it from me.

714
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
I am just a small worker.

715
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
I will still support you in the future.

716
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,560
You are so modest.

717
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,160
Among our old classmates,

718
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,360
you two are the only ones who are not married yet.

719
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,360
Mr. Jiang is busy.

720
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,760
It's understandable.

721
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,760
What about you, Ye Meng?

722
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,960
This woman is old.

723
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,360
She has to have a baby, right?

724
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,560
Don't just be a busybody.

725
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Really?

726
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,360
Lu Zhi.

727
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,560
He said you are too old.

728
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,960
If you like your child so much,

729
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,560
why don't you be a music teacher?

730
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,360
You have money and a child.

731
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:08,660
I am a

732
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,760
boyfriend.

733
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,760
Who?

734
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:11,760
Do we know each other?

735
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
His family is sick.

736
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,760
They are busy in the hospital.

737
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,360
I will call him later

738
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,760
to see if he will come.

739
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,160
He will come to see us.

740
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
That's right.

741
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Don't just surround me and gossip about me.

742
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,760
Look at our class.

743
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:24,760
We are all single.

744
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,160
I am leaving.

745
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,360
Your attitude hasn't changed at all.

746
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,160
How are you recently?

747
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
I am fine.

748
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Although Jiang has been separated,

749
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,560
he has ended the one-to-one relationship.

750
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,360
Then we are single.

751
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,960
Look at this couple.

752
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
They are not happy.

753
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Look at you.

754
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,160
Look at me.

755
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,960
I am an old man.

756
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,560
No one is talking to me.

757
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,960
I am not a human, right?

758
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,960
I am a dog.

759
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,960
I am safe.

760
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,760
If you are a dog, that's good.

761
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,360
You will listen to whatever I say.

762
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,960
How about you talk to that Ye?

763
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,960
I think he is nice.

764
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,560
He is generous and outgoing.

765
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,160
He understands human and human affairs.

766
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
He can't even say a word

767
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,160
to you.

768
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
He is a good man.

769
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,160
He is a good man.

770
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,360
He is a good man.

771
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,760
What's the matter?

772
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:27,960
You haven't finished?

773
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,360
Okay.

774
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,760
What's the matter?

775
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,160
I have performed in the bar.

776
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,760
My classmate's wedding

777
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,560
is scheduled for the next day.

778
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Are you interested?

779
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,760
I don't have time.

780
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
You don't have time?

781
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,360
Dr. Gao.

782
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:48,960
Yes.

783
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:49,760
They are all there.

784
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,360
You go first.

785
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,160
I will make a call.

786
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:51,360
Okay.

787
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,160
You go first.

788
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,360
Don't think about it.

789
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
Hurry up.

790
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
Listen.

791
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,960
You must be

792
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,560
quiet with Jiang.

793
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:06,960
Do you hear me?

794
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,560
Don't worry.

795
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:09,960
I am leaving.

796
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,760
Dear guests,

797
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
dear friends,

798
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,560
now our groom, Zhong Yuefei,

799
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,960
the bride, has come to the wedding hall.

800
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
I would like to invite you

801
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,560
to give the bride a warm applause

802
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
to express her love

803
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,360
to the bride.

804
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,760
Is it okay?

805
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Okay.

806
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,560
Let's give a round of applause.

807
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,760
Come on.

808
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,760
Who do you think

809
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:39,960
will get married first?

810
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:41,960
No way.

811
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,760
It's a competition.

812
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,160
What are you pretending?

813
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,360
In the past,

814
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
we were even more resistant

815
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,360
to not going to the bathroom.

816
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,760
That's a matter of fate.

817
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,960
Yes.

818
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,160
Our rival

819
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,960
is much more stable than our best friend.

820
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,160
I know better

821
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,360
than Fang Ya

822
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,360
that you are so considerate of Li Jinyu

823
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
because he was my boyfriend at that time.

824
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,560
He has eight children, right?

825
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,160
Don't you have Goukai?

826
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,160
What?

827
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
You want to be a manager

828
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,560
for both the north and the south?

829
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,360
I said so on purpose.

830
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:13,360
I am not with Goukai at all.

831
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
At least,

832
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,160
it's okay to love.

833
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,760
But in terms of means,

834
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,360
I can't compare to you.

835
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:22,760
In the north of the Yangtze River, there is Goukai.

836
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,560
When he came back to his hometown,

837
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
he immediately hooked up with a female manager.

838
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,360
And this Dr. Gao.

839
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
This Dr. Gao

840
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,960
is quite in line with

841
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,160
the standards of your Ye Jiaxuan's son-in-law.

842
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,560
He is kind of a fan of you.

843
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,760
So please

844
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,760
be my boyfriend in the future.

845
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:43,960
Your boyfriend?

846
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,960
Did he agree to it?

847
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,960
Guess.

848
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,960
As the best friend of the bride,

849
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,560
I must say to the groom,

850
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,360
congratulations on finding the treasure.

851
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,760
Please cherish him and protect him in the future.

852
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,960
Become his forever shelter.

853
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,760
Money, status, age,

854
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,960
are not as good as a person

855
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,760
who is willing to wait for you forever.

856
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,360
No matter when you turn around,

857
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,960
you will always be the one waiting for you.

858
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,160
Next, let's welcome

859
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,360
the bride and groom to exchange rings.

860
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,160
Let's welcome the lovely flower boy to sing.

861
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,360
Let's welcome all guests to the wedding ceremony.

862
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,760
Congratulations.

863
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:26,960
Ye Meng.

864
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,160
What a coincidence.

865
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,360
What a coincidence.

866
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
You are...

867
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,760
I am the college classmate of the groom.

868
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,560
What a coincidence.

869
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,760
The last time we met,

870
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,760
I was quite fond of you.

871
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,760
I know

872
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,560
you don't like this kind of form of blind dates.

873
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,960
We can

874
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,760
start with being friends.

875
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,360
We are friends now.

876
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,560
Here, have some water.

877
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,760
It's good for your health.

878
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,760
You are really here.

879
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,960
Why are you drinking alone?

880
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,360
I want you to drink with me.

881
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,960
Do you want to go out for a breath?

882
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,760
I want to go out for a breath.

883
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,960
The class reunion is getting more and more boring.

884
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,160
We are getting closer.

885
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
Why did you come back?

886
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,640
It's an old topic.

887
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,440
The Jiangbei that can't be kept

888
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:17,800
and the hometown that can't be returned.

889
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,360
I just believe what you said.

890
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,680
But I don't believe it's true.

891
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,360
What about you?

892
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,680
Why did you choose to live in Ningcui?

893
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,720
You don't get used to it here.

894
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,680
You must be tired if you pretend to get used to it.

895
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,480
But in other words,

896
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,440
the reason you came here today

897
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:42,880
is because of me.

898
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,720
I'm here to earn money.

899
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:48,920
But you

900
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,000
left your blind date there alone

901
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,880
and ran out with me.

902
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:52,880
Is it appropriate?

903
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,200
Aren't you different?

904
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,760
Your ex-girlfriend is also there.

905
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:04,320
Hello.

906
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,520
Jin Yu, it's me.

907
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,840
I called you before.

908
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:10,320
But you didn't answer.

909
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,960
So I changed a number to call you.

910
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,280
I'm sick.

911
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,440
I'm very sick.

912
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,320
I miss you.

913
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,760
No matter what, Jin Yu,

914
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,720
you're my son.

915
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,280
Son?

916
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,360
Are you okay?

917
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,560
It's your mother.

918
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,280
Don't worry about it.

919
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,520
You're really strange.

920
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,000
You're so annoying.

921
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,560
Ye Meng,

922
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:47,680
I know you're just playing with me.

923
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,120
But if you're upset,

924
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,720
I suggest you change another person.

925
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:52,720
Play?

926
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:54,760
Okay, let's play now.

927
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:55,800
Come to my room.

928
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,280
Hello, give me a beer.

929
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,000
Okay.

930
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,320
Didn't you say you were going back to your room?

931
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,960
Why are you here?

932
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,800
Song Le, do you need a drink?

933
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,760
What do you want?

934
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,440
I'm not here to drink.

935
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,840
I'm here to drink.

936
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,240
I'm here to drink.

937
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,360
I'm here to drink.

938
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,640
I'm here to drink.

939
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,120
I'm here to drink.

940
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,520
I'm here to drink.

941
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,800
I'm here to drink.

942
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,960
I'm here to drink.

943
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,360
What are you thinking about?

944
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,040
I'm here to cultivate some atmosphere.

945
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,520
You don't understand anything.

946
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,760
You don't even want to drink beer?

947
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,440
Hello,

948
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,560
give me a beer.

949
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,320
Okay.

950
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,760
Thank you.

951
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,320
What's this?

952
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,440
The special drink of this bar

953
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,840
is called God of Poetry.

954
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,040
You don't dare to drink?

955
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
Why not?

956
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,400
It tastes good.

957
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,280
Please give me all those.

958
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,160
Thank you.

959
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,360
Please enjoy.

960
00:39:38,120 --> 00:39:38,760
Thank you.

961
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,480
I have a great friend who is awards.

962
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,640
And he's very sweet.

963
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,160
So, the first thing I felt…

964
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,200
was that I couldn't live like I have any parents in my life.

965
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,680
Do you know that?

966
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,680
Yes, I know.

967
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,280
Okay, the training is over.

968
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,440
But we will make up to you.

969
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,260
I am wrong.

970
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,780
Have a drink.

971
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,560
Your qu showc side is highlighted.

972
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,520
Have some water.

973
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,960
Give me a cup of water.

974
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,700
Okay.

975
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,080
Thank you.

976
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:31,900
You are welcome.

977
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
I'm sorry.

978
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,520
I didn't control my emotions well.

979
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,640
But I know

980
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,240
you did it for my own good.

981
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,960
Li Jinyu.

982
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,280
Why do you control your emotions?

983
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,680
I hope you don't set so many obstacles for yourself.

984
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:03,200
Sometimes you should be more presumptuous.

985
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,560
Not everyone has the right to do so.

986
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,120
Li Jinyu.

987
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,600
If someone tells you

988
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,200
you don't have the right to do so,

989
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,920
ask him to come to me.

990
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,280
In the future,

991
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,880
please allow me to fight for you.

992
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,200
A moment in the dream

993
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:43,760
Even if you forget all the memories

994
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,160
I can't erase you from my mind

995
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,760
Every time I look at you

996
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,200
I want to get closer to my own sincerity

997
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:00,640
How can I forget

998
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,640
those unintentional feelings

999
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,400
If you know my feelings

1000
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,000
and want to escape

1001
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,440
because you care too much

1002
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:14,680
The courage to be lost

1003
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,800
should be spent on something

1004
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,800
Let me use all my strength

1005
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,600
to hug you

1006
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,680
Don't doubt

1007
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:28,920
on what you have achieved

1008
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,640
Just try your best

1009
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:34,160
From now on

1010
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:39,400
let's go to the final dimension

1011
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:43,400
You are the best

1012
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:48,880
Fight together

1013
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,080
To the end

1014
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:53,320
Fight unit

1015
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,160
Judging by their judgement

1016
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:03,160
Where should I go? How should I respond?

1017
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:09,160
Those memories about you

1018
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:20,160
I want to be far away but I can't get you out of my mind

1019
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:27,160
I silently look into the distance, putting the flowers in the back of my eyes

1020
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,160
Maybe it will stop the sadness from spreading

1021
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:42,160
I pretend to be firm but I'm still obsessed with the original

1022
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:51,160
The most perfect lies, they all deceive themselves

1023
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:57,160
If we can still let go, let us lose the connection

1024
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:07,160
Why is it that in the moment of tears, my heart is still lingering?

1025
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:22,160
The most perfect lies, they all deceive themselves

1026
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:32,160
If we can still let go, let us lose the connection
