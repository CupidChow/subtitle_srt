not to know him.

Yeah.

00:14:36,545 --> 00:14:37,671
Just finishing work?

203
00:14:38,631 --> 00:14:39,673
Yes.

204
00:14:42,968 --> 00:14:47,807
I heard someone set off the alarm

Oh, that.

It's okay. I'm used to it.

[musician 1] A birthday present?

- [Yeongmi] It would've been great

if Sujin became the concertmaster
with this.

251
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,855
[Jiae] I know.
Plus, she's really talented too.

I'm really curious.

257
00:18:36,619 --> 00:18:37,703
Hey, Luna.

258
00:18:38,412 --> 00:18:41,332
Just how did you get Seeum
to make you concertmaster?

259
00:18:41,874 --> 00:18:42,916
I'm sorry?

260
00:18:44,168 --> 00:18:45,544
I didn't...

261
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:48,255
Seeum made that decision.

262
00:18:48,339 --> 00:18:50,841
Luna was just as surprised that day.

263
00:18:51,175 --> 00:18:54,261
Would she have gotten the position
no strings attached?

264
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:57,640
[Yeongmi] Ajin, you're way too nice.
It's like a disease.

265
00:18:57,765 --> 00:18:59,975
The world isn't as innocent as you think.

266
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,935
It's easy to scam people like you.

267
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,229
[whispering] Beware of people like her.

268
00:19:04,313 --> 00:19:07,358
They're not rich or connected,
so they manipulate to get their way.

269
00:19:07,441 --> 00:19:09,485
[Seeum] Isn't that something
we should learn?

270

Having nothing,
but scheming our way to the top?

271
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,370
You should ask how she does it
instead of being wary of her.

[Seeum] You left that door open

00:20:22,224 --> 00:20:23,434
So I would hear you.

287
00:20:26,437 --> 00:20:30,065
Are you going to say it was a coincidence?
That would be even more disappointing.

288
00:20:33,068 --> 00:20:34,987
Stop acting all nice and innocent.

289
00:20:35,863 --> 00:20:38,365
Because I want to see the real Luna.

290
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:42,619
Not the child

I want to see a concertmaster
that's driven, fearless, and ambitious.

Whether you have to cajole them
or threaten them, break them down.

You have to do it on your own

Someone who is so afraid of the others

295

The teacher worried about the student,

321
00:22:39,152 --> 00:22:41,655
so he took it upon himself to quit.

322
00:22:42,155 --> 00:22:44,992
And so,
the student went to his house to beg.

323
00:22:46,451 --> 00:22:49,705
