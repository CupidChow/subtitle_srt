388

he faced many personal struggles,

such as a troubled love life
and a continued loss of hearing.

In Beethoven's biography,
his assistant Anton Schindler

454
00:34:01,417 --> 00:34:03,044
quoted Beethoven as having said

455
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:05,296
that the first movement represented

She's shooting a documentary

- I have one last question.

730
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:07,859
You're Hanphil's youngest concertmaster.

What is your goal?

732
00:51:11,279 --> 00:51:13,698
I want to continue working with Seeum.

[Luna] Hmm.

I want to work with Seeum

736
00:51:19,996 --> 00:51:23,833

We should have given out
