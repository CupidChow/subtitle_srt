00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,427
I'm sorry, Mom.

7
00:01:37,473 --> 00:01:40,935
I didn't come to visit,
even though I knew you wanted to see me.

8
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,652
I was scared.

9
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:53,781
Seeing how you've changed…

10
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:08,004
I was scared I would become like you.

11
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:26,731
Mom.

12
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,196
Seeum…

13
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,747
Do you recognize me?

14
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,170
Seeum.

15
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:57,553
Yes.

16
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:03,184
I missed you.

17
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:14,195
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,915
I'm…

19
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,085
I'm…

20
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,048
sorry.

21
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:52,191
Seeum.

22
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:58,906
You're not
going to become like me.

23
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,870
Don't let it find you.

24
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,957
Mons…

25
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:13,629
Don't let the monster…

26
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:18,342
catch you.

27
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,846
The monster…

28
00:04:31,731 --> 00:04:33,107
Mom.

29
00:04:35,317 --> 00:04:36,318

Seeum, help me.

33
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,723
Don't press it!

34
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:08,058
Don't press it!

35
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:17,026
Don't press it!

36
00:05:36,128 --> 00:05:38,568
- Junghwa, you need to calm down.
- Kill me, please.

37
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,050
- You'll be fine.
- Help me, please!

38
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,968
It’s okay, Junghwa.

39
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,303
Lower her head.

40
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,679
Ms. Bae, are you okay?

41
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:46,931
Ms. Bae!

42
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,974
Get the sedatives.

43
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,476
Add one more ampoule.

Once you finish treatment,
come visit me in New York.

47
00:08:07,446 --> 00:08:09,114
You can come see me at music school.

48
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,118
I wouldn't miss it for the world.

00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,385

50
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,680

<i>She has Remington's disease.</i>

52
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,435
<i>Unfortunately, it's hereditary.</i>

53
00:08:40,229 --> 00:08:43,148

56
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,536
Morning.

57
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,507
Is that Junghwa’s violin?

58
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:34,843
Yes.

59
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:48,649
This was the first violin you ever made.

60
00:10:48,941 --> 00:10:50,025
Right?

61
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,445
That's right.

62
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,616
She used to love it.

63
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:01,203
I’m sure…

64
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:06,041
she’s in a better place now.

65
00:11:09,878 --> 00:11:10,921
I know.

66
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,091
She must be feeling better now.

67
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:23,493
My goodness,
why are you back so soon?

68
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:25,245
You were supposed to take some time off.

69
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:26,455
I’m fine.

70
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,624
I heard they've finished fixing
the rehearsal room.

71
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,667
Yes, it's as good as new.

72
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:32,377
Do you want to see?

73
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,517
Looks great.

74
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,896
Not sure what I would have done
without Mr. Yoo.

75
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:54,524
Well, you see,

76
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,736
he paid for all the repairs
because insurance didn't cover it.

77
00:12:57,861 --> 00:13:00,989
Even the damaged instruments
were reimbursed.

78
00:13:01,156 --> 00:13:02,950
No expense was spared.

79
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:08,747
So we can start
rehearsing again this afternoon?

80
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,145
We got a notice to go
to the rehearsal room later.

81
00:13:14,169 --> 00:13:16,338
- Really?
- Is Seeum back already?

82
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,173
She came in to work today.

83
00:13:18,382 --> 00:13:21,176
It must be really hard for her right now.

84
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:25,806
I heard Ms. Bae started showing symptoms
when she was around Seeum’s age.

85
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,642
Man,
she battled it for a long time.

86
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:30,435
When she was Seeum’s age?

87
00:13:30,852 --> 00:13:33,563
That means Seeum could be...

88
00:13:33,647 --> 00:13:36,650
That isn't something
you should say lightly.

89
00:13:37,693 --> 00:13:42,072
Hey, did anyone see
Professor Kim at the funeral?

90
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,824
I didn’t see him.

91
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:46,743
Neither did I.

92
00:13:47,119 --> 00:13:48,370
Come to think of it,

93
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,707
Ajin missed the funeral too.

94
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:57,337
Maybe they went on their own
instead of going with us.

95
00:13:57,796 --> 00:13:58,839
Something's off.

96
00:13:59,131 --> 00:14:03,176
Doesn't Ajin seem
a little different these days?

97
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,387
What I mean is,

98
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,223
doesn't her aura seem
completely different?

99
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,392
It does.

100
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:14,187
Maybe those rumors about the affair…

Didn't you just take some pills?

106
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:47,971
Oh...

107
00:14:48,638 --> 00:14:51,266
- They're just supplements.
- Really?

108
00:14:52,184 --> 00:14:53,685
You look a little haggard.

109
00:14:54,561 --> 00:14:55,761
Make sure you're eating right.

110
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,024
I will.

111
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,285
What do you mean?

PROF KIM
VACATE THE APT

113
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:14,748
Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

114
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,709
I'm supposed to start teaching there
next week.

115
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,371
<i>I'm sorry, Professor Kim.</i>

116
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,965
At least tell me what this is all about!

117
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:26,802
<i>Out of the blue...</i>

118
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,846
<i>the president told me
he didn't think we could hire you.</i>

119
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,807
<i>I plan to stand</i>

120
00:15:32,182 --> 00:15:35,268
in the way of everything this man does.

121
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,853
With a vengeance.

122
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,272
Wait,

123
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:42,901
does Yoo Jeongjae from UC Financial
have anything to do with this?

124
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:45,779
<i>No. Well, not necessarily.</i>

125
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,906
<i>Anyway, I'm really sorry about this.</i>

126
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:51,034
<i>I'll be in touch, Professor Kim.</i>

127
00:16:00,836 --> 00:16:02,754
Ah, Ms. Go.

128
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:05,382
I couldn't get hold of you,

129
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:06,925
and your office was empty.

130
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,722
If I'd come any later,
I wouldn't have found you here either.

131
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,225
I'm sorry.

132
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,018
No need to apologize.

133
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,438
I sent you the documentary contract.

134
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:20,981
Why didn't you reply?

135
00:16:21,982 --> 00:16:23,233
I'm sorry,

136
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:26,153
but I can't do that documentary.

137
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:27,821
What did you say?

138
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:29,614
I don't think it'll work.

139
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,741
I don't need an apology from you.

140
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:35,871
What I want is for you and Cha Seeum
to appear as a loving couple

141
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:37,831
in the documentary.

142
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,878
The only thing I can say
is that I'm sorry.

143
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,005
You said you'd be able to change her mind.

144
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,966
Then suddenly you disappear,
and now you're saying you can't do it?

145
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,593
You're kidding, right?

146
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,346
Did you think I would just let it go?

147
00:16:55,432 --> 00:16:56,600
Excuse me?

148
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,937
I believe in an eye for an eye.

149
00:17:01,021 --> 00:17:02,189
In fact,

150
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,483
I'll take two eyes.

151
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,644
A blind audition for everyone?

152
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,773
Yes, I'm trying to get an accurate picture
of everyone's skill level.

153
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:49,486
But you didn't even discuss it with me…

154
00:17:50,529 --> 00:17:52,322
That's why I'm telling you now.

155
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:57,118
Seeum, are you confusing this
with blind recruitment,

156
00:17:57,244 --> 00:17:58,495
where we pick new members?

157
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,914
Actually, I think the orchestra
should be evaluated.

158
00:18:01,081 --> 00:18:04,376
As part of the testing process,
I'll also invite all the guest performers.

159
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,003
But we've already passed that test.

160
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:08,857
- And you're suddenly...
- That's good.

161
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:11,591
It won't be a problem
if you have the skills.

162
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,804
And if we don't pass the test?

163
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,767
As I said on the first day,
you'll have to leave the orchestra.

164
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,772
The members are all permanent employees.

165
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:27,607
You can't just do this,

166
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:29,943
even if you are the conductor.

167
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,487
That's why we have unions.

168
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:36,783
Think of it as an employee
performance review at a regular company.

169
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,160
Permanent employees can be fired

170
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:40,912
if they don't have the skills.

171
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:42,956
I don't understand

172
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,417
why you're suddenly doing this.

173
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,020
I heard our last concert
was better than the city orchestra's...

174
00:18:48,044 --> 00:18:49,629
I'll be honest with you.

175
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,339
Your last performance…

176
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:54,134
was the worst.

177
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,397
So you did better
than someone else.

178
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,014
Are you satisfied with that?

179
00:18:59,139 --> 00:19:00,599
It wasn't as good as rehearsal.

180
00:19:00,724 --> 00:19:02,564
In other words,
it didn't meet my expectations.

181
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:05,270
So, I feel the need to reevaluate.

182
00:19:07,606 --> 00:19:10,859
Becoming the best orchestra
doesn't just happen.

183
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,237
I'm all for it.

184
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,075
You should leave
if you aren't good enough.

185
00:19:19,743 --> 00:19:20,952
But still…

186
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:24,831
Tests can make some people nervous.

187
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:28,460
How come you're all doubting yourselves?

188
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,337
You know how talented you are.

189
00:19:30,503 --> 00:19:32,088
Besides, we're all employees here.

190
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:36,384
As she said, let's think of this
as an employee performance review.

191
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:37,886
Okay, then.

192
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,804
Your performance of <i>Symphony No. 1</i>

193
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:42,891
will be evaluated tomorrow
in the rehearsal room.

194
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:44,267
Thank you, everyone.

195
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,357
This doesn't make any sense.

196
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,733
I'm getting a headache.

197
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,860
Seriously…

198
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,783
Seeum!

199
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,328
Are you doing this to get rid of me?

200
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:05,580
You don't seem sure about your skills.

201
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:09,542
Why would I put everyone through
all this trouble just to get rid of you?

202
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:13,296
You better be telling the truth.

203
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,965
If not, I won't stand for it.

204
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:18,051
You'd be better off practicing right now.

205
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:20,011
Unless you want to get fired.

206
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,436
<i>Has she lost her mind?</i>

207
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:31,272
Why does she act like this?

208
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,566
If you take even one step closer to her,

209
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:36,319
it feels like she takes three steps back.

210
00:20:36,778 --> 00:20:39,280
Tomorrow's the big day.
What should I do?

211
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:41,908
We already have so many violinists.

212
00:20:42,158 --> 00:20:44,244
Let's just do it.

213
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,788
It's our performance review. Cheers.

214
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,752
Hey, Jiae.

215
00:20:53,211 --> 00:20:55,630
Why did you come alone?
Where's your buddy?

216
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,509
Oh. She said she was busy,
so she couldn't join us.

217
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:04,973
Maybe she's practicing on her own.

218
00:21:05,473 --> 00:21:07,475
- There's no way.
- Come on.

219
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,523
Hmm?

220
00:21:18,653 --> 00:21:19,779
Hey!

221
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:22,157
I just remembered
I have something to do at home.

222
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,451
I need to go.

223
00:21:24,576 --> 00:21:25,618
Just like that?

224
00:21:28,413 --> 00:21:30,290
I forgot about my grandma's
memorial service.

225
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,709
- Goodness.
- Wasn't that a few months ago?

226
00:21:33,877 --> 00:21:35,336
For my other grandma.

227
00:21:35,462 --> 00:21:36,796
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

228
00:21:36,921 --> 00:21:37,964
Wait...

229
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:41,509
Cheers.

230
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:43,678
Come on, cheers!

231
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,305
I'm sorry.

232
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,058
The next one's on me.

233
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:52,631
- I'm sorry.
- It's fine.

234
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:54,606
You can do it!

235
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:24,844
Something was going on at
Kim Horyeong's place, so I investigated.

236
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,556
I think Kim Bongju ran away.

237
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:32,560
He ran away…

238
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,287
<i>There's a rumor
that Chairman Yoo Jeongjae</i>

239
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,313
<i>took over Hanphil because of Cha Seeum.</i>

240
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,190
<i>It seems they were an item years ago.</i>

241
00:23:22,402 --> 00:23:24,696
Is this because of Seeum?

242
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,333
Damn it.

243
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:42,672
It was because of her?

244
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:46,551
I can't believe this.

245
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:53,600
<i>I booked your flight. Get ready.</i>

246
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:01,524
I should give her
a surprise gift before I go.

247
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,976
Man, this is going to be tough.

248
00:24:40,229 --> 00:24:41,397
REMOTE SMART PARKING ASSIST 2

249
00:24:48,488 --> 00:24:49,572
REMOTE PARKING

250
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,259
Wow, that's nice.

251
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:19,268
I like it. It's so smart.
Just like someone I know.

252
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:32,073
First of all, I'm glad to see you.

253
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:35,410
But,

254
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:38,788
I'm not sure if I'm qualified to judge.

255
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,373
It's not my area of expertise.

256
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,251
Your job is to listen
on behalf of the audience.

257
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:45,574
Being the chairman makes you
plenty qualified to do that.

258
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:47,422
Right.

259
00:25:51,134 --> 00:25:52,343
I heard that

260
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:56,472
you paid for the room repairs
and compensated for the instruments.

261
00:25:57,807 --> 00:25:58,933
Did I do that?

262
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:02,311
Thank you.

263
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:09,652
What did you say?

264
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,282
Say that again.

265
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:16,868
I don't like to repeat myself.

266
00:26:21,164 --> 00:26:22,206
I already heard you.

267
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:26,252
Hello.
It's nice to see you, Mr. Yoo.

268
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:28,004
Let me introduce you to someone.

269
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,631
This is Oh Hyeonseok,
our assistant conductor

270
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:32,258
and Hanphil's pillar of strength.

271
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:34,052
Nice to meet you.

272
00:26:35,094 --> 00:26:36,137
Likewise.

273
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,973
I'm Hanphil's assistant conductor,
Oh Hyeonseok.

274
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:40,433
I'm Yoo Jeongjae.

275
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,143
Man…

276
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,812
You're as handsome as they say.

277
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,192
Who would say such a thing?

278
00:26:53,071 --> 00:26:54,238
Excuse me?

279
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,865
I'll take them out to dinner

280
00:26:56,616 --> 00:26:57,742
so I can thank them.

281
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,621
That would be me.

282
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:02,997
You can buy me dinner.

283
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,582
- Let's all sit.
- Here.

284
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:06,876
Have a seat.

285
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,255
Why are you taking off your shoes?

286
00:27:12,006 --> 00:27:13,007
Oh...

287
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:16,260
You can tell a woman from a man
by the sound of their shoes.

288
00:27:16,385 --> 00:27:19,388
So at Hanphil,
women traditionally take them off.

289
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,016
Does that count
as gender discrimination or equality?

290
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,684
Well…

291
00:27:24,102 --> 00:27:27,355
Since Seeum told the men
to remove their shoes as well,

292
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,815
it must be equality, right?

293
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:31,400
Oh.

294
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,903
Luna,

295
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,697
I'm sure you'll do great,

296
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,407
but good luck anyway.

297
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,158
Wait,

298
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:04,035
are you serious about firing them?

299
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:07,455
The others agreed
that their performances were subpar.

300
00:29:07,872 --> 00:29:09,248
I know that, but still,

301
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:12,001
they're not guest performers.
They're permanent members.

302
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,420
We're in for another mess.

303
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,382
Yes, come in.

304
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:22,053
You wanted to see us?

305
00:29:25,264 --> 00:29:26,807
CEO ROOM

306
00:29:29,227 --> 00:29:32,063
What do you think will happen
to those two?

307
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:35,233
Earlier, I overheard them…

308
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:36,859
And?

309
00:29:41,364 --> 00:29:43,324
We're getting fired? Why?

310
00:29:44,367 --> 00:29:46,247
Your breathing is erratic,
and you keep lagging.

311
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:48,829
I saw a lot of issues.

312
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,831
Well,

313
00:29:51,457 --> 00:29:52,541
we were both

314
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,086
just nervous today.

315
00:29:55,211 --> 00:29:57,922
Of course. There's something
nerve-wracking about a test.

316
00:29:58,172 --> 00:29:59,757
Today's not the first time.

317
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,968
Could it be a lack of practice

318
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,554
or are you doing something
you shouldn't be?

319
00:30:10,601 --> 00:30:11,811
If it's the latter,

320
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:14,272
it's all the more reason
you can't stay in the orchestra.

321
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,953
<i>So,</i>

322
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,455
did you really get fired?

323
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,332
Stop laughing.

324
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,296
Why is he getting so worked up?

325
00:30:41,716 --> 00:30:44,093
What is he saying?

326
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,346
Hey.

327
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:49,348
What is this?

328
00:30:51,434 --> 00:30:54,312
You are under arrest
for violating the Narcotics Control Act.

329
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:57,231
You have the right to remain silent
and the right to an attorney.

330
00:30:57,315 --> 00:30:58,357
- Arrest them.
- Yes, sir.

331
00:30:59,025 --> 00:31:01,444
Detective…

332
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,914
Excuse me, how did you get in here?

333
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,541
We're here on official business.

334
00:31:16,125 --> 00:31:18,145
What kind of official business
would bring cops here?

335
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,505
Oh Minjun and Jeong Suhyeon are
members of this orchestra, aren't they?

336
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:23,174
They are,

337
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:24,633
but they were fired yesterday.

338
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,761
Oh, and...

339
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,429
there's one more person.

340
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,186
Time is running out.

341
00:31:35,269 --> 00:31:37,772
Hey, come on. Let's find something quick.

342
00:31:38,105 --> 00:31:39,106
Geez, man.

343
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,942
Hey, if you see anything strange,
let me know right away.

344
00:31:42,026 --> 00:31:43,694
What are you doing?

345
00:31:44,695 --> 00:31:45,780
Well, hello.

346
00:31:48,866 --> 00:31:50,409
I would appreciate your cooperation.

347
00:31:50,493 --> 00:31:52,912
SEARCH AND SEIZURE WARRANT
NARCOTICS CONTROL ACT VIOLATION

348
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:57,875
Are we good?

349
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:02,004
I found it!

350
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,884
Will you look at that?

351
00:32:09,845 --> 00:32:10,888
Ms. Cha Seeum.

352
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:20,106
What do you mean, arrested?
What did Seeum do?

353
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,399
<i>They found drugs in her office.</i>

354
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,484
What?

355
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,445
The members who were fired yesterday

356
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:28,697
confessed to getting drugs from Seeum.

357
00:32:38,874 --> 00:32:40,674
<i>We have a serious problem.</i>

358
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,086
What happened?

359
00:32:42,211 --> 00:32:43,504
<i>It's about Seeum…</i>

360
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:45,798
The police came and took her.

361
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,467
What?

362
00:32:50,428 --> 00:32:51,804
Our paths keep crossing.

363
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,516
I know. It would be better
if we didn't see each other so often.

364
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,270
So far, you seem very relaxed.

365
00:32:59,353 --> 00:33:00,479
I have nothing to hide.

366
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:07,695
Oh Minjun and Jeong Suhyeon
both testified that you gave them drugs.

367
00:33:07,862 --> 00:33:09,989
We also found evidence in your office.

368
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:13,701
We have obtained witnesses,
testimonies, and evidence.

369
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:15,911
Okay, so what?

370
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:18,664
Your confession
would be greatly appreciated.

371
00:33:20,124 --> 00:33:22,460
Unfortunately, that will never happen.

372
00:33:24,545 --> 00:33:28,799
It will be interesting to see
how long you can remain relaxed.

373
00:33:29,091 --> 00:33:32,136
This is an arrest without a warrant,
so it's 48 hours, right?

374
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:34,680
That's right.

375
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:38,392
This will waste a lot of time.

376
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:48,861
I'll be representing Cha Seeum.

377
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:54,325
You're well-prepared
for someone with nothing to hide.

378
00:33:55,784 --> 00:33:57,870
I never hired a lawyer.

379
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:01,373
I was sent by Chairman Yoo Jeongjae.

380
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,210
From now on, you can talk to me.

381
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:10,883
I'm not sure I can do that.

382
00:34:11,008 --> 00:34:13,677
We have witnesses and evidence.

383
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:16,472
We can't release her right now.

384
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,140
Chief.

385
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,643
I know she's not that kind of person.

386
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:22,770
But…

387
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:25,397
I am not simply asking for a favor.

388
00:34:26,232 --> 00:34:30,152
But there are certain procedures...

389
00:34:40,788 --> 00:34:43,148
I'll meet with someone higher up
so I can bypass procedures,

390
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:47,419
and you won't be held accountable.

391
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:50,839
Mr. Yoo.

392
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:06,772
I'm a little busy right now,
so I hope you won't waste my time.

393
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:11,986
Of course.

394
00:35:12,987 --> 00:35:15,406
I'm sure it will help Seeum with her case.

395
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,700
Okay, start talking, then.

396
00:35:20,327 --> 00:35:21,996
Something was off that day.

397
00:35:26,584 --> 00:35:27,793
Did you do well?

398
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:29,670
Oh...

399
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,297
I think so.

400
00:35:32,965 --> 00:35:34,008
I'll be off now.

401
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,207
<i>They usually leave deliveries
at the information desk.</i>

402
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:49,023
<i>The driver paused when he saw me,
which I found strange.</i>

403
00:35:53,569 --> 00:35:55,070
<i>So I looked back.</i>

404
00:35:57,156 --> 00:35:59,158
<i>His physique and the way he walked…</i>

405
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,911
reminded me of Bongju.

406
00:36:05,456 --> 00:36:06,665
I'm sure it was him.

407
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,253
Are you saying Bongju
came out of Seeum's office?

408
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:13,339
Yes.

409
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:17,217
I should have noticed
something was wrong right then.

410
00:36:21,388 --> 00:36:23,057
Is Seeum going to be okay?

411
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,934
I'll do whatever it takes
to make sure she's okay.

412
00:36:29,563 --> 00:36:32,024
I need you
to listen carefully, Mr. Park.

413
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,277
Look into the delivery driver
that came to Hanphil yesterday.

414
00:36:35,361 --> 00:36:38,030
Check surveillance cameras, dashcams,
and whatever else you need to

415
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,782
to find that bastard.

416
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:41,825
<i>So,</i>

417
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:44,328
I look forward to reading
your news article.

418
00:37:31,709 --> 00:37:34,378
Oh Minjun and Jeong Suhyeon
are in the next room.

419
00:37:34,586 --> 00:37:35,587
What about the drugs?

420
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,464
Everything's laid out for them.

421
00:37:41,009 --> 00:37:42,219
You can go now.

422
00:37:42,511 --> 00:37:43,595
Yes, sir.

423
00:37:52,646 --> 00:37:54,732
Hi, I'm at a club right now,

424
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,067
and I think people in the next room
are doing drugs.

425
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,083
<i>Tell them you got the drugs
from Seeum.</i>

426
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:12,833
<i>She was the one
who called the police.</i>

427
00:38:22,009 --> 00:38:24,219
You shouldn't have messed with me.

428
00:38:35,022 --> 00:38:37,816
Now, get out of here and out of my life.

429
00:38:56,627 --> 00:38:59,588
Can I just see her for a moment?

430
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,672
I'm sorry.

431
00:39:00,923 --> 00:39:03,926
She's being interrogated right now,
so no family visits.

432
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,638
We need to talk about
getting her a lawyer…

433
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:10,557
Ms. Cha has already found a lawyer.

434
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,029
If you'll excuse me.

435
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,776
Pops!

436
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:22,402
Hey.

437
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:26,365
There's no point in going
to the police station tonight.

438
00:39:26,448 --> 00:39:27,842
They won't allow visitors at night...

439
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:29,576
Even if that's true, I need to go.

440
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,660
I'll feel better that way.

441
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:35,290
Seeum called and told us not to worry
since it was all a misunderstanding.

442
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:36,959
Still...

443
00:39:37,793 --> 00:39:40,712
She won't feel comfortable
with you guarding the station.

444
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:42,923
She's probably already feeling bad.

445
00:39:44,675 --> 00:39:47,761
She has a lawyer, so it'll be fine.

446
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:50,305
You believe in Seeum, right?

447
00:39:50,806 --> 00:39:53,100
Of course I do, but...

448
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:55,102
Just go back upstairs, then, okay?

449
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:59,231
I promised her
that I wouldn't let you go visit her.

450
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,695
Go on now.

451
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:09,324
Is this how you've been
developing the orchestra?

452
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:13,537
"Creating miracles by taking a third-rate
orchestra and making it first-class."

453
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:16,290
Did that method involve drugs?

454
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,417
That was out of line.

455
00:40:19,209 --> 00:40:21,289
Members of the Pittsriver Phil
where you used to work

456
00:40:21,336 --> 00:40:24,089
were also involved in a drug case.

457
00:40:27,134 --> 00:40:28,844
Are you an aspiring novelist?

458
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,471
This isn't an investigation, it's a novel.

459
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:33,974
Look here, Ms. Cha.

460
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:36,768
Watch yourself.
You're pushing this too far.

461
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:13,055
<i>Any updates on Seeum?</i>

462
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:15,057
KIM TAEHO

463
00:41:20,479 --> 00:41:22,272
<i>No, not yet…</i>

464
00:41:30,322 --> 00:41:33,283
Luna, have you seen your sister?

465
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:35,160
We planned to look at houses today…

466
00:41:38,956 --> 00:41:41,375
Uh, is everything okay, Luna?

467
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,251
You look…

468
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,338
I…

469
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,841
What's wrong?

470
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:54,888
Uh, you can tell me.

471
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,725
Cha Seeum's rapid test

472
00:41:59,226 --> 00:42:01,103
came back negative.

473
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,855
We're still waiting
on the hair strand test.

474
00:42:03,939 --> 00:42:07,442
Those results take 15 days.

475
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:11,446
Negative results don't prove
that she didn't distribute drugs.

476
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:12,864
Honestly,

477
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:15,659
this case wasn't even ours.

478
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,704
You just went and got it for us.

479
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:20,829
It was the same as the case
of the tampered brakes,

480
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:22,124
and now you've done it again.

481
00:42:22,582 --> 00:42:24,001
Why is this happening?

482
00:42:24,126 --> 00:42:26,837
There's so much else we should be doing.

483
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,256
It's a different case,

484
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,092
but the suspect is the same.

485
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,511
Geez. Come on…

486
00:42:37,014 --> 00:42:38,724
What on earth is she doing?

487
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:40,392
Huh?

488
00:42:57,868 --> 00:43:00,120
SEOUL POLICE DEPARTMENT

489
00:43:09,504 --> 00:43:10,964
What are you doing right now?

490
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,550
I don't want to waste time.

491
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:18,764
I'm ready to begin.

492
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,307
Ah.

493
00:43:20,474 --> 00:43:24,394
Would you mind
if I asked you something this time?

494
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,271
No, go ahead.

495
00:43:26,563 --> 00:43:28,231
When, where, and how did Oh Minjun

496
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:30,859
and Jeong Suhyeon get the drugs from me?

497
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:32,360
What?

498
00:43:32,778 --> 00:43:35,030
When, where, and how did they get them?

499
00:43:36,907 --> 00:43:38,742
Seeum gave them to us in her office.

500
00:43:39,659 --> 00:43:42,287
The idea of doing drugs
never crossed my mind.

501
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:48,043
But she said everyone does them
in the States, so it wasn't a problem.

502
00:43:48,502 --> 00:43:50,087
That's what she told me.

503
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:53,673
Seeum was very coercive.

504
00:43:54,216 --> 00:43:56,426
Then I became more addicted…

505
00:43:56,718 --> 00:43:58,303
This all feels unfair.

506
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:01,223
This will be easier than I thought.

507
00:44:02,057 --> 00:44:05,936
I heard the hair strand drug test
tells you what drug you used and when.

508
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:10,565
I'm pretty sure they started taking drugs
before I came to Hanphil.

509
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:14,402
As far as I'm concerned,
they were already in bad shape.

510
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:15,904
That's why I fired them.

511
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:19,032
So you knew from the start

512
00:44:19,116 --> 00:44:20,200
that they were doing drugs?

513
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:21,868
It was just a guess.

514
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:25,872
You seem to know a lot about drugs.

515
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,545
- That's the conclusion you're drawing?
- Just answer the question.

516
00:44:34,548 --> 00:44:38,135
I listen to the breath
of every single one of my members.

517
00:44:38,468 --> 00:44:40,345
I can always tell
when something goes wrong.

518
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:44,057
And when those two don't breathe right,
their instruments sound different.

519
00:44:45,684 --> 00:44:47,394
So conductors know everything?

520
00:44:47,519 --> 00:44:50,814
Why would I offer drugs to the members
when I expect perfection from them?

521
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:56,444
Unless using them
would significantly improve their skills.

522
00:44:58,905 --> 00:45:01,616
I would never do anything
to ruin my orchestra.

523
00:45:09,791 --> 00:45:13,211
There's someone here
who claims to be a witness.

524
00:45:23,471 --> 00:45:27,517
We didn't try to find a witness,
but one showed up anyway.

525
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:32,063
But everything he said is true.

526
00:45:34,065 --> 00:45:35,692
Cha's test came out negative.

527
00:45:35,984 --> 00:45:38,653
Also, I don't think
she needs to sell drugs

528
00:45:38,737 --> 00:45:41,156
to make money.

529
00:45:41,448 --> 00:45:43,408
As for Oh Minjun and Jeong Suhyeon,

530
00:45:43,575 --> 00:45:46,620
they may have been holding a grudge
after getting fired.

531
00:45:47,370 --> 00:45:51,291
So if what that man is saying is true,
Kim Bongju planned all this?

532
00:45:51,499 --> 00:45:54,044
It makes sense under the circumstances.

533
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,594
Let's find out where Kim Bongju is.

534
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:03,845
Yes, sir.

535
00:46:04,221 --> 00:46:06,890
SEOUL POLICE DEPARTMENT

536
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:16,191
You must be tired.

537
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:19,110
You too.

538
00:46:21,196 --> 00:46:22,822
I assume you brought the witness?

539
00:46:26,493 --> 00:46:27,786
<i>Uh...</i>

540
00:46:27,994 --> 00:46:29,663
<i>You're close to Kim Bongju, right?</i>

541
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:32,249
Excuse me?

542
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:35,335
When he was running from his father,

543
00:46:35,752 --> 00:46:39,130
I heard you gave him a place to hide
and a burner phone.

544
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,799
Uh...

545
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:43,385
- Well...
- Did you do anything else?

546
00:46:44,886 --> 00:46:46,972
I didn't do anything for him.

547
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,432
Didn't he ask you to let him know

548
00:46:49,808 --> 00:46:50,934
when Oh Minjun

549
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,937
and Jeong Suhyeon showed up at the club?

550
00:46:55,272 --> 00:46:56,314
How did you know that?

551
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,191
And when you told him, the cops showed up.

552
00:46:58,525 --> 00:46:59,859
Yes, that's right.

553
00:46:59,943 --> 00:47:01,987
So now, our club's been shut down.

554
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,238
That's too bad.

555
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,783
Are you saying Bongju called the cops?

556
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:09,744
Damn it, that bastard!

557
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:12,455
He threw me a few bucks
and put me out of a job.

558
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:18,144
And you know something else, don't you?

559
00:47:18,253 --> 00:47:19,254
What?

560
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,131
That he was doing drugs.

561
00:47:24,426 --> 00:47:25,552
And he also sold them.

562
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:36,146
Neither Oh Minjun nor Jeong Suhyeon
seem to know Bongju gave them the drugs.

563
00:47:36,229 --> 00:47:37,605
But you seem to know that.

564
00:47:41,568 --> 00:47:44,821
All you have to do is
be an innocent witness.

565
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:50,869
Let's go.

566
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:53,079
I'll take you home.

567
00:48:25,779 --> 00:48:26,863
Thank you.

568
00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,239
Seeum.

569
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:31,826
You have something to say?

570
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,831
If not, go home.

571
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,250
I think

572
00:48:40,001 --> 00:48:43,546
Bongju is doing this because of me.

573
00:48:48,259 --> 00:48:51,930
He's the one who leaked those photos
of your husband's affair, and I...

574
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,390
It's fine.

575
00:48:55,058 --> 00:48:56,518
Anyway, it's all over.

576
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:00,313
Good night.

577
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,837
Dad, don't worry, everything's fine.

578
00:49:24,421 --> 00:49:25,547
Have a good night.

579
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,673
Bye.

580
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,383
Seeum.

581
00:49:33,054 --> 00:49:34,534
What are you doing here at this hour?

582
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,433
Oh...

583
00:49:36,850 --> 00:49:38,017
I was worried.

584
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:43,064
I asked Taeho, and he told me
you were coming home today.

585
00:49:46,192 --> 00:49:47,652
Is everything all right with you?

586
00:49:52,157 --> 00:49:53,408
Let's go inside.

587
00:49:57,287 --> 00:49:58,413
Feel free to take a seat.

588
00:49:58,872 --> 00:49:59,873
Okay.

589
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:07,797
Was it awful?

590
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:09,757
I'm fine.

591
00:50:11,676 --> 00:50:13,761
I never thought Bongju would go this far…

592
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:16,389
How did you know?

593
00:50:19,017 --> 00:50:22,770
Actually, I saw him
coming out of your office.

594
00:50:23,313 --> 00:50:25,273
I didn't recognize him at the time.

595
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:28,985
If I had known he would do this…

596
00:50:31,154 --> 00:50:32,947
That's enough.

597
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:36,201
From now on,
let's just focus on the concert.

598
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:37,577
Seeum.

599
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:40,663
We'll start rehearsing tomorrow,
so get ready.

600
00:50:44,042 --> 00:50:47,462
It might be hard to do that.

601
00:50:59,849 --> 00:51:04,938
IT'S OVER FOR DRUG ENABLER CHA SEEUM
GET RID OF DRUG QUEEN CHA SEEUM

602
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,191
I told you there was nothing to see here.

603
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:10,151
Mr. Jeon said you should rest...

604
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:11,903
Seeum!

605
00:51:17,116 --> 00:51:18,785
8282 QUICK PICKUP

606
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:33,633
DRUGGIE CHA SEEUM
HANPHIL'S SHOCKING NEWS

607
00:51:36,928 --> 00:51:38,096
Okay.

608
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:40,292
Get rid of everything.

609
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:45,353
This is all outside Hanphil?

610
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:47,897
What about the media?

611
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,566
So far, I've blocked everything.

612
00:51:49,857 --> 00:51:52,318
But when it comes to social media
and online communities,

613
00:51:52,694 --> 00:51:54,487
posts keep popping up.

614
00:51:56,447 --> 00:51:59,075
IT'S OVER FOR DRUG ENABLER CHA SEEUM

615
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:05,331
Tell them to report that
Kim Horyeong's son Kim Bongju

616
00:52:05,415 --> 00:52:06,499
is the one responsible.

617
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:08,334
Neither Hanphil nor Seeum are involved.

618
00:52:11,421 --> 00:52:13,423
Emphasize that he's the son
of an assemblyman.

619
00:52:14,882 --> 00:52:16,134
Yes, sir.

620
00:52:29,105 --> 00:52:30,189
Yes?

621
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:43,953
I told you not to come.

622
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:47,790
Whatever is out there
doesn't matter to me.

623
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,337
I canceled today's rehearsal.

624
00:52:52,712 --> 00:52:54,297
And the members aren't coming.

625
00:52:58,259 --> 00:52:59,594
What do you mean?

626
00:53:00,053 --> 00:53:02,764
You didn't do anything wrong,
and I'm sure you're frustrated.

627
00:53:03,264 --> 00:53:06,726
But news reports and rumors
say you're under police investigation.

628
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:11,939
I'll just be honest with you.

629
00:53:12,649 --> 00:53:13,858
Those with Hanphil memberships

630
00:53:13,941 --> 00:53:16,527
protested and asked
that the concert be canceled.

631
00:53:16,653 --> 00:53:18,404
About half of the members
said they'd quit.

632
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:22,367
This incident has shaken everyone up.

633
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:24,202
So,

634
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:28,331
let's wait. We just need time to regroup.

635
00:53:28,414 --> 00:53:29,999
Take some time to rest.

636
00:53:30,958 --> 00:53:32,085
For how long?

637
00:53:33,836 --> 00:53:35,088
Until things settle down?

638
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,926
Does it end when I quit?

639
00:53:40,927 --> 00:53:42,261
It's not like that...

640
00:53:42,387 --> 00:53:44,430
I'm afraid I can't do that.

641
00:53:46,516 --> 00:53:48,226
If and when I do decide to quit,

642
00:53:49,143 --> 00:53:51,729
it won't be because
of this ridiculous accusation.

643
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:54,357
And there's no way

644
00:53:54,524 --> 00:53:55,900
that lousy concert we put on

645
00:53:56,693 --> 00:53:58,236
is going to be my last.

646
00:53:58,361 --> 00:54:00,029
- But now it's...
- Mr. Jeon.

647
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:01,489
Now's not the time!

648
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:04,325
I'm not backing down this time.

649
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,120
If this continues,
Hanphil's done for good.

650
00:54:09,622 --> 00:54:11,182
Just until things settle down.

651
00:54:12,375 --> 00:54:14,210
It's time that you follow my lead.

652
00:54:56,252 --> 00:54:58,092
<i>He's the one
who leaked those photos</i>

653
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:00,006
of your husband's affair, and I...

654
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:02,049
I never thought Bongju would go this far…

655
00:55:03,342 --> 00:55:05,303
<i>I'm not backing down this time.</i>

656
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:07,597
If this continues,
Hanphil's done for good.

657
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,640
Just until things settle down.

658
00:55:10,224 --> 00:55:12,268
It's time that you follow my lead.

659
00:55:59,982 --> 00:56:01,108
Hello?

660
00:56:02,652 --> 00:56:04,237
<i>Seeum, this is Bongju.</i>

661
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,657
<i>We should meet.</i>

662
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:10,451
There's something I need to show you.

663
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,832
Where are you right now?

664
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:43,698
<i>Where are you right now?</i>

665
00:57:43,878 --> 00:57:45,158
<i>I think we should meet.</i>

666
00:57:45,755 --> 00:57:47,548
<i>There's something I need to show you.</i>

667
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,551
I'll wait for you in front of Hanphil.

668
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:10,988
Hello?

669
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,032
<i>This is Detective Choo Dongsik.</i>

<i>What are you looking for?</i>

683
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:25,896
<i>We suspect foul play.</i>

684
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:28,149
<i>Strange things keep happening around her.</i>

685
00:59:28,315 --> 00:59:29,984
But where did you go?

686
00:59:30,067 --> 00:59:31,944
<i>You don't remember
that night, do you?</i>

687
00:59:32,111 --> 00:59:33,380
I don't remember anything.

688
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:35,448
<i>In the event your spouse dies…</i>

689
00:59:35,531 --> 00:59:37,592
<i>Didn't you want
to shoot a documentary? Let's do it.</i>

690
00:59:37,616 --> 00:59:40,536
<i>If I can generate some interest,
I'll do whatever it takes.</i>

691
00:59:40,661 --> 00:59:42,848
What do you think?
The ratings will go through the roof.

692
00:59:42,872 --> 00:59:44,790
She's using you.

693
00:59:44,874 --> 00:59:47,084
I've had enough of your little games.

694
00:59:47,209 --> 00:59:48,687
<i>Why does Hanphil mean so much to you?</i>

695
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:50,671
This could be my last orchestra.
