00:00:55,197 --> 00:00:56,239
Let's go.

7
00:00:56,406 --> 00:00:57,407
Goddamnit.

8
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:00,535
Or die here.

9
00:01:01,578 --> 00:01:02,746
Go ahead.

10
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,417
<i> Less than 5%</i>
<i>of all conductors are women,</i>

11
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:09,961
<i>but Cha Seeum is among the best,</i>
<i>regardless of gender.</i>

12
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,838
<i> Did you see the news?</i>

13
00:01:11,922 --> 00:01:13,632
You know I don't watch that stuff.

14
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:15,675
<i>Cha Seeum is coming to Korea.</i>

15
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:19,554
<i>So how could you stay away</i>

16
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,264
<i>from a husband like me for three years?</i>

17
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:25,852
<i> I haven't heard you play the piano</i>
<i>in a while. I'd like to hear it again.</i>

18
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:28,605
<i>The new music director</i>
<i>and chief conductor</i>

19
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,316
of The Hangang Philharmonic is…

20
00:01:31,441 --> 00:01:32,609
I'm Cha Seeum.

21
00:01:32,901 --> 00:01:35,737
<i>Talent trumps friendship,</i>
<i>personality, and effort.</i>

22
00:01:36,488 --> 00:01:38,406
<i>My only concern will be</i>
<i>a person's ability.</i>

23
00:01:40,283 --> 00:01:43,829
<i>Starting with our next concert,</i>
<i>our new concertmaster will be Lee Luna.</i>

24
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:48,458
How can she change concertmasters
without notifying anyone?

25
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,211
It's obvious she has no regard for us.

26
00:01:51,336 --> 00:01:52,420
So what?

27
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:54,589
There's one thing
I'd like to clarify.

28
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:58,009
A conductor can leave,
but the orchestra will remain.

29
00:01:58,468 --> 00:02:01,596
There will be an uproar.
Are you trying to drive everyone away?

30
00:02:01,763 --> 00:02:03,265
The backlash indicates

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,393
<i>that the reform is going</i>
<i>in the right direction.</i>

32
00:02:07,102 --> 00:02:08,436
And what about you?

33
00:02:10,105 --> 00:02:11,773
<i>How qualified are you?</i>

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:15,193
You're going to visit your mom,
aren't you?

35
00:02:18,905 --> 00:02:20,407
Die!

36
00:02:20,782 --> 00:02:22,325
<i>I need…</i>

37
00:02:23,118 --> 00:02:24,286
<i>more time.</i>

38
00:02:26,121 --> 00:02:28,415
<i>Within a year, Hanphil will be on top.</i>

39
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:31,501
<i>- I'll step down if it doesn't work out.</i>
<i>- I'll give you three months.</i>

40
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,755
<i>Increase the paid attendance rate</i>
<i>to at least 50% within three months.</i>

41
00:02:39,509 --> 00:02:40,969
Your wish is modest.

42
00:02:41,845 --> 00:02:43,847
What about 90%? No.

43
00:02:45,056 --> 00:02:46,099
How about 95%?

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,437
<i>We cannot follow</i>
<i>your arbitrary decisions.</i>

45
00:02:50,812 --> 00:02:53,857
<i>You are not welcome</i>
<i>here in Hanphil.</i>

46
00:02:54,274 --> 00:02:56,943
<i>I decide where I stay.</i>

47
00:03:02,282 --> 00:03:03,867
<i>If you want to fight with me…</i>

48
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:06,995
do it through music.

49
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:10,832
Hey, what about Seeum?
Did you see her?

50
00:03:10,916 --> 00:03:12,667
Not yet.

51
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:16,171
Well, I guess it's pointless
to meet now.

52
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:18,131
Actually, we're meeting.

53
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:20,967
<i>For curiosity's sake.</i>

54
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,393
<i> It's been a long time.</i>

55
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,065
Who are you?

56
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:37,859
Right.
It's our first time meeting.

57
00:03:38,526 --> 00:03:39,903
Hello. I'm Yoo Jeongjae.

58
00:03:40,862 --> 00:03:43,865
<i> Do you by chance</i>
<i>know a guy named Yoo Jeongjae?</i>

59
00:03:44,407 --> 00:03:45,992
No. First time hearing the name.

60
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:48,536
<i> It seemed like he and Seeum</i>
<i>knew each other pretty well,</i>

61
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,872
<i>but Seeum totally pretended</i>
<i>not to know him.</i>

62
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:54,000
<i>By any chance,</i>
<i>did my wife</i>

63
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:56,127
and Yoo Jeongjae from UC Financial--

64
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,798
<i>They did date briefly a long time ago.</i>

65
00:03:59,881 --> 00:04:03,635
<i>That must have been 20 years ago.</i>
<i>Such a long time.</i>

66
00:04:04,135 --> 00:04:06,930
<i> Can you keep it a secret</i>
<i>that I know about this?</i>

67
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:09,015
<i>I don't want to worry her for no reason.</i>

68
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,603
Good morning.

69
00:04:13,979 --> 00:04:15,188
What are you doing here?

70
00:04:15,814 --> 00:04:17,315
I'm also here for work.

71
00:04:18,441 --> 00:04:20,110
<i>I bought this orchestra.</i>

72
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,988
<i>I'm the chairman of the board</i>
<i>here at Hanphil.</i>

73
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,365
<i> Is this amusing?</i>

74
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:27,867
<i>The three years</i>
<i>we were together</i>

75
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:29,703
<i>were the most fun years of my life.</i>

76
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:31,496
<i>Better than any other time.</i>

77
00:04:32,122 --> 00:04:34,165
<i>Actually, it feels like I'm still there.</i>

78
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,209
<i>So?</i>

79
00:04:37,294 --> 00:04:38,503
Just come back to me, Seeum.

80
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,172
- You really are crazy.
- Yes, I am.

81
00:04:42,674 --> 00:04:44,301
<i>I want you to get a divorce.</i>

82
00:04:44,926 --> 00:04:46,761
<i>So, I need something to threaten you with.</i>

83
00:04:48,221 --> 00:04:49,931
<i> You will never get your way.</i>

84
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,851
<i>And you think you will?</i>

85
00:04:52,934 --> 00:04:54,561
COME TO THE B1 EMERGENCY STAIRS
LEE AJIN

86
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,730
<i> But you know it's not my style</i>
<i>to give up either, right?</i>

87
00:04:58,606 --> 00:05:01,901
<i>I really didn't want you</i>
<i>to get on that podium, Seeum.</i>

88
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:32,682
Don't look.

89
00:05:46,112 --> 00:05:47,280
"EPISODE 3"

90
00:06:18,686 --> 00:06:19,729
That's about it.

91
00:06:48,508 --> 00:06:49,801
<i> When are you coming over?</i>

92
00:06:50,301 --> 00:06:51,428
<i>I miss you.</i>

93
00:06:57,308 --> 00:06:59,352
<i>I miss you too.</i>

94
00:06:59,477 --> 00:07:01,813
<i>But I can't tonight.</i>

95
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,606
LEE AJIN

96
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,122
Now that your wife is back,

97
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:21,541
it's harder to commute together.

98
00:07:25,003 --> 00:07:27,505
I hope you understand.

99
00:07:30,758 --> 00:07:31,926
I'll try.

100
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:44,898
<i> Hello, everyone.</i>

101
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:46,691
It's break time, right?

102
00:07:47,192 --> 00:07:49,444
Yes. Hello, Professor Kim.

103
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,654
Hey…

104
00:07:51,738 --> 00:07:54,782
Professor Kim! Why did you buy so much?

105
00:07:58,286 --> 00:08:00,205
I wasn't really serious about the donuts.

106
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,040
You said you were craving them.

107
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:04,334
Thank you.

108
00:08:04,792 --> 00:08:06,044
But…

109
00:08:06,961 --> 00:08:08,838
I'd rather see you more often.

110
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:11,925
I'm sorry about everything.

111
00:08:12,717 --> 00:08:15,470
No, I shouldn't have said anything.

112
00:08:20,642 --> 00:08:22,977
Just give me a little more time.

113
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,232
I'll end things with her.

114
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:33,530
How about…

115
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,074
meeting for dinner tomorrow?

116
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:38,368
Really?

117
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,954
Come to the apartment.
I know you wanted crab stew.

118
00:08:41,246 --> 00:08:43,122
Let me make it for you.

119
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,167
Ajin.

120
00:08:51,172 --> 00:08:52,966
Thank you for everything…

121
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:55,593
and I'm sorry.

122
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,887
<i> Cancel the concert?</i>

123
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,389
I just can't stand it.

124
00:09:42,432 --> 00:09:45,727
What exactly are you referring to…

125
00:09:51,065 --> 00:09:52,609
- You did good.
- Thank you.

126
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,987
You're always amazing,
but you were exceptionally amazing today.

127
00:09:57,322 --> 00:09:58,656
Stop it.

128
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,700
Just get married if you're so jealous.

129
00:10:00,992 --> 00:10:02,827
Oh, just yesterday you were talking

130
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,538
about going back to the States.

131
00:10:05,622 --> 00:10:07,624
What…

132
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:08,833
LEE AJIN

133
00:10:08,916 --> 00:10:10,209
I need to take this.

134
00:10:10,668 --> 00:10:11,669
Okay.

135
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,463
- Nice work out there.
- Good job.

136
00:10:13,546 --> 00:10:15,173
You did great. Thank you.

137
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,300
- Hi.
- I want to see you.

138
00:10:21,888 --> 00:10:23,014
Now's not the time.

139
00:10:23,806 --> 00:10:24,849
Maybe later.

140
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:27,477
I'll be waiting.

141
00:10:38,655 --> 00:10:39,739
<i>Seeum,</i>

142
00:10:39,864 --> 00:10:42,075
<i>come to the B1 emergency stairs.</i>

143
00:10:50,249 --> 00:10:51,626
What is this about?

144
00:10:55,213 --> 00:10:57,799
Ajin, there are still people out there.

145
00:10:58,341 --> 00:10:59,384
So what?

146
00:11:33,751 --> 00:11:34,752
Don't look.

147
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:42,719
Seeum.

148
00:11:51,352 --> 00:11:52,395
Honey, please.

149
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:59,152
Stop. I've seen enough.

150
00:12:10,705 --> 00:12:12,749
This is none of your business.

151
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,420
Well, I don't think Seeum's life
is your business anymore.

152
00:12:56,334 --> 00:12:57,835
Seeum, get a grip!

153
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:04,300
I told you to give up the concert
because I knew this would happen.

154
00:13:07,595 --> 00:13:09,305
Is that why you canceled it?

155
00:13:13,434 --> 00:13:15,853
- From now on, stay out of my life.
- No.

156
00:13:16,187 --> 00:13:17,688
I can't do that.

157
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:23,319
You mean nothing to me,
and you never have.

158
00:13:49,846 --> 00:13:51,889
Phil, wait!

159
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,851
This had to happen eventually.

160
00:13:55,309 --> 00:13:58,020
You were going to leave her anyway.
This just speeds things up.

161
00:13:58,187 --> 00:13:59,272
Are you crazy?

162
00:14:00,898 --> 00:14:03,317
You said you would end it.
You told me to wait!

163
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:04,610
Not like this.

164
00:14:08,739 --> 00:14:10,700
So, you want me to just sit still

165
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,702
while the two of you go off to the States?

166
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:16,163
- What?
- Were you ever going to leave Seeum?

167
00:14:20,585 --> 00:14:22,295
Why can't you answer the question?

168
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:27,133
Later.

169
00:14:27,758 --> 00:14:29,093
We'll talk about this later.

170
00:15:24,231 --> 00:15:26,484
Seeum.

171
00:15:26,984 --> 00:15:28,069
Seeum!

172
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,197
Seeum!

173
00:15:33,324 --> 00:15:35,368
Please, please.

174
00:15:57,682 --> 00:15:59,767
Congratulations on your debut, Maestra.

175
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:05,940
You brought me sunflowers. Thank you.

176
00:16:06,107 --> 00:16:08,025
I should be thanking you.

177
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:10,361
It's nice to be acknowledged
by the composer.

178
00:16:11,237 --> 00:16:12,321
This is a thank-you gift.

179
00:16:27,044 --> 00:16:28,170
Is this a new piece?

180
00:16:40,474 --> 00:16:42,393
I hope you'll premiere

181
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:43,978
all my future pieces.

182
00:16:44,812 --> 00:16:45,938
For the rest of our lives.

183
00:16:48,524 --> 00:16:49,567
What?

184
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,235
Seeum.

185
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:53,404
Please stay with me forever.

186
00:16:59,076 --> 00:17:00,161
Will you marry me?

187
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,456
You're all I need.

188
00:17:19,013 --> 00:17:20,598
Let's get married.

189
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:10,471
Seeum.

190
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:12,598
<i> I told you to get lost.</i>

191
00:18:13,891 --> 00:18:16,853
- Who do you think you are?
- Hang up and don't bother us.

192
00:19:36,015 --> 00:19:37,224
Good morning.

193
00:19:40,353 --> 00:19:41,604
Let's cure that hangover.

194
00:19:45,316 --> 00:19:46,484
What happened last night?

195
00:19:47,068 --> 00:19:49,028
There's hangover soup.

196
00:19:49,487 --> 00:19:51,530
Maybe a hamburger?

197
00:19:51,656 --> 00:19:53,532
Would chocolate milk be better?

198
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:56,494
Did you think I'd leave you here alone?

199
00:19:57,119 --> 00:19:58,371
Anyway, I ordered for us.

200
00:19:58,496 --> 00:20:00,289
Two bowls of hangover soup.

201
00:20:00,665 --> 00:20:01,791
Hey!

202
00:20:07,672 --> 00:20:09,632
<i> I told you to get lost.</i>

203
00:20:11,133 --> 00:20:13,135
<i>Hang up and don't bother us.</i>

204
00:20:19,308 --> 00:20:20,351
Seeum.

205
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,814
Where were you yesterday?

206
00:20:26,857 --> 00:20:29,193
I'm so sorry. This is all my fault.

207
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:32,279
Just stop.
I'll send over the divorce papers.

208
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,198
I did a terrible thing.

209
00:20:34,448 --> 00:20:36,158
I totally understand
why you're doing this.

210
00:20:36,742 --> 00:20:37,785
But Seeum,

211
00:20:38,536 --> 00:20:39,954
we can't end it like this.

212
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,956
It's already over.

213
00:20:42,581 --> 00:20:44,166
It was just a mistake!

214
00:20:47,628 --> 00:20:48,838
After…

215
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:51,841
you told me to go back to Korea,

216
00:20:52,299 --> 00:20:53,884
you never came to visit.

217
00:20:54,844 --> 00:20:55,886
I was…

218
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,597
just feeling lonely…

219
00:21:00,516 --> 00:21:01,767
You're such a coward.

220
00:21:04,103 --> 00:21:05,271
You're right.

221
00:21:06,313 --> 00:21:07,356
I am a coward.

222
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,359
You know…

223
00:21:11,569 --> 00:21:13,195
she always smiles at me…

224
00:21:15,031 --> 00:21:16,782
tells me I'm the best,

225
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:20,077
and leans on me for support.

226
00:21:21,078 --> 00:21:23,205
She's so different from you,

227
00:21:23,664 --> 00:21:25,041
and I felt torn.

228
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:28,669
But I realized yesterday

229
00:21:29,587 --> 00:21:30,796
that it was a mistake.

230
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:32,506
- A mistake.
- It doesn't matter.

231
00:21:33,257 --> 00:21:34,341
Whatever it was.

232
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,261
And what about you?

233
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,972
Were you with anyone yesterday?

234
00:21:42,308 --> 00:21:43,309
What?

235
00:21:43,768 --> 00:21:45,144
You were with Yoo Jeongjae!

236
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:56,989
How low…

237
00:21:57,364 --> 00:22:00,618
are you going to go?

238
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:01,345
CHUNG EUN SENIOR CARE CENTER

239
00:23:11,605 --> 00:23:13,732
What do you think, honey?

240
00:23:16,402 --> 00:23:18,279
Isn't Seeum amazing?

241
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,246
What?

242
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,875
What did you say?

243
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,086
I want…

244
00:23:35,004 --> 00:23:36,172
Yes?

245
00:23:38,215 --> 00:23:40,634
I want to see her too.

246
00:23:41,135 --> 00:23:42,344
Seeum.

247
00:23:46,307 --> 00:23:48,100
Of course.

248
00:23:49,894 --> 00:23:52,563
She'll come and visit you soon.

249
00:23:53,606 --> 00:23:56,025
She's a little busy these days.

250
00:23:59,695 --> 00:24:01,447
Seeum…

251
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:06,368
Okay, I understand.

252
00:24:07,328 --> 00:24:09,788
I'll tell her to come over soon.

253
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:21,383
SEEUM MUSIC STORE

254
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:43,364
CALL

255
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:46,492
MY DEAR SEEUM

256
00:26:05,446 --> 00:26:07,489
I didn't think you'd come in today.

257
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,200
There's no reason I can't.

258
00:26:12,828 --> 00:26:14,705
So, what are you going to do?

259
00:26:15,831 --> 00:26:17,875
It seems ridiculous for us…

260
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,627
to perform together, doesn't it?

261
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:28,260
- What's with the smile?
- Don't be absurd.

262
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,055
Are you saying
you'll remain at Hanphil with me?

263
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:35,100
Your skills will determine
whether I let you stay.

264
00:26:36,643 --> 00:26:38,187
Stop being so hypocritical.

265
00:26:39,313 --> 00:26:43,150
Having to face me like this
must be uncomfortable for you too.

266
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,249
Of course it is.

267
00:27:01,001 --> 00:27:02,044
Even now…

268
00:27:07,174 --> 00:27:08,217
I find you revolting.

269
00:27:10,969 --> 00:27:14,098
There would be nothing unusual
about me strangling you right now.

270
00:27:15,224 --> 00:27:18,102
So don't create situations
where we have to face each other.

271
00:27:30,656 --> 00:27:31,698
Ms. Lee Ajin.

272
00:27:33,117 --> 00:27:34,660
Leave your personal life at home.

273
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:37,246
I don't want you wasting my time
with such nonsense.

274
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,541
You can leave now.

275
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:13,782
PROFESSOR KIM

276
00:28:15,826 --> 00:28:18,162
<i>Your call cannot be answered at this time.</i>

277
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:20,539
<i>Please try again later.</i>

278
00:28:26,462 --> 00:28:28,547
<i>Your call cannot be answered at this time.</i>

279
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:31,133
<i>Please try again later.</i>

280
00:28:36,889 --> 00:28:38,807
I appreciate
all the hard work you've put in.

281
00:28:38,932 --> 00:28:42,936
I'm glad everyone kept up
despite the sudden change in venue.

282
00:28:43,562 --> 00:28:45,689
I saw Hanphil's potential.

283
00:28:45,856 --> 00:28:48,650
Together, let's make our orchestra…

284
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:50,986
the best in the country.

285
00:28:51,778 --> 00:28:55,115
I've prepared something for you.

286
00:28:55,824 --> 00:28:56,909
Turn off the lights, please.

287
00:29:07,503 --> 00:29:11,215
I know performing outdoors
with the crowd noise was tough.

288
00:29:11,298 --> 00:29:13,050
Even so,

289
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,427
the <i>Radetzky March</i> had many problems.

290
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,346
We'll go over them as we watch.

291
00:29:18,972 --> 00:29:20,641
It's just an encore piece.

292
00:29:20,766 --> 00:29:22,643
Do we need to go this far?

293
00:29:22,809 --> 00:29:24,561
Besides, the audience loved it.

294
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:27,189
Did you slack off because
it was an encore, Ms. Lee Ajin?

295
00:29:27,397 --> 00:29:29,233
That sounds unprofessional.

296
00:29:29,691 --> 00:29:33,278
Every piece an orchestra performs
for the audience has to be perfect.

297
00:29:33,362 --> 00:29:34,947
In every situation.

298
00:29:37,032 --> 00:29:38,283
So, let's begin.

299
00:29:42,454 --> 00:29:44,540
Mr. Kang Inhan.

300
00:29:44,706 --> 00:29:46,750
- Yes?
- You rushed your entry.

301
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:48,961
Oh, I'm sorry.

302
00:29:49,086 --> 00:29:51,880
Don't get swept up in the moment,
and watch the concertmaster.

303
00:29:51,964 --> 00:29:53,757
I will.

304
00:29:57,719 --> 00:29:59,972
- Mr. Kim Bongju.
- Yes?

305
00:30:00,347 --> 00:30:03,600
From here, you kept falling behind
and seemed out of breath.

306
00:30:03,725 --> 00:30:05,060
Are you not feeling well?

307
00:30:05,519 --> 00:30:07,604
No, I'm fine.

308
00:30:07,688 --> 00:30:09,565
You'll have to figure it out, then.

309
00:30:09,648 --> 00:30:12,568
Maybe you should relearn
circular breathing or get in better shape.

310
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:14,236
Do it right.

311
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:17,072
Next.

312
00:30:19,074 --> 00:30:20,867
<i> It was a total mess.</i>

313
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:24,037
- Excuse me?
- The audit report.

314
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:26,498
There were unnecessary expenses.

315
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,502
What expenses…

316
00:30:31,753 --> 00:30:34,131
It seems Hanphil
has its own chief composer.

317
00:30:34,423 --> 00:30:36,592
Someone who hasn't composed anything
for three years.

318
00:30:38,927 --> 00:30:40,887
Yes, come on in.

319
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,102
Speak of the devil,
here comes our chief composer.

320
00:30:49,605 --> 00:30:52,316
Your contract requires you
to write an original piece every year...

321
00:30:52,774 --> 00:30:54,526
...at least 15 minutes in length,

322
00:30:54,735 --> 00:30:57,696
composed in two or more parts.

323
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:00,490
And Hanphil should hold
the copyright for three years.

324
00:31:01,241 --> 00:31:02,409
But there's not a single piece.

325
00:31:03,452 --> 00:31:05,078
Why don't you sit down?

326
00:31:05,203 --> 00:31:07,831
Well, I can explain that.

327
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,835
He does all the arrangements
for our orchestra.

328
00:31:11,918 --> 00:31:14,004
He also held a composition master class--

329
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:15,380
Hmm. So we call it even?

330
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:20,510
Even…

331
00:31:21,762 --> 00:31:22,763
I'm firing you.

332
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:25,974
Both from the advisory committee
and as a chief composer.

333
00:31:26,141 --> 00:31:28,435
We can't keep you
if you don't have what it takes.

334
00:31:29,895 --> 00:31:32,397
But, Mr. Yoo…

335
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:35,359
how can you spring this on him
without any warning?

336
00:31:35,567 --> 00:31:37,444
We're like family.

337
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:38,904
And if we give him enough time,

338
00:31:39,029 --> 00:31:41,531
he can always compose a new piece for us.

339
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:43,241
Right, Phil?

340
00:31:45,243 --> 00:31:46,578
I'll quit.

341
00:31:51,249 --> 00:31:52,626
He's right.

342
00:31:52,834 --> 00:31:55,587
You don't need an incompetent composer.

343
00:31:56,421 --> 00:31:58,340
You seem to know your place.

344
00:31:58,882 --> 00:32:00,801
That's great. Keep it up.

345
00:32:04,346 --> 00:32:05,555
Maybe…

346
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:10,727
you should know yours too,
and make sure you don't cross the line.

347
00:32:26,785 --> 00:32:28,995
Normally, you would rest after a concert,

348
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,415
but I'll continue checking on you.

349
00:32:31,498 --> 00:32:35,085
Hanphil can only grow
when our quality improves.

350
00:32:35,252 --> 00:32:37,587
Rehearsal for the <i>Radetzky March</i>
starts tomorrow,

351
00:32:37,671 --> 00:32:38,964
so get ready.

352
00:32:39,214 --> 00:32:40,424
I'll see you tomorrow.

353
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:42,050
Great work, everyone.

354
00:32:42,134 --> 00:32:43,885
Thank you.

355
00:32:59,693 --> 00:33:01,486
Seeum.

356
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:03,238
We have a problem.

357
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:07,492
Mr. Yoo just fired Phil from Hanphil
for not composing anything.

358
00:33:07,617 --> 00:33:09,703
It was so sudden.

359
00:33:09,786 --> 00:33:12,080
Maybe you could talk to Mr. Yoo

360
00:33:12,164 --> 00:33:13,832
and put in a good word for Phil.

361
00:33:13,915 --> 00:33:17,002
I don't see a problem. The chief composer
was fired for not composing.

362
00:33:18,295 --> 00:33:20,797
- But still--
- Now, if you'll excuse me.

363
00:33:26,386 --> 00:33:28,138
Are you sure you two are married?

364
00:33:29,055 --> 00:33:31,224
How can she be so cold?

365
00:33:33,727 --> 00:33:34,811
I wonder if they fought.

366
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:36,855
Oh, I can't believe this.

367
00:33:37,355 --> 00:33:40,692
We just finished the concert.
She really is ruthless.

368
00:33:42,235 --> 00:33:44,654
She's starting to scare me now.

369
00:33:46,615 --> 00:33:48,825
I was scared from the get-go.

370
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,911
How can you be scared already?

371
00:33:51,036 --> 00:33:53,955
She's just getting started.
Hmm?

372
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:09,679
36 SONGYI-RO 12-GIL

373
00:34:45,173 --> 00:34:46,716
DO NOT ENTER

374
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:57,519
- You did great.
- Good job.

375
00:36:08,632 --> 00:36:10,133
Good morning!

376
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:12,719
You are?

377
00:36:12,886 --> 00:36:16,222
I'm Kim Taeho, and I will be
your personal assistant starting today.

378
00:36:17,515 --> 00:36:18,600
I see.

379
00:36:18,683 --> 00:36:20,435
It's an honor to work for you.

380
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:22,812
When I was in the States,

381
00:36:22,896 --> 00:36:25,857
I always went to your performances.

382
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,278
- Mr. Kim Taeho.
- Yes?

383
00:36:30,362 --> 00:36:33,615
Bring me videos of Hanphil's
performances from the past three years.

384
00:36:34,407 --> 00:36:35,408
Excuse me?

385
00:36:35,575 --> 00:36:37,702
You've introduced yourself,
so let's get started.

386
00:36:38,036 --> 00:36:39,120
Yes, of course.

387
00:36:39,371 --> 00:36:40,622
Seeum!

388
00:36:40,789 --> 00:36:43,333
Seeum, you have to…

389
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,710
I think you need to see this.

390
00:36:47,629 --> 00:36:50,840
WORLD-RENOWNED CONDUCTOR'S HUSBAND
HAVING AN AFFAIR?

391
00:36:59,438 --> 00:37:01,773
- Is this really Ajin?
- This is unbelievable.

392
00:37:01,899 --> 00:37:03,692
Honestly, this is ridiculous.

393
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:05,819
My goodness.

394
00:37:05,903 --> 00:37:08,155
Seriously.

395
00:37:08,906 --> 00:37:11,366
What a shame.

396
00:37:14,953 --> 00:37:16,371
What's going on?

397
00:37:17,205 --> 00:37:18,874
Actually…

398
00:37:19,041 --> 00:37:20,792
Well, you see…

399
00:37:27,716 --> 00:37:29,885
- Can you believe it?
- You saw it too?

400
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:32,638
Yes, that's what happened.

401
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:50,614
Really? Professor Kim?

402
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:06,755
THERE'S NOTHING TO LEARN FROM AN ADULTERER

403
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:12,594
Professor?

404
00:38:48,171 --> 00:38:49,256
<i>I just can't believe it.</i>

405
00:38:49,381 --> 00:38:51,800
It's always the quiet ones.

406
00:38:52,092 --> 00:38:54,970
- How could Ajin have an affair?
- Seriously.

407
00:38:55,178 --> 00:38:57,973
Professor Kim seemed like such a good guy.

408
00:38:58,098 --> 00:38:59,766
Maybe the picture was photoshopped.

409
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:01,768
Could be a deepfake.

410
00:39:02,227 --> 00:39:04,688
I've known Phil a long time,

411
00:39:04,771 --> 00:39:06,481
and he's not that type of person.

412
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,525
You can't really categorize people.

413
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:10,360
Passion makes people do crazy things.

414
00:39:10,652 --> 00:39:11,778
Come on, Bongju.

415
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,366
By the way, where's Ajin?

416
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:18,535
Coming to work can't be easy for her.

417
00:39:18,952 --> 00:39:21,371
Even Seeum isn't answering my calls.

418
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,665
As accomplished as Seeum may be,

419
00:39:24,374 --> 00:39:26,293
she won't be able
to handle the humiliation.

420
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,253
She won't be in Korea for long.

421
00:39:28,378 --> 00:39:30,422
She didn't do anything wrong,
so why would she leave?

422
00:39:30,505 --> 00:39:31,798
Because it's embarrassing.

423
00:39:33,008 --> 00:39:34,593
There's no reason for her to leave.

424
00:39:34,676 --> 00:39:36,553
It's those other two who should.

425
00:39:36,636 --> 00:39:38,180
Huh? Look at this.

426
00:39:38,263 --> 00:39:40,265
They've revealed Seeum
and Ajin's identities.

427
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,059
- What?
- Really?

428
00:39:43,685 --> 00:39:44,936
MISTRESS - WIFE

429
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,271
My goodness.

430
00:39:46,354 --> 00:39:50,275
All this scandal could be
very damaging to Hanphil.

431
00:39:53,445 --> 00:39:55,113
<i> Can you explain this?</i>

432
00:39:55,405 --> 00:39:57,991
Hanphil seems to have a lot of problems.

433
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,993
What on earth made you buy it?

434
00:40:00,077 --> 00:40:01,411
Exactly.

435
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,830
Image is everything in the arts industry.

436
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:07,417
Rumors of the conductor's husband
having an affair are spreading online.

437
00:40:07,501 --> 00:40:10,712
It's all very third-rate.
Now we have this trashy scandal.

438
00:40:12,756 --> 00:40:15,342
I don't care about affairs or scandals.

439
00:40:15,425 --> 00:40:17,052
I invested in Cha Seeum,

440
00:40:17,135 --> 00:40:18,136
not her husband.

441
00:40:18,386 --> 00:40:22,224
- The company has suffered damages--
- My stocks will cover any damages.

442
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:23,391
Is that good enough?

443
00:40:24,810 --> 00:40:25,894
Is it?

444
00:40:35,612 --> 00:40:38,198
- Take care of that video.
- Yes, sir.

445
00:40:59,553 --> 00:41:02,556
Aren't you going home, sir?

446
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,766
I will.

447
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,811
But I don't have the strength to get up.

448
00:41:08,562 --> 00:41:11,022
Mr. Jeon.

449
00:41:13,358 --> 00:41:15,277
Hanphil is doomed, isn't it?

450
00:41:15,735 --> 00:41:17,404
Rumors are spreading

451
00:41:17,487 --> 00:41:19,906
on YouTube and social media.

452
00:41:20,157 --> 00:41:22,742
We're famous.

453
00:41:22,826 --> 00:41:24,536
<i>Here is conductor Cha Seeum</i>

454
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:26,121
<i>from The Hangang Philharmonic.</i>

455
00:41:26,496 --> 00:41:28,206
- What-- What did he say?
<i>- Welcome.</i>

456
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,749
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Thank you for coming.</i>

457
00:41:29,833 --> 00:41:31,877
<i>Uh, you're the youngest violinist</i>

458
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,712
to win the Schoenberg Competition.

459
00:41:33,837 --> 00:41:35,964
You've won the Grammo Award
for Best Classical Album.

460
00:41:36,089 --> 00:41:39,217
You're also the<i> Manhattan Post's</i>
best conductor of the year.

461
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,595
You've got some fancy titles
on your résumé.

462
00:41:41,803 --> 00:41:44,097
I'm a longtime fan of yours.

463
00:41:44,222 --> 00:41:45,307
- Thank you.
- Of course.

464
00:41:46,141 --> 00:41:49,978
Please excuse me,
this question may be a little off-topic.

465
00:41:50,061 --> 00:41:52,772
It's a very hot topic right now.

466
00:41:52,939 --> 00:41:56,985
With such a large fanbase,
it seems we need to address it.

467
00:41:58,361 --> 00:41:59,821
Yes?

468
00:41:59,946 --> 00:42:01,406
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

469
00:42:01,489 --> 00:42:05,577
I'm sure most of you are curious
about the rumors of my husband's affair.

470
00:42:05,785 --> 00:42:07,954
EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH
HANPHIL'S CONDUCTOR, CHA SEEUM

471
00:42:08,038 --> 00:42:09,247
<i>I will get a divorce.</i>

472
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,793
<i>Or I would</i>
<i>if it were an authentic photo.</i>

473
00:42:14,586 --> 00:42:15,795
By that, you mean--

474
00:42:15,921 --> 00:42:17,380
That picture was manipulated.

475
00:42:17,464 --> 00:42:19,591
My husband is not having an affair.

476
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,969
<i>That must have been a huge shock.</i>

477
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,888
<i>It's all right.</i>

478
00:42:25,013 --> 00:42:27,515
<i>That story got me on the news.</i>

479
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,684
<i> Do you mind if I ask</i>

480
00:42:29,809 --> 00:42:32,229
<i>what you plan on doing next?</i>

481
00:42:32,312 --> 00:42:34,272
<i>We will premiere a new piece</i>

482
00:42:34,356 --> 00:42:36,816
<i>by my husband, composer Kim Phil.</i>

483
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:38,902
<i>It will be at our next Hanphil concert.</i>

484
00:42:39,236 --> 00:42:40,862
<i>So, composer Kim Phil</i>

485
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,240
<i>is releasing his first new piece</i>
<i>in three years?</i>

486
00:42:43,323 --> 00:42:44,366
<i>That's right.</i>

487
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:48,620
<i>Why did you choose it</i>
<i>for your next concert?</i>

488
00:42:49,037 --> 00:42:51,081
<i>Quite simply, it's a great piece.</i>

489
00:42:51,665 --> 00:42:53,333
<i>I trust my husband.</i>

490
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:56,169
<i>As a composer and as a husband.</i>

491
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:58,046
<i>It might have been painful and difficult.</i>

492
00:42:58,129 --> 00:42:59,798
<i> But I think this must have</i>

493
00:42:59,881 --> 00:43:01,633
<i>brought you closer together as a couple.</i>

494
00:43:01,758 --> 00:43:03,134
<i>I think so too.</i>

495
00:43:10,183 --> 00:43:11,309
- <i>Okay.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

496
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:12,727
<i>Thanks for coming today.</i>

497
00:43:12,811 --> 00:43:14,479
- Thank you.
- Of course.

498
00:43:14,604 --> 00:43:15,689
Thank you even more.

499
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:17,607
For accepting my sudden request.

500
00:43:17,691 --> 00:43:19,192
You should be thanking me.

501
00:43:19,818 --> 00:43:21,945
- Hello, Mr. Go.
- Hello.

502
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:24,990
Or should I be thanking you?

503
00:43:25,156 --> 00:43:27,117
For making headlines.

504
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,911
You used the news coverage
to cover up the controversy.

505
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,204
That's amazing.

506
00:43:31,288 --> 00:43:34,207
Oh, how about joining me for tea
in my office?

507
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:36,459
I'll be swamped with work from now on.

508
00:43:36,543 --> 00:43:38,712
Turning down a friend
you haven't seen in 20 years?

509
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,380
Were you my friend?

510
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:42,924
I thought you were Jeongjae's friend.

511
00:43:44,718 --> 00:43:46,845
It's the same thing, isn't it?

512
00:43:47,595 --> 00:43:48,680
Next time.

513
00:44:04,029 --> 00:44:06,239
- What did you do?
- Can't you tell?

514
00:44:06,406 --> 00:44:09,075
Why are you doing this?
You saw it for yourself that day.

515
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:11,953
- So what?
- Seeum!

516
00:44:12,078 --> 00:44:13,455
It's my business, so butt out.

517
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,666
Not when the orchestra is involved.
Especially since I'm the chairman.

518
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:25,175
Don't worry, Mr. Yoo.

519
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:29,137
I'll have the new piece ready
for the next concert within a week.

520
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,890
And if you don't?

521
00:44:39,522 --> 00:44:41,316
I'll close down Hanphil.

522
00:44:59,626 --> 00:45:01,002
That will never happen.

523
00:45:21,564 --> 00:45:23,483
We will premiere a new piece

524
00:45:23,566 --> 00:45:25,944
by my husband, composer Kim Phil.

525
00:45:26,653 --> 00:45:28,446
<i>It will be at our next Hanphil concert.</i>

526
00:45:40,708 --> 00:45:42,752
HANSUK UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS

527
00:46:02,856 --> 00:46:03,940
Yes?

528
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:11,448
Come on in, Phil.

529
00:46:16,286 --> 00:46:19,038
What are you doing here…

530
00:46:19,247 --> 00:46:21,040
Come on, have a seat.

531
00:46:22,625 --> 00:46:23,835
Yes, thank you.

532
00:46:28,423 --> 00:46:31,593
Ms. Cha explained everything to me.

533
00:46:31,843 --> 00:46:33,094
Also, I saw yesterday's news.

534
00:46:33,303 --> 00:46:35,513
What kind of crazy guy would do that?

535
00:46:35,597 --> 00:46:37,348
Manipulating a picture that way…

536
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:38,641
My goodness.

537
00:46:38,808 --> 00:46:40,310
If I'm this upset,

538
00:46:40,518 --> 00:46:43,980
honestly, I can't imagine
how hard it must've been for you two.

539
00:46:44,189 --> 00:46:45,231
Man…

540
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:48,526
Anyhow, just stay focused on your work.

541
00:46:50,069 --> 00:46:51,154
Wait, what--

542
00:46:51,237 --> 00:46:55,492
You said you might need to take
a few days off to finish your piece.

543
00:46:55,575 --> 00:46:57,869
So I asked him for you.

544
00:47:15,428 --> 00:47:17,222
Why would you do that?

545
00:47:18,556 --> 00:47:21,309
I thought I had given you
enough time to think last night.

546
00:47:21,893 --> 00:47:22,936
Seeum.

547
00:47:24,062 --> 00:47:25,146
Do you think

548
00:47:25,688 --> 00:47:28,608
I made all this happen
because I've forgiven you?

549
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,486
The only thing you're going to
break up is my marriage,

550
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:33,863
not my orchestra.

551
00:47:34,113 --> 00:47:36,866
So, take responsibility
for everything and fix it!

552
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:42,288
Your life is over if you can't do this.

553
00:47:42,747 --> 00:47:44,290
You want to be a cheater

554
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,501
and a useless composer?

555
00:47:54,717 --> 00:47:57,262
Are you saying that picture
was manipulated?

556
00:47:57,345 --> 00:47:58,888
So that news from yesterday was true?

557
00:47:59,472 --> 00:48:02,100
All of you still believe what Seeum said?

558
00:48:02,267 --> 00:48:03,518
If that picture is real,

559
00:48:03,893 --> 00:48:05,353
why would she appear on the news?

560
00:48:05,436 --> 00:48:07,730
I don't care if it's real or fake.

561
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:09,107
It's all so strange.

562
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:10,233
But think about it.

563
00:48:10,358 --> 00:48:13,528
Ajin looked so guilty yesterday.

564
00:48:13,653 --> 00:48:15,530
Or maybe she was in shock.

565
00:48:15,613 --> 00:48:18,449
What on earth
is going on around here?

566
00:48:18,575 --> 00:48:19,701
Do you think

567
00:48:20,076 --> 00:48:22,495
Phil actually composed a new piece?

568
00:48:23,037 --> 00:48:24,080
I mean,

569
00:48:24,163 --> 00:48:27,166
he did say
he was having trouble composing.

570
00:48:27,292 --> 00:48:29,586
Well, that's…

571
00:48:29,752 --> 00:48:32,130
I see everyone's here.

572
00:48:33,631 --> 00:48:35,049
This week's rehearsals…

573
00:48:35,883 --> 00:48:37,176
have all been canceled.

574
00:48:37,343 --> 00:48:38,845
- What?
- Really?

575
00:48:39,178 --> 00:48:40,179
Who would do that?

576
00:48:40,763 --> 00:48:42,307
It was Seeum.

577
00:48:42,599 --> 00:48:45,643
But she was so hard on us
right after the concert.

578
00:48:45,768 --> 00:48:47,312
- What happened?
- I know.

579
00:48:51,649 --> 00:48:52,817
Are you kidding me?

580
00:48:53,318 --> 00:48:54,527
Why was the video removed?

581
00:48:55,403 --> 00:48:56,946
I'll pay what you want.

582
00:48:57,030 --> 00:48:58,698
So please upload it--

583
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:00,950
Hello?

584
00:49:01,492 --> 00:49:02,577
Hello…

585
00:49:56,631 --> 00:49:58,508
<i>You want to be a cheater</i>

586
00:49:58,841 --> 00:50:00,218
and a useless composer?

587
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:18,695
HANPHIL CEO JEON SANGDO

588
00:50:23,199 --> 00:50:24,826
Hello?

589
00:50:24,951 --> 00:50:26,703
Why don't you answer the phone?

590
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:28,996
Do you want me to die of frustration?

591
00:50:29,163 --> 00:50:30,206
Is everything okay?

592
00:50:31,374 --> 00:50:33,793
You pulled that stunt on the news
and now you're ghosting us.

593
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:36,462
I "pulled a stunt"?

594
00:50:36,587 --> 00:50:38,589
<i> Phil said that he was quitting</i>

595
00:50:38,673 --> 00:50:40,425
because he couldn't compose anymore.

596
00:50:40,508 --> 00:50:43,678
So how do you plan to use
his new piece in your next concert?

597
00:50:43,970 --> 00:50:45,346
It's going to happen.

598
00:50:45,430 --> 00:50:46,472
<i>Come on.</i>

599
00:50:46,556 --> 00:50:49,392
Honestly, what are you thinking?
Do you even have a new piece?

600
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:53,020
- Don't worry.
<i>- How can I not?</i>

601
00:50:53,104 --> 00:50:54,814
I'm hanging up now.

602
00:50:54,939 --> 00:50:56,774
Seeum, wait a minute. Seeum!

603
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:59,235
Seeum! Seeum… I need to stay calm.

604
00:50:59,444 --> 00:51:00,445
Just stay calm.

605
00:51:19,422 --> 00:51:20,423
Seeum.

606
00:51:45,656 --> 00:51:46,699
I'm sorry.

607
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,161
This isn't going to work.

608
00:51:50,912 --> 00:51:52,622
I couldn't even begin.

609
00:51:53,831 --> 00:51:56,167
I don't think I can do it.

610
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:01,964
When things get tough,
you make excuses and run.

611
00:52:02,048 --> 00:52:03,841
The moment you can't do it, you give up.

612
00:52:04,926 --> 00:52:06,177
It's so easy for you.

613
00:52:07,345 --> 00:52:09,138
You know what made you fail?

614
00:52:09,388 --> 00:52:11,432
Whenever things don't go your way,
you find an excuse.

615
00:52:11,891 --> 00:52:13,893
You just come up with excuses to run away.

616
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:27,406
You just do it like this.

617
00:52:40,211 --> 00:52:42,713
No matter how hard it gets, keep going.

618
00:55:27,378 --> 00:55:30,172
What do you think
you're doing? Hey!

619
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,769
Are you the one who leaked the picture?

620
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:47,440
Man…

621
00:55:56,615 --> 00:55:59,243
You've got a lot of nerve
doing something like that.

622
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,707
Do you have proof?

623
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:08,878
That attitude of yours, you know?

624
00:56:09,378 --> 00:56:10,379
Your…

625
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,181
But how do you know
what I'm referring to?

626
00:56:39,992 --> 00:56:41,077
Thanks.

627
00:56:48,417 --> 00:56:49,877
This reminds me of the past.

628
00:56:51,337 --> 00:56:52,421
I don't think…

629
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:54,840
I can live without you.

630
00:57:01,555 --> 00:57:03,015
How about we...

631
00:57:14,401 --> 00:57:15,402
This is where you've been.

632
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:17,988
Let's talk outside.

633
00:57:18,239 --> 00:57:20,533
No. I'm going to talk here.

634
00:57:43,597 --> 00:57:44,974
Now you need to decide…

635
00:57:48,769 --> 00:57:49,937
what you're going to do.

636
00:58:47,077 --> 00:58:49,830
MAESTRA: STRINGS OF TRUTH

637
00:58:50,206 --> 00:58:52,291
Tell her to get out of our house!

638
00:58:52,583 --> 00:58:54,376
<i> I don't think</i>
<i>I can live without you.</i>

639
00:58:54,501 --> 00:58:56,503
<i>I thought</i>
<i>you wouldn't be able to perform.</i>

640
00:58:56,629 --> 00:58:59,089
<i> It has to happen.</i>
<i>Otherwise, Hanphil's done.</i>

641
00:58:59,215 --> 00:59:02,343
You hate everything they do,
but you can't beat them.

642
00:59:02,635 --> 00:59:04,178
<i>Were you trying to kill her? Were you?</i>

643
00:59:04,678 --> 00:59:06,222
Seeum almost died because of you.

644
00:59:06,347 --> 00:59:09,058
You should have gotten it right,
if you wanted to kill me.

645
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,310
<i>So, next time, make sure</i>
<i>you kill me properly.</i>

646
00:59:11,435 --> 00:59:13,437
<i>So, should I have an abortion?</i>

647
00:59:13,604 --> 00:59:15,856
How could you do this?

648
00:59:15,981 --> 00:59:17,775
<i>What happens next?</i>

649
00:59:20,183 --> 00:59:22,060
