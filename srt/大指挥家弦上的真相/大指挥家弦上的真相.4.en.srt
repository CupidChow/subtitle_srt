367
00:23:59,482 --> 00:24:01,651
for Kim Phil's Sunflower.

368
00:24:02,027 --> 00:24:05,864
Of course, you have all seen the score,
but let me give you a brief overview.

369
00:24:06,573 --> 00:24:07,782
In the first movement,

370
00:24:07,908 --> 00:24:09,784
you should feel the excitement

371
00:24:09,951 --> 00:24:13,872
and butterflies of a young sunflower
seeing the sun for the first time.

372
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,457
In the second movement,

373
00:24:15,832 --> 00:24:20,170
finally, the sun and sunflower meet
and fall in love.

374
00:24:20,462 --> 00:24:22,923
In the third movement,
their love reaches its climax.

375
00:24:23,089 --> 00:24:25,634
But the season comes to an end,

376
00:24:25,717 --> 00:24:28,136
and the sunflower bows its head.

377
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:31,431
With fierce intensity,
it comes to an end in the fourth movement.

378
00:24:32,474 --> 00:24:35,852
Perhaps, we can describe it
as a beautiful tragedy?

379
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:40,899
So, feeling the excitement
of the sunflower,

380
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,692
let's begin the first movement.

381
00:24:49,658 --> 00:24:52,827

you were the one
to premiere Mr. Kim's pieces.

388
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,552
What makes his work unique?

389
00:25:50,677 --> 00:25:51,803
CHA SEEUM - KIM PHIL

390
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,055
- [♪ gentle music continues]
- Its warmth.

391
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:56,975
When I'm conducting one of his pieces,

392
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:59,602
it's like I'm standing under the warm sun.

393
00:25:59,686 --> 00:26:01,021
That kind of feeling.

394
00:26:01,187 --> 00:26:02,772
That's very romantic.

395
00:26:02,981 --> 00:26:06,985
In that case,
what does Mr. Kim mean to you, Ms. Cha?

396
00:26:07,819 --> 00:26:09,154
He's the perfect partner.

397
00:26:09,237 --> 00:26:12,907
I'm so grateful to him
for expanding my music spectrum.

398

Thank God, tickets are selling like crazy.

417
00:27:34,322 --> 00:27:35,365
"Thank God"?

418
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,991

[breathes deeply] By the way,
why doesn't Mr. Yoo come by these days?

422
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,751
He used to come here every day.

423
00:27:46,918 --> 00:27:47,961
You don't say.

424
00:27:49,546 --> 00:27:50,630
What's the deal?

425
00:27:51,714 --> 00:27:52,715
Why is that?

Going to work is so much fun these days.

If possible, try not to move too much,

Were you trying to kill her? Were you?

539

I didn't mean to cause an accident.
