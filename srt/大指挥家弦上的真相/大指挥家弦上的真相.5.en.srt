"EPISODE 5"

6
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:53,111
It's called Remington's disease.

7
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:57,850
Remington's?

8
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,311
There's a 50% chance of inheriting it.

9
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:04,398
Your body slowly stiffens over time,
and your memory starts to fade.

10
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,984
In some cases, total memory loss.

11
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,159
Remington's.

12
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,107
Is that what you've been trying to hide?

13
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:07,136
<i>Remington's.</i>

14
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,306
Is that what you've been trying to hide?

15
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:21,734
She was amazing.

16
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:23,341
- She certainly was.
- Hey, look.

17
00:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,445
Seeum!

18
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:27,072
Well, you must be exhausted.

19
00:07:27,406 --> 00:07:28,991
Are you feeling better?

20
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:31,535
- I'm fine.
- Honey, you were great.

21
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:36,415
That was an incredible performance.

22
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,751
Shouldn't we have a party or something?

23
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,920
Maybe some champagne?

24
00:07:44,048 --> 00:07:46,050
Let's do it next time.

25
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,219
- Let's talk soon, Dad.
- Hey, what's going on?

26
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,888
- Seeum.
- Soon.

27
00:07:51,347 --> 00:07:53,098
Oh. Wait, Seeum…

28
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:55,059
At least take the flowers with you.

29
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,603
What's the rush?

30
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:00,439
Something must be wrong.

31
00:08:07,404 --> 00:08:08,572
How did you find out?

32
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,284
Tell me.

33
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,287
You're not even going to lie?

34
00:08:16,956 --> 00:08:18,248
What is it you want?

35
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,756
I heard getting tested will tell you
whether or not you'll get it.

36
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,300
Bring me the test results.

37
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,762
You don't want to get tested, do you?

38
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:36,976
That's why you tried so hard
to get out of the ER when you woke up.

39
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,769
You refused to take a blood test.

40
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,398
You're avoiding it.

41
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:45,484
- It's not your problem.
- Take the test.

42
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:49,947
You have a 50% chance of inheriting it.
That's a pretty high risk.

43
00:08:52,533 --> 00:08:54,284
You must know from your research.

44
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:57,913
As your memory fades,
you start seeing things.

45
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,666
You can't control your own body.

46
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,668
There's no prevention or cure.

47
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:06,213
Would knowing in advance
make a difference?

48
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:10,050
And if I knew?
How would I spend the rest of my life?

49
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,137
- But still...
- I'd rather not know.

50
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:16,181
Hope is the only thing keeping me going.

51
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,773
So keep this to yourself.

52
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,436
WOO YEONGSEON

53
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,565
Are you Bae Junghwa's doctor?

54
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:11,111
Yes, I am. Can I help you?

55
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,030
How do you plan to deal with this?

56
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,533
A patient's information was leaked.

57
00:10:17,576 --> 00:10:18,577
Excuse me?

58
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:19,953
What are you...

59
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,165
The only way someone could find out
I could have Remington's

60
00:10:23,624 --> 00:10:25,501
is through this hospital.

61
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:30,005
Because I've never once mentioned
that disease!

62
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:32,466
And obviously, I've never been tested!

63
00:10:32,591 --> 00:10:34,426
Okay, first,

64
00:10:34,968 --> 00:10:38,263
I need you to calm down.
I'll find out what happened...

65
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,974
Don't you think it's too late for that?

66
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,688
You'd better watch your step.

67
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,024
If this happens one more time,

68
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:53,403
I'll make sure
you never wear that white coat again.

69
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,619
Seeu…

70
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,297
All right.

71
00:11:53,797 --> 00:11:54,840
Next time,

72
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,510
I'll make sure to bring Seeum with me.

73
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:00,053
Seeu…

74
00:12:18,739 --> 00:12:19,907
Honey.

75
00:12:20,073 --> 00:12:22,427
Oh! Hey, you're both here!

76
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:25,245
- Congratulations, you did a great job.
- You brought me flowers?

77
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:27,080
Thank you.

78
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,132
- You were wonderful.
- Thanks.

79
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,250
Way to go, Mom.

80
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,629
Mom.

81
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,515
Mom!

82
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:27,641
Mom...

83
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:31,478
What's wrong?
There's no one there.

84
00:13:32,187 --> 00:13:33,855
- Mom.
- You're a monster.

85
00:13:34,356 --> 00:13:35,774
- A monster.
- What?

86
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:37,234
Die.

87
00:13:38,277 --> 00:13:39,319
Die!

88
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,404
Die.

89
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:44,074
Die!

90
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,161
You're a monster!

91
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:49,871
Die!

92
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:50,998
Die.

93
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,791
Please die.

94
00:14:28,869 --> 00:14:29,870
A celebratory drink?

95
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:31,360
<i>You're the new art director</i>

96
00:14:31,384 --> 00:14:33,144
<i>of the Yeonsung
International Music Festival.</i>

97
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,375
And your new piece is a big hit.

98
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,585
Let's go out for drinks.

99
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,670
It's not confirmed yet.

100
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,423
Getting a call from the chairman himself
means you got it.

101
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,134
Man, you're on a roll.

102
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:46,595
<i>But…</i>

103
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,349
will you be working for the festival
alongside Seeum?

104
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,310
I'm not sure yet.

105
00:14:54,019 --> 00:14:55,896
Anyway, let's set a date soon.

106
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,397
<i>All right, sounds good!</i>

107
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,690
See you.

108
00:15:01,485 --> 00:15:04,085
TO CHA SEEUM AND KIM PHIL,
CONGRATS ON YOUR FIRST CONCERT IN KOREA

109
00:15:05,364 --> 00:15:06,365
Yes?

110
00:15:08,825 --> 00:15:09,910
Hello.

111
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:16,625
It looks like someone tampered

112
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,336
with the brakes on Ms. Lee Ajin's car.

113
00:15:21,505 --> 00:15:22,923
So,

114
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,093
someone intentionally did that to Ajin…

115
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:33,100
Can you tell us where you were
on the day of the incident?

116
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,652
WARD

117
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:46,488
Were you trying to kill her? Were you?

118
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:49,366
I didn't mean to cause an accident.

119
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:50,992
You think I believe that?

120
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:53,203
I can't believe you.

121
00:16:18,186 --> 00:16:20,522
You shouldn't skip meals.

122
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:23,400
I didn't expect to see you again.

123
00:16:26,278 --> 00:16:28,697
I heard what actually happened that day.

124
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,409
And?

125
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,163
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:36,955 --> 00:16:39,374
In spite of everything,
you want to be the good guy.

127
00:16:46,298 --> 00:16:47,466
Seeum…

128
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,803
is the perpetrator.

129
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:56,099
- What?
- Who else could it be?

130
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:59,227
Who else would want
to harm me and my baby?

131
00:17:02,314 --> 00:17:03,356
No.

132
00:17:04,107 --> 00:17:05,150
It can't be her.

133
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:06,568
Are you sure?

134
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:08,528
She'd never do something like that.

135
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:14,409
You trust her completely?

136
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,411
No matter what?

137
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,881
I'm having this baby, and I'll make sure

138
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:30,258
nothing happens to him.

139
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,553
And you don't deserve

140
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:35,847
to be a father.

141
00:17:37,641 --> 00:17:40,268
- Ajin.
- Just leave.

142
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,791
Seeum.

143
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,761
This is for you.

144
00:21:14,065 --> 00:21:16,109
I was asked to deliver this to you.

145
00:21:16,443 --> 00:21:19,154
- Who is it from?
- There's a note inside.

146
00:21:22,407 --> 00:21:23,491
Thank you.

147
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,827
YOO JEONGJAE

148
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,513
<i>I'm at the first-floor restaurant.</i>

149
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,857
<i>Choose from the menu and join me.</i>

150
00:21:38,923 --> 00:21:40,425
<i>I'd rather not know.</i>

151
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,844
Hope is the only thing keeping me going.

152
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:45,096
So…

153
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:47,474
keep this to yourself.

154
00:22:07,202 --> 00:22:08,369
I'm touched.

155
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:11,372
You really came to see me.

156
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:18,922
What would you like to order?

157
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:22,759
Don't joke around.

158
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:24,511
Come on, let's eat.

159
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,723
Jeongjae.

160
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:31,392
This isn't a joke, it's a threat.

161
00:22:35,814 --> 00:22:37,524
Isn't what I found out significant enough

162
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:39,818
to call you down for breakfast?

163
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:48,368
Mm.

164
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,037
Try the porridge, it's delicious.

165
00:22:52,455 --> 00:22:53,790
Mm.

166
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:57,502
You're not in the mood for Korean.
Should we go for Western?

167
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:59,546
Oh, that's right.

168
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,422
Do you still not eat breakfast?

169
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,676
- That's enough.
- How about coffee?

170
00:23:05,927 --> 00:23:08,137
Okay, fine.
Can you just watch me eat, then?

171
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:15,144
Fine. Let's go together.

172
00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:32,620
You're heading to work anyway.
Get in, I'll take you.

173
00:23:38,001 --> 00:23:39,168
Jeongjae…

174
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:43,965
Don't be shy, Seeum.

175
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:56,269
See, hmm?

176
00:23:57,145 --> 00:24:00,106
Isn't it nice
to sit face-to-face like this?

177
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,358
We can chat on the way.

178
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:04,777
Mr. Park, can we go now?

179
00:24:04,861 --> 00:24:05,945
Hold on.

180
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,408
Don't forget

181
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:13,077
to buckle your seat belt.

182
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,374
Now we're ready.

183
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,835
Or not. It's my turn to buckle up.

184
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,239
Have a great day.

185
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:20,571
<i>This isn't a joke,
it's a threat.</i>

186
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:23,356
<i>Isn't what I found out significant enough</i>

187
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:25,858
<i>to call you down for breakfast?</i>

188
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:42,667
A list of neurologists and neurosurgeons
from the country's top five hospitals.

189
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,293
Nice work.

190
00:25:46,504 --> 00:25:49,298
Look overseas as well
and find the most qualified doctor.

191
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:52,166
- Doesn't matter where they're from.
- Yes, sir.

192
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:57,849
PROFESSOR OF NEUROLOGY
PARK MUNGI

193
00:26:39,807 --> 00:26:40,850
Good morning.

194
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:42,185
Morning.

195
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,438
Uh, despite having little rehearsal time,
we premiered an original piece.

196
00:26:45,521 --> 00:26:48,107
And I want to thank you
for putting on a great performance.

197
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:49,233
Great work, everyone.

198
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:51,235
Thank you.

199
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,491
Hey, Ajin.

200
00:26:57,075 --> 00:26:59,368
How do you feel
now that you've been discharged?

201
00:26:59,494 --> 00:27:00,703
I'm fine.

202
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:02,705
Ajin.

203
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:05,958
Please be on time.

204
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,462
Sure, no problem.

205
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,133
- Taeho.
- Yes.

206
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,565
Let's review
our last performance, shall we?

207
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,945
She won't let us off easy.

208
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:56,050
DIVORCE APPLICATION

209
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,661
Ajin.

210
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,914
Have you lost some weight?

211
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:11,334
I haven't had an appetite lately.

212
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,585
I'm better now.

213
00:29:14,337 --> 00:29:16,005
I was wondering…

214
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,715
about that rumor.

215
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,220
We all want to know.

216
00:29:22,553 --> 00:29:26,224
Are you wondering if Professor Kim
and I are having an affair?

217
00:29:26,349 --> 00:29:27,869
Not really.

218
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:31,020
We didn't really believe any of it.

219
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,314
Well…

220
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:35,483
Is it true?

221
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:39,195
You won't believe me no matter what I say.

222
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,783
I don't see why we shouldn't.

223
00:29:45,368 --> 00:29:47,578
I think your joke's gone too far.

224
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,837
If you'll excuse me,
I have some work to do.

225
00:29:58,756 --> 00:29:59,840
Wait…

226
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:09,475
So, is she or isn't she?

227
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,227
It's hard to tell.

228
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:32,206
How can I help you?

229
00:30:33,916 --> 00:30:36,252
I'm having this baby.

230
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:39,488
And I'm staying in Hanphil.

231
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,090
It'd be a pleasure…

232
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,843
for me to share

233
00:30:45,219 --> 00:30:46,762
my child's life with you.

234
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:53,311
So, I guess he didn't want
to leave with you.

235
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:56,814
However, I'm not interested
in such things.

236
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,608
So don't bother explaining all that.

237
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:03,946
If you're done, could you please leave?

238
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:07,033
Are you sure you're not interested?

239
00:31:08,743 --> 00:31:11,120
Soon, it will be clear
you lied on the news.

240
00:31:11,662 --> 00:31:13,414
It will all be exposed.

241
00:31:21,172 --> 00:31:22,631
Are you worried about me?

242
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:31,307
The moment my lie is exposed,
you'll become an adulteress.

243
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,768
You should worry about yourself.

244
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,866
Come on, it's over now.

245
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,537
The boss said

246
00:31:53,996 --> 00:31:55,581
to close the case

247
00:31:55,706 --> 00:31:58,459
because there's no evidence
and both parties have settled.

248
00:31:58,542 --> 00:32:01,629
- Who are we to...
- But that settlement seems fishy.

249
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,800
She settled when her husband's mistress
caused the accident?

250
00:32:05,883 --> 00:32:09,804
Well, maybe
Cha Seeum is a good and decent person.

251
00:32:09,929 --> 00:32:12,181
"Good and decent"?

252
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,517
That would be news to me.

253
00:32:15,601 --> 00:32:17,645
- Here.
- Man, come on.

254
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:19,021
Besides,

255
00:32:19,522 --> 00:32:23,943
I'm sure there's a perpetrator.
It wasn't just some freak accident.

256
00:32:36,831 --> 00:32:39,542
My sweet baby.

257
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,086
My goodness.

258
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,213
You look so haggard.

259
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,049
Oh, honey.

260
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,759
Mom.

261
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,762
Bongju.

262
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,347
Leave now.

263
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:56,058
You have to lie low
until your dad's election is over.

264
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,813
After that, I'll find a way
to send you abroad, okay?

265
00:33:02,356 --> 00:33:05,109
My poor baby.

266
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,088
<i>Remington's disease
doesn't have a cure yet.</i>

267
00:33:26,422 --> 00:33:29,884
<i>The best we can do is prescribe medication
to delay the symptoms.</i>

268
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,277
She goes into work early and stays late.

269
00:33:48,402 --> 00:33:52,156
Immediately after a concert,
she starts thinking about the next one.

270
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,117
And she usually eats quick meals
in her office.

271
00:33:56,494 --> 00:33:57,620
Hmm.

272
00:34:02,082 --> 00:34:03,209
Is that all?

273
00:34:03,292 --> 00:34:05,336
You don't need to tell me
what I already know.

274
00:34:05,419 --> 00:34:06,504
That's it.

275
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,048
That's all I know.

276
00:34:10,841 --> 00:34:13,177
You're pretty useless for a spy.

277
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:16,514
Oh, that's right. I'm a spy.

278
00:34:17,056 --> 00:34:18,891
I thought I was just another success story

279
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,227
who used my cousin to get ahead.

280
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:22,645
What the…

281
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,023
It was obviously a mistake to hire you,
so why am I still paying you?

282
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,443
You know what?

283
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:31,987
Never mind.

284
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,280
What?

285
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:36,992
I just want to pretend I don't know.

286
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:39,245
After punching Seeum's husband
at the hospital,

287
00:34:39,453 --> 00:34:42,373
you ran a background check on her,
and now you commute together.

288
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,749
It's all so strange.

289
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,044
But I'm just going to play dumb.

290
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,171
Besides,

291
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,215
what would people think

292
00:34:52,049 --> 00:34:53,759
about you doing this at her workplace?

293
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:56,887
I can't afford to worry about
such trivial matters.

294
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,347
You got it?

295
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:09,191
It's way too early
in the morning for this.

296
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,736
Why aren't you signing off on it?

297
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:14,905
I sent my project proposal ages ago.

298
00:35:15,406 --> 00:35:17,575
You did?

299
00:35:18,701 --> 00:35:20,452
Don't you come to work to hang out?

300
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:25,583
Just sign off on it.

301
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:29,503
Jeez... What are you up to?

302
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,676
"Documentary on the lives
of Cha Seeum and Kim Phil,

303
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:37,261
the married musical geniuses"?

304
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:38,887
What is this?

305
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,973
Sounds good, right?

306
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:45,519
If Jeongjae knew, he'd freak out.

307
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:47,021
That's why I'm doing it.

308
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,232
You said she was Jeongjae's first love.

309
00:36:22,598 --> 00:36:23,932
You're already working on it?

310
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:28,270
The <i>Symphony No. 1</i> violin solo.

311
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:30,773
Yes, it's a bit challenging.

312
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,232
It can't be easy.

313
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:35,069
It took Brahms more than 20 years
to compose this piece.

314
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,323
The fair thing about effort
is that it always shows.

315
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,867
Hard work pays off in the end, right?

316
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,457
It's important to capture
the lyrical mood in this movement.

317
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:50,250
Shall we begin?

318
00:36:59,843 --> 00:37:02,721
Stay calm, you don't want to get
too overexcited when playing a solo.

319
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:05,641
Imagine that you're having a conversation
with a woodwind instrument.

320
00:37:05,891 --> 00:37:06,892
Let's try again.

321
00:37:11,188 --> 00:37:12,189
Seeum.

322
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,067
Mr. Jeon wants to see you.

323
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,826
I sense a big hit.

324
00:37:24,368 --> 00:37:26,161
Thank you.

325
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:28,622
This is great. What do you think?

326
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,501
- It looks good.
- Doesn't it?

327
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:35,671
Yes, come in.

328
00:37:38,465 --> 00:37:40,467
Hey, Seeum, come on in.

329
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:48,392
Hello.

330
00:37:48,892 --> 00:37:51,645
I'm Go Yura, director of KVN.

331
00:37:51,729 --> 00:37:53,689
KVN
GO YURA

332
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,275
I see. I'm Cha Seeum.

333
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:04,408
Your last concert was a huge success.

334
00:38:04,908 --> 00:38:07,536
That's why I've rushed here
to get you on board.

335
00:38:08,203 --> 00:38:10,873
Despite my appearance,
I'm quick on my feet.

336
00:38:14,418 --> 00:38:17,921
I'm planning a documentary about you two.

337
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:20,799
The genius conductor
and the genius composer.

338
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:22,426
The life of a musician couple.

339
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:24,571
Doesn't it sound exciting?

340
00:38:24,595 --> 00:38:27,222
You don't have to overthink this.

341
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:29,956
Just show us how your daily life is...

342
00:38:30,056 --> 00:38:31,456
I appreciate your interest,

343
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,479
but I can't do a documentary
about my life.

344
00:38:34,062 --> 00:38:36,732
Unless it's a documentary about Hanphil.

345
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,276
I'm sure Hanphil

346
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:41,737
will naturally play a part in our story.

347
00:38:41,945 --> 00:38:44,490
I think it'd be great
if we could do this together.

348
00:38:46,867 --> 00:38:49,953
We've been getting a lot of requests
for joint interviews

349
00:38:50,078 --> 00:38:51,872
- and TV appearances...
- No.

350
00:38:52,581 --> 00:38:55,793
We're not doing any future interviews
or TV appearances together.

351
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,753
- Honey.
- If you'll excuse me,

352
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:58,879
I'm busy right now.

353
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:02,508
Considering
I'm the director of KVN,

354
00:39:02,674 --> 00:39:04,676
don't you think it'll cause problems

355
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:06,929
if you flat out refuse me like this?

356
00:39:10,432 --> 00:39:13,602
The abrupt presentation of your proposal
without any prior arrangement

357
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:17,022
gave me the impression
that you're quite impatient.

358
00:39:17,189 --> 00:39:18,232
I guess I was wrong.

359
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:21,360
If you want an indirect rejection,

360
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:24,571
my assistant will relay the message.

361
00:39:24,988 --> 00:39:28,158
- I'll be going now.
- Wait, Seeum, just…

362
00:39:29,618 --> 00:39:31,161
Wait…

363
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:37,626
Ms. Go, Seeum's speech
may be a bit abrasive,

364
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:38,877
but that's not who she is.

365
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:40,712
You don't need to explain.

366
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:43,090
I've heard enough.

367
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:46,969
She might change her mind
if I talk to her.

368
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,429
Is that possible?

369
00:39:49,847 --> 00:39:53,475
It's a great opportunity,
for both Hanphil and us.

370
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,826
This should be good enough.

371
00:40:11,368 --> 00:40:12,369
This is great.

372
00:40:20,002 --> 00:40:22,004
What brings you here?

373
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,172
I'm working.

374
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:31,471
- What's with the sandwiches?
- You don't need to know.

375
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:33,765
How sweet.

376
00:40:34,224 --> 00:40:37,269
- You brought her a sandwich.
- Why are you here?

377
00:40:40,022 --> 00:40:42,482
I'm going to produce an amazing show.

378
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:47,070
A documentary that shows a glimpse into
the daily lives of Cha Seeum and Kim Phil.

379
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,574
- You're doing what?
- Looking forward to it?

380
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:55,495
- Leave her alone.
- I don't have to listen to you.

381
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,998
It was a decision made
by Cha Seeum and her husband.

382
00:40:58,373 --> 00:40:59,416
Why would you stop them?

383
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,710
Did Seeum say she'd do it?

384
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,046
I just met with them, and they agreed.

385
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,844
Honey,

386
00:41:11,303 --> 00:41:12,471
don't forget.

387
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:14,097
Seeum is a married woman.

388
00:41:14,181 --> 00:41:17,142
Bringing her a sandwich
doesn't change that.

389
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:21,146
In fact, if you keep this up,
people will think you're an adulterer.

390
00:41:23,357 --> 00:41:26,109
Would that make her an adulteress, then?

391
00:42:10,445 --> 00:42:12,572
DAD

392
00:42:18,036 --> 00:42:19,121
Hi, Dad.

393
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,044
HANYANG HWARO
SPECIALIZING IN GRILLED BEEF

394
00:42:27,838 --> 00:42:29,548
Seeum, over here.

395
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:43,270
No, don't worry about me.

396
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,354
Give it to Seeum.

397
00:42:44,479 --> 00:42:46,356
Yes, of course.

398
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,284
Mm.

399
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,369
- It's delicious.
- I agree.

400
00:43:00,829 --> 00:43:02,539
The food's better because we're all here.

401
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:08,962
Why aren't you eating?

402
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,299
Hmm? Do you not feel well?

403
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:15,594
Oh, no, I'm fine. I'll eat.

404
00:43:23,143 --> 00:43:24,144
It's good.

405
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:26,605
- Dig in, Dad.
- Sure.

406
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,038
They do takeout.

407
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,874
No, I ate way too much today.

408
00:43:45,999 --> 00:43:47,351
You two should take it.

409
00:43:47,375 --> 00:43:49,211
I got some for us too. Hope you enjoy.

410
00:43:49,294 --> 00:43:51,755
Thanks.

411
00:43:52,506 --> 00:43:53,590
I'll definitely enjoy it.

412
00:43:53,673 --> 00:43:56,134
Go on now.

413
00:43:56,259 --> 00:43:57,719
We'll wait until you get inside.

414
00:43:58,053 --> 00:44:01,139
My house is right there.
I'll watch you leave.

415
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:04,518
- Okay, we're going to go.
- Go ahead.

416
00:44:04,601 --> 00:44:06,721
- Good night, Dad.
- You too.

417
00:44:07,813 --> 00:44:09,248
- We'll see you soon.
- All right.

418
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:16,446
Bye.

419
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,468
Stop the car.

420
00:44:39,928 --> 00:44:41,680
- Honey.
- I told you to stop.

421
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,282
- Seeum!
- Let go.

422
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:04,578
- Have you lost your mind?
- It's unfair, I know.

423
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:07,289
But I was willing to do it
if it meant I could hold on to you.

424
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,040
Just file the divorce papers.

425
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:11,585
No.

426
00:45:13,461 --> 00:45:14,796
I don't want a divorce.

427
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:20,427
I'm sure you'll change your mind.

428
00:45:22,137 --> 00:45:23,221
You see,

429
00:45:24,181 --> 00:45:25,307
I know…

430
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:32,397
about the Remington's.

431
00:45:38,403 --> 00:45:40,989
I've known since last year.

432
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,413
The fish might be shy.

433
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:50,707
Maybe.

434
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:54,419
There's not a single fish biting today.

435
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:01,218
CHUNG EUN SENIOR CARE CENTER

436
00:46:03,511 --> 00:46:04,512
Hello?

437
00:46:21,947 --> 00:46:25,116
Is everything okay with Junghwa?

438
00:46:27,035 --> 00:46:28,245
Yes.

439
00:46:30,205 --> 00:46:32,874
She sometimes throws fits
looking for Seeum.

440
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:35,835
She was a little worse today.

441
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:42,300
I never wanted you to see her like this.

442
00:46:45,971 --> 00:46:46,972
If Seeum finds out…

443
00:46:48,765 --> 00:46:50,225
I won't say anything.

444
00:46:50,684 --> 00:46:53,895
I don't want to worry her either.

445
00:46:57,983 --> 00:46:59,025
Thanks.

446
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,406
<i>I have no intention of separating.</i>

447
00:47:05,407 --> 00:47:07,993
I didn't want to when I found out,
and I don't now.

448
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:12,163
I understand why you couldn't tell me.

449
00:47:13,331 --> 00:47:15,834
And I totally get
why you didn't want kids.

450
00:47:16,001 --> 00:47:17,294
So this time,

451
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,338
I'm asking you to understand me.

452
00:47:28,054 --> 00:47:29,180
You…

453
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:33,601
want…

454
00:47:34,436 --> 00:47:36,021
to keep conducting, don't you?

455
00:47:43,403 --> 00:47:45,613
All this time, I kept your secret…

456
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:50,910
because I'm your husband.

457
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,717
Is this a new piece?

458
00:48:51,513 --> 00:48:53,515
I hope you'll premiere

459
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,141
all my future pieces.

460
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:57,018
For the rest of our lives.

461
00:48:59,771 --> 00:49:01,272
Let's get married.

462
00:49:05,527 --> 00:49:06,569
<i>You want…</i>

463
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,280
to keep conducting, don't you?

464
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,283
All this time, I kept your secret…

465
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:16,371
because I'm your husband.

466
00:49:53,366 --> 00:49:55,368
<i>RMRFK305</i>

467
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,537
has completed
phase 1 clinical trials this year,

468
00:49:57,620 --> 00:50:00,039
and we're now
conducting research with Soohan Hospital.

469
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:02,959
Besides treating obesity...

470
00:50:03,084 --> 00:50:05,336
it stabilizes the nerves
and reduces stress...

471
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,504
<i>But,</i>

472
00:50:06,671 --> 00:50:09,090
<i>if you keep doing this kind of thing
at her workplace,</i>

473
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,468
you could put her in a predicament.

474
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:14,637
Would that make her an adulteress, then?

475
00:50:14,929 --> 00:50:17,891
The product is formulated
to ensure clean charging.

476
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:20,435
This concludes my presentation.

477
00:50:20,852 --> 00:50:23,813
Feel free to ask any questions.

478
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:30,904
It's over, Mr. Yoo.

479
00:50:31,613 --> 00:50:32,655
What?

480
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:11,611
What brings you here?

481
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,241
How did you know he was having an affair?

482
00:51:19,118 --> 00:51:20,203
What?

483
00:51:24,499 --> 00:51:25,792
You have evidence, right?

484
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,010
HANSUK UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS

485
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,768
Let's wrap this up with your resignation.

486
00:51:45,270 --> 00:51:47,230
- Sir...
- Don't make a fuss.

487
00:51:47,605 --> 00:51:49,649
If things get out of hand,
our school could suffer.

488
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:51,568
Shame on you.

489
00:52:23,933 --> 00:52:24,934
Hello?

490
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:26,738
<i>Did you get the pictures?</i>

491
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:29,063
Was it you?

492
00:52:29,355 --> 00:52:31,024
It all started with you.

493
00:52:32,567 --> 00:52:34,444
<i>Your threat hinges on a possibility.</i>

494
00:52:34,694 --> 00:52:36,279
I don't have the disease yet.

495
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:38,323
- Seeum.
- We're getting divorced.

496
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:41,409
<i>If we can't reach an agreement,
we'll go to court.</i>

497
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:43,661
You have nothing to gain from this.

498
00:52:43,786 --> 00:52:46,581
Is this really necessary?

499
00:52:46,664 --> 00:52:48,750
You shouldn't have crossed the line

500
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:51,502
if you really wanted my forgiveness.

501
00:52:54,756 --> 00:52:55,882
<i>Those pictures…</i>

502
00:52:56,591 --> 00:53:00,345
were only sent to the president's office.
Next time, it'll be a TV station.

503
00:53:01,596 --> 00:53:04,015
Stop, or you'll lose everything.

504
00:53:31,626 --> 00:53:34,671
Today is our first look
at <i>Symphony No. 1</i> by Brahms.

505
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:39,384
It took Brahms many years
to complete this symphony.

506
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:42,095
It was only released
after a lot of thought was given to it.

507
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:44,180
Consequently, it is rich,

508
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,266
intricate and structurally dense.

509
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,311
For the concert, I would like to add

510
00:53:50,436 --> 00:53:53,314
more dramatic elements
to this already dramatic piece.

511
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:55,608
Let's begin.

512
00:54:13,418 --> 00:54:14,460
Yoseop!

513
00:54:15,169 --> 00:54:16,504
The steps of a giant!

514
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,299
Good. Tempo!

515
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:28,766
With more intensity!

516
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,222
<i>You have a 50% chance of inheriting it.</i>

517
00:54:50,246 --> 00:54:51,289
<i>That's a pretty high risk.</i>

518
00:54:55,501 --> 00:54:57,521
<i>As your memory fades,
you start seeing things.</i>

519
00:54:57,545 --> 00:54:58,546
You're a monster!

520
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:00,923
<i>You can't control your own body.</i>

521
00:55:13,603 --> 00:55:14,645
Seeum.

522
00:55:40,087 --> 00:55:41,714
Seeum, are you okay?

523
00:56:44,527 --> 00:56:46,737
It doesn't look
like there's a fire.

524
00:56:46,904 --> 00:56:49,448
Why did it go off, then?

525
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:52,034
There's been so much chaos,
and now this!

526
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:55,246
Just look at all this water!
It's as if a water cannon went off!

527
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:58,809
- Are you okay?
- I can't believe this.

528
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:20,605
- Inhan.
- Yes?

529
00:57:20,730 --> 00:57:22,982
- Please call the instrument technician.
- Okay.

530
00:57:23,107 --> 00:57:24,525
Check your instruments,

531
00:57:24,609 --> 00:57:27,612
and give the damaged ones
to the technician first.

532
00:57:27,737 --> 00:57:30,406
- Seeum, are you okay?
- Of course.

533
00:57:30,615 --> 00:57:33,075
Luna, hurry and check
on the string instruments.

534
00:57:33,367 --> 00:57:35,786
- Okay.
- What... What happened here?

535
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:38,539
Mr. Jeon, please turn off the sprinklers.

536
00:57:38,623 --> 00:57:40,458
Yes, of course.

537
00:57:40,583 --> 00:57:42,043
Please get them some dry towels.

538
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:43,252
Okay.

539
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:45,838
Mr. Park, are you okay?

540
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48,424
I'm fine.
It's the instruments I'm worried about.

541
00:57:48,507 --> 00:57:50,384
Yoseop, is the timpani okay?

542
00:57:50,551 --> 00:57:52,970
I'm not sure. It looks pretty bad though.

543
00:57:53,721 --> 00:57:55,514
Seeum?

544
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,005
Seeum?

545
00:58:37,098 --> 00:58:38,140
Seeum.

546
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:18,723
STRINGS OF TRUTH

547
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:19,992
<i>You saw for yourself.</i>

548
00:59:20,016 --> 00:59:22,018
<i>I'm not merely
making empty verbal threats.</i>

549
00:59:22,101 --> 00:59:24,353
<i>She doesn't have much time left.</i>

550
00:59:24,437 --> 00:59:26,856
<i>It's coming for you.</i>

551
00:59:27,064 --> 00:59:29,483
Tell me what you want to do
to that bastard.

552
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:32,361
From now on, I plan to stand in the way

553
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:34,238
<i>of everything this man does.</i>

554
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:35,781
<i>Seeum, I can't leave you.</i>

555
00:59:36,073 --> 00:59:38,075
<i>She might be hiding it from us.</i>

556
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,327
I will voluntarily step down.

557
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,329
<i>She didn't look
like she was all there.</i>

558
00:59:42,663 --> 00:59:44,057
<i>You must have a death wish.</i>

559
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,499
<i>Now, get out of here</i>

560
00:59:45,583 --> 00:59:47,251
and out of my life.
