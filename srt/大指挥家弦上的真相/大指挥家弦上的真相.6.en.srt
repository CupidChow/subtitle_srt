00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:18,335
Today is our first look
at<i> Symphony No. 1</i> by Brahms.

7
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:21,756
It took Brahms many years to complete

8
00:00:21,839 --> 00:00:23,049
this symphony.

9
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,760
It was only released
after a lot of thought was given to it.

10
00:00:25,968 --> 00:00:27,636
Consequently, it is rich,

11
00:00:27,845 --> 00:00:31,057
intricate and structurally dense.

12
00:00:31,515 --> 00:00:34,143
For the concert, I would like to add

13
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:37,063

to this already dramatic piece.

She doesn't have much time left.

149
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:48,799
I have a question.

150
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:54,971
What are the first symptoms
of the disease?

151
00:10:56,098 --> 00:10:58,975
From birth,
those affected are somewhat different.

152
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:04,231
A high percentage of Remington's patients
are born with very acute senses.

153
00:11:05,649 --> 00:11:08,026
So, many of them become artists.

154
00:11:09,611 --> 00:11:13,657
But slowly,
all of the senses start to dull.

155
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:16,243
Eventually your senses and nerves

156
00:11:16,827 --> 00:11:20,122
stop functioning the way you want them to.

157
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,632
Everything you were given at birth
is taken from you in an instant.

158
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,512
That's why those patients experience
a stronger sense of frustration.

159
00:11:35,846 --> 00:11:36,847
In particular,

160
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,017
it's when they lose their memory
and start to become violent

161
00:11:42,018 --> 00:11:43,603
that it becomes very tough.

162
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:48,024
Especially because
those closest to them

163
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:50,235

In Korea, their interpretation of Brahms

Yes, it's true. My mother has Remington's.
