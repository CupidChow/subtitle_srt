Goddamnit. What the hell?

00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,719
We have two hours left.

00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,221
Look. Just back off, would you?

10
00:02:20,432 --> 00:02:21,683
Let's go.

11
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,019
I told you to leave me alone.

12
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,653
Or die here.

13
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,740
Go ahead. Shoot.

14
00:03:22,411 --> 00:03:23,620
Bravo!

15
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,477
Adios. Hope we never meet again.

16
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,981
I'll still come to your funeral.

17
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,317

23
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,102
That's it! Let's go!

24
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,979
Keep going! You got this!

25
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,355
There you go!

26
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,024
No, please! Keep…

27
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,985
No, just hold on until the end! Please!

28
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,997
Hey, what's wrong with you guys?

29
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,710
This is embarrassing.
Why didn't any of you win?

30
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,464
Come on, this is no fun.

31
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,674
Right?

32
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:03,303
I can't believe this. I'm his owner,
and he's not even listening to me.

33
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,138
Huh, I guess words aren't enough.

34
00:05:05,222 --> 00:05:07,974
You need a little sugar to wake up.

35
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:09,226
Here you go.

36
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,480
I know, Thunder.

37
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,941
Honestly, it's you who behaves the best.

38
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,234
Have one more.

39
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:21,071

<i>Cha Seeum is coming to Korea.</i>

44
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:46,972

00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:52,978

It appears to be the board's decision.

51
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:33,977
It's all over the news.

52
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,396
This is how our new conductor
is introduced to us?

53
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,106
Can you believe this?

54
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:41,401
I know, right?
Seriously, it's so ridiculous.

55
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,238
What's going to happen
to our assistant conductor, then?

56
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,074
He was expecting
to become the chief conductor.

57
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,411
Oh! Wait, here he comes.

58
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:55,123
My goodness.

59
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,750
Mr. Oh, I wasn't expecting you.

60
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,126
What brings you...

61
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,462
Sangdo, is it true?

62
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:03,548
- Is what true?
- Hanphil's new chief conductor.

63
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:05,008
Is it really Cha Seeum?

64
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:09,638
Yes, I was meaning to tell you...

65
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:13,183
Didn't you promise me
that vacant position?

66
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,518
I even turned down a professorship.

67
00:07:15,602 --> 00:07:16,978
How could you do this to me?

68
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,273
I strongly recommended you, of course.

69
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,858
But the higher-ups

70
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:25,528
were so set on Cha Seeum.
There was nothing I could do...

71
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,988
Mr. Jeon.

72
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:29,157
Hi, Yoseop. Come on in.

73
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:30,682
Even the union can't agree to this.

74
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,792
Changing the conductor
without our permission?

75
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:34,829
This decision is too sudden and one-sided.

76
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,540
Look, it was forced on me too.

77
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:39,250
Why are you guys doing this to me?

78
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:42,379
So you're not going to do anything?

79
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,047
Mr. Jeon.

80
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,715
You have to make a decision.

81
00:07:51,763 --> 00:07:53,598
Let's be honest here.

82
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:56,309
We are in a crisis.

83
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,895
Do you know
what Hanphil's paid attendance rate is?

84
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:02,065
Audience members who don't pay
outnumber those who do.

85
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:04,484
If we keep this up, we might not survive.

86
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:07,445
The news of Cha Seeum's arrival alone
flooded the media.

87
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,114
She's getting so much attention.

88
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:12,158
How was I supposed to stop this?

89
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,244
There's no good reason to do so.

90
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:18,415
Honestly, what makes Cha Seeum
so famous is all the theatrics.

91
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:21,459
"She's a living legend who transforms
third-rate into first-class."

92
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,294
It's all just marketing.

93
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,588
When it was announced that she was coming,

94
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:28,216
Hanphil was stigmatized,
like we were third-rate.

95
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,427
Oh, it's so humiliating.

96
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:33,179
She's known to be
extremely tough and scary.

97
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,557
Rumor has it...

98
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,726
that she fired a gun at her members.

99
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:39,936
That's ridiculous.

100
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,272
Wow, sounds exciting.

101
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,484
It will be the same for our concerts.

102
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,821
It's not necessarily
a bad thing, though.

103
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,908
Cha Seeum is a famous
and very talented conductor.

104
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,537
What would you know?

105
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:01,458
Since you're the newbie here,
you don't get to say anything, okay?

106
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,293
You haven't been here long enough.

107
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,753
She's right though.

108
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,174
Less than 5% of all conductors are women,

109
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,093
but Cha Seeum is among the best,
regardless of gender.

110
00:09:13,344 --> 00:09:16,014
I don't think we're in a position
to reject her.

111
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:20,769
It's true. And there are rumors
that we're disbanding...

112
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:22,729
But it's not right that she was appointed

113
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,097
without any procedure
or consultation with the members.

114
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,193
Can't we at least vote on this?

115
00:09:28,318 --> 00:09:30,737
I think we already have our answer.

116
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,156
It's either disbandment…

117
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,700
or Cha Seeum.

Mr. Jeon.

123
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,438
- We have a problem.
- "We have a problem." What…

124
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,565
What is it?

125
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:10,944
What is it now?

126
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:18,368
Hey, Seeum.

127
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,745
Weren't you flying in
the day after tomorrow?

128
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,413
I guess I couldn't wait.

129
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,583
Still, you could have let us know
before coming.

130
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,709
Where's your manager?

131
00:10:26,835 --> 00:10:29,546
They dumped me for signing
a contract on my own.

132
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,800
That's enough with the pleasantries.
I want to meet the members.

133
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,263
Right now? I'm pretty sure
they've all gone home…

134
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,472
What should I do…

135
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,475
Man, this has been a long day.

136
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,058
Nice work today.

137
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,863
- Good work, everyone.
- Nice work.

138
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:50,191
Everyone! Please wait!

139
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:52,735
One moment, please.

140
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,028
Sit down, everyone.

141
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:02,704
I'm sure…

142
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,581
this is a surprise for all of you.

143
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,292
I understand. I was very surprised too.

144
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,087
Nevertheless, I need to make
a formal introduction.

145
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:14,132
The new music director and chief conductor

146
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,759
of The Hangang Philharmonic is…

147
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,261
I'm Cha Seeum.

148
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,305
Yes, let's all give her a hand.

149
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:29,981
It's nice to meet you all.

150
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,400
Though I'm sure some of you
don't feel the same.

151
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:33,693
At least she knows.

152
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,614
They're all a bit shy
around new people.

153
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,116
Isn't it true that musicians
are somewhat shy by nature?

154
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,284
It doesn't matter.

155
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,495
Talent trumps friendship,
personality, and effort.

156
00:11:44,913 --> 00:11:47,373
My only concern will be
a person's ability.

157
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,501
Now, let's get to know each other.

158
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,421
Uh, so, the most recent piece...

159
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,633
We've prepared a welcome gift for you.

160
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,968
Mr. Librarian, can you hand out
the sheet music, please?

161
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:10,396
It's okay, I don't need to see it.

162
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,191
All right, let's start.

163
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,304
Thank you.

164
00:12:44,097 --> 00:12:47,183
So it's <i>Mission: Impossible.</i>

165
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:51,229
That's a bit negative
for a welcome greeting, isn't it?

166
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:54,607
But if you want to say hello,
do it right.

167
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,276
Go for it without hesitation.

168
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,194
Mr. Noh Baha.

169
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,531
The underlying cello in the beginning
is very important in this piece.

170
00:13:01,698 --> 00:13:05,493
Lead confidently and the rest
of the string instruments will follow.

171
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,288
Ms. Lee Ajin, sit up straight.
That's not good for you.

172
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,833
Mr. Kim Bongju, what's the value
of the first note in the seventh bar?

173
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,311
- Pardon?
- It's an eighth note.

174
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,337
But you played a 16th note.

175
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:18,548
If you don't measure up,
you've got to be humble.

176
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,097
Mr. Librarian, please bring me
the sheet music.

177
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:23,928
The music was lifeless.

178
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,599
With an impact that's not too heavy.

179
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,311
Okay, let's take it from the top.

180
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,531
One, two, three, four!

181
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,425
Stay focused, Ms. Lee Luna!

182
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:33,081
Whoa, people are right
about her being ruthless.

183
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,583
I think she's memorized our names already.

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,378
She didn't need sheet music
to point out all the bars.

185
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:42,131
I think <i>Mission: Impossible</i>
was a bad idea.

186
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,720
- Did you see that?
- What?

187
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,223
Seeum's coat is limited edition.

188
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,849
Really? What's the brand?

189
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:53,976
Her sudden arrival left me a little dazed.

190
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,938
She's trying to establish authority.
Definitely not a pushover.

191
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:58,648
I'm worried about what's to come.

192
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,837
I told you not to come.
I can't believe you drove all this way.

193
00:15:22,672 --> 00:15:25,800
I had to pick you up.
We haven't seen each other in months.

194
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,430
- Did you wait long?
- No, I just got here.

195
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,099
When you told me
you were making a stop at Hanphil,

196
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,102
I thought, "Oh, there's no way
she'll just say hi."

197
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,979
I just had a gut feeling.

198
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,900
- You're tired, aren't you?
- A little.

199
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:44,444
Come on, let's go.

200
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,620
<i>Wow.</i>

201
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,250
Hanphil really went all out.

202
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,502
A professor's apartment
can't even compare.

203
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,087
But that's where I wanted to go.

204
00:16:03,171 --> 00:16:08,384
Can you imagine taking the maestra
to such a shabby place?

205
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,055
We once lived
in a semi-basement in the States.

206
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:17,101
The first thing we need to do
is find a nice place to live.

207
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,811
So I can take you there.

208
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,063
It doesn't have to be fancy, just...

209
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:24,025
Just somewhere close to Hanphil?

210
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,112
You can't stand wasting time commuting.

211
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:30,114
I was already looking into
that neighborhood.

212
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,284
- I appreciate it.
- I bet you do.

213
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:37,246
So how could you stay away
from a husband like me for three years?

214
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:41,834
Well, that's because

215
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,253
you came to the States every vacation.

216
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,923
I knew you wouldn't come here,
so what else could I do?

217
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,470
Hey, why did you suddenly come to Korea
when you hate it so much?

218
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,097
You've received offers
from other places as well.

219
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:01,854
Uh...

220
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,235
I haven't heard you play the piano
in a while. I'd like to hear it again.

221
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,694
Uh, now? At this hour?

222
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:09,862
Yes, please.

223
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,122
Okay, but I haven't finished it yet.

224
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,001
Have you composed something
recently?

225
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:26,796
Uh-huh.
I've missed my day job.

226
00:17:28,506 --> 00:17:29,840
I'm getting nervous.

227
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:12,508
Okay, that's it.

228
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,867
Have a good night. Take care.

229
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:05,121
Hey, Luna, wait up!

230
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:08,249
I heard today's your last day.

231
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,626
How can you just up and quit like this?

232
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:11,877
I'm sorry, sir.

233
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,463
You can't just quit,
even if it's only part-time...

234
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,675
In exchange,
I won't charge you for this month.

235
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,719
What's with you?

236
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,138
Have you won the lottery or something?

237
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:25,141
You could compare it to the lottery.

238
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:28,644
Luna, you worked so hard
to earn money to study abroad...

239
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,312
There's no need for that anymore.

240
00:20:39,989 --> 00:20:42,158
<i>I don't have to go
to the States anymore.</i>

241
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,410
<i>We have finally met.</i>

242
00:23:26,864 --> 00:23:29,533
Hello, Maestra.

243
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:34,079
Were you the youngest member recruited
through this year's blind recruitment?

244
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:36,874
Yes, that's right.

245
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,044
Don't hesitate to speak freely.

246
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,968
How did you learn to play the violin?

247
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:51,680
My dad taught me.

248
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,934
He played the violin as a hobby.

249
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,772
I went to many concerts with my dad
before his business went bankrupt.

250
00:24:00,731 --> 00:24:03,067
I tagged along wherever he went.

251
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:11,825
You don't seem like the type
to follow your dad around.

252
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,371
Do you think so?

253
00:24:26,966 --> 00:24:29,760
Uh, the two eighth notes in bar 448.

254
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,138
Can you extend those notes
with force instead of cutting them short?

255
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,355
Let's play it together.

256
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:30,904
Yes?

257
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,787
- How are you, Mr. Park?
- Hey, Seeum.

258
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,122
Wait, that's not right.

259
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,166
I should call you Maestra, right?

260
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,667
Come in.

261
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,378
Were you tuning your violin?

262
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,297
Do you recognize this?

263
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,383
My dad made that. Do you still use it?

264
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:52,718
Of course.

265
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:56,055
It means more to me than a Stradivarius.

266
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,184
It seems like just yesterday
that I was teaching you violin.

267
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,645
You've become
such an accomplished conductor, huh?

268
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,689
I'm so proud of you.

269
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,108
I have something to tell you.

270
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,818
Sure.

271
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:15,949
Are you aware that you have a problem
with your left fourth finger?

272
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,163
You couldn't press
the strings down properly.

273
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,637
No one's said anything about it yet.

274
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,932
I'm sorry, but I'll have to replace you
with another player.

275
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:43,060
- Seeum.
- This is for the orchestra.

276
00:26:51,068 --> 00:26:52,736
I have one year until retirement.

277
00:26:53,362 --> 00:26:55,531
And my daughter's getting married.

278
00:26:55,656 --> 00:26:58,242
Considering I was your teacher once,

279
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:00,828
don't you think you can overlook this?

280
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,458
I'm not asking you to leave Hanphil.
If you just resign as concertmaster...

281
00:27:06,542 --> 00:27:07,876
My honor is all I have.

282
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,712
Your words…

283
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,257
are basically a death sentence.

284
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:15,884
I can't have
an unstable concertmaster on my stage.

285
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,388
I'm sorry, sir.

286
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,350
And what about you?

287
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:29,565
How qualified are you?

288
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,784
I…

289
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:42,870
Still remember.

290
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,914
It was 20 years ago.

291
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,405
Because you didn't show up
for a concert and disappeared,

292
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:50,669
Hanphil was expelled
from the National Orchestra.

293
00:27:53,422 --> 00:27:55,299
I'm here to pay that debt.

294
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:57,801
That's why I'm qualified.

295
00:29:04,034 --> 00:29:05,285
HANSUK UNIVERSITY OF THE ARTS

296
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:06,609
<i>Good morning.</i>

297
00:29:06,662 --> 00:29:08,247
Congratulations, Professor Kim!

298
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:10,540
Cha Seeum has returned to Korea, right?

299
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,561
You must be very happy,
Professor Kim!

300
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,796
Of course I am.

301
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,299
We want to see her too.

302
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,885
Could she give us a special lecture?

303
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,804
Nope. She's all mine.

304
00:29:24,972 --> 00:29:27,683
- Come on, why not?
- Just once, please?

305
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:29,893
All right, that's enough fun for today.

306
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,866
We had a very memorable introduction
yesterday, didn't we?

307
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,202
However, I intend to continue

308
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:31,496
pushing all of you.

309
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:36,168
I would appreciate it
if everyone followed along.

310
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,296
All right, then.

311
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:43,050
Luna, please change seats with Mr. Park.

312
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:48,388
Starting with our next concert,
our new concertmaster will be Lee Luna.

313
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,706
What is she talking about?

314
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:57,022
Sir, I would appreciate your cooperation.

315
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,459
I'll say it again, Luna.

316
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,127
Come up front and take your seat.

317
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,130
Maestra.

318
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,804
- I think you're being stubborn.
- So what?

319
00:31:30,097 --> 00:31:31,932
Even rudeness has its limits.

320
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,184
There's one thing I'd like to clarify.

321
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:36,436
A conductor can leave,

322
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,189
but the orchestra will remain.

323
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:49,449
Come on, Yoseop.

324
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,535
Yoseop, wait. Ajin, don't go.

325
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,703
Wait a minute. Hold on, please.

326
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,289
All right, everyone, just wait a minute.

327
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:58,750
Where are you all going? For God's sake.

328
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:00,794
My goodness.

329
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:07,259
Now, just wait a minute.

330
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:10,720
You can't all just leave like this.

331
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:13,306
How can she change concertmasters
without notifying anyone?

332
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,184
You need more than talent
to be a concertmaster. Luna's just a kid.

333
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,312
She's right. And what about Sujin,
our assistant concertmaster?

334
00:32:19,396 --> 00:32:21,064
Out of the blue, she chose Luna?

335
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,900
It's obvious she has no regard for us.

336
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:27,195
No matter who she is, this is too much.

337
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,531
We cannot let this slide, Mr. Jeon.

338
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,336
Please handle this
according to regulations

339
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,743
regarding the new conductor
and the concertmaster.

340
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,373
What is going on with you?

341
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,584
Mr. Park is Hanphil's oldest member.

342
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:43,378
- How could you do that without...
- You granted me carte blanche.

343
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,339
You should have consulted
with the executives…

344
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:49,634
- Or at least with me.
- Would it have made a difference?

345
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,974
Why would you suddenly change
the concertmaster?

346
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,436
In terms of ability, Luna is the best,
and Hanphil needs a change.

347
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,438
Do I need to explain myself further?

348
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,608
Concertmasters need more than just talent.

349
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:07,986
If a kid with little stage experience
becomes concertmaster...

350
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,047
- It'd be refreshing.
- They'd find it refreshing...

351
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,072
What?

352
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,367
I heard Luna was chosen
over all the other accomplished musicians

353
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:15,869
during the blind recruitment.

354
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:19,456
Totally based on talent.
I was able to confirm it, of course.

355
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,754
Okay, then,

356
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,255
how about Kwon Sujin?

357
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:30,091
It makes more sense to promote
the assistant concertmaster.

358
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:33,887
That smile scares me.

359
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:36,848
I clearly stated
that I only care about talent,

360
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,225
not someone's background.

361
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:41,353
- What do you...
- I mean nepotism.

362
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:45,065
What? It's not true.

363
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,526
Those rumors are unfounded…

364
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:49,945
I meant that nepotism
should not be tolerated.

365
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,488
My only concern is talent.

366
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,157
You must have misunderstood me.

367
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,994
Kwon Sujin seems capable enough.

368
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,874
Let's avoid unnecessary procedures.

369
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,877
There will be an uproar.
Are you trying to drive everyone away?

370
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,462
The backlash indicates

371
00:34:07,546 --> 00:34:10,799
that the reform is going
in the right direction.

372
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,179
Within a year, Hanphil will be on top.

373
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:18,098
I'll step down if it doesn't work out.

374
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,855
I'll give you three months.

375
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:31,653
Increase the paid attendance rate
to at least 50% within three months.

376
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,287
Your wish is modest.

377
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,957
What about 90%?

378
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,168
No.

379
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:49,421
How about 95%?

380
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,846
I'm fine.

381
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:01,725
Mr. Park.

382
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:31,463
DAD

383
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,344
SEEUM MUSIC STORE
ALL THE WORLD'S MUSIC

384
00:35:37,427 --> 00:35:39,067
Boss, I'm going home now.

385
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,347
Sure, go ahead.

386
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,558
Nice work.

387
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,146
Hey, Pops, Seeum is here.

388
00:35:48,313 --> 00:35:49,689
Hey, Seeum!

389
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,318
- How have you been?
- Good.

390
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,405
Who do we have here?

391
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,492
Hey, Dad.

392
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,498
I'm back.

393
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,348
You've lost some weight, I see.

394
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,559
No, she hasn't.
She's become more beautiful.

395
00:36:26,643 --> 00:36:29,562
Ah, living in the States
must have been great.

396
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,356
How have you been?

397
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:35,485
You know me. Work and my kid
are all I have time for.

398
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:39,698
Why did you have to come now?
I have to go pick up Seowoo.

399
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,909
I'll see you soon, right?

400
00:36:43,118 --> 00:36:44,358
You're running late. Go on now.

401
00:36:44,452 --> 00:36:47,372
All right. Good night, old man.

402
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:48,540
Good night.

403
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,799
Shall we have some hot tea?

404
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,135
Sounds great.

405
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,222
I'll be right back.

406
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:20,613
Don't just stand there,

407
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,198
go on up to the house.

408
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:58,461
GRAND PRIZE IN STRING INSTRUMENT CATEGORY
CHA SEEUM, THIRD GRADE

409
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:43,464
<i>Die!</i>

410
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:47,677
Die!

411
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,178
Die.

412
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,309
Please die!

413
00:39:54,434 --> 00:39:55,727
Seeum.

414
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,990
Everything's the same, right?

415
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:12,674
It must've been hard keeping
everything clean. Why did you bother?

416
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,622
It was like a ritual for me.

417
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:20,627
I would sweep and dust
while praying for your well-being.

418
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,589
My prayers have been instrumental
to your success in the States.

419
00:40:33,514 --> 00:40:36,476
You're going to visit your mom,
aren't you?

420
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:49,405
I need more time.

421
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:56,663
Thank you for doing this.

422
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,290
You remembered what I said

423
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,501
and came to see your mom
before she goes.

424
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:04,212
That's enough for now.

425
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,298
Let me know whenever you're ready.

426
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,470
By the way…

427
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,264
You saw Jaeman, right?

428
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,226
He was your violin teacher.

429
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,229
He was thrilled
when I told him you were coming.

430
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:25,984
You can count on him
to be a big help to you.

431
00:41:29,237 --> 00:41:30,613
The concertmaster was replaced.

432
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,245
What do you mean?

433
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:40,915
It just happened.

434
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,004
Seeum, how could you...

435
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:50,133
I just hope you can understand me, Dad.

436
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,196
Daddy!

437
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,948
Daddy!

438
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,914
You came out to see me?

439
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,959
Hi, honey.

440
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,353
Hope you had a good day.

441
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,855
- Hayeon, let's go home.
- Let's go.

442
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,173
Hayeon, let's have
something nice for dinner.

443
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,272
Why'd you leave your father's so early?
I wanted to see him, too.

444
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,109
He's sleeping. Maybe next time.

445
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,279
I hurried over,
but I guess I was still too late.

446
00:42:53,863 --> 00:42:54,906
Let's just go.

447
00:42:58,242 --> 00:43:01,245
We should take your father
on a trip somewhere nearby.

448
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,206
It's been a while since you were in Korea.

449
00:43:06,918 --> 00:43:08,252
That sounds great.

450
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,173
Honey, do you…

451
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,218
Yes, do I what?

452
00:43:16,636 --> 00:43:17,637
Never mind.

453
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,348
Come on, what is it?

454
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,939
Do you regret not having children?

455
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,486
Not really.

456
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,696
What makes you ask that now?

457
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,491
You're all I need.

458
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:42,787
Besides, it can't be easy being a dad.

459
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,248
I don't think I'd be a good one.

460
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:51,671
You would have been a great father.

461
00:44:21,409 --> 00:44:22,535
Wow, this is fun.

462
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:25,955
Why did you create this game?

463
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:29,417
Because I've maxed out
my levels on everything.

464
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,669
RPG games are really my thing.

465
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,505
I beat every game on the market
and had nothing else to play.

466
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,216
- That's why I created it.
- You really maxed out all your levels?

467
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,970
Yes, I have a difficult time
containing my curiosity.

468
00:44:41,596 --> 00:44:43,306
I must see things through to the end.

469
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,684
Do you tend to obsess over things?

470
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,353
- Excuse me?
- You would have to.

471
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,564
Creating something interesting
requires persistence.

472
00:44:52,106 --> 00:44:54,650
Oh, well, yes, I do.

473
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,861
That grit is appealing to me.

474
00:44:56,944 --> 00:45:00,615
BRIEFING ON ATTRACTING INVESTMENT

475
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,242
- Mr. CEO.
- Yes, sir.

476
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:05,453
Can you tell me
what you want most in life?

477
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,207
At the moment,
it would be getting this investment.

478
00:45:14,003 --> 00:45:16,339
So if I don't invest,

479
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,926
your feelings will be similar to mine.

480
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,309
I'll invest then. This is fun.

481
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:29,727
Thank you, sir.

482
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,312
Thank you!

483
00:45:51,207 --> 00:45:52,333
What are you doing?

484
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,295
I wanted to feel like a chairman
instead of a CEO.

485
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,759
Hey, what about Seeum?

486
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:03,678
Did you see her?

487
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:05,346
Not yet.

488
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,725
Well, I guess it's pointless to meet now.

489
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:11,560
Actually, we're meeting.

490
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,068
For curiosity's sake.

491
00:46:21,696 --> 00:46:23,823
Look at those eyes.

492
00:46:24,532 --> 00:46:26,909
You're going off the rails again.

493
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:40,214
Your eyes are wandering.

494
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:45,511
They're all running late.
We'll be starting soon.

495
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,431
They're not running late.

496
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,808
It's because of me, isn't it?

497
00:46:52,101 --> 00:46:56,564
Actually, I know that
I shouldn't be the concertmaster.

498
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,067
I was planning to tell Seeum
when she got here...

499
00:47:00,151 --> 00:47:03,237
You'll do it if you want to.
What's the problem?

500
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,048
Everyone who's rehearsing today
is here, right?

501
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:26,344
Luna, please come
to the concertmaster's seat.

502
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:32,808
Luna?

503
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,686
Yes, of course.

504
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,280
Let's begin.

505
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,334
What's going on?

506
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:00,127
Where's everyone else?

507
00:48:01,379 --> 00:48:04,799
Seeum, please listen…

508
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,093
Come on.

509
00:48:07,426 --> 00:48:09,970
You could be nicer
and try to appease them.

510
00:48:10,096 --> 00:48:11,776
They'll be more open-minded and come back.

511
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:14,475
Why should I?
It was their own decision to quit.

512
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:17,770
There's not much time
until the next concert.

513
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,481
Exactly. There isn't much time left,

514
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:22,525
and they staged a protest.

515
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:24,276
Well, that's because

516
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:27,113
you changed
the concertmaster at your whim…

517
00:48:27,363 --> 00:48:28,683
They have until tomorrow.

518
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,993
I'll assume they're all quitting
if they don't show up tomorrow.

519
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:35,454
What?

520
00:48:35,955 --> 00:48:38,666
Please go and tell them
so I can choose new members.

521
00:48:39,375 --> 00:48:43,421
Now, hold on a minute…
This is driving me crazy.

522
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,633
You're hurting my feelings.

523
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,010
Come on, Sujin. You're better than this.

524
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,054
Why are you doing this?
I thought we were close.

525
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,597
I can't work with Seeum.

526
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,641
Don't be like that.

527
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:57,810
I think you should reconsider.

528
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:00,688
Since Seeum is so great,
let her handle everything.

529
00:49:00,855 --> 00:49:03,399
You should be trying to convince her,
not us.

530
00:49:03,524 --> 00:49:05,151
That's what I'm saying.

531
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:09,071
It's over for Hanphil
if you don't show up tomorrow.

532
00:49:09,238 --> 00:49:11,574
Everyone's really digging in their heels.

533
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,160
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeon.

534
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,080
My answer is no.

535
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,876
She said she would hire new members.

536
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,257
<i>What happens if we all get fired?</i>

537
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,019
- Mr. Jeon.
- Yes?

538
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,025
APPROVED BY
CEO

539
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:51,697
Here you go.

540
00:49:54,909 --> 00:49:56,243
Mm.

541
00:49:56,911 --> 00:49:57,912
This is nice.

542
00:49:58,078 --> 00:50:01,207
Did something good happen, Mr. Jeon?

543
00:50:01,457 --> 00:50:03,709
Well, of course.

544
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:06,504
It's a beautiful day,
and the coffee is great.

545
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:08,672
Despite all the protesting members?

546
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,841
This is me you're talking to.

547
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,677
What? Did you resolve everything?

548
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,930
Look for yourself. They're all here.

549
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,016
Wow, I can't believe it!

550
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,162
There's this thing called leadership.

551
00:50:22,186 --> 00:50:23,979
Well, sometimes,

552
00:50:24,063 --> 00:50:26,982
I feel so proud of myself, you know?

553
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,443
Why did everyone come so early?

554
00:50:30,945 --> 00:50:31,946
Uh...

555
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,366
They're a little earlier than usual…

556
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:39,203
Why is this chill going down my spine?

557
00:51:00,182 --> 00:51:02,017
You all turned to me in your time of need.

558
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,895
I'm here because
I understand how you feel.

559
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:06,939
I'll keep this short.

560
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:11,652
I invite you all to perform
the <i>Pastoral Symphony</i> with me.

561
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:30,838
- Is it locked?
- Yes.

562
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,841
This is so childish. Open this door!

563
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:36,844
Open it right now!
This doesn't change anything.

564
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,804
- Here it is, Mr. Jeon.
- Man… Thanks.

565
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,639
I can't believe this. Wait a minute.

566
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,391
What do I do with this…

567
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,810
Hurry up and find it. My goodness.

568
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:49,315
What's going on?

569
00:51:51,275 --> 00:51:53,986
Uh, the door is locked.

570
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:00,576
Why did you have to fire
the concertmaster?

571
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:02,661
What is the problem?

572
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,664
Everything. The members
are rehearsing together

573
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,833
without the conductor and concertmaster.

574
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,151
Move aside.

575
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:53,744
Now there's no problem, right?

576
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,814
Thanks for your hard work, Mr. Oh.

577
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,691
You may step down now.

578
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,075
The members do not want to work with you.

579
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:25,119
That's why I'm here.

580
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,539
You are not welcome here in Hanphil.

581
00:53:28,706 --> 00:53:31,542
I decide where I stay.

582
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:33,460
We cannot follow

583
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,337
your arbitrary decisions.

584
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,961
You can't change concertmasters
without our consent.

585
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,009
Are you content to remain
a third-rate orchestra?

586
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:44,972
- What did you say?
- Seeum.

587
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:54,022
The concertmaster's ability
is the heart of the orchestra.

588
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,442
It doesn't take much to recognize

589
00:53:56,525 --> 00:53:58,986
Luna's ability, if you have ears.

590
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,921
We will continue to be in this position

591
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,116
if we compromise on everything
according to custom.

592
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:08,662
But as long as I'm here,
Hanphil will be the best.

593
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:10,748
It's going to be ruthless and intense.

594
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,714
If you're not prepared for this,
please leave now.

595
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:48,035
Apparently, this is what the members want.

596
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,149
If you want to fight with me,

597
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,152
do it through music.

598
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,699
Concertmaster,
are you ready for rehearsal?

599
00:55:28,367 --> 00:55:29,952
Yes, of course.

600
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,830
We're really going to rehearse
right now, in this mess?

601
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:34,706
I know, right?

602
00:55:37,376 --> 00:55:40,170
<i>Angenehme, heitere Empfindungen.</i>

603
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,881
Pleasant, cheerful feelings.

604
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:48,011
That's what Beethoven wrote
on the score of his <i>Pastoral Symphony.</i>

605
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:51,014
Imagine the view that Beethoven saw

606
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,725
when he went to the countryside.

607
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,978
The earlier performance was too dry.

608
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,565
Now, remembering that feeling,
let's try that again.

609
00:56:13,537 --> 00:56:15,122
Cheerfully.

610
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:21,378
As if we are giving and receiving.

611
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,007
As if you're warmly embracing each other.

612
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:29,803
Subito.

613
00:56:33,265 --> 00:56:34,683
Crescendo.

614
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:39,146
Good.

615
00:56:46,653 --> 00:56:47,779
Excellent.

616
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,754
Watch the concertmaster, bows in unison.

617
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:01,103
It's been a long time.

618
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,607
STRINGS OF TRUTH

619
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:49,484
<i>Hello. I'm Yoo Jeongjae.</i>

620
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:51,069
<i>I bought this orchestra.</i>

621
00:58:51,403 --> 00:58:53,780
- Is this amusing?
- Play with me again.

622
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,800
<i>So, I need something to threaten you with.</i>

623
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,677
<i>Whether you have to cajole them
or threaten them…</i>

624
00:58:57,701 --> 00:58:59,077
You will never get your way.

625
00:58:59,161 --> 00:59:00,281
The concert's been canceled.

626
00:59:00,412 --> 00:59:02,205
I told you to come back to me.

627
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:03,749
<i>There must be some mistake.</i>

628
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:06,501
<i>Do you by chance
know a guy named Yoo Jeongjae?</i>

629
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:09,268
<i>Can you keep it a secret
that I know about this?</i>

630
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:12,019
<i>But you know it's not my style
to give up either, right?</i>

631
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,341
<i>Stop joking.</i>

632
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,136
<i>You think I'm joking?
The next round is going to be fun.</i>

633
