[Episode 31]

5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,380
We will help Your Highness

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,770
wipe their power from the realm.

7
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,490
That's our offer.

8
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,570
I wonder

9
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:51,490
if it's enough for you.

10
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,690
Tang Linghuang is our...

11
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:01,980
friend.

12
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,980
He's also Lianyue's senior.

13
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,260
Naturally,

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,290
his life matters greatly to us.

15
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,850
If you can help us

16
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,170
rescue him,

17
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,170
and purge the puppet poison in him,

18
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,820
we'll owe you a great favor.

19
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,450
As for what you said,

20
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,940
borrowing my light

21
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,730
to light Blood River's path...

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,540
it's an honor

23
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,170
for me.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,170
I believe

25
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,450
you can bring the jianghu

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,220
a brand-new

27
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,340
Blood River.

28
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,500
Not bad.

29
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,130
That's a decent ending.

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,220
This isn't the end.

31
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,730
It's only the beginning.

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,220
When Blood River is finally accepted

33
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,100
by the world,

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:12,060
Master Mu,

35
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,940
what's the first thing you want to do?

36
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,890
What I want most...

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,820
The first thing

38
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:22,340
is to pass the headship

39
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,340
to Yumo.

40
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,410
The first thing

41
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,730
is to hand it off?

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,060
My duty

43
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,980
is to lead the Mu family

44
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,260
into the light.

45
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,380
Clearly,

46
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,450
I've done that.

47
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,130
As for

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,660
the road ahead,

49
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,980
that's for them to decide.

50
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,340
My second thing

51
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,060
is to go to Wangchengshan Sect.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:45,820
I'll meet

53
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,540
the Profound Sword Deity I admire most.

54
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:48,980
And I'll eat

55
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,570
a peach he planted himself.

56
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,010
Then...

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,060
stay at Mount Wangcheng to cultivate?

58
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,100
I did think so once,

59
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:02,980
but...

60
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,820
probably not.

61
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,890
Why not?

62
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,100
Because cultivation demands cutting off love,

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,570
and I can't.

64
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,340
My third thing

65
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,380
is to tell Xuewei...

66
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,700
I like her,

67
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,540
and...

68
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,140
I've liked her for many years.

69
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,730
The previous generation of the Mu family

70
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,020
in Blood River

71
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,850
were terrors that made people quake.

72
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,700
So how come your lot

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,580
think only of romance?

74
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,810
Sir,

75
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,410
why are your hands so cold?

76
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,730
When did you learn the Frost Palm?

77
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,500
I didn't.

78
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,250
Changhe...

79
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,050
Let's head back to the Clinic.

80
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:16,490
Master,

81
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,810
are you sure

82
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,810
this tonic won't overwhelm

83
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,540
Changhe's body?

84
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,100
It's way too tonifying.

85
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,100
It's all blazing yang herbs.

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,250
No matter.

87
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,410
Su Changhe can take it.

88
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:30,700
Okay.

89
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,610
You're burning, then freezing.

90
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,810
How is this possible?

91
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,170
What's this?

92
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,370
Changhe,

93
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,660
my master told you to drink this.

94
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,250
I'm not drinking it.

95
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,100
Does this look fit for a human to drink?

96
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,370
I tasted it.

97
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,580
It looks black

98
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,460
but tastes sweet.

99
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:45,490
Without that medicine,

100
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,730
you'll sleep an hour

101
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:48,930
and wake freezing,

102
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,580
another hour

103
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:51,780
and wake burning.

104
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,540
Then you won't sleep again,

105
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,170
because you'll feel

106
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,020
ants crawling all over you.

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,660
Mighty Patriarch of Blood River

108
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,340
ever suffered like that?

109
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,780
Feels like being thrown back into the Furnace.

110
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,290
The Prince of Langya

111
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,340
is off.

112
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,140
Maybe...

113
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,490
he cultivates an extreme-cold style?

114
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,050
That palm you took earlier

115
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:21,290
hurt you with Frost Qi.

116
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,900
His skills aren't weak.

117
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,850
But if his palm could hurt me this bad,

118
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,850
what right do we have

119
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,700
to bargain with him?

120
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,660
My Hell Palm

121
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,340
draws in the opponent's Qi

122
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,540
in a clash of palms,

123
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,540
and strikes it back.

124
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,020
So the stronger the foe, the harder it hits.

125
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,900
But the Prince of Langya's Qi

126
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:38,580
carries poison.

127
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,370
What kind of poison?

128
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:42,220
It's frost poison.

129
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:43,370
That's right.

130
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:44,900
It's frost poison.

131
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,460
If it were Frost Qi alone,

132
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,370
I'd just absorb it and strike it back.

133
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,460
But the frost poison is tricky.

134
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,540
With one palmful I drew in,

135
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,540
it started rampaging

136
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,490
all through my body.

137
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,660
He poisoned you?

138
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,220
No, he didn't.

139
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,100
The moment he came in,

140
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,170
I sensed something off

141
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,140
in his look.

142
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,930
He was invaded by frost poison himself.

143
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,460
He hasn't long to live.

144
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,220
Oh, really?

145
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,490
But,

146
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,020
isn't he a prince?

147
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,540
With so many imperial physicians,

148
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,580
how is he still afflicted?

149
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,580
I heard two years ago,

150
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,290
he led a southern campaign.

151
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,140
Nanjue sent

152
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,100
five martial arts grandmasters to kill him.

153
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:27,610
All five were cut down,

154
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:29,290
but one of them

155
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,660
had reached the Free-Heaven level

156
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,890
and practiced the Demonic Frost Art, Moon-Yin Finger.

157
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,300
Maybe the rumor is true.

158
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,180
No wonder

159
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,180
he's so desperate to work with us.

160
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,220
Seems he's cornered too.

161
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,370
Can this frost poison

162
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,220
be cured?

163
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,370
I'd need to take his pulse

164
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,820
to be sure,

165
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,610
but from how he looked earlier,

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,770
he's likely at the point

167
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,100
of beyond remedy.

168
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,530
Even if once

169
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:01,250
there was a chance to treat it,

170
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,300
by now

171
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,440
there's at best a sliver of hope.

172
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,610
As a man soon to die,

173
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,460
what would he want from us?

174
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,010
Maybe he wants our hand

175
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,340
to purge Tianqi City

176
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,650
of those plotting unrest.

177
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,850
Before he dies, he wants

178
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,460
to clear every threat

179
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,820
for his elder brother.

180
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:27,100
That's his aim.

181
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:30,250
So noble as that?

182
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,530
If I were dying,

183
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,220
why care about tomorrow?

184
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,890
The world

185
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:38,340
would have nothing to do with me.

186
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:48,130
I'm going into seclusion.

187
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,370
Seclusion?

188
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,250
That frost poison nearly crippled me,

189
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,100
and it ties to my Hell Palm

190
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,010
at the ninth level.

191
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,980
I failed to break that threshold,

192
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,730
so the backlash hit this hard.

193
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,420
Once I reach the ninth,

194
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,980

quit with the cryptic talk.

320
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,480
He sprang up

321
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,180
just like that.

322
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,100

327
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,530
I'll take it back and refine medicine.

328
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,770
This case defies a quick prescription.

329
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,610
I need time to work it out.

330
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,490

335
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:32,180
Nothing.

336
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:33,460
He's only asleep.

337
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,700

338
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,340

340
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:51,850

How is my son's illness?

342
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,340
His condition

343
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,460
won't be cured in a snap.

344
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,730
If it were that simple,

345
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,290
those physicians you hired

346
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,380
would've fixed him already.

347
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,090
But none of them

348
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:10,730
produced this specific reaction.

349
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,220
That means their skills were lacking.

350
00:17:13,830 --> 00:17:14,380
However,

351
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,860
I can at least let your son

352
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,140
sleep soundly.

353
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,420
Otherwise,

354
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,860
if that state earlier

355
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:21,290
last another dozen days,

356
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,290
even if he doesn't die,

357
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,570
he'll be a living corpse.

358
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,050
Hey!

359
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,570
Sir, rest easy.

360
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,380
Miss Bai has a plan.

361
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,220
Once the elixir is refined,

362
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:31,900
Mr. Li's illness

363
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:33,810
will naturally be cured.

364
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,730
Cured?

365
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,180
What's going on?

366
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,770
I don't know either.

367
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,090
The deputy commander sent men everywhere for physicians,

368
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,250
and one turned up at Blood River's clinic.

369
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,530
By the time we heard,

370
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,050
the physician was already inside.

371
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,090
Don't let her leave.

372
00:17:59,310 --> 00:17:59,860
At once.

373
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,290
Can your people

374
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,380
guarantee this job?

375
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,010
You decide to act?

376
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,090
Let's hope those Blood River folks

377
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,530
don't disappoint me.

378
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,220
Much obliged, Sir.

381
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:35,660
Of course.

382
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,220
But,

383
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,730
it'll take a few days.

384
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,700
If that's the case,

385
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:42,090
please stay

386
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,660
at my manor a few days.

387
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,010
Sir,

388
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,290
I brought the physician here.

389
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:48,810
If she wants to leave,

390
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,180
I'm taking her.

391
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,700
If you mean to keep her by force,

392
00:18:53,310 --> 00:18:55,420
there's only one way.

393
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,420
Which is?

394
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:00,660
Kill me.

395
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,980
You think I don't dare?

396
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:07,900
Never mind my title

397
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,530
as Second Master of Thousand-Gold Tower.

398
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,700
Today, I'm just Tu Wan.

399
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,900
If you want me dead,

400
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,010
go ahead and try

401
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,460
so long as you can shoulder

402
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,250
the cost.

403
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,620
Fine.

404
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,730
As you wish!

405
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,730
Whether I stay or go

406
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,530
isn't for you to decide.

407
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,700
Come on!

408
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,490
Come on!

409
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,660
All of you at once.

410
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:36,860
Let's see

411
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:37,940
who can keep us here today.

412
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,090
Go!

413
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:54,940
Who's there?

414
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,380
You knew I'm here?

415
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,530
No.

416
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:03,530
I guessed.

417
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,050
Who are you?

418
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,980
Physicians heal and save lives.

419
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:16,860
All should respect them.

420
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,490
Yet you would cage one.

421
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,420
How is that right?

422
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,490
So, you're going to kill me?

423
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:27,770
If I wanted you dead,

424
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,490
I could do it anytime.

425
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,420
But right and wrong

426
00:20:31,550 --> 00:20:32,860
aren't judged by might.

427
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,140
You stand in the light.

428
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,460
Treasure your power and rank.

429
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:42,220
Let's go.

430
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,730
Off we go!

431
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,050
Also,

432
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,090
if you want to make trouble

433
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,250
for Second Master Tu later,

434
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,900
then next time we meet,

435
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,620
what I bring you

436
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,010
won't be just sword energy.

437
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,010
What madman are you?

438
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:12,980
Do you take Tianqi City's Jinwu Guard

439
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,940
for mere decoration?

440
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,770
You're just a swordsman.

441
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,940
You may kill one, kill ten.

442
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:23,090
But if my Jinwu Guard comes by the thousand,

443
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,010
will you survive?

444
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,180
I don't know if I will,

445
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,180
but you...

446
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:37,420
will certainly die.

447
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:52,330
Truly sorry.

448
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:53,860
I thought

449
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,810
it was a chance

450
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,220
for He-Yu Clinic to make a name in Tianqi.

451
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,220
I didn't expect the Jinwu Guard's deputy commander

452
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,620
to be this unreasonable.

453
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:02,730
It's fine.

454
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,490
You meant well.

455
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,180
Miss Bai and I will head back.

456
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,570
If the deputy commander

457
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,090
comes after you later,

458
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,730
find us at the Clinic.

459
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,420
Don't be afraid.

460
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,700
We've got your back.

461
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,700
All right.

462
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,330
As for his son's illness,

463
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,620
no need to bother, Miss.

464
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,380
Let them fend for themselves.

465
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,900
They should taste a little hardship.

466
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,090
I'll take my leave.

467
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,010
Mr. Su,

468
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,660
let's go hear some tunes when you're free.

469
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:31,490
Farewell.

470
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,180
That deputy commander's son

471
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:40,980
isn't right.

472
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,090
Why?

473
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,530
He bears puppet poison,

474
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,530
but unlike what we saw

475
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,550
in Sihuai City that day.

476
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,660
This one is still alive.

477
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,700
I have a bad feeling.

478
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,290
Maybe Night Crow

479
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,620
is seeping her puppet poison

480
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,490
through all of Tianqi City.

481
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:55,900
If even here

482
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,900
a deputy commander's son is poisoned,

483
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,250
then elsewhere

484
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,140
others

485
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:00,940
may be infected too.

486
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,490
Are they trying

487
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,420
to raise a puppet army?

488
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,530
No wonder they've kept quiet

489
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,050
all this time.

490
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,730
Let's return to the Clinic.

491
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,860
I took a drop of his brow-blood.

492
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:12,770
I'll see if I can refine

493
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:13,810
an antidote early.

494
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:14,620
Okay.

495
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:17,420
Be careful!

496
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,940
What crushing blade aura.

497
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,490
You're Blade Ghost Xu Liuyun.

498
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,050
You're Umbrella Ghost Su Muyu.

499
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,490
Many years ago,

500
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:41,420
we met once.

501
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,730
Yes.

502
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,940
Shame we met,

503
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,490
yet had no chance

504
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:48,770
to test each other.

505
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,220
Meeting again in Tianqi City

506
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,330
settles that regret.

507
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:58,940
You want a fight with me?

508
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,010
Why?

509
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,860
Sent by another,

510
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,620
I've waited for you here.

511
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,250
As for the physician behind you,

512
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,700
her life

513
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,530
will be taken here, today.

514
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,220
So the famed Blade Ghost of Nanjue

515
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,660
let Tianqi's powers

516
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,380
use him?

517
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,660
Didn't expect that.

518
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:22,730
We're all just blades

519
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,660
in others' hands.

520
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,660
Isn't Blood River the same?

521
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:27,900
Not anymore.

522
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:29,900
We're different now.

523
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,490
Miss Bai,

524
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,900
when I clash with him,

525
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,090
find a way to slip out.

526
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,330
I've heard

527
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,420
of the Blade Ghost of Nanjue.

528
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:39,330
They say his skill rivals a Blade Deity's,

529
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,810
but his ways are too bizarre

530
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,220
to be ranked one.

531
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,940
Be careful.

532
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,330
Rest easy.

533
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,290
No problem.

534
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:52,570
Since they call you Umbrella Ghost,

535
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,730
I'll gift you a ghost-breaker.

536
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:07,180
Immortal-slayer!

537
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,380
Without your umbrella,

538
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,220
you can't use the Eighteen-Sword Array.

539
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:57,730
After all,

540
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,290
that's your deadliest killing art.

541
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,090
My Spring-Rain Swordwork

542
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,140
is enough to kill you.

543
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,290
I see.

544
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:10,420
You want

545
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,220
to cast off those marks on you,

546
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,490
the title Umbrella Ghost,

547
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,220
the Eighteen-Sword Array...

548
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,730
Do you know

549
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,460
when a killer

550
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,700
will meet

551
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,180
his death?

552
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,420
It's...

553
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,620
when his heart holds

554
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,090
more than killing!

555
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,010
Don't treat me like dead weight!

556
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,220
Now I see

557
00:26:57,270 --> 00:26:58,420
why you're only a Blade Ghost,

558
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,490
not a Blade Deity.

559
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,940
As long as I win,

560
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,180
titles mean nothing!

561
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,220
Horse-Cleaver fells immortals.

562
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,140
Goose-Feather Blade slays saints.

563
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,010
Miao Sabre breaks ghosts.

564
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,980
Precept Blade banishes Buddhas.

565
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,900
Gold-Ring Saber destroys deities.

566
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,900
Be you immortal, Buddha, ghost, deity,

567
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,460
or the greatest sage among men,

568
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,810
all will die beneath my blades!

569
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:04,700
Fall!

570
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,940
Su Muyu!

571
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,900
I've laid a poison array.

572
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:16,860
He won't dare get close.

573
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,570
Fight at ease.

574
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:18,330
Kill him!

575
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,420
What?

576
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,860
I know

577
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,250
why you use so many blades.

578
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,730
You can't drive any single one

579
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,010
to its limit.

580
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,460
Therefore,

581
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,660
you wield them all

582
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,180
to mask your weakness.

583
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,730
You're not wrong.

584
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:52,810
But I'll kill you

585
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,810
before you shatter the last,

586
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,460
Umbrella Ghost!

587
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,810
Now that Changhe and I lead Blood River,

588
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,900
you should address me as...

589
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,860
Master Su.

590
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,620
All right.

591
00:29:22,070 --> 00:29:22,940
Master Su.

592
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,180
You're worthy of the name!

593
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,090
No one's there?

594
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,570
You really think I'm that foolish?

595
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,900
Miss Bai!

596
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:06,860
Miss Bai.

597
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,660
Master...

598
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,330
Stop the bleeding for me.

599
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,010
At my waist,

600
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:30,810
there's a green vial.

601
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:31,980
Take it out.

602
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,090
It can save my life.

603
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:51,940
Don't worry.

604
00:30:58,830 --> 00:30:59,620
Miss Bai...

605
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:16,980
Useless!

606
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,180
You wasted plenty of my Qi.

607
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:25,860
You didn't use your sword.

608
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,660
With only sword aura and energy,

609
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,220
you killed my disciple at her side.

610
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,660
Seems you care quite a lot

611
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,570
for that lady.

612
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,290
Yet you're merciless

613
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,900
to your disciple.

614
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,660
She can't move now,

615
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,660
and could die any moment.

616
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,980
If you still mean to shield her,

617
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,180
it won't be as easy as before.

618
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,140
Why must you kill her?

619
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,770
She's the one least tied

620
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,980
to this mess.

621
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,860
Dragging her

622
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,700
into this storm,

623
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,140
do you feel guilty?

624
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,330
Wind rises!

625
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,290
Blade-Ruin Array!

626
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,250
It takes time to break

627
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,380
my Blade-Ruin Array.

628
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,730
You won't live to see him.

629
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,460
Die!

630
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:58,140
You forced the array to save her.

631
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,050
Had you let her go,

632
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,180
you wouldn't be this badly hurt.

633
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,980
What-ifs

634
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,660
are meaningless.

635
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,700
But in the end,

636
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:10,290
I'm the winner!

637
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,420
This blade's seen years.

638
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,530
Thirty-two years ago,

639
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:19,660
when I first wandered the jianghu,

640
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,290
I bought it for two taels.

641
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,570
It's broken three times since,

642
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,290
patched and cased,

643
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:27,730
sixteen years without light.

644
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,810
Now drawn again,

645
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,730
it can take

646
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,860
Master Su's fine head...

647
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,420
Lucky for it, I'd say.

648
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,660
