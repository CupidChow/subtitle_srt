[Episode 13]

5
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,390
If word of Blood River spreads

6
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,660
across the jianghu,

7
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:45,130
then we, with nowhere to go,

8
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,330
will make Tianqi City

9
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,840
our first stop.

10
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,330
Maybe the world won't have us,

11
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,850
but we'll...

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,770
erase the Shadow Sect from this world.

13
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,010
Fine young man...

14
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,940
gutsy,

15
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,220
sharp,

16
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,940
and skilled.

17
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:38,780
The moment he walked in,

18
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,220
he sensed you were here.

19
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,890
Didn't you try

20
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,980
to hide your aura?

21
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,500
You were wrong.

22
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,890
Before he entered,

23
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:51,690
I used the Breath-Concealing Art

24
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,260
to fully conceal

25
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:54,500
every trace of my aura.

26
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,060
His skills are high.

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,610
So young,

28
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,870
and already beyond

29
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,960
the last Su family head.

30
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,940
If you plan to rein them in,

31
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:11,610
judging by the Shadow Sect today,

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,610
His Highness will be disappointed.

33
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,130
Yi Bu,

34
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,730
show some real skill.

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,610
This is the Wanjuan Tower.

36
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,750
[Wanjuan Tower]

37
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,890
In this residence,

38
00:03:58,430 --> 00:03:59,610
it's the most heavily guarded.

39
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,540
To get inside,

40
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,220
I must draw those experts away.

41
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:32,810
Uncle Zhe,

42
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:34,490
you're here.

43
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:37,250
On my way,

44
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,340
I got your message to the Patriarch.

45
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,220
So...

46
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,460
we really plan to kill the Prince of Langya?

47
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,370
Back in Blood River,

48
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,410
that isn't a contract

49
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,780
I'd ever take.

50
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,100
Besides,

51
00:04:53,390 --> 00:04:54,370
he's of the Xiao imperial line,

52
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,540
first in three generations.

53
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,370
He's not an easy kill.

54
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:00,810
What's your plan?

55
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,140
First we'll pretend to bargain with the Shadow Sect.

56
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,370
We have to visit the Wanjuan Tower.

57
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,660
We must find a way

58
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,100
to shatter the Shadow Sect in one strike,

59
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:11,850
then pull away

60
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,140
most of their forces,

61
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,610
enter Wanjuan Tower,

62
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:16,780
and destroy every record

63
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,610
on Blood River.

64
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,340
That way,

65
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,140
Blood River can be a guild

66
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,490
born and raised in the jianghu.

67
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,460
Yi Bu wants to use us

68
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,490
to kill the Prince of Langya.

69
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,580
That means he's scared.

70
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,340
So we'll do

71
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,340
the opposite:

72
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,370
use the Prince of Langya

73
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,810
to wipe out the Shadow Sect.

74
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,100
I thought the battle at Jiuxiao City

75
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,290
was the end of it all.

76
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,980
After surviving this time,

77
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,460
will there be another hurdle?

78
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,250
Where there are people,

79
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,540
there's a jianghu.

80
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,610
Where there's a jianghu,

81
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,250
there's conflict.

82
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,610
Besides,

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,100
you've got a brother who loves a good fight.

84
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,810
When will he arrive?

85
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:04,700
I've already sent word

86
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,580
about Tianqi City.

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,370
Once he's ready,

88
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,930
he'll enter Tianqi.

89
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,020
In that case,

90
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,900
we'll wait a few days.

91
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,020
Compared to us,

92
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,110
that Shadow Sect lot

93
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,700
won't be sitting easy.

94
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,520
Since we're in Tianqi,

95
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,050
I'll take you around

96
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,290
to some fun spots.

97
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,660
The most famous places in Tianqi City?

98
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,780
I've made the rounds these days.

99
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:32,930
Oh yeah? Which ones?

100
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,490
Thousand-Gold Tower,

101
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,270
the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,170
the Heaven-Querying Stone,

103
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,050
Dragon-Ascending Garden.

104
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,780
I even stopped by the academy.

105
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:41,980
Hold it.

106
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,100
What kind of boring spots are those?

107
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,170
They're the most famous sites

108
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,220
in all of Tianqi City.

109
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:53,930
When it comes

110
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:54,900
to the truly famous place,

111
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,210
it should be...

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,120
The Imperial Palace?

113
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,610
The Entertainment Street.

114
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,030
Su Changhe?

115
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,020
What brings you here?

116
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:13,370
I'm going to find Su Muyu.

117
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,220
Want to come along?

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,040
- Kites! - Fresh buns!

119
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,800
- Kites for sale! - Take a look!

120
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,720
Kites in every style!

121
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,480
Muyu,

122
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,100
you come all the way to Tianqi

123
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:24,730
and don't even stroll through here?

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:26,900
I...

125
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:28,580
I don't know the way.

126
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:30,980
Fair point.

127
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,730
A place like this,

128
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,170
you'll always get lost alone.

129
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:35,660
Before lust can bewitch you,

130
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,610
you're already lost here.

131
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,460
Uncle Zhe...

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,220
how come you started drinking?

133
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,980
Because it makes me look dashing.

134
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:48,810
How come so fluent

135
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,850
in standard speech now?

136
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,540
Why do you care?

137
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:53,850
Then Uncle Zhe,

138
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,250
where are we going

139
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,460
next from here?

140
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,250
At Pleasure House flowers bloom,

141
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,780
when they bloom beauties arrive.

142
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,050
Of course, we're going to Pleasure House.

143
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:17,620
[Pleasure House]

144
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,170
Uncle Zhe,

145
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,220
you really set me up.

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,540
You didn't tell me

147
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,960
it's this kind of place!

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,050
Sir!

149
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,400
A cup from a beauty

150
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,820
is surely the finest wine.

151
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,530
Sir...

152
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
[Pleasure House]

153
00:08:59,080 --> 00:08:59,530
Uncle Zhe,

154
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,120
what now?

155
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,190
What do we do?

156
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,420
What do you want to do?

157
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,610
I want to leave.

158
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:13,370
Is this your first time here, Sir?

159
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,610
Yes.

160
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,980
For a gentleman like you

161
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:19,010
to grace my place,

162
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,770
you shall have whatever you desire.

163
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,730
Today,

164
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,220
do whatever you please here,

165
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,250
and you won't have to pay

166
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,370
a single tael.

167
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,370
What would you like to do?

168
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:33,890
I already said it.

169
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,340
I want to leave.

170
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,010
You want to leave?

171
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:41,460
But...

172
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,060
the uncle beside you

173
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,250
seems keen to stay.

174
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:47,730
Muyu,

175
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,220
we're already here,

176
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,300
so enjoy yourself.

177
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,650
How about going in to hear a tune?

178
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,580
I don't mind

179
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,610
you sipping the priciest wine

180
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,200
or choosing the prettiest girl.

181
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,370
I only worry when you ask for music.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,790
The last one who came for a tune

183
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:08,440
was Xueyue City's Third City Lord,

184
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,600
Sikong Changfeng.

185
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,570
He walked off

186
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,060
with my top-earning girl.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,530
You're teasing me.

188
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,340
But Sir,

189
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,980
today,

190
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,580
it hasn't even rained outside.

191
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,010
So why bring an umbrella?

192
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,650
I'm guessing

193
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,130
it's your weapon.

194
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,300
To enjoy music here,

195
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,610
no weapons inside.

196
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,180
Let me hold it for you.

197
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,430
Second Master, perfect timing.

198
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,750
Come give me a hand

199
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,690
with our new friend.

200
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,580
Sure!

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,420
This way, please!

202
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:53,890
Go on.

203
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,100
After you, please.

204
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:07,540
[Pleasure House]

205
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,210
Here.

206
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:13,940
Have a seat.

207
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,070
[Wan'er of Pleasure House]

208
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:27,240
Mr. Jiang, you're right...

209
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,250
I'm Tu Wan of Thousand-Gold Tower.

210
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,690
[Tu Wan of Thousand-Gold Tower]
May I ask your name?

211
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,100
Su Muyu.

212
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:36,980
Muyu...

213
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,300
Good name!

214
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,340
A fine name indeed!

215
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,250
Su Muyu, the Umbrella Ghost?

216
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,700
Today I'm just Su Muyu here,

217
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,310
not the "Umbrella Ghost".

218
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,670
Don't worry.

219
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,340
I'm just here to enjoy the music.

220
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,300
Ah, Mr. Su...

221
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,130
such tasteful leisure!

222
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:17,820
[Tianqi]

223
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,060
I wonder

224
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,730
what Su Muyu

225
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,340
is up to now.

226
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,570
Mr. Chang, another cup.

227
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,720
Come on!

228
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,630
Drink up!

229
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,590
This tune today is truly good!

230
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,100
Worth the trip...

231
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,940
Do you often visit for music?

232
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,180
I used to.

233
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,720
Back then Miss Feng, a true virtuoso,

234
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,580
held court here.

235
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,530
Since Miss Feng left,

236
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,980
I haven't come for a long time.

237
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,100
Now the one at the zither is Miss Wan'er.

238
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,190
They said

239
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,850
her playing isn't beneath Miss Feng's.

240
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:55,850
So I came to listen.

241
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,060
How does it feel?

242
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,770
In my heart

243
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:04,250
she still falls short of Miss Feng,

244
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,450
but indeed

245
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,150
she's already remarkable.

246
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,160
What do you think?

247
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,260
As for music,

248
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,010
I only appreciate it.

249
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,840
I have no standing

250
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
to judge others.

251
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:19,250
I...

252
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,820
Let's talk later,

253
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,490
or Miss Wan'er will be upset.

254
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,820
Seems this "top assassin"

255
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,490
isn't so terrifying.

256
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,020
He even feels quite friendly.

257
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,700
Maybe the rumors

258
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,850
exaggerate too much,

259
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:45,100
or only if he draws his blade

260
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,180
he turns into a demon.

261
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,580
Forget it.

262
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,420
Let me enjoy the music.

263
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,010
I'll slip out when there's a chance.

264
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,650
Where did you pick up

265
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,530
such a handsome young lad,

266
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,580
and so brave, too?

267
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,530
Look how he's hooked

268
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,530
the hearts of our girls.

269
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,490
He's a junior of mine.

270
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,180
I want to see

271
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,100
if he's a reliable man.

272
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:15,980
What,

273
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,850
does making merry in my house

274
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,570
mean he isn't reliable?

275
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,460
Why test a man on that?

276
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,780
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

277
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,660
I've found my daughter.

278
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:31,200
That's wonderful.

279
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,300
Isn't that what you've wished for

280
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,530
all these years?

281
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,100
It is.

282
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,490
But ever since

283
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,300
my girl met this boy,

284
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:44,370
I feel she's taken a liking to him.

285
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,110
As for the boy,

286
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,570
I watched him grow up.

287
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,560
He's solid in everything else,

288
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,570
but when it comes to love,

289
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,800
I don't know him at all.

290
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,460
Then has the kid

291
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:56,700
passed your test now?

292
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,180
At this house of temptation,

293
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:01,690
he only hears music.

294
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,540
Now I'm at ease.

295
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,020
But to me,

296
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,500
this kid

297
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:12,260
may be cold all his life.

298
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,570
Didn't you predict

299
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,140
I'd die halfway down this path?

300
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,420
Yet I'm safe now.

301
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:22,610
I've even had a daughter.

302
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,690
Our family

303
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,540
is changing in a big way.

304
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,660
This kid

305
00:15:29,990 --> 00:15:30,970
can surely change

306
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,090
that so-called fate.

307
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,610
In that case,

308
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:35,300
shouldn't we

309
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,570
celebrate properly?

310
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:37,930
Come on.

311
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,330
Here, a toast to you.

312
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:49,330
I've got girls here

313
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:50,380
who favor

314
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,450
heroes like you.

315
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,020
You're now a widower anyway,

316
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,810
your so-called "test"

317
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,930
hardly matters.

318
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,580
[Yi's Residence]

319
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:10,450
Sir,

320
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,690
The Three Officials are back.

321
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,330
Let them in.

322
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,330
Impressive, Sir.

323
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,090
You should've been

324
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,850
the hardest shadow to spot,

325
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,090
yet you hold the glorious public face

326
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:26,780
of the Imperial Father-in-Law.

327
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,660
What nonsense are you babbling?

328
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,380
Crow, stop.

329
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:33,690
I heard

330
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,580
your talks with Su Muyu

331
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,970
fell through.

332
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,140
But at Yellow Springs Pawnshop,

333
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,570
we ran into Su Changhe.

334
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,210
From our talk,

335
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,900
I got the sense

336
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,810
that compared to Su Muyu,

337
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,330
this Patriarch now in power

338
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:56,020
is the better

339
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,090
partner.

340
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,170
You're sure

341
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,610
you can negotiate with Su Changhe?

342
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,650
Yes.

343
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,610
He puts profit first,

344
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,260
which is why

345
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,470
he became Patriarch

346
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:16,170
in the end.

347
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,700
And the only person

348
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,810
who can make him set profit aside

349
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,090
and act on feeling

350
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:22,740
just happens

351
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:25,330
to have entered Tianqi early.

352
00:17:28,910 --> 00:17:30,780
If we seize Su Muyu first,

353
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:32,540
then our terms with Su Changhe

354
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,220
gain leverage.

355
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,330
By then,

356
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:37,460
emotionally

357
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,220
and in profit,

358
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,090
he will have to work with us.

359
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,610
Then,

360
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,410
we can throw

361
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,020
the full might of Blood River

362
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,850
to kill a prince

363
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,610
in Tianqi City.

364
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,170
Whether Blood River

365
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,300
survives after that

366
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,890
no longer matters.

367
00:17:58,390 --> 00:17:59,020
Good.

368
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,330
Then change the plan.

369
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,850
No more waiting for Su Muyu's reply.

370
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:04,980
Tonight,

371
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,060
throw him into the Shadow Prison!

372
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,370
As you command.

373
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,090
Sir,

374
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,260
Should we inform

375
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,020
the First Prince?

376
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,500
No need.

377
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,940
I've got a bad feeling:

378
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,780
the First Prince

379
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:35,460
has already grown

380
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,890
dismissive of us.

381
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,170
We must do something

382
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,130
to show him

383
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,410
our sect's strength.

384
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,700
Our sect may not be what it was,

385
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,220
but it still has the strength

386
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:51,090
to defend Tianqi City.

387
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,540
Catching Su Muyu

388
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,940
is the perfect chance.

389
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:24,410
Good!

390
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:28,540
- Good! - Good!

391
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,090
Here!

392
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,650
Much obliged, Sir!

393
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,610
Mr. Zhou, after you.

394
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,370
Here, take mine!

395
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,780
Oh, you brought no silver?

396
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,060
No worries. I've got it!

397
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:44,650
Thank you, Sir!

398
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:46,780
Buddy,

399
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:48,090
come with me in a bit.

400
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,370
Know the gambling house?

401
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,170
The biggest in Tianqi City!

402
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:52,090
My family runs it.

403
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:53,370
I'll help you win some money.

404
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,260
So you're the type

405
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,740
who calls everyone "buddy"

406
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,980
after a drink.

407
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,260
I've long heard

408
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,370
of your name.

409
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,780
They called you some "human fiend".

410
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,500
Didn't expect you

411
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,330
to be a dashing young man!

412
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,740
We just click, don't we?

413
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,810
How about we...

414
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,170
Who's there?

415
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,940
Who dares kill in Tianqi City?

416
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,740
Who's sneaking around,

417
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:29,650
shooting from the dark?

418
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,170
This has nothing to do with you.

419
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,260
Who are you,

420
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,410
playing at spooks?

421
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,540
Second Master, please step back.

422
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,170
He's here for me.

423
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,940
So he's your enemy?

424
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,020
Not exactly.

425
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,540
They once belonged to Blood River.

426
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,020
Then what ghosts are they?

427
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,310
They're not "ghosts".

428
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,540
They're the "deities" in temples.

429
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,500
Only we who bear swords

430
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,410
are called "ghosts",

431
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,090
the so-called

432
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:58,090
"human fiends".

433
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,780
I don't really get it.

434
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:03,700
Sounds scary, anyway.

435
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,020
Not really.

436
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,300
But Uncle Zhe took my sword.

437
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,020
That's a hassle.

438
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:17,330
Usually,

439
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,410
I don't use weapons,

440
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,500
just this dagger

441
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,060
for emergencies.

442
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:24,890
Good.

443
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,020
I often see Changhe

444
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,810
use the Inch Sword.

445
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,810
I didn't expect it'd come in handy today.

446
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:33,960
Mr. Su,

447
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:34,850
another friend of yours

448
00:21:34,870 --> 00:21:35,850
came with you, didn't he?

449
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:36,650
Yes.

450
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:38,570
Make it a livelier fight,

451
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,850
drag it out,

452
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:41,090
and stall for Uncle Zhe.

453
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,460
He won't.

454
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,020
Second Master, stand down.

455
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,170
This has nothing to do with you.

456
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:51,370
Zi,

457
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,810
you're generous.

458
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,700
To celebrate me finding my daughter,

459
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,460
you sent four ladies to serve me.

460
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,890
Trying to take this old life of mine?

461
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,410
Serve Mr. Su well,

462
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:03,260
got it?

463
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,330
Yes.

464
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:05,700
Then,

465
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:06,980
I'm off now.

466
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,370
Go on.

467
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:20,020
Mr. Su.

468
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,370
Ladies,

469
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,650
you may leave too.

470
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,740
I may be visiting the Entertainment Street,

471
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:28,330
but I'm not that kind of man.

472
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:30,410
I've got a daughter now.

473
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,540
Then let me

474
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,170
see you off

475
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:35,850
to supreme bliss.

476
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,020
I said

477
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,890
I'm not that kind of man.

478
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,980
I'm past the age

479
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,460
of falling for honey traps.

480
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,060
Careful!

481
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,170
That's an Immortal Brush.

482
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,130
Every word on the floor

483
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:12,940
[Characters]
is a strand of qi.

484
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,220
The qi will be guided by the brush later.

485
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,540
He's probing for your weak point!

486
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,500
Too chatty.

487
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:25,260
Second Master,

488
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:26,220
leave at once.

489
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,130
Mr. Su,

490
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,570
I'll repay this life-saving debt.

491
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:29,980
Watch yourself.

492
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:33,650
Rise.

493
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,700
[Loyal Unto Death]

494
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,700
[Death]

495
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,380
[Loyal]

496
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,500
[Death]

497
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,420
[Sacrifice]

498
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,460
[Honored in Life, Mourned in Death]

499
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,170
The Immortal Brush

500
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:04,570
writes nothing but death.

501
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,610
Because today is the day you die.

502
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,130
Even immortals can't save you!

503
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:17,170
Watch out!

504
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,540
This is bad.

505
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,610
How can they really go for the kill?

506
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,460
[Death]

507
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:03,860
[Swift Rain]

508
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,180
[Sword in left hand]

509
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,460
[Bow stance, right-finger sword]

510
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,700
Watch out!

511
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:26,130
Su Muyu!

512
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:27,410
What are you doing?

513
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,340
[Death]

514
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,500
[Death]

515
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:38,500
You're catching the Immortal Brush barehanded?

516
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,650
Do you have a death wish?

517
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:58,740
Truly the famed heir

518
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,890
of No-Sword City,

519
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,780
you even master the finger-sword.

520
00:26:02,190 --> 00:26:03,500
But this sword art

521
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,260
hurts both foe and self.

522
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,330
If you let it lapse,

523
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,610
one finger-blade ruins one finger.

524
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,610
I have nine fingers left.

525
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,610
That's nine arcs of sword energy.

526
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,540
Three arcs to kill one man

527
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,540
is plenty.

528
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,330
Su Muyu,

529
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,940
after tasting mortal life,

530
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,650
you really changed.

531
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,410
You even dared visit the Entertainment Street!

532
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,650
Your father brought me here!

533
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:56,980
I can vouch.

534
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,740
Mr. Su truly just came to hear music.

535
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:01,310
So...

536
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,280
he might actually be innocent?

537
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,220
Naturally.

538
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:11,220
Coming here just to hear songs,

539
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,330
like me going

540
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,260
to Tianqi's Diaolou Cottage

541
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:15,650
and ordering a cup of tea.

542
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,260
Know what that's called?

543
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,500
What?

544
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:21,060
"Having it both ways".

545
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,650
"Acting on the spot".

546
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,330
Second Master,

547
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,540
help me look after Miss Bai.

548
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,330
All right.

549
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,300
You still have time to butt in mid-fight?

550
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,610
Worry about yourself first.

551
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:34,610
Take this!

552
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,090
Put it

553
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:37,090
on your injured finger.

554
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,460
Thanks!

555
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,700
Miss Bai?

556
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:55,650
Bai Hehuai,

557
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,220
Medicine King Xin Baicao's senior.

558
00:27:58,590 --> 00:27:59,300
An honor.

559
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,700
Honor what?

560
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:01,910
I've never even shown up

561
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:02,970
in the jianghu.

562
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,130
Quit the nonsense!

563
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,390
So I don't buy

564
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:05,940
what you just said either!

565
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,150
No, I...

566
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:09,460
Miss,

567
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:10,300
you've got me

568
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,500
at a loss for words.

569
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,500
You don't seem

570
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,220
too worried about Mr. Su.

571
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:24,460
Of course.

572
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:25,740
The moment

573
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,300
Su Muyu has a sword in hand,

574
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,890
the outcome is set.

575
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,060
Aren't you coming down to help?

576
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:35,610
Coming.

577
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:55,300
What...

578
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,700
what now?

579
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,410
It's the Lone Void Array.

580
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,330
Reinforcements.

581
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,130
Who is it?

582
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,130
The Blood River Patriarch,

583
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,740
the Mu family head,

584
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,480
and...

585
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,930
Well...

586
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,120
I'll be off now.

587
00:29:11,390 --> 00:29:12,130
What's the rush?

588
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,020
Watch till the end.

589
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:18,940
Miss Bai,

590
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,610
see you later!

591
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,650
Until we meet again!

592
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,090
Su Muyu!

593
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:35,410
Master Su,

594
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,060
never thought you'd be subdued

595
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,370
by my Drunken Dream Bone,

596
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,060
did you?

597
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,260
Stop!

598
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:46,170
Su Changhe,

599
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,170
why were you blocking me?

600
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,020
Why not save Su Muyu?

601
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,570
Su Changhe,

602
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:52,310
if you want to save Su Muyu,

603
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:55,130
follow the Shadow Sect's plan.

604
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,580
[Yi's Residence]

605
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,500
He's poisoned?

606
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,810
He's been dosed with Drunken Dream Bone.

607
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,300
Even if he's an immortal,

608
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,500
he can't use a shred of martial skill.

609
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,460
His qi is mild and slack,

610
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:37,460
as if falling into a drunken dream

611
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:39,810
that never ends.

612
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,540
Indeed poisoned with what you said.

613
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:47,700
You two did well.

614
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:49,890
Guards,

615
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,650
throw Su Muyu into the Shadow Prison.

616
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,540
Yes.

617
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,500
However,

618
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,810
why are there only two of you?

619
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,570
Where's Earth Official?

620
00:31:13,590 --> 00:31:14,370
He's dead.

621
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:16,500
After all, taking Su Muyu alive

622
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,740
is no easy task.

623
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:21,300
A pity.

624
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:26,410
Heaven Official,

625
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,700
why so quiet?

626
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,890
A brother died,

627
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,330
and to you, it's only "a pity".

628
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,700
But to me,

629
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,940
it's far more

630
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,130
than just that word.

631
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:40,940
I have nothing more to say.

632
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,090
Why press me?

633
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:46,740
I see.

634
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,220
Sorry.

635
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:50,500
I overstepped.

636
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,020
By the way, Mr. Yi,

637
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,260
there's more good news

638
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,300
to tell you.

639
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,610
What news?

640
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,460
Su Changhe, Blood River's Patriarch,

641
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,330
by now...

642
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,260
he has entered Tianqi City.

643
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:16,780
Your Highness,

644
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,850
there was a clash at the Entertainment Street.

645
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,060
It was between the Shadow Sect's Three Officials

646
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,740
and Su Muyu.

647
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,980
Then Blood River's Patriarch,

648
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,890
Su Changhe, arrived,

649
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:24,940
but too late.

650
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,850
The Earth Official was slain by Su Muyu.

651
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:28,980
Su Muyu was hit with Drunken Dream Bone

652
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,260
and taken by the Shadow Sect.

653
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:38,330
Those Shadow Sect losers

654
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,060
actually managed a win.

655
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,500
We work with the Shadow Sect

656
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,850
only to use them

657
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,740
as Blood River's whetstone.

658
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,460
We'll wipe them out after,

659
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,370
and gain Blood River,

660
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:53,260
a sharper blade.

661
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,940
Pity that the Three Officials are strong,

662
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,810
no weaker than the family heads of the Blood River.

663
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,370
And earlier, their stance

664
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,570
seemed reluctant to clash

665
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,260
with Blood River head-on.

666
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:09,370
Why the sudden change?

667
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:16,890
How come the Shadow Prison

668
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,500
is so empty?

669
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,130
The Shadow Sect

670
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,940
once guarded Tianqi as its shadow.

671
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,890
But when the light blazes brightest,

672
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,060
and even the night

673
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,980
is lit,

674
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,060
there's no need for shadows.

675
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,500
Now the Prince of Langya

676
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:34,890
holds the power

677
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,220
to guard Tianqi and all of Beili.

678
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,060
So the Shadow Sect

679
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,810
has little reason

680
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,610
to keep prisoners.

681
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,500
Some were even taken away

682
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,610
soon after they arrived

683
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:46,020
by the Prince of Langya.

684
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:47,570
No wonder

685
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:49,130
Yi Bu is so bent on killing the Prince of Langya.

686
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,260
You can still talk after being poisoned?

687
00:33:57,830 --> 00:33:58,300
This toxin

688
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,460
is no ordinary one.

689
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,570
These past hours,

690
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:03,940
I've tried to rouse my qi

691
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:06,170
and break the shackle inside.

692
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,460
But till now,

693
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,770
I can barely speak.

694
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,060
Figures.

695
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,290
This is my proudest creation.

696
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,250
Among the Three Officials,

697
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,250
you're the most unusual.

698
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,690
Besides Water Official,

699
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,570
what else are you?

700
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,210
My name is Su Henshui.

701
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,020
I want to live for myself,

702
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,860
not sit like a statue

703
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,570
in a temple,

704
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:41,380
nor be a blade in another's hand.

705
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,130
I see.

706
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:49,130
Who?

707
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,290
Worthy indeed

708
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:57,420
of Blood River's Patriarch,

709
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,060
you sensed my presence.

710
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,290
Who are you?

711
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:00,820
I'm Crow

712
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:02,170
from Shadow Sect.

713
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:05,900
I heard you've arrived this city,

714
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,290
so I came to pay respects.

715
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,340
Where is Su Muyu?

716
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,500
He asked me to wait here.

717
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,210
Why isn't he here?

718
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,210
You want to see Su Muyu?

719
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:15,940
Of course.

720
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,540
He's the Su family head,

721
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,380
my best friend

722
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,690
for life.

723
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:21,940
Even if I lose

724
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,060
the Patriarch's seat,

725
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:23,820
I won't allow him

726
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,090
the slightest harm.

727
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,170
If any of you touch him,

728
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,250
and I'll fight you to the end.

729
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,170
No need to be so tense, Sir.

730
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,900
Su Muyu is currently

731
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,500
a guest at our sect.

732
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,210
He's fine.

733
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,570
Only...

734
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,210
Only what?

735
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,250
Such killing intent...

736
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,170
Speak!

737
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,500
Only what?

738
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,770
Only that a guest can become

739
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:57,290
the host or a prisoner.

740
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,570
All depends

741
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,570
on your sincerity.

742
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:08,420
My "sincerity"?

743
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,610
Testing my sincerity

744
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,420
shows none of yours.

745
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,610
And it's dangerous.

746
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,860
Danger is all

747
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:23,610
we ever deal in,

748
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,940
isn't it?

749
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,210
Well said.

750
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,340
I'm almost impressed.

751
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:33,570
Speak...

752
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,130
what do you want from us?

753
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,650
We want you

754
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,340
to take the head of the Prince of Langya.

755
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,460
What?

756
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,650
Do you even know what you're saying?

757
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,820
Blood River kills anyone,

758
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,210
doesn't it?

759
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,200
I'll put

760
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,560
the hardest man to kill

761
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,540
before you.

762
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,340
No need to

763
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,020
rush your answer.

764
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:57,580
Think it over and...

765
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,420
And?

766
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,020
If you turn your head,

767
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,730
will it

768
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:05,650
fall off?

769
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:12,820
♪Like fate, winding with the tide♪

770
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:16,740
♪Who can ford this river of night?♪
