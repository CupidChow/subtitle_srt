[Episode 33]

5
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:40,690
Changhe,

6
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,490
why must we work with them?

7
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,050
If we had stepped in

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,050
in time last night,

9
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,540
Muyu might not

10
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,690
have been hurt that badly.

11
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,050
You're questioning me?

12
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,290
Your decision

13
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,210
must have your reasons.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,820
Go tell Dian Ye

15
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,780
my cooperation with them

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,940
is limited to helping them

17
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,100
take on the Prince of Langya.

18
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:20,690
When I leave seclusion,

19
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,780
everything will be decided.

20
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,850
Tell them they'd better...

21
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,380
not act rashly.

22
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:30,010
Understood.

23
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,220
Go.

24
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,100
Something big happened.

25
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,380
Your Highness, Deputy General He seeks audience.

26
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,410
Your Highness, urgent report!

27
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,540
Speak.

28
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,660
From your look,

29
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,890
it's definitely not the kind

30
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,170
of news you want heard.

31
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,370
When General Lei struck Nanxu City,

32
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,130
he was ambushed.

33
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,130
Then he led a small squad to break out,

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,940
and is now fleeing to Mount Luolei.

35
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,660
We do have some troops there,

36
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,690
but if Nanjue is set on sealing the mountain,

37
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,290
I'm afraid...

38
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,100
No reinforcements?

39
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,100
All tied down by Nanjue's main force.

40
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,060
They've gone all out,

41
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,170
willing to pay any price,

42
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,730
just to take down our commander.

43
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,050
Mount Luolei...

44
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,020
Your Highness.

45
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,220
Go.

46
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,460
Bring him back.

47
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,290
Undercurrents run deep in Tianqi City,

48
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,020
how can I leave now?

49
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,190
I'll be fine.

50
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,700
In Tianqi City,

51
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,410
no one can threaten me.

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,340
I just hate

53
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,050
that this time I can't...

54
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:50,980
Your Highness!

55
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,540
Where is Ji Ruofeng?

56
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,850
Why isn't he back yet?

57
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,820
He took Chuhe

58
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,660
to the Miao Territory to find Dragonfire Herb

59
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,850
and Cinnabar Spiders.

60
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,370
He found clues in ancient texts.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,140
Taken together,

62
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:10,610
they can suppress the frost poison in me.

63
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,220
I keep feeling

64
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,460
someone's deliberately moving your people away.

65
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,660
Xinyue,

66
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,250
right now,

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,900
every extra word you say

68
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,250
could well become

69
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,340
a lifelong regret.

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,050
But, Your Highness...

71
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,930
In this world,

72
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,340
everyone

73
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,490
has something

74
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,020
we absolutely cannot lose.

75
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:37,980
I have it.

76
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,100
You do too.

77
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,220
When the worst

78
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,220
inevitably comes,

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,410
then...

80
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:47,290
cast everything aside.

81
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,660
I'm sorry,

82
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:57,980
Your Highness.

83
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:32,900
Your Highness.

84
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,170
Something major happened

85
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,100
in Tianqi City last night.

86
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,220
Su Muyu fought Nanjue's Blade Ghost,

87
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,170
Xu Liuyun.

88
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,700
Xu Liuyun was killed.

89
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,580
As for Su Muyu's side,

90
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,170
that young physician Bai Hehuai

91
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,460
from Medicine King Valley

92
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,900
seems to have met with misfortune.

93
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:50,700
After that, Su Muyu stormed

94
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,780
the Flying Tiger General's residence,

95
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:54,050
even drawing in the Jinwu Guards.

96
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,810
Now He-Yu Clinic

97
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,250
stands emptied out.

98
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,100
As for the exact cause,

99
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,490
I don't yet know.

100
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,290
You'll know soon.

101
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,730
Mu Qingyang of the Mu family

102
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:11,930
pays respects to Your Highness

103
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,610
and Xuanwu Guardian.

104
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,540
Have a seat.

105
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:21,660
Looks like

106
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,290
Your Highness was not surprised

107
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,410
by my arrival.

108
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,780
About last night,

109
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,140
Lianyue told me.

110
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,730
The miracle physician...

111
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,020
She's alive.

112
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,410
That's good.

113
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,580
Not entirely.

114
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,020
Right now,

115
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:39,340
our Patriarch of Blood River

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,250
is in seclusion.

117
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,980
One family head is badly hurt.

118
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,290
Another

119
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,540
is far away in Blood River.

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,580
And the last

121
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,700
isn't much of a fighter,

122
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:49,980
and that's me.

123
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,610
But now,

124
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,780
something outrageous has happened.

125
00:07:55,190 --> 00:07:55,900
So I think

126
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,580
we need the Guardians' help.

127
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,340
There aren't several.

128
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,460
Only this one left.

129
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,540
What is it?

130
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:07,660
What rotten luck!

131
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,290
Why are you the one left?

132
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,540
Muyu,

133
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:24,810
you're awake.

134
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,130
Why am I here?

135
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,460
He-Yu Clinic

136
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,370
is no longer safe.

137
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,130
It'll be under watch from now on.

138
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,940
So for now, we're hiding

139
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,850
at Ms. Wan'er's place.

140
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:48,130
Mr. Tu brought us here.

141
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,580
It's Ms. Wan'er

142
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,770
of Pleasure House?

143
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,250
That's her.

144
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,430
Mr. Tu also said

145
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,460
Ms. Wan'er's place

146
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,530
is the quietest in Tianqi City,

147
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,530
so no one should disturb us.

148
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,820
Good.

149
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,340
How's the miracle physician?

150
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,180
Zhaoyan says

151
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,370
she's out of danger,

152
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,530
but needs time

153
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,530
to wake up.

154
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,130
Xuewei,

155
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:20,940
please escort her

156
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,700
out of Tianqi City

157
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:23,700
to Nan'an.

158
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,130
No.

159
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,650
No one can protect her in Nan'an now.

160
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,820
Send her to Blood River.

161
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:31,820
Uncle Zhe and Uncle Qidao are there.

162
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,010
She's too weak now.

163
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:39,650
If she leaves Tianqi for Blood River,

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,170
the road is too long,

165
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:42,220
she won't hold out.

166
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,010
Muyu,

167
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,250
don't worry.

168
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:47,530
Yumo has sent word to Blood River.

169
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,100
Uncle Zhe and Uncle Qidao

170
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,700
will dispatch reinforcements to Tianqi.

171
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,580
Then we're getting some serious reinforcements.

172
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,360
[Good harvest this year. Next year, plant widely.]

173
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,890
Back in the old Blood River,

174
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,220
our intel

175
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,180
always told us

176
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,980
who would appear where.

177
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,250
On which year, month, and day,

178
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,770
some even picky enough

179
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,920
to name the exact hour,

180
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,820
to kill the target.

181
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,250
Now the info I get

182
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,420
is all about

183
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,700
this year's yields

184
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,730
and next year's planting plans.

185
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,220
When did Blood River's broadswords

186
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,700
turn into sickles for cutting wheat?

187
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:31,130
Now our disciples have nothing to do,

188
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,820
no place to spend their strength.

189
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,390
So Master Su

190
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,820
gave us these tasks.

191
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:38,220
When they return

192
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,490
from Tianqi City,

193
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:40,890
we'll even be tested.

194
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,250
Tested how?

195
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:46,700
Anyone who fails

196
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:48,490
is expelled from the Three Families.

197
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,130
That's the toughest thing

198
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,010
Su Muyu has said

199
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,610
since becoming family head.

200
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,580
Uncle Qidao, you know,

201
00:10:55,910 --> 00:10:57,130
Master Su

202
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,180
is kind by nature.

203
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,100
But when he gives his word,

204
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,180
it's set in stone.

205
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,980
Our Xie family's the strongest,

206
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,340
so jobs like these

207
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,490
are easy for us.

208
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,770
The Su family... can manage too.

209
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:12,650
The Mu family has it rough.

210
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,770
They like things spotless and aren't strong.

211
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,980
- I'm afraid... - Enough.

212
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,060
Stand down.

213
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:18,650
Yes, sir.

214
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,490
Nice.

215
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,370
Su Muyu

216
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,490
has learned to tease people.

217
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,820
I think

218
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:34,100
he isn't teasing.

219
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,420
He's serious.

220
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,610
By the way,

221
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,940
they had you stay

222
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,610
to help me with Blood River affairs,

223
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:42,820
but why didn't you...

224
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,460
I can't farm.

225
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,100
Why didn't you

226
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,010
go to Tianqi with them?

227
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,820
I'm just an old man.

228
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,820
They're all young.

229
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,530
Sometimes,

230
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,940
having us elders around

231
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,420
just gets in the way,

232
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,130
you know.

233
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,420
I don't.

234
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,010
Then why didn't you go?

235
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,010
I...

236
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,580
Blood River is huge.

237
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,490
Someone has to sit in command.

238
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:13,700
Without a hand on them,

239
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:15,730
they'll run wild.

240
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,010
Big news!

241
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,940
Master, big news!

242
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,770
What is it?

243
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,340
Wild boars raided the cabbages?

244
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:24,890
No.

245
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,010
Something happened in Tianqi.

246
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,440
[He-Yu Clinic was attacked. Miracle Physician Bai was critically injured.]

247
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:43,940
[Master Su stormed and nearly destroyed]

248
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,540
[the Flying Tiger General's Residence.]

249
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,180
Su Zhe, what are you doing?

250
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,940
Flatten Tianqi!

251
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,980
So it's you.

252
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,820
You're...

253
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,250
Mu Xuewei, Poisonous Blossom of the Mu family.

254
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,530
Yumo's good friend.

255
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,850
Too bad the poison in me

256
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:17,770
has been purged.

257
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,460
Otherwise, one palm from me

258
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,340
and you'd be dead.

259
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,340
Well,

260
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,850
he's a genius of the Tang Clan.

261
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,370
Your poisons are fierce.

262
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:29,730
But to kill him,

263
00:13:29,870 --> 00:13:30,980
that's nowhere near enough.

264
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:34,610
Let's go.

265
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:36,850
Where to?

266
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,530
I'd planned

267
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,890
to wait until the miracle physician woke

268
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,890
and ask her more.

269
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,650
But who knows when she'll wake.

270
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:43,890
So now,

271
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,890
we can only investigate

272
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:45,850
that rotten commander's son.

273
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,650
I really hate Tianqi City.

274
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:48,580
Let's move.

275
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,250
To your Mount Wangcheng?

276
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,700
So, are you...

277
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,420
coming with us?

278
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,460
They don't take women there.

279
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,820
Xuanwu Guardian,

280
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,730
let's split up then.

281
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,940
Where's Su Muyu and the rest?

282
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:13,610
He's hurt,

283
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,250
so of course he's inside.

284
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,180
Miss Yumo.

285
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:27,850
What should I call you?

286
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,710
Mr. Lianyue?

287
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,180
Sounds like quite the perfect match.

288
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,490
Now's not the time...

289
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,940
Now's not the time for this,

290
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:41,650
huh?

291
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,220
Then when is it?

292

00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:01,650
In your heart,

298
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:03,580
am I there?

299
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,730
Since we parted at the Tang Clan,

300
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,250
I often think of you.

301
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,650
Good.

302
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,700
Then why never come find me?

303
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,820
I've been tracking my senior's trail.

304
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:22,490
Let me ask you again:

305
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,730
If your senior

306
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:25,700
is safely rescued,

307
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,100
will you come to Blood River to marry me?

308
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,200
I'm a Tang Clan disciple

309
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:43,850
and Tianqi City's Xuanwu Guardian.

310
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:47,220
If I go to Blood River to propose,

311
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,730
the grand master won't agree.

312
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,250
And His Highness would likely...

313
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm asking

314
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:54,940
if I'm in your heart.

315
00:15:57,910 --> 00:15:59,010
Did I ask about the Tang Clan?

316
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,370
Or the Prince of Langya's Manor?

317
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:11,820
Enough.

00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:13,180

- I didn't mean... - It's fine.

321
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,130
I'm happy.

322
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,460
At least...

323
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,890
now I know I'm in your heart.

324
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,940

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,420
is not much good at martial arts.

376
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:39,860
He's past twenty

377
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,770
and still hasn't made deputy general.

378
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,580

a deputy commander

380
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,570

promoted.

the Golden Throne Contest begins.

386
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,900
If he can rack up three straight wins,

387
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,660
he will be appointed deputy general.

388
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,700
Can every Jinwu Guard join

389
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,530
the Golden Throne Contest?

390
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,050
Of course not.

391
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,770
To enter the contest,

392
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,330
you must first clear

393
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,290
the Jinwu Guards' prelims.

394
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,620
Only forty-eight make the cut.

395
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,250
General Li Xian's son

396
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,330
couldn't even pass

397
00:19:15,350 --> 00:19:16,250
the prelims at first.

398
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,730
But ten days ago,

399
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,900
he stunned everyone in the prelims,

400
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,250
earning a direct slot for the contest.

401
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,860
Soon after,

402
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,140
news spread he fell ill.

403
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:28,900
So, in that window,

404
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,250
he used some method

405
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:32,570
to boost his power,

406
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:34,460
most likely...

407
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,250
the drugged puppet art.

408
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,870
It can indeed boost one's power

409
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,010
for a short time.

410
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,770
But the general's boy likely didn't know

411
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,700
about the backlash.

412
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,700
He was probably set up.

413
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,460
So I traced his movements.

414
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,250
I found that a month ago,

415
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,810
he kept visiting Doom Abyss in the Ghost Market.

416
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,420
The Ghost Market

417
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,940
is actually just Tianqi's

418
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:59,050
best-known black market,

419
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,660
a mixed crowd,

420
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,770
a gray zone at best.

421
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,380
Without connections, you can't get in.

422
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,730
Even its hours

423
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:07,860
are hard to catch.

424
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,460
However,

425
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,220
as far as I know,

426
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,180
it opens once today.

427
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,180
Good.

428
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,570
Notify Xuewei now.

429
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,070
Bravo!

430
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,050
Since entering Tianqi,

431
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:42,420
I've wanted to see the Ghost Market.

432
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,250
They say it's a place of monsters and ghosts.

433
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:47,010
I wonder how it compares to Blood River.

434
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,900
Didn't expect this wish

435
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,660
would come true today.

436
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,700
What a coincidence.

437
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:53,420
All I've ever wanted

438
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,700
was to take you here.

439
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,570
Then why not sooner?

440
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,220
Now we need someone else to bring us in.

441
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:01,570
After all, we're strangers

442
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,490
in Tianqi.

443
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,050
We need the right connections.

444
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:06,090
Am I right,

445
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,010
Xuanwu Guardian?

446
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,140
Yumo,

447
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,140
I'll go with you!

448
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,530
Hey, that's not how we're grouped!

449
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,420
Looks like, same as me,

450
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,250
you're not very welcome.

451
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,770
Who's like you?

452
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,250
Everyone,

453
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:39,170
long time no see.

454
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:45,980
Try some snacks.

455
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:57,220
One for me.

456
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,290
Me too.

457
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,270
- Thanks. - Much obliged.

458
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,160
That's it!

459
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,620
Not bad!

460
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,220
Recently,

461
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,140
Li Zhengqi passed the Golden Throne prelims,

462
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:21,490
then soon fell ill.

463
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,460
A friend of mine

464
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,700
works at their manor.

465
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,090
He says he's gone mad.

466
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,090
Are these pills really safe to take?

467
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,170
Of course.

468
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,460
Take one after every two meals,

469
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,250
ten pills in a row.

470
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:39,100
In fifteen days,

471
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,480
your body will be

472
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,500
as good as reborn.

473
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:45,140
Forget the Golden Throne Contest,

474
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,090
you might even win first place

475
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,940
in next year's martial exam.

476
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,140
That magical?

477
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,460
Then why did he end up like that?

478
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,770
Because...

479
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,330
he rushed it.

480
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,620
He feared he'd fail the prelims

481
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,660
and downed all three pills I gave him

482
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,090
on the eve of the bout.

483
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,940
Even so, today,

484
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,730
I'll give each of you five pills.

485
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:19,900
I hope you all

486
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,220
won't do anything that stupid.

487
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,710
- Of course not. - Never.

488
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,470
This time it's in the bag.

489
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,060
Yeah.

490
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,730
With this, the martial exam's nothing.

491
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,710
- Yeah. - Yeah.

492
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,130
Great.

493
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,860
How did Sikong Changfeng rope you in?

494
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,010
Since you're here,

495
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:54,700
why not a rematch?

496
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,250
A true lady stays silent

497
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,290
when others are reading.

498
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,490
He says there's a tough endgame

499
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,660
and asked me to take a look.

500
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,220
A fine game indeed.

501
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:08,330
So I seek answers in the books.

502
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:09,900
Nonsense.

503
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,280
[Your father's in peril on Mount Luolei. I'm heading there.]

504
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:23,940
[Tianqi City is in turmoil.]

505
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,140
[If a Sword Deity lends aid, I'll rest easy. Please help.]

506
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:28,570
What is it?

507
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,010
I thought at your Xueyue City,

508
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:32,770
atop Mount Cang,

509
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,330
nothing worldly would trouble the heart.

510
00:24:35,830 --> 00:24:36,900
Seems as long as we live,

511
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,380
wherever we flee,

512
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,420
we can't escape being disturbed.

513
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,530
My mother left Tianqi

514
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,730
to aid my father.

515
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:48,330
The Prince of Langya

516
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,030
is in poor health

517
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,900
and may have no guards at hand.

518
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,180
So you're heading to Tianqi?

519
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,420
I don't like that city,

520
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,010
but it seems I have to go.

521
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,780
My mother wrote

522
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,380
that with a Sword Deity's help,

523
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,850
she'd have no worries.

524
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,660
- So, will you... - Hold.

525
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:12,940
Say no more.

526
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,240
In literary terms,

527
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,660
your mother's letter is just flowery praise.

528
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,620
In the end,

529
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,490
it was meant to move you.

530
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,570
Let's make a bet.

531
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,660
If I win,

532
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,090
you'll go to Tianqi.

533
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,380
I'll lend you the Luoshui City Lord's collection

534
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,290
to read.

535
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,250
If I lose,

536
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:35,900
I'll go instead

537
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:37,660
and take up my mother's charge.

538
00:25:40,790 --> 00:25:41,220
Bet on what?

539
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,380
How about plucking leaves with sword energy?

540
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,770
Mount Cang has plenty of flowers.

541
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:50,380
Let's see,

542
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,810
within one stick of incense,

543
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,010
how many petals

544
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,330
we each can pluck.

545
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,940
Most wins.

546
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,900
So I'm alive after all.

547
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:13,810
Miracle physician,

548
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:14,860
you're awake!

549
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,180
Have a seat.

550
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,090
Your wounds are grave.

551
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,700
Don't move around.

552
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,180
Look at you...

553
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,140
Are you the miracle physician or am I?

554
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,330
Master!

555
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,140
How can you be out of bed?

556
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,090
Take care of yourself!

557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,180
Are you the master or am I?

558
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:52,730
You're all talking

559
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,290
awfully bold today.

560
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,570
Master,

561
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:56,860
you're almost dead

562
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,940
and still bragging.

563
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,460
Please drink your medicine.

564
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,250
Did you treat

565
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,490
my wounds,

566
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,140
Zhaoyan?

567
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,250
Just now,

568
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,490
I felt the wound.

569
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,770
The bandaging

570
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:12,330
could use some improvement.

571
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,530
I am lacking.

572
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,220
Don't say that.

573
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,730
When I was hit,

574
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:22,460
I thought I was done for.

575
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,490
In Tianqi City,

576
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:26,980
finding a physician to fix this

577
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,050
isn't easy.

578
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,490
You're impressive!

579
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,330
You...

580
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:54,860
Give me your hand.

581
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,330
Master,

582
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,870
to draw those experts away

583
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,900
and safeguard us,

584
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,570
Muyu stormed the grand general's manor

585
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,180
and suffered severe internal injuries.

586
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,980
Lately,

587
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,810
he's been recovering.

588
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,490
I prescribed some medicine,

589
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,220
but I'm not sure if it's right.

590
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,220
Master, will you take a look?

591
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,220
It's not about internal injuries.

592
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:35,730
I trust your work.

593
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,180
Treating internal wounds

594
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,940
was the first thing I taught you.

595
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,090
If even that goes wrong,

596
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,330
you'd be expelled from Medicine King Valley.

597
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,140
All right,

598
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:48,570
I should rest.

599
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,810
You may go out.

600
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,180
Master,

601
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
we're staying at Ms. Wan'er's place now.

602
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,140
Thing is,

603
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,380
there aren't many rooms.

604
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,050
All patients have to stay here.

605
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,900
Muyu needs rest too.

606
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,530
So he...

607
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,730
has to sleep here as well.

608
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,860
Where... will he sleep?

609
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,090
He'll sleep...

610
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,810
in the next room.

611
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,250
You may step out now.

612
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,490
Su Muyu,

613
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:57,980
are you...

614
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,050
hiding something from me?

615
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:04,140
You're no longer

616
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,090
Blood River's Kui,

617
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,180
nor a wandering ghost

618
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,090
of No-Sword City.

619
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,770
Whatever it is,

620
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,380
you can

621
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,090
and should tell me.

622
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,140
When I took your pulse,

623
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,530
I found

624
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:19,900
you could go into deviation at any time.

625
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,250
Do you realize that?

626
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,770
As expected, I can't hide it from you.

627
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,860
Was it to save me

628
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,570
that you did this?

629
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,050
I promised

630
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,900
to keep you safe.

631
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,570
That promise

632
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:37,570
was back in Jiuxiao City.

633
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,290
Is that so?

634
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:43,810
I thought that promise

635
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,980
still stood.

636
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,770
You're in real danger now.

637
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,420
In Wushuang City,

638
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:51,570
we all saw

639
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,530
Jian Wudi's state.

640
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,050
Once in deviation,

641
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,380
power may surge,

642
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,180
but it burns one's life away.

643
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,530
Don't worry.

644
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:00,860
I know my limits.

645
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,530
I won't let myself

646
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,700
reach that point.

647
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,660
However,

648
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,090
about my condition,

649
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,700
please don't tell Yumo and the others.

650
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,180
Things are perilous enough,

651
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,420
no need to worry them.

652
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:16,770
All right.

653
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,770
But Su Muyu,

654
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,980
remember this...

655
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,460
no bravado.

656
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,380
Of course no.

657
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,700
The Mu family's messenger butterfly

658
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:52,330
is exquisitely made.

659
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,200
[Qingyang, Xuewei, Yumo, and the Xuanwu Guardian]

660
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,300
[are investigating the Ghost Market. Note from Su Muyu]

661
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:02,770
Looks like

662
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,490
I judged him right.

663
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,220
This head of Blood River's Su family

664
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,180
is worthy of trust.

665
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:10,860
Then,

666
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:12,660
it's time

667
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:14,730
to see them again.

668
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:17,330
All right.

669
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,010
Let's go.

670
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:18,730
- Let's go. - Let's go.

671
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,490
Keep the pills safe.

672
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,490
- My pills! - My pills!

673
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:30,860
Who's there?

674
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,250
Xuanwu Guardian Tang Lianyue!

675
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,380
- Move! - Move!

676
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,380
No one runs!

677
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,050
I hear in Tianqi City,

678
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,090
when the Four Guardians handle a case,

679
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:50,220
even the grand chancellor must cooperate.

680
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:52,010
Gentlemen, didn't you hear him?

681
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:53,860
No one leaves.

682
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,140
Get them! Go!

683
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,420
- Go! - Go!

684
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,250
Don't kill them.

685
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,290
That's a bit hard.

686
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:03,270
Move!

687
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,770
Quit staring! Move!

688
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,090
Hurry!

689
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:08,870
Leave it!

690
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:09,570
This way!

691
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,180
Quick!

692
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,780
What are you waiting for?

693
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,530
Are you just watching?

694
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:26,010
Winds howl, the longbow sings.

695
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:27,860
A general rides the killing field.

696
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,490
Facing you

697
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,260
on the battlefield,

698
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,170
I'd fear you some.

699
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,020
But within this space,

700
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,900
let's see if my Tang Clan's hidden weapons

701
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:38,940
are faster than your arrows!

702
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:41,690
Watch out!

703
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,050
Senior!

704
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,570
What "senior"?

705
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,420
He's here to take your life!

706
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:04,170
Tang Lianyue!

707
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,340
Don't touch him!
