[Episode 3]

5
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,980
This is the first

6
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,540
of those three hidden weapons,

7
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,820
Cries of 1,000 Birds!

8
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:19,340
Yu.

9
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,660
What are you up to again?

10
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,570
Do you truly intend to kill me?

11
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,570
The same bewitching spell

12
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:31,940
won't work

13
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:32,820
on me again.

14
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,780
Tell me the motive

15
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,660
of your Patriarch,

16
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,010
and I'll spare you.

17
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,410
I told you before.

18
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,100
I don't know any bewitching spells.

19
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,340
If you actually had feelings for me,

20
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,290
that means you've fallen for me.

21
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,130
Demoness,

22
00:02:58,870 --> 00:02:59,500
do not spout such nonsense!

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,570
Wait!

24
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,820
Can you use another hidden weapon instead?

25
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,010
What do you mean?

26
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,570
I'll be pricked by all these needles.

27
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,260
I'll meet an ugly end, you know?

28
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,570
Can you use something else

29
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:15,220
that won't let me meet an ugly end?

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,130
Or use something

31
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,450
that can let me die while preserving my looks?

32
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:26,780
What is this?

33
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,380
This is the Blood Rose.

34
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:29,570
Although

35
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,660
it might look silver to you,

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,130
once it penetrates

37
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,130
your body,

38
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:35,380
your blood will flow into its petals,

39
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:37,290
dyeing it red.

40
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,690
It'll form a beautiful rose.

41
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,010
So, you're the leader of the Blood River Spider Shadow Sect,

42
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,890
Kui.

43
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,100
How's your injury?

44
00:03:58,630 --> 00:03:59,890
I would've died for real

45
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,380
had you come a few moments later.

46
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,890
Trap him with the 1000-Spider Array.

47
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,850
I suppose I have to see

48
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,850
the rest of your hidden weapons next time.

49
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,100
Yu,

50
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:24,140
the Tracking Spider that you owned

51
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,220
started getting excited all of a sudden.

52
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:27,100
I knew that you would be near.

53
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,410
Luckily, you made it in time.

54
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,410
Is your injury okay?

55
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,100
It's nothing too serious.

56
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,170
Tang Lianyue

57
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,410
went easy on me.

58
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,490
If not,

59
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,490
I might've been dead.

60
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,850
After all,

61
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,460
he's one of the Four Guardians of Tianqi City.

62
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,460
He's a top martial arts expert.

63
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,490
Luckily, he's the one you encountered.

64
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,850
Tang Lianyue, the Xuanwu Guardian,

65
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,370
always hated killing.

66
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,050
Nonsense.

67
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,490
He spared me

68
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,730
because

69
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,610
he fell for me at first glance.

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,290
Your blind confidence

71
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,540
is actually growing stronger.

72
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,580
I'm serious.

73
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,810
Just now, he said

74
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,610
that I cast a bewitching spell on him.

75
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:11,730
Yu,

76
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,580
do you think I know any bewitching spells?

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,250
Most of the women in the Mu family excel at bewitching spells.

78
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,780
However, I suppose you don't know any.

79
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,610
The Xuanwu Guardian targeted me because he fell for me.

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,660
I must be charming, then.

81
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,410
Let's drop the topic for now.

82
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,140
Changhe sent many people

83
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,410
to obstruct me while I was on my way here.

84
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:31,980
He knew all about

85
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,780
our movements.

86
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,660
He even delivered a message to Tang Lianyue.

87
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,340
That means he has planted a mole

88
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,050
within Spider Shadow.

89
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,170
We have to return to the Patriarch

90
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:39,980
as soon as possible.

91
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:41,930
Yu.

92
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,580
Has it never occurred to you

93
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,980
that I might be

94
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:49,660
the mole?

95
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:53,050
That's not funny.

96
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,930
I'm not joking.

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,810
I did hesitate before.

98
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,540
Although

99
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,900
I haven't managed

100
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,290
to do something

101
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,900
that will go against the vow I made back then,

102
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,930
Yu,

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,610
I hesitated.

104
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,220
I'm starting to doubt

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,220
the meaning of our existence.

106
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:19,700
Yu.

107
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,290
You grew up together

108
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,700
with Changhe.

109
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,980
But this time,

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,050
do you two have to

111
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:28,660
fight each other?

112
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,140
I swore a vow when I joined Spider Shadow.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,460
I won't let anyone

114
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,340
threaten the Patriarch's safety

115
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,900
until the day I die.

116
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,170
Of course I remember that.

117
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:43,490
Joining the Spider Shadow

118
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,290
is the biggest honor for a member of Blood River.

119
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,730
Once the Patriarch's poison is neutralized,

120
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,410
and he rules over the Three Families again,

121
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,050
the head of the Su family will rescind his order.

122
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:55,930
By then,

123
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,730
we won't need to

124
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,660
go against each other.

125
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:23,610
Who's there?

126
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:24,900
I'm Su Muyu

127
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,140
of the Su family.

128
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,410
Why are you here?

129
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,290
I cannot

130
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,730
accept this mission.

131
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,290
It's been many years

132
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,250
since anyone dared

133
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,540
to reject the mission

134
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,370
the Soul Reapers' Hall had assigned.

135
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,610
Even the Patriarch

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,340
cannot change our decision.

137
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,780
What's your excuse

138
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,730
for rejecting us?

139
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,250
I don't feel like accepting it.

140
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,610
That's not your decision to make.

141
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,100
But I know why you're doing so.

142
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,140
Zhang Taicheng, the Governor of Luonan,

143
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,610
was rumored

144
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,100
to be an excellent official who loved his people.

145
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,980
When the south was struck by a flood,

146
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,610
every prefecture

147
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,980
lined their pockets.

148
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,610
He was the only one who opened the granaries

149
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,980
to aid the people.

150
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,290
Not only that,

151
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,020
but he also reported their corruption

152
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,100
to Tianqi City,

153
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,140
forcing Tianqi City

154
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,220
to send their inspectors here.

155
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,780
That's how the people were able to survive.

156
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,220
He's a good person.

157
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,250
Therefore,

158
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,340
you don't wish to kill him.

159
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:20,980
Such audacity!

160
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,700
Once you receive the writ of the Soul Reapers' Hall,

161
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,850
you have to kill your target, even if he's the emperor.

162
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,100
Whether he's good or bad doesn't matter.

163
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,580
You're an assassin.

164
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,810
You aren't a saint.

165
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:32,730
I won't accept it.

166
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:41,610
Relay a message to the head of the Su family.

167
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,010
Deem him a traitor.

168
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:44,340
Kill him.

169
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,130
Kill him!

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,340
If the old fool of the Su family isn't willing to kill him,

171
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,650
I'll do it.

172
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,490
Calm down.

173
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,180
Look.

174
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,650
One of his friends has arrived.

175
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,890
Greetings, Three Officials.

176
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,580
Su Changhe,

177
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,770
also known as the Undertaker.

178
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,060
The rising prodigy of the Su family.

179
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,300
You stand shoulder to shoulder with Su Muyu.

180
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,300
Shoulder to shoulder?

181
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,650
That means I'm inferior to him.

182
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,220
What are you doing here?

183
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,980
Su Muyu is a great buddy of mine.

184
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,940
He wanted to set a rule

185
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,610
for the Soul Reapers' Hall about how he would accept missions.

186
00:09:21,630 --> 00:09:23,370
My buddy has a set of rules called the Three Refusals.

187
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,460
He refuses to accept missions of massacre,

188
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,580
missions without cause,

189
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,460
and missions against his will.

190
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:33,580
And I, Su Changhe,

191
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,730
wish to set a rule too.

192
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,650
You two

193
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,250
are still green.

194
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,890
You think you can set up a rule here?

195
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,340
Even the Patriarch doesn't have the right to do so.

196
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,650
It seems

197
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,340
the Soul Reapers' Hall

198
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,130
must keep you guys in check today.

199
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,650
The other two officials, please wait.

200
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,940
I wish to hear about

201
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,370
the kind of rule

202
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:02,340
you wish to set.

203
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:04,460
This is the rule I wish to set.

204
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,300
For the missions that Su Muyu wouldn't accept,

205
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:09,060
I'll accept them all.

206
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,130
You went to the Soul Reapers' Hall a few days ago.

207
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:29,100
Why did you go there?

208
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,610
Of course I went there to negotiate a deal on your behalf.

209
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:33,980
You're bad with your words.

210
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,100
The Soul Reapers' Hall isn't the Patriarch.

211
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,250
They only acknowledge the rules.

212
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:38,850
They don't care about the sword you wield.

213
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,700
No wonder it's as if they've acknowledged

214
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,730
the three rules I set.

215
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,580
Naturally.

216
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,010
I've always been eloquent, you know?

217
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,300
If they don't yield, you'll beat them until they do.

218
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,530
If that's the case,

219
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,580
I suppose you're eloquent in your own way.

220
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,490
Don't tell me

221
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,180
you actually fought them.

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,770
I merely analyzed

223
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,250
the pros and cons for them.

224
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:06,580
The Soul Reapers' Hall keeps tabs too, you know?

225
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:07,580
Killing you

226
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,770
doesn't benefit them in any way.

227
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,490
Be honest with me.

228
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,610
Did you agree

229
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,300
to some of their conditions?

230
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,980
You have your own means.

231
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,850
I have my own means as well.

232
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,300
Just trust me.

233
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:39,300
[Jiuxiao City]

234
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,460
[Jiuxiao City]

235
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,770
"My sword shatters the nine heavens,

236
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,150
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]

237
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:48,980
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]
severing all chaos.

238
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,750
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]

00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:51,650
[Li Hanyi, Xueyue City]
It cuts through sorrow

240
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,530
and strikes down every injustice,

241
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,770
so that I can soar with you beyond the mortal sky."

242
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,370
Is this the city

243
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,850
where the Sword Poet Deity made a name for himself?

244
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,130
His strike pierces through the nine heavens, huh?

245
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,980
That's just a rumor.

246
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,180
Sir.

247
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,010
You're a swordsman too.

248
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,770
Haven't you thought of visiting Jiuxiao City

249
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,770
when you were young?

250
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,420
Ordinary people see swords as mere swords.

251
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,180
For Blood River, swords

252
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,980
are weapons for murder.

253
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,530
Moreover,

254
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,130
I wasn't a swordsman

255
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,010
when I was young.

256
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:45,770
I picked up swordsmanship

257
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,530
after that.

258
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,580
Sir,

259
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,250
what did people call you

260
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,010
when you were young?

261
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,010
Do you know

262
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,100
that the question you asked just now

263
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,180
was a taboo in Blood River?

264
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:08,980
However,

265
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,940
I think it won't matter even if I tell you my name.

266
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,530
My surname is Mu.

267
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,010
They called me Mu Mingce

268
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,250
before I became the Patriarch.

269
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,300
Mu Mingce?

270
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,650
Is this the so-called Spider's Nest?

271
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,650
The Spider Shadow Sect

272
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,220
has set up such bases

273
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,580
in both Beili and Nanjue.

274
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,940
Each base

275
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:43,890
is a fortress that's easy to defend and hard to invade.

276
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,530
Therefore, many people

277
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,610
don't want us

278
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,460
to return to our nest.

279
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,340
That's all you got, huh?

280
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,460
You think that you can deal with me?

281
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,650
It's from the Xie family.

282
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,530
Chou the Ox,

283
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:22,220
there's no need to expose them.

284
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:23,460
Sir,

285
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,010
since they were bold enough to attack us,

286
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,100
there's no need

287
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,340
for us to spare them.

288
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,420
Let's kill them all.

289
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,610
The Xie family and the Mu family actually joined hands?

290
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:58,460
They actually set up the Heavenly Web Array!

291
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,010
Heavenly Web Array?

292
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:03,850
Don't look!

293
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:08,890
Hai the Swine!

294
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:09,700
Chou the Ox?

295
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,130
I'm not dead yet.

296
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,370
Sir,

297
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,460
didn't you say

298
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,890
that this carriage was impenetrable?

299
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,820
Why aren't we using it?

300
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:17,100
It's too late.

301
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,220
He has already infiltrated it.

302
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,180
He?

303
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,460
Fanhua, it's you.

304
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,030
[Xie Fanhua, young master of the Xie family]

305
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:30,420
[Xie Fanhua, young master of the Xie family]
Long time no see.

306
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,340
Sir,

307
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,820
please pardon me for not being able to greet you

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,530
as I'm quite sick.

309
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,250
Sickly Ghost?

310
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,700
You're terminally ill.

311
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:43,770
Even the deities can't save you.

312
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:45,370
Indeed.

313
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,340
I'm destined to die soon.

314
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,130
That's why I'm daring enough

315
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,940
to intercept the Patriarch's carriage and see him personally.

316
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:55,850
I'm not afraid of

317
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,460
the punishment that awaits me.

318
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:00,890
So,

319
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:04,580
what are you trying to tell me here?

320
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:07,610
Sir,

321
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,610
you've been in this position

322
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,530
for a long time.

323
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,180
And now,

324
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,770
you're seriously wounded.

325
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,340
Why don't you use this opportunity to retire

326
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:19,850
and enjoy the rest of your years?

327
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,980
Isn't it better to leave this vexing position

328
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,850
to those who are in the prime

329
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,700
of their youth?

330
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,130
In the prime of their youth?

331
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,580
Are you referring

332
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,490
to Xie Ba?

333
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:41,300
The head of the Xie family

334
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:43,370
has served Blood River faithfully

335
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,060
all these years.

336
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:48,130
Naturally,

337
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,100
he's the best candidate for the position.

338
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,730
What if I reject your request?

339
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,300
If so,

340
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,580
I have no choice but to offend you.

341
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,420
You guys merely

342
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,220
desire

343
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:21,180
the Dormant Dragon Sword

344
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,380
that I possess.

345
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,010
The one who wields the Dormant Dragon Sword

346
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:29,490
is the true leader of Blood River.

347
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,620
So, you know about that, huh?

348
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:34,090
If so, I suppose you can see

349
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,330
who the current wielder

350
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,220
of the sword is.

351
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,380
Since I still wield

352
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,770
the sword,

353
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,330
I'm still the leader

354
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,090
of Blood River.

355
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,620
The Soul-Calling Incense?

356
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:03,730
Senior Brother!

357
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:07,700
This is bad.

358
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,860
He protected the incense with his inner force.

359
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,620
Sir!

360
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,900
The Patriarch is fine.

361
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:21,180
Let's leave.

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,770
It's impossible for Xie Fanhua

363
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,980
to get his hands on the Soul-Calling Incense.

364
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,420
The Mu family must've given it to him.

365
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,180
The Soul-Calling Incense

366
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,420
isn't that difficult to neutralize.

367
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,490
But this is truly unexpected.

368
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,250
Sir, you came from the Mu family.

369
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,050
But now,

370
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,490
even the Mu family is disregarding their past ties with you.

371
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,810
Once a person becomes the Patriarch,

372
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,220
they will cease to be a member of the Three Families.

373
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:01,980
Sir,

374
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,330
I never expected

375
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,460
your inner force to be this powerful.

376
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,250
You actually expelled the poison

377
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:06,900
by force.

378
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,330
That's the easy part.

379
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,940
However, I can't utilize my power

380
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,290
for the next 24 hours.

381
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,070
[Mu Kewen, Spider's Nest]

382
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,180
[Mu Kewen, Spider's Nest]
Sir.

383
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:43,700
Ke.

384
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,180
How long

385
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:47,660
have you served the sect?

386
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,460
It's been 30 years.

387
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,140
I never thought I'd live to see the day

388
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:55,530
when the Patriarch himself would come.

389
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,380
I have no regrets in life now.

390
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,330
You should've spent your retirement years here in peace.

391
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,570
I've caused trouble for you

392
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,860
by coming here.

393
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,290
Sorry for bothering you.

394
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,860
Sir, you must be joking.

395
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,940
People like us

396
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:17,140
have no right

397
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,010
to retire.

398
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,860
All of you, listen up.

399
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,050
Utter no word the moment

400
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,010
you step through the gate.

401
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:29,490
Understood.

402
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,620
Sir,

403
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,180
the key.

404
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,810
You all may speak now.

405
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,010
Is that the Soundless Array?

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:26,980
Indeed.

407
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:30,250
That's the Soundless Array.

408
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:05,220
Sir,

409
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,460
let me take you to your room.

410
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,140
Sir,

411
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,660
who's this lady?

412
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,180
I'm Bai Hehuai.

413
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,940
I could've treated your hunched back

414
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,460
had you encountered me 50 years earlier.

415
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,250
This lady

416
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,460
is the miracle physician of the Medicine King Valley.

417
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,050
She might not be bragging

418
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,620
with what she said.

419
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,490
I never brag.

420
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:35,810
He wasn't born

421
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:36,810
with a hunched back.

422
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:38,860
It was because someone poisoned him.

423
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,810
His bones turned soft because of it.

424
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,730
That's why his back is hunched.

425
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,250
If the poison was neutralized in time,

426
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:48,220
and if he received some chiropractic treatments,

427
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,180
his condition could've been cured.

428
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,010
It's a shame

429
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,290
that it's been too long since then.

430
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,090
Thank you, miracle physician.

431
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,570
I'm already

432
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,250
used to it.

433
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,180
It's not that I cannot cure your condition.

434
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,420
But the price

435
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,700
will be steep.

436
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,010
How steep?

437
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,330
Why don't you give me the entire residence?

438
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,730
Sir,

439
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:24,140
the miracle physician must be joking.

440
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:27,900
Miracle physician,

441
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,980
you're quite greedy, aren't you?

442
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:32,140
That's why I left the Medicine King Valley.

443
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,050
Sir,

444
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,490
we've arrived at your room.

445
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:37,420
Miracle physician,

446
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,770
if you encounter any issues,

447
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:43,050
just tug this rope.

448
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,570
The wooden bird will relay the sound through vibration.

449
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,050
And,

450
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,330
I'll rush to your side

451
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,490
as fast as I can.

452
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:52,700
The wooden bird?

453
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:53,660
That's right.

454
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,420
Wooden birds can be found

455
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,420
in every corner of the Spider's Nest.

456
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,010
Sir,

457
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,220
I shall take my leave first.

458
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:39,810
Sir.

459
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,220
You're a stubborn old man.

460
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:51,420
I haven't fainted yet.

461
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,380
Miracle physician, you don't need to mock me first.

462
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,010
I just think

463
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,530
that the old man

464
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,570
was loyal to you.

465
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,530
If so, why did you still pretend

466
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,290
to be tough

467
00:26:02,510 --> 00:26:03,420
and acted as if

468
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,570
you were still normal?

469
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,660
You would understand why

470
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,090
if you saw the face he had when he killed people.

471
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:12,660
I do trust him.

472
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,570
But it's been 30 years

473
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,900
since we met after all.

474
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,290
It's truly exhausting

475
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:21,180
to be the Patriarch.

476
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,050
He's on our tails.

477
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:53,010
I'll stop him.

478
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,050
You can head to Jiuxiao City.

479
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:55,380
We're talking about Tang Lianyue here.

480
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,940
He might have spared you last time.

481
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,420
But he might not this time.

482
00:26:59,550 --> 00:26:59,980
Yu,

483
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,090
I don't want to choose

484
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,380
between you and Changhe.

485
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,180
Go and end this once and for all.

486
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:06,420
You can decide for me.

487
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,530
As for him...

488
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:11,460
Just trust me.

489
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:12,980
He can't bear to kill me.

490
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,460
I'll give you some of my Life-Protecting zhenqi.

491
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,090
Escape if you can't stop him.

492
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,770
Please be careful.

493
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:46,980
You're hot on our tails, aren't you?

494
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,940
We've been traveling

495
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,940
day and night without rest.

496
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,980
Even so, you still caught up to us.

497
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,220
What's wrong?

498
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,570
Do you wish to see me

499
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,290
that badly?

500
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,050
You two can't travel fast due to the carriage.

501
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,700
Of course I can catch up to you two.

502
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,180
Did Umbrella Ghost

503
00:27:58,750 --> 00:27:59,660
leave you behind?

504
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:01,090
That's right.

505
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:02,620
You see, other people

506
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,940
don't treat me that nicely.

507
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,810
Unlike you, Xuanwu Guardian.

508
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,420
I still remember

509
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:09,090
your warm embrace last night.

510
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:11,140
You have a warm body.

511
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,530
Why are you pretending

512
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,660
to be a cold person?

513
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,090
You!

514
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:21,770
Do you actually think that I won't kill you?

515
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,900
Of course not.

516
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,180
The martial world is never short of passionate men.

517
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,250
However,

518
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,180
they always lose their passion

519
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,570
soon after.

520
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,620
Although

521
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,220
you may have fallen for me that night,

522
00:28:32,790 --> 00:28:34,620
you might have forgotten about me the next day.

523
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,700
Or perhaps,

524
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,140
seeking vengeance is more important to you.

525
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,420
Perhaps a relationship isn't as important to you.

526
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,010
Who knows?

527
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,570
Who said I fell for you?

528
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,770
I wonder who's flustered here.

529
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,220
Although my beauty is unparalleled,

530
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,290
and I'm the top beauty of Blood River,

531
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:55,700
you and I

532
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,250
are just fleeting acquaintances.

533
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,770
It's a transient love affair.

534
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,290
You might think that you have fallen for me at first glance,

535
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,090
but you're just after my body.

536
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:06,810
In the end, you have no deep feelings

537
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:07,730
for me.

538
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,490
I understand.

539
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,530
I'm just after your body?

540
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:15,860
Stop right there.

541
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,060
[Luojiuxiao Inn]

542
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,700
Try to kill me, and I'll try to kill you.

543
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,570
Til death do us part...

544
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:20,810
Remember,

545
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,460
I'm not killing you

546
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,460
only because I don't like to kill.

547
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,220
I knew you were lying to me.

548
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,490
I knew you were still concerned about me.

549
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,330
Your hidden weapons are terrifying.

550
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,530
I'm no match for you.

551
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,460
This time...

552
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,770
This time,

553
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:08,940
I might actually die.

554
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:31,810
You won't die today.

555
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,620
Miracle physician,

556
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,420
will you perform the Soul-Swap Technique on me today?

557
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,810
I'm afraid I can't perform it today.

558
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,900
Sir,

559
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,420
you had just gone through a huge battle this morning.

560
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,220
You're still mentally weakened.

561
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,530
The Soul-Swap Technique

562
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:30,180
will exhaust a large portion of

563
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,980
the target's and the caster's mental strength.

564
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,380
If we perform

565
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:35,140
the Soul-Swap Technique now,

566
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,730
I'm afraid

567
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,490
our lives will be in danger.

568
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,140
Sir,

569
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,530
you should rest for today.

570
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:43,860
As long as

571
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:45,770
the Spider's Nest

572
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,380
is as impenetrable as you said,

573
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:49,330
there's nothing to worry about.

574
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,010
Fine.

575
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,570
I suppose we can wait a little longer.

576
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,060
[Shuying Villa]

577
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,220
The moon looks gorgeous tonight.

578
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,490
Yeah.

579
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:14,770
It does look gorgeous.

580
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:15,900
Who's there?

581
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,660
The Phantom Step, huh?

582
00:33:30,030 --> 00:33:31,290
That's the technique of Blood River's Su family.

583
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,250
You were mistaken.

584
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,860
I just dodged your skill casually.

585
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:34,860
This is interesting.

586
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,140
The girl I thought

587
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,460
I could kill with one blow

588
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:39,290
has given me a huge surprise.

589
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:40,570
That's not

590
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:41,770
the only surprise you'll see.

591
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,140
This is no fun.

592
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,250
You should remove the straw hat.

593
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,330
You can't see well after all.

594
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,940
The Su family's Three-needle Thread, huh?

595
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,900
That's a technique that many Celestial Assassins

596
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,130
cannot master.

597
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:10,010
You'd better not move.

598
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,340
If not, I'll kill you.

599
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,170
I can no longer move.

600
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,490
Just deal one more blow to me,

601
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:16,780
and I'll die for sure.

602
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,570
Do you think I'm that dumb?

603
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,210
Who knows what kind of tricks you're up to?

604
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:22,690
Someone!

605
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,690
If you encounter any issues,

606
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:34,820
just

607
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,610
tug this rope.

608
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,900
The wooden bird

609
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,780
will relay the sound through vibration.

610
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,210
And I'll rush to your side

611
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,940
as fast as I can.
