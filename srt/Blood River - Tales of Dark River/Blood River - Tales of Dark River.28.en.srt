Everything about this seems off.

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,260
He probably figured

7
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,740
the food here wasn't to his taste,

8
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,260
so he went to find lighter dishes.

9
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,100
In Jin City,

10
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,540
where can you find light dishes?

11
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,020
Perhaps

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,900
the Tang Clan?

13
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,380
Why did he go there?

14
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:55,910
You guys came here

15
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,180
to negotiate a deal with us.

16
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,120
If you guys are visiting Tang Clan,

17
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,900
the deal between us

18
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,820
is off!

19
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,660
You really think we're taking this negotiation seriously?

20
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,220
Now that Xuewei has returned,

21
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,610
the negotiation

22
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,380
is off.

23
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:12,570
You!

24
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,290
Didn't the intel you guys gathered inform you

25
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,890
that I wasn't a credible individual?

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,500
I never said

27
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,730
that I would keep my promise.

00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,100
Patriarch,

29
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,820
what exactly do you want?

30
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:26,060
We wish to get out of the dark and nefarious Blood River.

31
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,290
But judging from Tang Clan's current situation,

32
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,780
it's just like Blood River.

Keep guard over here.

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,540
Notify me immediately if there are any movements.

37
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,730
Be careful.

38
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,100
Isn't that Tang Tianlu?

39
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,290
If we fight him,

40
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:04,730
the commotion will definitely

41
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:05,730
attract all of their members here.

42
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,690
We have to lure them away somehow.

43

He was trapped in Tang Clan as well.

But right now,

95
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,220
you should let me

check your pulse.

97
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,340
This toxin

98
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,140
is the same as the toxin in Xuewei's body.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,980
Could it be that she's in trouble?

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,220
She was taken away by Night Crow before this.

101
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:05,250
I knew it.

102
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,660
Although my martial niece harbored

103
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,490
sinister thoughts,

104
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,660
she's exceptionally intelligent.

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,490
A near-perfect toxic beauty

106
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,490
was in her hands.

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,170
I suppose she could extract the toxin

108
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:14,810
within her

109
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,290
and use it for other purposes.

110
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,730
This toxin is difficult to neutralize.

111
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,140
This pill will suppress it for now.

112
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:22,250
I'll neutralize the poison for you

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,580
once we leave this place.

114
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,580
Thank you, Miss Bai.

115
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,410
Miss Bai,

116
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,610
do you have a way to rescue Tang Lianyue?

117
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,260
The Frostmoon Cocoon, huh?

118
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,170
I have an idea.

119
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,610
How should we rescue him?

120
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,460
I'll try using Ember.

121
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,250
I suppose snakes devour cocoons, right?

122
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,490
I think so.

123
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,780
What kind of snake is Ember?

124
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,100
A Phoenix Flame Serpent.

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,020
This is Ember.

126
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,260
Ember isn't as obedient as Green.

127
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,250
It knew that my calling would surely mean trouble.

128
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,900
That's why it isn't willing to work.

129
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,850
That's more like it.

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,810
Get to work.

131
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,370
I think the room

132
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,700
isn't as cold now.

133
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,700
Yeah.

134
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,410
And,

135
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,730
it's getting warmer by the second.

136
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,290
If we have the Celestial Sea Flame Spider,

137
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:09,580
Tang Lianyue

138
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,850
would've returned to normal by now.

139
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,350
Although Ember

140
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,560
is a rare flame-attribute mystical snake,

141
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,110
it'll take at least four hours

142
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,740
for it

143
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,460
to melt all of the ice here.

144
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,660
He'll return to normal eventually.

145
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,050
However,

146
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,780
he won't regain consciousness just yet.

147
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,100
It's a shame

148
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,700
that you guys won't have the time to do so.

149
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:37,890
You're already dead

Miss Bai,

153
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,530
please examine him.

154
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,340
I didn't do that.

155
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,420
It'll take at least half an hour

156
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,580
for ordinary people

157
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,580
to regain their movements in this situation.

158
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,250
Miss Bai, you were referring to ordinary people.

159
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,300
But he's Tang Lianyue.

160
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,340
Yes.

161
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,580
I'm Tang Lianyue.

162
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,850
You're finally awake.

163
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,370
Never would I have imagined

164
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,220
that the ones to come and save me

165
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,010
would be you all.

166
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,950
What do you mean by that?

167
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,950
Shouldn't you think of me at the first time

168
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:57,100
when you were ambushed?

169
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,130
It's you?

170
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,230
What do you mean by that?

171
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:03,650
Who am I?

172
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,060
Mu Yumo.

173
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,010
He answered that directly, huh?

174
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,340
That was pretty surprising.

175
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:09,370
Yeah.

176
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,820
He's Tang Lianyue after all.

177
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,770
Martial Uncle,

178
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,300
I want to know why you're doing this.

179

You guys support Tang Linghuang.

180
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,700

to become the next grand master.

183
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,770
But the address of Tang Clan's Wanbao Tower

184
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,940
is only known to

185
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:46,220
Grand Master Tang, Senior Brother, and me.

186
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,730
Is that why you guys

187
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,850
trapped us here

188
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,060
without killing us?

189
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,610
Within Wanbao Tower

190
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,220
contains

191
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,730

Without them,

193
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,320
it'll be difficult for Tang Clan

194
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,070
to maintain its position

195
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,060

Although you're free now,

Tang Linghuang and Tang Lian

198

are still in our hands.

If you try anything funny,

200
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,700
we can kill them at any time.

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,180
So, it turns out that the term "hypocrite"

202
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,100
in the so-called righteous sects

203
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,980
was used to describe someone like you.

204
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:29,980
You used one's sense of justice

205
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,420
and loyalty to blackmail your own member

206
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:33,530
in order to achieve your despicable goal.

207
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:36,130
However, a true gentleman

208
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,100
is annoying as well.

209
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,370
After all, they would yield to someone like you.

210
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,490

211

and I'll make sure that you and Tang Linghuang

215
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,060
can leave Tang Clan safely.

216

Where's Grand Master Tang?

217
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,610
He won't return to Tang Clan again.

218

It's just that he's unable to return to Tang Clan again.

223

That is all.

Don't believe in his nonsense.

You might fall for his trap again.

Senior Brother once told me this.

249
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,560
Who exactly are you?

250
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,140
I'm just a passerby.

251
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,420
I was passing by Tang Clan.

252
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,420
Initially, I was here

253
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,460
to complete a deal as per the order I received.

254
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,730
They would ensure my safety,

255
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,370
and provide me with a secret area

256
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,980
and herbs for my experiment.

257
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,100
I would help them seize power in the sect.

258
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,980
But now, it seems like

259
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:16,890
the deal

260
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,220
might not stand.

261

You see,

00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,420
I only like to join hands with the most powerful.

263
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,060
It's a shame

264
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,220
that the three strongest individuals of Tang Clan

265
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,580
are hard to work with.

266

I have no choice but to join hands with the second best.

379
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,890
your goal.

380
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,540
Master Su.

381
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,810
The members of Tang Clan have arrived.

382
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:46,980
Yes, sir.

383
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:49,740
Who are you?

384
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,550
[Tang Xuan, Tang Clan]

385
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,300
I'm Tang Xuan.

386
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,780
Where's Tang Lianyue?

387
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,570
Vice Master Tang was taken away before Lianyue

388
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,850
arrived at Execution Hall.

389
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:57,890
After Lianyue heard about it,

390
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,410
he and Xueyue Sword Deity

391
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,410
went to pursue him.

392
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,500
Before his departure,

393
00:21:01,550 --> 00:21:02,740
he requested me to thank

394
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,170
the members of Blood River.

395
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,650
Is that all?

396
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,260
Where's Baicao, then?

397
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,850
King of Medicine

398
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,410
was confined in a secret chamber before this.

399
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,980
When Vice Master Tang was taken away,

400
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,130
he was also released

401
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,090
on purpose.

402
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,410
He's resting in the medicine room now.

403
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:19,460
I came here to notify you all.

404
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,060
It seems like the work of martial niece of mine.

405
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,460
They took Tang Linghuang away

406
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,740
because his body

407
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,370
was the perfect medicinal vessel.

408
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,700
Later, I'll give him a diagnosis

409
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,610
at Tang Clan.

410
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,780
Please send him back

411
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:31,190
to Medicine King Valley after that.

412
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,090
Thank you.

413
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,610
Is that all from Tang Lianyue?

414
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,780
I'm sure you all are here

415
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,510
for other purposes.

416
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,090
And, Grand Master Tang hasn't returned from his trip.

417
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,740
Neither Vice Master Tang nor Lianyue is around as well.

418
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,020
If you need anything,

419
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,740
you may discuss it with me.

420
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:53,740
Discuss it with you?

421
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,890
Who do you think you are?

422
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Do you think you have the right to speak with us?

423
00:21:57,270 --> 00:21:57,980
Patriarch,

424
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,300
what do you mean by that?

425
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,540
I feel the same as Changhe.

426
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,170
Who do you think you are?

427
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,780
You have no right to speak with us.

428
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,300
Scram.

429
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,060
Go back and tell Tang Lianyue this.

430
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,610
If he wishes to see us,

431
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,410
tell him to come to Blood River.

432
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,740
I've put my Tracking Spider on him.

433
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,060
I will find you

434
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,220
no matter where you are.

435
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,500
[20 Days Later]

436
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,220
[Tianqi City]

437
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,540
[At the Autumn Equinox, day and night are equal, while you and I are apart]

438
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,810
Guardian Azure Dragon?

439
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:00,260
The Undertaker?

440
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:07,850
Muyu, oh, Muyu.

441
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,460
I suppose everyone in the world

442
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,500
is hostile toward Blood River.

443
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,810
Patriarch,

444
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,020
please don't be reckless.

445
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,610
Am I being reckless just for trying to spar with

446
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,220
the successor of the Heart Sword?

447
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,890
I am Su Changhe, Patriarch of Blood River.

448
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,740
Guardian Azure Dragon, it's an honor to meet you in Tianqi City.

449
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,060
Please inform him

450
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,370
of my arrival.

451
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,980
Inform him?

452
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,500
I wish to see

453
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,220
Prince of Langya.

454
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,520
For the past few centuries,

455
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,500
martial artists feared and respected

456
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,780
Blood River.

457
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,130
You guys

458
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,170
are the blades of darkness.

459
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,460
You show up unannounced to take one's life.

460
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,740
I am Guardian Azure Dragon of Tianqi.

461
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,060
My duty is to protect the city.

462
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,540
Therefore,

463
00:24:01,550 --> 00:24:02,220
I'm sorry.

464
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,740
I unleashed the defensive sword energy

465
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:05,940
due to my duty.

466
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,020
I don't care about that.

467
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,500
However, Su Muyu

468
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,850
might care about that.

469
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:15,980
My daughter encountered the Umbrella Ghost

470
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,500
in Tang Fort before.

471
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,260
Now, he's the head of Su family.

472
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,740
Fine.

473
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,410
Master Su said

474
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,500
that they were involved in the uprising of Tang Clan.

475
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,810
But it was obvious

476
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,220
that they sided with Tang Lianyue.

477
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,700
They rescued Tang Lianyue.

478
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,810
Due to that,

479
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,090
we're indebted to him.

480
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,300
Hanyi was able to find Tang Lianyue after that.

481
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:41,780
But at the same time,

482
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,410
Tang Linghuang was taken away

483
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:44,700
by a group of mysterious figures.

484
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,940
They pursued them northward.

485
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,130
However, there were still traces

486
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,700
of the Frostmoon Cocoon's toxin

487
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,650
within Lianyue's body.

488
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:53,020
They were forced to stop halfway.

489
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,740
After that,

490
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:57,540
they lost Tang Linghuang's trail.

491
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,940
Tang Linghuang was taken

492
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,570
to Tianqi City.

493
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,890
The scouts of Inner Security Division also said

494
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:05,840
that a group of mysterious figures

495
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,800
entered Tianqi City not long ago.

496
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,130
But soon after,

497
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,740
they managed to shake off their surveillance.

498
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,220
Hanyi returned to Xueyue City as she didn't want

499
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,330
to be involved with Tianqi.

500
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,610
Lianyue and I continued our investigation.

501
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:16,890
We suspect

502
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,020
that the group of mysterious figures

503
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,220
were the ones who abducted Tang Linghuang.

504
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,740
Right when we intended to investigate this case further,

505
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,850
you guys entered Tianqi.

506
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,020
We can help you guys

507
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,020
to locate them.

508
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,890
So, you guys are here

509
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,700
to make a deal with us, am I right?

510
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,020
Speaking of which,

511
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,170
we need to settle some debts with them.

512
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,630
You see, with my personality,

513
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:42,170
I would've gotten rid of them.

514
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,540
But Su Muyu?

515
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,170
He said

516
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,220
this was an excellent opportunity.

517
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,260
What opportunity?

518
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,700
An opportunity to become friends with Prince of Langya.

519
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,740
Actually, I don't care about it at all.

520
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,610
I'm an arrogant fellow who's full of myself.

521
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,570
How could I become friends

522
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,940
with a shining hero

523
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:03,980
like Prince of Langya?

524
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,170
But Su Muyu already said so.

525
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:10,020
Why do you listen to him?

526
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:14,940
What did he say?

527
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,890
Su Muyu said

528
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:18,740
he wanted Blood River and Prince of Langya to become friends,

529
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,220
not me.

530
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,610
Therefore,

531
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:22,850
he told me to shut up.

532
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,850
Isn't this ridiculous?

533
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,650
Who's the Patriarch here? He? Or I?

534
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,850
Why should I shut up?

535
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,410
I'm not going to shut up.

536
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:33,090
I'm not willing to shut up.

537
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,190
I don't care at all.

538
00:26:35,350 --> 00:26:36,740
I scoff at it.

539
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,300
I sneer at it.

540
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,370
I...

541
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,700
I yield.

542
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,020
Therefore, Guardian Azure Dragon,

543
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,410
please inform

544
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,020
Prince of Langya

545
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,650
that I'm seeking an audience with him.

546
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,260
What's your goal?

547
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,300
As for my goal,

548
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,940
I wish to tell him face-to-face.

549
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,810
Guardian Azure Dragon,

550
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,570
you merely need to inform him.

551
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,560
Where's Master Su,

552
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,650
whose power surpasses even yours?

553
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,650
Him?

554
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,330
He needs to wake up early for a house-viewing session tomorrow.

555
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:08,890
Therefore, he's already asleep.

556
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:13,570
Come.

557
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,300
Over here.

558
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,090
I'll take you guys to the unit now.

559
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,540
It's warm during winter and cool during summer.

560
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,790
And, it's located in a lively area.

561
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:20,980
It'll satisfy your wish to have guests over

562
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:23,020
and still keep your privacy.

563
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,220
The previous two guests who lived here

564
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,810
all struck it rich.

565
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,060
I believe

566
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,090
that you and your wife

567
00:27:29,310 --> 00:27:30,170
will surely be able to achieve the same.

568
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,920
Didn't I tell you already?

569
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,220
We aren't a couple.

570
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,260
We're merely business partners.

571
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,460
I understand.

572
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,980
A gifted man and a graceful lady.

573
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,090
A perfect couple like you two

574
00:27:39,550 --> 00:27:41,060
came all the way to Tianqi to open an apothecary.

575
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,330
And now, you say that you're merely business partners?

576
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,890
I'll never believe that.

577
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:44,940
I'm sure you two

578
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,090
are members of noble families

579
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,170
who stole some money from the family

580
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,850
and eloped all the way here.

581
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,300
I...

582
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,300
Don't worry.

583
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,330
I won't tell anyone about it.

584
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,570
My lips are sealed.

585
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,090
That's not convincing at all.

586
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,570
Come.

587
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,460
Over here, please.

588
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,260
Please.

589
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:14,370
Here.

590
00:28:14,590 --> 00:28:15,810
What do you think about this unit?

591
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,060
This residence is pretty good.

592
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,850
It's pretty quiet.

593
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,500
I just don't know if business here will be good.

594
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,650
As for that,

595
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,570
that'll depend on you.

596
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,260
What do you think about your medical skills?

597
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:36,020
I'm one of the top five physicians in the world.

598
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,940
Where are the other four, then?

599
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,300
I don't think they're in Tianqi City.

600
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,260
I suppose this place isn't secluded enough

601
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,170
to hide your popularity.

602
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,650
He and his slick tongue.

603
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,570
How much per month?

604
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:53,460
Per month?

605
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:54,980
We don't rent this place out in months.

606
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,020
Only in years.

607
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,060
You guys came all the way here to open an apothecary.

608
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,570
How could you only rent it for one month?

609
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,170
What about half a year?

610
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,170
I don't think we'll be staying here for long.

611
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:09,060
Yeah.

612
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,410
I don't really like the climate here.

613
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,170
Nan'an City suits me better.

614
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,060
And, the osmanthus cakes here aren't nice at all.

615
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,300
Why don't

616
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,780
we

617
00:29:20,070 --> 00:29:20,740
forget about it?

618
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,890
Half a year, huh?

619
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:25,540
Fine, then.

620
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,500
Half a year of rent

621
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,700
will cost you 200 silver taels.

622
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,170
It's that expensive?

623
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,570
This is Tianqi City, you know?

624
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,780
It's the busiest city in the world.

625
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,570
200 silver taels,

626
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,980
it's a great bargain.

627
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,600
You're calling this a great bargain?

628
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,430
You...

629
00:29:44,430 --> 00:29:45,170
What?

630
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,610
It costs 200 silver taels

631
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,890
to rent this lousy place?

632
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,130
Go away.

633
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,330
- Second Master Tu. - Mr. Su.

634
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,460
Why did you find a lousy place as such?

635
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,410
Come with me.

636
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,850
I have a huge unit

637
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,850
within Qile Pleasure House.

638
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,220
It's ten times the size

639
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,980
of this unit.

640
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,650
I have 80 servants there.

641
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,220
You won't need to worry about a single thing living there.

642
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,410
You can just live there.

643
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,460
If you like the place,

644
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,330
you can have it.

645
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,780
If you don't like the place,

646
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:06,850
if you like somewhere that's quieter,

647
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,780
I have a mountain villa

648
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,980
on the outskirts.

649
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,330
It's 30 times the size of this unit.

650
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:12,650
There's even a hunting ground inside.

651
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,810
Come, I'll take you there.

652
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,780
Second Master Tu, thank you so much.

653
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:15,980
But it's fine.

654
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,370
This place is pretty nice.

655
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,460
We came here to open an apothecary.

656
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,740
It'll be inconvenient for us

657
00:30:20,790 --> 00:30:21,610
if the unit is too big.

658
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,410
We should stay down-to-earth.

659
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,630
It'll be troublesome

660
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:26,650
if the patients are too intimidated

661
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,090
by its sheer size to come inside.

662
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:29,980
You have a point.

663
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,330
This place will do, then.

664
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,850
Which estate agency do you work for?

665
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,940
Greetings, Second Master Tu.

666
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,020
I'm an estate broker

667
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:41,260
for Home of Love.

668
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:42,260
Never heard of it before.

669
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:43,940
This is my friend.

670
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:45,890
Give him a cheaper price.

671
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,130
If so...

672
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:48,570
What about one...

673
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,540
How much?

674
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:50,780
One silver tael.

675
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,740
One silver tael?

676
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,260
That's right.

677
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:00,130
My main intention

678
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,500
is to befriend Second Master Tu.

679
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,980
You think you can befriend me

680
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,020
with such a meager amount?

681
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,700
That's not it, Second Master Tu.

682
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,740
I suppose you got yourself a great bargain.

683
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,260
Find some of your men

684
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,060
and help my friend

685
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:11,540
renovate the unit tomorrow.

686
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,170
Mr. Su,

687
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,510
when do you guys plan

688
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,330
to open the apothecary?

689
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,610
In three days.

690
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,130
Did you hear him?

691
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:18,940
I did.

692
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:19,890
Go and hire more help.

693
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,890
Understood.

694
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,850
I'll get to it immediately.

695
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,410
Mr. Su.

696
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,740
Why did you return to Tianqi City

697
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,780
all of a sudden?

698
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,170
I came here to get in someone's good graces.

699
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,410
Who?

700
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:37,810
Prince of Langya.

701
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,650
I suppose

702
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,700
he's a man among man, huh?

703
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:48,740
Here.

704
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:51,740
Mr. Su,

705
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,540
why is Blood River

706
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:54,980
looking for Prince of Langya?

707
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,130
Are you guys preparing for something huge?

708
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:58,980
What do you mean?

709
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,610
For example,

710
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:02,890
staging a rebellion.

711
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,130
Staging a rebellion?

712
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,650
May I join you guys?

713
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,060
No.

714
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,810
What a shame.

715
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,500
I mean,

716
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,780
we aren't here to stage a rebellion.

717
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,170
Why are you guys looking for Prince of Langya, then?

718
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,850
Do you think a person like Prince of Langya

719
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,330
will stage a rebellion?

720
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,500
Not in the past, he won't.

721
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,170
But now,

722
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:25,090
I think it's a little different.

723
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,260
What's so different about it?

724
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,260
Lately, rumors have been circulating

725
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:32,460
in Tianqi City.

726
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,700
Rumor has it

727
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,700
that his name was contained within

728
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,370
the Dragonseal Scroll he tore apart back then.

729
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,710
Who in Tianqi City

730
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,810
is bold enough to spread such a rumor?

731
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,980
You're right.

732
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,870
Back then, Prince of Langya invaded Tai'an Palace

733
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,850
with his army.

734
00:32:45,850 --> 00:32:46,800
He obtained the Dragonseal Scroll

735
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,300
from the late emperor.

736
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,330
After that, he announced

737
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,170
that the late emperor had passed the throne to Xiao Ruojin,

738
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,090
which is the current Emperor Mingde.

739
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,300
But you need to know this.

740
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,650
There were always

741
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,090
two Dragonseal Scrolls.

742
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,940
One of them was ripped apart

743
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,610
by Prince of Langya

744
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,460
outside Tai'an Palace back then.

745
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,610
As for the other one,

746
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,300
it was supposed to be delivered to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau

747
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,330
by the messenger eunuch.

748
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:06,370
However, the bureau never received the scroll.

749
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,540
And, the messenger eunuch

750
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,700
went missing as well.

751
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,300
This rumor has existed since the beginning.

752
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:13,850
Prince of Langya

753
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,330
didn't need to rip the scroll apart

754
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:17,410
if Xiao Ruojin's name was within it.

755
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,370
It was merely because

756
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,540
he possessed immense military strength back then.

757
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,980
If anyone refused to comply,

758
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,330
they wouldn't have survived the night.

759
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:24,540
That's why no one

760
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:25,650
dared to mention it again

761
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,940
after the incident.

762
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,650
Therefore,

763
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,260
now that the rumors are starting to circulate again,

764
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,170
I'm sure someone is spreading them on purpose.

765
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,570
Who do you think is the culprit, then?

766
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,780
I think it's Prince of Langya himself.

767
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,460
Now, he has conquered all three areas of Nanjue,

768
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,220
and has rendered numerous merits.

769
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:42,220
He's already the top figure of Beili's military.

770
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:43,940
His fame rivals that of

771
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,300
the founding emperor of Beili,

772
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,570
Xiao Yi, also known as Emperor Tianwu.

773
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,460
And, the army under him

774
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,700
is already raring to act.

775
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:51,650
They want him to be the emperor.

776
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,060
Perhaps back then, Prince of Langya

777
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,170
truly intended

778
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,130
to support his elder brother.

779
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,220
But people change, you know?

780
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,460
Especially for those who stand at the peak for a long time.

781
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,740
It gets lonely up there.

782
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:02,940
After all,

783
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,700
I'm sure everyone will strive for a higher position.

784
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,060
Just like how Second Master Tu

785
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,060
intends to replace First Master Tu.

786
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,820
Miss Bai, that's nonsense.

787
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,340
That's definitely nonsense.

788
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,820
It was just a joke.

789
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,940
It seems my prediction is correct.

790
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,290
Mr. Su, what was your prediction?

791
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,730
We encountered

792
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:21,650
some troublesome opponents

793
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,130
during our fight with Tang Clan in Sihuai City.

794
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,170
Although

795
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:26,940
we aren't their targets,

796
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,020
we found out

797
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,860
that

798
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,020
they were plotting something big.

799
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,290
Combining the news you gave us just now,

800
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,860
I suppose

801
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,060
they were trying to deal with Prince of Langya.

802
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,610
Thank you, Second Master Tu.

803
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:45,020
Mr. Su, if you require any help

804
00:34:45,150 --> 00:34:46,770
while you're in Tianqi City,

805
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,860
just send your men

806
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,290
to Thousand-Gold Tower and ask for my help.

807
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:51,540
Second Master Tu, do you intend to befriend Blood River?

808
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:53,340
Are you trying to get in our good graces?

809
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,060
Mr. Su, we hit it off immediately during our first encounter.

810
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,900
We're true friends. I'm not trying to curry favors here.

811
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,420
You know this too.

812
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,290
I've been living in this pretentious city

813
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,060
called Tianqi for a long time.

814
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,250
I especially treasure that feeling of

815
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,610
hitting it off at first sight.

816
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:09,860
Moreover,

817
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,570
Mr. Su, you've saved me before.

818
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,020
Where did you guys hit it off at first sight?

819
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,130
Of course it's on the Entertainment Street.

820
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:21,730
The tavern was filled with drunken guests.

821
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,900
Only Mr. Su and I

822
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,770
remained untempted.
