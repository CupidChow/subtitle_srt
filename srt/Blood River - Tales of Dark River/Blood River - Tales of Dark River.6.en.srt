[Episode 6]

6
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,180
He's Xie Ba's favorite disciple.

7
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,690
Killing him

8
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:08,500
would be the same as declaring war on the Xie family.

9
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,340
Just tell them that I killed him.

10
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,610
There's nothing to be afraid of.

11
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,450
Xie Ba is declaring war

12
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:15,450
on the entire Su family.

13
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:17,980
I'm not afraid that he's declaring war on us.

14
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,850
I'm just worried that he'll be too timid to act.

15
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,730
I'm leaving.

16
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,170
Wait.

17
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,980
We must put on the full act.

18
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,100
Once a person crosses the Blood River,

19
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,820
they shall reach the shore.

20
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,450
Where the shore lies

21
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,060
will no longer be the dark of night.

22
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,380
It will be light.

23
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,610
Someone's coming.

24
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,500
Hurry and leave.

25
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,610
What a shame.

26
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,340
There aren't many interesting people

27
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,500
in the current Xie family.

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:04,940
I guess you could be considered one.

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,980
I would've liked to engage you in a fiery battle

30
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,220
if you didn't have

31
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,220
such a sickly complexion.

32
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,260
This is truly unexpected.

33
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,130
The Undertaker of Blood River

34
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,890
is actually very melancholic.

35
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:21,570
It's you?

36
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,450
The family head of the Mu family,

37
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,780
Mu Zizhe.

38
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,630
[Mu Zizhe, Family Head of Mu family]

39
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,690
You killed Xie Fanhua.

40
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,410
Xie Ba won't let you off.

41
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,660
Even after that,

42
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,270
the members of Blood River

43
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,410
won't let each other off.

44
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,410
Perhaps the so-called Three Families

45
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,660
will only have one family left at the very end.

46
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,100
The sword has been unsheathed.

47
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,660
Why hide its luster?

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,610
You're the youngest family head

49
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,820
in the history of the Mu family.

50
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,820
Don't you wish to be

51
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,730
the youngest Patriarch

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,260
in all of history?

53
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,220
You're truly

54
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,170
interesting.

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,850
I'm here to kill you.

56
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,850
Actually, I already wanted to kill you

57
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,010
when I met you for the first time.

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,930
Actually,

59
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,020
your so-called Uncle Zhe,

60
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,660
he's my father.

61
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,290
This is why

62
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,290
I've been inquiring about his whereabouts.

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,810
My mother

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,250
told me nothing.

65
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,610
She only told me

66
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,660
that he was Kui of Blood River.

67
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:34,930
That's impossible.

68
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,340
I'm not joking.

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,580
Why is it impossible?

70
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,900
The members of Blood River

71
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,020
never marry anyone outside of the sect.

72
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,900
Someone already broke the rule once

73
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,580
and married someone

74
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:47,410
outside of the sect.

75
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,810
But in the end?

76
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,290
He

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,730
and his family

78
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,100
were wiped out.

79
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,370
Uncle Zhe was once Kui.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,100
Even now, he holds a high position

81
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,780
in the Mu family.

82
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,340
It's impossible for him to have a child outside of the sect.

83
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:04,570
You see,

84
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,980
I was just joking with you.

85
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,730
You actually gave me

86
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,700
an honest and rigid answer.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,220
Isn't Blood River's Kui

88
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,020
the potential candidate to inherit the title of Patriarch?

89
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,220
If so,

90
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:14,730
why didn't the Patriarch pass the throne to you?

91
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,050
Wouldn't that resolve your crisis?

92
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:17,410
I'm not a member

93
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,100
of the Blood River's Three Families.

94
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,220
I was born a Nameless.

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,580
There were no such individuals

96
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,170
in Blood River

97
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,140
who had inherited the title of Patriarch.

98
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,900
The so-called Nameless

99
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,220
were orphans.

100
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,200
They were only granted a surname after they passed the trial.

101
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,810
They may have joined the Three Families in name,

102
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,540
but in reality,

103
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,400
they're not seen as

104
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,340
true clan members.

105
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,020
Back then, due to special circumstances,

106
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,410
the Patriarch

107
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,100
had no choice but to appoint me as Kui.

108
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,220
All these years,

109
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,580
I always wanted to hand over the position.

110
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,020
But the Patriarch...

111
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,730
The Patriarch didn't allow me to do so.

112
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,540
I wanted to say this since just now.

113
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,700
You're already wounded.

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,730
Why are you pretending to be tough in front of me, the miracle physician?

115
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:58,730
Sorry about that.

116
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,140
I've expended most of my strength and qi

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,660
after the fierce battle.

118
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,580
I was truly worried about

119
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:06,490
the Patriarch.

120
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:07,980
That's why I pretended to be tough.

121
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,290
What about now?

122
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,340
I can't hold it in anymore.

123
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,780
Let me give you a diagnosis.

124
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,340
The Life-Death Contract?

125
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,460
Only the caster is able to neutralize it

126
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,730
with their inner force.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,220
Miss Bai?

128
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,250
I'll be fine after I treat my wound by regulating my qi.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,250
There's no need to worry.

130
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,460
Regulate your qi to treat your wound?

131
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,020
I think you're just trying to suppress the wound

132
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,460
with your qi.

133
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,540
Physicians like us

134
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,930
hate stupid people like you

135
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,140
who don't cherish their bodies

136
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,460
and lives.

137
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,850
I made a promise

138
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,370
that I would protect the Patriarch.

139
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,580
I also promised

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,050
that I would protect you.

141
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,410
Although I didn't promise

142
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,410
that I would protect myself,

143
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,660
I'll at least take care of myself

144
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:33,930
until you two are doing well.

145
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,140
Su Muyu, the logic expert.

146
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,290
You should rest well.

147
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,250
If not,

148
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,170
you won't have any strength

149
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,780
for the fight later.

150
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,220
I'll be in trouble by then.

151
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,660
This is truly interesting.

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,020
The books that were kept in the secret chamber

153
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:05,780
of Spider's Nest

154
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:08,410
turned out to be nothing but miscellaneous tales

155
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:09,540
and popular romances.

156
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,980
Did they put them here because

157
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,220
they were afraid that those who seek shelter here

158
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,610
might be too bored?

159
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:37,940
What a strange story.

160
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,980
Miss Bai, let's move.

161
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:45,700
Are you sure

162
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,770
you've rested enough?

163
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,420
Do all members of Blood River

164
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,700
have no regard for their lives?

165
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,940
In Blood River,

166
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,490
I have a senior called Mu Zhaoyang.

167
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,220
He created a set of techniques

168
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,340
that were meant for resting.

169
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,850
It's called the Resting Breath.

170
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:57,940
The practitioners

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,890
only sleep for two hours per day.

172
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,130
After that, we'll find another chance

173
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,060
to rest for a moment.

174
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,850
That would be enough rest for us.

175
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:03,980
To

176
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,060
medical practitioners like us,

177
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,220
it doesn't make sense at all.

178
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,220
No matter how awesome the Resting Breath

179
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:09,250
which was created by your senior is,

180
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,060
it doesn't make sense

181
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,220
from a medical perspective.

182
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,650
Perhaps.

183
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,990
But to us,

184
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:14,700
it proves to be very useful.

185
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,060
After all,

186
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,060
we're always in a race against time.

187
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,180
Sorry for the trouble.

188
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,220

00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,060
Pitiful members of the Three Families.

192
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,340
They think

193
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,530
that they have a choice.

194
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,610
But they never understood

195
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,340
that the title of Patriarch is just a tool.

196
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,420
The person wielding the tool

197
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,700
has never been them.

198
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,130
The Su family has Su Changhe

199
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,530
and Su Muyu.

200
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,490
There's no way to control them.

201
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,650
Although the Xie family is powerful,

202
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,730
they're reckless. They cannot win the hearts of the people.

203
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,250
The Mu family is cunning and cruel.

204
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:10,530
However, they're quite weak.

205
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,060
We need a tool that will obey us.

206
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,010
They can fight among themselves.

207
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,890
We can take our time to find one.

208
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:22,540
[I am incompetent. Please grant me The Death Coffin. — Mu]

209
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,960
That Mu Zizhe

210
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,690
is actually smart enough to ask for help.

211
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,730
If so, we shall grant him The Death Coffin.

212
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,060
It's time for us

213
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,890
to head to the battlefield as well.

214
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,820
Let's find out who the final victor is.

215
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,490
Naturally, everyone except for you can go.

216
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,420
This trip will dispel our misfortune

217
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,890
and absolve us of our sins.

218
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,220
However, it cannot grant us any blessings.

219
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,370
If so, I shall go.

220
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:51,700
All right.

221
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,100
You shall go.

222
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,300
We've been holed up in here for so long.

223
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,850
It's time for us to take a stroll outside.

224
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,770
Miss Bai.

225
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:23,850
Please wait here.

226
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,610
I'll head out and inspect the area.

227
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:26,730
All right.

228
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,220
You're Mu Bai,

229
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,460
young master of the Mu family.

230
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,820
Su Muyu.

231
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,370
I've been waiting for you.

232
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,850
You're smarter than I thought.

233
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,700
Did you forget?

234
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,010
Every array in Spider's Nest

235
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,010
was created by the Mu family.

236
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,850
Although we cannot observe the entire area,

237
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,530
there are some tracks

238
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,370
that we can still go after.

239
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:14,010
Xuewei relayed the news to me.

240
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,490
She said you and the miracle physician

241
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:17,060
entered the secret tunnel.

242
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,250
If so, I just need to wait here

243
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:20,770
and kill the miracle physician when she appears.

244
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,250
By then, the Patriarch

245
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,530
won't be able to survive.

246
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,770
But you?

247
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,580
You're dumber than I thought.

248
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,130
What do you mean?

249
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,420
Since I'm the one appearing before you,

250
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,180
what makes you guys think

251
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,180
that you can defeat me?

252
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:56,420
Su Muyu, please hang in there.

253
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:15,060
So, the family head of the Mu family

254
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,180
is only good at

255
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,250
playing sissy tricks, huh?

256
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,850
Dance of the Butterfly, Nine Drives!

257
00:13:29,550 --> 00:13:29,980
Oh no.

258
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,300
I guess this is the full extent

259
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,820
of Blood River's Undertaker, huh?

260
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,890
I already told you

261
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,100
that I hate fighting the Mu family the most.

262
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,850
You guys aren't assassins at all.

263
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,300
You guys are mere tricksters.

264
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,300
Initially, I thought the task I assigned to Uncle Zhe

265
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,250
was a difficult one.

266
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,220
I thought coming to Spider's Nest was a mere formality.

267
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,250
I guess

268
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,650
my calculations were wrong.

269
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,130
I should've taken on his task instead.

270
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,610
During close-quarter combat,

271
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,130
even a top martial arts expert

272
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,340
might commit mistakes.

273
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,010
Therefore, I won't allow you

274
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:14,650
to come near me.

275
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,580
You do like to talk, don't you?

276
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,300
Did you forget?

277
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:28,650
I have a friend

278
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,010
who also excels at using Puppet Strings.

279
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,100
His name is Su Muyu.

280
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,820
You may be invincible outside of close-quarter combat,

281
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,460
but that's what we're doing right now.

282
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,980
If so, that means I have the upper hand.

283
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,220
I can only confirm this after testing you.

284
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,610
You don't have enough inner force

285
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:54,420
to sustain the Eighteen-Sword Array.

286
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,850
Right now, you can only wield one sword.

287
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,890
And, you're seriously wounded.

288
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,130
Do you think you can defeat me?

289
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,730
It seems

290
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,850
I can't enjoy my battle with you today.

291
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:07,490
I don't think you would dare to engage me

292
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:10,700
had I not used the Eighteen-Sword Array before this.

293
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,650
It's rare for you

294
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:15,770
to say something like that.

295
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,460
You were always aloof and nonchalant.

296
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,940
You didn't show any emotions

297
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,770
usually.

298
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,530
It seems you're truly flustered.

299
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:23,580
You're trying to provoke me

300
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,490
with such a method.

301
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,650
Even so,

302
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,580
you're still no match for me.

303
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,340
Back then, both of us were known as

304
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,240
the youngest top martial experts in our families.

305
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,010
But Mu Zizhe knows

306
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,010
all of your techniques.

307
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,610
However, the techniques I use

308
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,220
are unknown,

309
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,530
even to the family head of the Su family.

310
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,580
Is that so?

311
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,300
Have you seen my Trinity Array before?

312
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,130
I spent a lot of years

313
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,890
to create and improve this array.

314
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,300
All of the techniques and moves are closely knitted.

315
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,060
My foes won't even stand a chance.

316
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,530
Su Muyu,

317
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,100
you'll lose all of that confidence of yours

318
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,650
very soon.

319
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,890
Stop wasting your energy.

320
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:19,530
They've ingested the Painless Powder,

321
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:21,250
which the Mu family had invented not long ago.

322
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,180
They know no pain.

323
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,250
They will only obey our commands.

324
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,060
You shall be annihilated in an instant.

325
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,530
An instant

326
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,490
is an eternity for me.

327
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:54,580
I coated the dagger with poison.

328
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,300
You actually tried to poison

329
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,890
a member of the Mu family?

330
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,300
Naturally, you won't be harmed

331
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,860
by such a weak poison.

332
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:06,140
But you see...

333
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,380
I won't treat any of you with respect

334
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,810
unless

335
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,420
Su Jinhui comes here personally.

336
00:17:17,830 --> 00:17:19,380
Even if what you said was true,

337
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:20,870
you have to deal with

338
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:21,660
the three of us at the same time.

339
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,220
If so, you won't have enough time

340
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,460
to expel the poison in your body.

341
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,090
To you, the poison

342
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:27,700
might not amount to anything at the moment.

343
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,140
But what if the poison lasts for

344
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,180
two hours?

345
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,380
I'm afraid even a mighty person like you

346
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,290
requires the help of the miracle physician

347
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,010
just to stay alive.

348
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:38,810
Su Changhe,

349
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,810
you've truly surprised me time and time again.

350
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,980
Farewell, family head.

351
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:47,330
How was it?

352
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,490
I assume you two

353
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,380
had witnessed my performance.

354
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,140
I truly gave it my all

355
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,290
this time around.

356
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,090
I almost died, you know?

357
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,770
Remember to flatter me

358
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,380
in front of the family head, okay?

359
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,290
With Cutting Embrace, your main offense weapon,

360
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:05,180
Falling Autumn, your main defense weapon,

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,940
and White-Sleeve Sword, your main hidden weapon,

362
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,490
your techniques are almost flawless.

363
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,290
You do live up to your reputation as the Umbrella Ghost.

364
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,770
You already saw through my sword arrays

365
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:14,380
right after a few blows.

366
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:15,770
But you forgot something.

367
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,180
There's another me out there.

368
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:18,530
I'm observing your every move

369
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,770
outside the array.

370
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:22,010
Those outside of the situation

371
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,860
always see clearer.

372
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,660
Mu Wusheng, target the Kan Gate in the southeast.

373
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,380
Mu Wuheng, target the Xiu Gate in the north.

374
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,460
Mu Wufeng, target his qi center.

375
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:22,730
So what if you've invented the Trinity Array?

376
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,180
Arrays are rigid

377
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,770
while your foes aren't.

378
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,530
No matter how meticulous an array is,

379
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,940
there's always a way to dispel it.

380
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:30,980
How did you find a way

381
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,090
to dispel it

382
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,180
in such a short period?

383
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,490
I come from a place

384
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,050
famed for its swordsmanship.

385
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:37,220
Over there,

386
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,380
there are people

387
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,730
who study and invent swordsmanship.

388
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,180
There are also some

389
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,330
who focus on defeating the ways of the sword.

390
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,180
My father once said this before.

391
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:46,490
If one isn't the Sword Deity,

392
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:48,940
one doesn't have the right

393
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,730
to mention the word "sword"

394
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,860
in front of him.

395
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,570
The No-Sword City?

396
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,380
You actually came from there?

397
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,090
I didn't even use the Eighteen-Sword Array,

398
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:00,380
and you've already lost to me.

399
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,140
Did you think

400
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,290
that I only brought three of them with me?

401
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,220
The blossom side's up.

402
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,530
Lucky.

403
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:22,570
Qingyang.

404
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,220
You're late.

405
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,620
Sorry about that.

406
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:26,620
I couldn't allow Xuewei

407
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:27,860
to witness this battle.

408
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:28,900
If not,

409
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:29,620
she would definitely

410
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,490
defend Su Muyu with her life.

411
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:32,770
It took me a lot of effort

412
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,010
to send her elsewhere.

413
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:36,860
Lord Kui.

414
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,420
We meet again.

415
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:39,860
Qingyang.

416
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,810
Five ghosts from the Mu family,

417
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,380
Mu Bai,

418
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,330
and Mu Qingyang, huh?

419
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:45,700
It seems my only choice

420
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,090
is to risk it all.

421
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,660
Miss Bai,

422
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,140
I hope this will help you

423
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,700
to escape.

424
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,140
Su Muyu.

425
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:29,730
You won't be able

426
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,770
to withstand this array for long.

427
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,340
Darn it.

428
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,250
That darned fool, Su Changhe.

429
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,730
What a let-down.

430
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,770
Uncle Zhe, you're here.

431
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:45,620
That brat

432
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,420
merely put on a show at Spider's Nest.

433
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,770
He told me to keep guard over here.

434
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:50,660
And, I did find my target.

435
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:52,730
But the seven ghosts of the Mu family are here as well.

436
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,900
Uncle Zhe, what do you mean by that?

437
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,460
Did I say you could speak?

438
00:21:59,350 --> 00:21:59,960
You...

439
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,730
Uncle Zhe, you still like

440
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,490
to pretend as if you're someone powerful.

441
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:04,860
Do I even need to do that?

442
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,290
I'm powerful from the start.

443
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,090
Uncle Zhe, what do you plan to do next?

444
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,570
I plan

445
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,810
to come up with a way

446
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,420
to not kill you and complete my task at the same time.

447
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:15,180
I'm afraid that would be quite difficult.

448
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,010
Indeed.

449
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,620
But you see,

450
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,810
we've been through the muck together after all.

451
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,330
You mean hardships.

452
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,220
That's right.

453
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:29,730
That's why we need to be educated.

454
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,220
What about this?

455
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,620
Let's join hands

456
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,700
and deal with the ghosts for now.

457
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:36,810
After that,

458
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,660
we can settle

459
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,330
our own family affairs.

460
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,660
It seems at least one of them

461
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,090
is quite powerful.

462
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,220
Uncle Zhe, I've long heard of your name.

463
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:52,900
Even if I'm not,

464
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:54,460
I have to pretend to be powerful.

465
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,810
That'll make things difficult for me, you know?

466
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:01,570
What do you think?

467
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:02,860
Uncle Zhe, I'm willing

468
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,490
to fend off our foes together with you.

469
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,380
Sorry about this.

470
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:26,620
Muyu.

471
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:43,810
Miracle physician,

472
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,090
we meet again.

473
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,620
I, Su Zhe of the Su family,

474
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,090
am here to send the miracle physician to the afterlife

475
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,010
under the family head's order.

476
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,250
The Phantom Step, huh?

477
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,660
You scum.

478
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,090
Who exactly are you?

479
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,660
Me?

480
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:08,860
I'm Bai Hehuai,

481
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,380
the miracle physician of the Medicine King Valley.

482
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,700
Does your mother have the surname Wen?

483
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,420
The Phantom Step that you used

484
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:17,900
was the one I had modified.

485
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,460
And,

486
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,620
I only taught her the technique alone.

487
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,420
You're right.

488
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,770
So what?

489
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:25,380
Su Zhe,

490
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,070
what's the relationship

491
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,180
between you and the miracle physician?

492
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,090
That's none of your business.

493
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,250
Fine.

494
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:34,490
I'll stay out of it.

495
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:35,860
Come.

496
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,090
Do it!

497
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,090
All of you, scram!

498
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:43,920
Su Zhe,

499
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,900
whose side are you on?

500
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:49,290
Is your mother's name

501
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:50,980
Wen Luojin?

502
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,290
Is her nickname He?

503
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:53,980
That's right.

504
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,090
If so, you must be...

505
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:02,720
I haven't had the chance

506
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,730
to name you yet.

507
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,620
So, your name is...

508
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,810
Hehuai is the name my mother gave me.

509
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,660
It means "White cranes fly south,

510
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,250
gazing across the Huai River."

511
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,420
White cranes fly south, huh?

512
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,330
What an excellent name.

513
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,980
Your mother is truly gifted

514
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,140
when it comes to naming people.

515
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,180
Do you mean like the time

516
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,660
she called you Scum?

517
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,220
That's right.

518
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,660
Just like the time she called me Scum.

519
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,700
So, what she said was true all along.

520
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,180
Are you injured?

521
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:56,290
Su Zhe,

522
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,940
how dare you marry someone outside of our clan?

523
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:01,770
So what if I did?

524
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,730
You've broken the rules of our clan.

525
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,140
Both you and this illegitimate child

526
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,050
deserve to die!

527
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:08,980
Nonsense.

528
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,720
Blood River is trying

529
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,860
to get rid of the Patriarch now.

530
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:13,980
Now, you want to talk about the rules?

531
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,010
I just married

532
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:16,980
a beautiful woman outside of the clan

533
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,250
and got myself a precious daughter.

534
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,180
And now, you're saying

535
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,220
that I broke the rules?

536
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:20,980
What about you, then?

537
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,490
You tried to kill the Patriarch.

538
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:24,180
Executing you is too lenient

539
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:24,900
of a punishment for you.

540
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:25,900
You!

541
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:28,530
Muyu.

542
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,050
I never expected

543
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,180
to encounter my daughter here.

544
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:31,980
Do me a favor.

545
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,620
I wish to speak with my daughter.

546
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,420
I don't want any outsiders to bother us.

547
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:36,290
Understood.

548
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,900
This is truly a surprising reunion.

549
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,770
If only

550
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,860
your mother were here.

551
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,250
What? Can't I be here instead of my mother?

552
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,460
Of course you can.

553
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:56,940
It's just

554
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,380
that it would be better if my wife were here.

555
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,380
No matter how good your wife was,

556
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:00,490
you never

557
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,330
returned home anyway.

558
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,380
I didn't return home

559
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,460
for the sake of you guys.

560
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,420
I reviewed the Patriarch's memory.

561
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,330
He gave you freedom.

562
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,490
Yeah.

563
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,700
He removed my position as Kui

564
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,090
and granted me freedom.

565
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,140
After that, I traveled to the Wen Residence happily.

566
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:18,700
But your mother

567
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,700
still contracted a terminal disease.

568
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,620
Your grandfather

569
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,490
kicked me out of the family.

570
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:24,770
He said

571
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,620
that he would kill me

572
00:27:26,790 --> 00:27:27,660
if I approached you

573
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,810
or the Wen family.

574
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,570
Of course,

575
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,700
I wasn't afraid of him.

576
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,330
But after I gave it some thought,

577
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,180
I realized that I would only

578
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,730
put you in danger

579
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,730
if I stayed beside you.

580
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,620
Scum.

581
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:42,460
Good girl.

582
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,420
Scum is what your mother used to call me.

583
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,180
You have to call me your father somehow.

584
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,090
Scummy Father.

585
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,460
Fine, fine.

586
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,010
I suppose that'll do.

587
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,510
Will you still take my life?

588
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:54,150
It was just a misunderstanding.

589
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,570
And now,

590
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,040
the misunderstanding has been resolved.

591
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,980
Those who dare

592
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,830
to approach my daughter

593
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,530
will be killed immediately.

594
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:08,330
Uncle Zhe.

595
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,810
Don't you think your change of attitude

596
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,660
is too immediate?

597
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,770
Hey, we're a family.

598
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,180
Stop being so courteous.

599
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,460
Young Master,

600
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,730
it appears

601
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:17,940
that they're trying to join hands.

602
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,900
Since the Su family wants a fight,

603
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,620
we'll give it to them.

604
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:22,620
How could we back off

605
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,570
in front of them?

606
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,700
Su Zhe

607
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,420
was the strongest member of the Su family.

608
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,220
Young fellow of the Mu family,

609
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,530
you're wrong about something.

610
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,090
What do you mean?

611
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,660
I'm still

612
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,490
the strongest member of the family.

613
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:49,900
What kind of sinister technique is this?

614
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,620
That's the Mu family's Hollow Ghost Array.

615
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:52,570
Please be careful.

616
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,330
How dare they use such a sinister technique

617
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,330
when I have the Demon-Taming Staff?

618
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:56,980
Such audacity.

619
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:18,250
Let's go!

620
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,290
I dispelled their array

621
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,460
before they could set it up.

622
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,700
Uncle Zhe,

623
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,730
how come none of us

624
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,810
noticed how powerful you were

625
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,140
when we were dealing with

626
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:37,900
the Demonic Sect back then?

627
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,620
My daughter is here, you know?

628
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,770
Of course I have to show off a little bit.

629
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:44,660
It's not like I'm getting paid

630
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,810
for dealing with the Demonic Sect.

631
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,010
There's no need to go overboard.

632
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,180
Uncle Zhe, you still went easy on them.

633
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,620
Those two brats

634
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,860
are quite capable.

635
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:53,940
They managed to escape.

636
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:55,620
So,

637
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:57,290
since you two have been reunited,

638
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,900
should I go somewhere else

639
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,140
and give you two some time?

640
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:02,250
No need for that.

641
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,090
You can stand here.

642
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,620
If not, it'll be very awkward.

643
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,530
During such a critical moment,

644
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:10,620
I reunited with my daughter,

645
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,290
which was supposed to be a touching scene.

646
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,660
But you see,

647
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,900
I'm not very used to it.

648
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,050
We can talk while we travel, then.

649
00:30:17,510 --> 00:30:18,180
We don't have much time left.

650
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,840
We have to return to Spider's Nest as soon as possible.

651
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:21,220
- All right. - All right.

652
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,620
Su Zhe

653
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,730
is too powerful to be true.

654
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,050
He was once

655
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,420
one step away from being

656
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,250
the Patriarch after all.

657
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,570
Once I return, I'll report this

658
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,250
to Father immediately.

659
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,570
This time,

660
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,660
not only will we kill the Patriarch,

661
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:49,660
but we'll also get rid of

662
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,460
the Su family once and for all.

663
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:52,620
That's right.

664
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:55,860
You have a point.

665
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,770
However,

666
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,290
I think we still lack a convincing reason

667
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,620
to steel the family head's resolve

668
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:05,700
of dealing with

669
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,530
the Su family.

670
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:08,900
What do we need?

671
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,810
Your death.

672
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,460
Now,

673
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:21,220
all of the traps here have been disarmed.

674
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,250
Even the Spider Web, which was meant to ward off foes, was destroyed.

675
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,490
Now, I can only depend on you all

676
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,050
to defend the place.

677
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,860
- Sir. - Sir.

678
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:37,290
Good job, everyone.

679
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:42,290
Su Zhe?

680
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,860
Sir.

681
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:45,730
Have you

682
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,490
betrayed us?

683
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:48,700
How could you guys

684
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,490
have no confidence in me?

685
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:51,490
Do you guys think I'll defect to our enemies' side

686
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,980
while you guys are still keeping guard here?

687
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:57,290
Sir,

688
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,770
back then, joining the Spider's Nest

689
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,000
was a top honor.

690
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,050
But now,

691
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,250
our own clan members are after us.

692
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,730
It's as if we're sinners.

693
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,290
They're the ones at fault here.

694
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:09,090
It's not you guys.

695
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,570
Uncle Zhe is here to aid us.

696
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:14,380
As the previous Kui,

697
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:16,900
he's willing to be on our side.

698
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,810
Brat,

699
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,330
stop slapping labels on me.

700
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,220
However,

701
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,980
quelling the internal dispute of Blood River

702
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:28,810
is indeed a part of my duties.

703
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:30,330
Sir,

704
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,900
Miss Bai has already found a way

705
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,570
to cure the Patriarch of his condition.

706
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,140
If that's the case,

707
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,420
please tell her to perform the treatment.

708
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,730
However,

709
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:40,290
I cannot perform

710
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,330
the treatment.

711
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,460
But why?

712
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:47,250
If I perform it,

713
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,810
I will die.

714
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,530
That won't do.

715
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:54,940
Miracle physician.

716
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,570
Is your death

717
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,770
the only condition?

718
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,380
Or can other people

719
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,290
die on your behalf?

720
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,180
After your mother's passing,

721
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,460
I visited the Wen family in secret a few times.

722
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,010
I realized that you were missing.

723
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,800
I never expected you

724
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,330
to travel to the Medicine King Valley

725
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:31,980
just to study medicine.

726
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,180
So, you returned to our residence

727
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:34,770
plenty of times.

728
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,900
Have you never met Mother even once?

729
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:39,010
That's not true.

730
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,620
I was able to see her

731
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,090
on the night before her passing.

732
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,220
What?

733
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,090
That night, your grandfather

734
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,220
no longer obstructed me from seeing her.

735
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,290
He brought me to her side.

736
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,090
She died in my arms.

737
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,220
You were still young back then.

738
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,460
You were sleeping on the bed beside hers.

739
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:04,620
You slept soundly.

740
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,330
You slept until the next day.

741
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,090
But according to my grandfather,

742
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,740
you're a heartless person.

743
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:14,690
You deceived my mother's feelings.

744
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,820
That old fool...

745
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,420
But according to my mother,

746
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,980
you're not someone like that.

747
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:27,740
That's why

748
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:29,900
I wanted to find you

749
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,170
and ask you about it personally.

750
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,460
I was young back then.

751
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:35,940
I thought love

752
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:36,820
was above all else.

753
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,610
With my capabilities,

754
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:40,860
I was sure I could defy the rules of Blood River.

755
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:43,640
Initially, I almost coerced them

756
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,460
into agreeing with my conditions.

757
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,690
But when they heard

758
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,050
that the lady was the precious daughter of the Wen family,

759
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,610
even the Patriarch

760
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,820
was unwilling to help me out.

761
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,740
In the end, I failed.

762
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,010
Scummy Father,

763
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,090
will you come with me?

764
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,900
Of course.

765
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,170
Wherever my daughter goes, I'll follow.

766
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,490
If you say yes, I won't say no.

767
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,690
But aren't you defying the rules of Blood River

768
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:10,570
by doing so?

769
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,980
The world is in chaos now.

770
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,570
No one is going by the books.

771
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,530
If so, it's every man for himself.

772
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:19,690
All right.

773
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,690
Come with me to the south

774
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,260
once I'm done treating the Patriarch.

775
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,210
Sure,

776
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,610
but why?

777
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,380
My girl,

778
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,300
you're doing everything you can

779
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,460
to treat the Patriarch.

780
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:34,420
Are you doing it because

781
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,490
you fell for Su Muyu?

782
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,650
People say that Muyu

783
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,740
is the best-looking member of Blood River

784
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,780
in the past 100 years.

785
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,780
It seems that wasn't just a rumor.

786
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,010
However,

787
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,740
it isn't a good thing for a girl

788
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,420
to fall for a member of Blood River.

789
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,570
Scummy Father,

790
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:55,130
why are you insulting yourself as well?

791
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,130
If not, why are you doing this, then?

792
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,010
Of course it's because

793
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,380
I get paid for it.

794
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:06,570
Why did you take after your mother in that regard?

795
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,690
Money is the most important thing, you know?

796
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,050
However,

797
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,260
we should only leave

798
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,420
after the Patriarch has been cured.

799
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,650
If not,

800
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,860
all of my previous efforts

801
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,090
will go down the drain.

802
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,130
And,

803
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:19,690
since Blood River

804
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,860
is indebted to us,

805
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,900
I think they won't stop us from leaving.

806
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,050
I suppose they won't stop us

807
00:36:24,110 --> 00:36:24,780
from getting reunited.

808
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:34,340
Sir,

809
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,780
back then, joining Spider's Nest

810
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,010
was a top honor.

811
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:38,090
But now,

812
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:40,480
our own clan members are after us.

813
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,740
It's as if we're sinners.

814
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:46,170
Were my principles

815
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,210
the reasons why

816
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,610
my followers became wandering vagabonds

817
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,000
without anyone to depend on

818
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,300
in Blood River?

819
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:58,460
Lord Kui.

820
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:00,170
Si the Snake.

821
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,460
Lord Kui, sorry for interrupting your personal time.

822
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,400
Miss Bai and Uncle Zhe were having a discussion.

823
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,860
They wanted me to deliver the medicine to you.

824
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,420
Si the Snake,

825
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,650
don't leave yet.

826
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,050
Lord Kui, do you have any other instructions?

827
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,260
I suppose you were the newest member

828
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,490
to join

829
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,300
Spider's Nest, right?

830
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:31,780
The previous Si the Snake

831
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,380
died from a sudden illness a year ago.

832
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:35,940
Lord Kui, you chose me

833
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:36,690
among the other members.

834
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:38,860
That's right.

835
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,980
You wouldn't be roped into this conflict

836
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,420
had I not chosen you

837
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,460
back then.

838
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:48,940
You were implicated because of me.

839
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:54,010
Lord Kui,

840
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,460
may I ask you a question?

841
00:37:58,630 --> 00:37:59,090
Go ahead.

842
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,980
Is Blood River

843
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,610
an organization filled with crooks?

844
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,340
We kill for money, and we don't ask questions.

845
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,380
People turn pale

846
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,340
when they hear our name.

847
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,210
We've accumulated countless feuds and grudges

848
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,940
in the martial world and the imperial court.

849
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,450
And, plenty of people

850
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:21,930
want to get rid of us.

851
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,690
So, are we crooks?

852
00:38:26,030 --> 00:38:27,210
Of course we are.

853
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,650
But no one is born a willing crook.

854
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,570
I was born in Blood River's Mu family.

855
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,690
I've been learning how to kill people

856
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,210
ever since I could remember things.

857
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:44,340
We had no other choice

858
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,980
ever since we were born.

859
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,210
I thought joining Spider's Nest

860
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,570
was just an extension of this nightmare.

861
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,860
That was until I met you, Lord Kui.

862
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,050
You were the first person I met in Blood River

863
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,980
who harbored kind thoughts

864
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,900
and retained hope in your heart.

865
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,460
You were the one who told us

866
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,860
that joining Spider's Nest

867
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,090
could turn us into a protective shield

868
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:09,780
from a killing tool.

869
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,010
If so, I'm willing to die

870
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,210
for the sake of protecting others.

871
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:16,860
Thank you.

872
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,420
But Lord Kui, you're the one I wish to protect,

873
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,860
not the Patriarch.

874
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,650
I think it's the same for Chen the Dragon and the rest.

875
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,490
No one is born a willing crook.

876
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,650
Even if one does turn into a crook,

877
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,090
in our hearts, we still admire and long for

878
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,900
kind individuals.

879
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,260
Lord Kui,

880
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:42,690
if Blood River

881
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,050
represents the endless night,

882
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,820
you're the first ray of light

883
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,300
that I've encountered.

884
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,740
Lord Kui,

885
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,980
if the Patriarch dies,

886
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,530
please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

887
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,090
and inherit the title of Patriarch.

888
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,340
Lord Kui, please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

889
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,380
and inherit the title of Patriarch.
