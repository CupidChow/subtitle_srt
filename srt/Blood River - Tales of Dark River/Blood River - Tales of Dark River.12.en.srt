[Episode 12]

5
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,100
Master,

6
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,740
are you serious?

7
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,800
Kill them!

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,800
End it once and for all.

9
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,820
We won't even own up!

10
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,130
As you command.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,100
So, are you two

12
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:59,740
Su Changhe,

13
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,180
the current Patriarch of Blood River,

14
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,340
and Su Muyu, the head of the Su family?

15
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,620
This is interesting.

16
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,770
I know about you two.

17
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,180
So, the current Blood River

18
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,090
is led by two Nameless, huh?

19
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,620
How did you guys manage to achieve that?

20
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:22,650
This has nothing to do

21
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,420
with our trip here.

22
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,620
You actually utter such preposterous words

23
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:31,140
at Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

24
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,650
I can see why

25
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,140
you were a former Kui.

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:38,900
Kui

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,370
is a monster among men.

28
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,370
We travel on the same path.

29
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,060
So, you're the owner of Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

30
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,210
Please don't say something like that.

31
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:01,460
I am

32
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:03,530
but an accountant.

33
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,810
I'm not the owner

34
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,740
of the shop.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,420
You guys can view all the items you want.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,300
But please don't land me in trouble.

37
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,690
We dare not do so.

38
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,420
Your words are too heavy, shopkeeper.

39
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,860
Let's not waste any time, then.

40
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,690
Take us to

41
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,180
the treasures of Blood River.

42
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,690
It's been so long

43
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,590
since anyone

44
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,740
has visited that place.

45
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,860
Follow me.

46
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,100
This is the place.

47
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,010
The Yellow Springs Pawnshop

48
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,010
serves everyone in the martial world.

49
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,860
All clans have their treasures deposited in this place.

50
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,130
This is

51
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,570
the treasury of Blood River.

52
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:56,890
I have a question.

53
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,620
Even if we don't have this key,

54
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,540
we can get in easily by scaling the wall.

55
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,180
You think you can get in by scaling the wall?

56
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,570
Trust me.

57
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,620
There's no way you can leave in one piece

58
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,660
even if you're the Patriarch.

59
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:17,220
The Blood River's Spider's Nest...

60
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,330
So, you know about that?

61
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,330
It's nothing compared to the security here.

62
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,220
It's utterly inferior.

63
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,370
When you unlock the gate

64
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,780
with this key,

65
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,810
all the traps and arrays

66
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,860
will be dispelled.

67
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:53,980
Here.

68
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,180
Keep the key.

69
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,740
After this, you'll understand

70
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,450
how precious

71
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,690
this key is.

72
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,450
All right.

73
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:32,010
Is this Blood River's treasury?

74
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,570
Let me show you the unrefined treasures first.

75
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,250
How many people do they have to assassinate

76
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,420
for them to gather this amount of wealth?

77
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:00,490
Do the gold bricks here

78
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,100
look a lot to you?

79
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,250
Can you try to understand

80
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,130
the sufferings of the world for once?

81
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,100
Even if I combine the chest of silver taels

82
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,980
and the residence I own,

83
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,130
it's not even worth as much as this chest.

84
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:12,860
To think that this room

85
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,660
is filled to the brim with such gold bricks.

86
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,540
I understand now.

87
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,420
Blood River has stored all of their wealth

88
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,890
in this treasury.

89
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,660
If you think that's the only thing they stored here,

90
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,680
Master Su, you're underestimating

91
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,100
your Blood River predecessors.

92
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,300
Follow me.

93
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,300
Calm down.

94
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,860
There's no one inside.

95
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:56,780
But I feel sword qi inside.

96
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:57,930
This sword

97
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,810
is from the Sword Heart Tomb.

98
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,220
Follow me.

99
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,370
The Sword Heart Tomb,

100
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,890
the Villa of Famed Swords,

101
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,370
and the No-Sword City, which had been eradicated,

102
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,490
most of the famed swords stored here

103
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,250
all came from those three places.

104
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,690
Look over there.

105
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,180
The armors,

106
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,810
the long sabers,

107
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,890
and the bows and crossbows,

108
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,330
they were also created by

109
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,810
the famous Lu Clan of Shanbei.

110
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,330
Now, look at the Overlord Armor.

111
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:33,500
The world thought

112
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:36,140
that the Mu family had the only one of its kind.

113
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,690
In reality, Blood River

114
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,730
has the exact same set.

115
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,570
This room

116
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,060
is more valuable than the gold room.

117
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,900
If you view it from a monetary perspective,

118
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,660
naturally, this room

119
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,210
isn't as valuable as the room filled with gold bricks.

120
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,210
However, most of the weapons

121
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:01,730
couldn't even be bought with money.

122
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:02,730
Any one of them

123
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,210
is rare enough

124
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,140
that the martial world will kill

125
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,970
just to get their hands on them.

126
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,930
Shopkeeper Wang,

127
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,210
why are you feeling proud about it?

128
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,450
All of them belonged

129
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,210
to our organization, you know?

130
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,850
Ah.

131
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,090
I suppose I was too used to it.

132
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,180
Let's check out the remaining rooms.

133
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,570
After this,

134
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:25,540
you guys have to practice caution.

135
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,140
[Cosmic Duality]

136
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,620
[Drums and Thunder Gate]

137
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,420
I once joined Lei Qianting of the Lei Clan

138
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,210
to fend off

139
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:07,060
Ye Dingzhi's Killing Array.

140
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,450
He once mentioned

141
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,380
these names to me before.

142
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:11,930
All of these are

143
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:12,930
the strongest gunpowder in the Lei Clan.

144
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,420
I never expected Blood River

145
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:17,730
to possess

146
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,900
the gunpowder of the Lei Clan.

147
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,730
This room is filled with all of them

148
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,730
except for Kirin Fire Tooth,

149
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,810
which is

150
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:27,450
a top-tier gunpowder of the Lei Clan.

151
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,570
Therefore, you have to be extra careful

152
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,300
when unlocking this gate.

153
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,730
Its walls

154
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,300
and the gate itself

155
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,850
were forged with Liuhe Steel.

156
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,660
If not,

157
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:42,730
if the gunpowder inside

158
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,210
ignites at the same time by accident,

159
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,730
the entire pawnshop

160
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,900
will be levelled.

161
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,140
You have to be careful

162
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,500
when unlocking the next gate as well.

163
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,300
If you're careless,

164
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:56,690
the three of us

165
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,330
will be buried here.

166
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,450
That room

167
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:01,930
is filled with all sorts of mystical poison.

168
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,060
The Slumbering Serpent King

169
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:05,970
can also be found within.

170
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:08,810
It was reared with the deadly poison

171
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,570
used by families such as the Wen family

172
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,850
and the Tang Clan.

173
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,900
Right now, this serpent

174
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,900
is filled with deadly poison

175
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,730
that has no cure.

176
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,900
A single drop of its blood

177
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,540
could easily topple the strongest of

178
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,660
Heaven-level martial artists

179
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,970
who had 30 years of cultivation.

180
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,260
If I'm not mistaken,

181
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:34,380
the last room

182
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,810
should contain all sorts of hidden weapons.

183
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:41,210
You're very smart.

184
00:11:41,830 --> 00:11:43,380
If we take them to Blood River,

185
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,970
Blood River can turn into a full army anytime.

186
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,570
It'll be the strongest army in the world.

187
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,610
No one will be able to stop us.

188
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,570
Monsters will be slain.

189
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:01,780
Even deities

190
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:03,690
will be slain.

191
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,540
No wonder this sword

192
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,500
could cause such a huge commotion.

193
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,610
However, this is a pawnshop.

194
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,730
It's not a money house.

195
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,180
Smart boy.

196
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:16,930
Plenty of people

197
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:18,730
would've leapt out of joy

198
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,570
upon seeing

199
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,970
all the treasures here.

200
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,450
No one would care about

201
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,500
the details.

202
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,570
Since it's a pawnshop,

203
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,380
that means

204
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,420
we have to pay a price

205
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,900
in order to obtain all these treasures.

206
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,780
What's the price we have to pay?

207
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:33,690
There's no price for you two to pay.

208
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,180
At least

209
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,500
my pawnshop doesn't need anything from you two

210
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,570
at the moment.

211
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,540
I don't trust you.

212
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:44,610
No need to be distrustful.

213
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,850
Actually, you guys had started

214
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:49,300
to pay the price

215
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,610
long ago.

216
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:52,540
The people you'd killed

217
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,730
and the missions

218
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:54,660
you'd completed

219
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:57,180
were the price you paid

220
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,450
to possess these treasures.

221
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,140
After all,

222
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,420
half of the missions you took on

223
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,540
were assigned

224
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,420
by us.

225
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,970
Three Officials,

226
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,180
you may stop hiding.

227
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,020
We shall not do anything reckless

228
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,330
within the Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

229
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:21,540
Back then, Soul Reapers' Hall

230
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,540
[Earth Official, Soul Reapers' Hall]
had an audience with you two.

231
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,500
I said that we should've eliminated both of you.

232
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,090
However, I also said

233
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,260
that the danger of their existence

234
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,540
was precisely why

235
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,810
we need to keep them alive.

236
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:36,210
Judging from the final result,

237
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:38,420
perhaps eliminating them back then

238
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,540
[Heaven Official, Soul Reapers' Hall]
was the best choice.

239
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,020
We've been expecting you all.

240
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,300
We've seen the treasures of Blood River

241
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,380
and encounter you guys here.

242
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,060
Our trip wasn't in vain.

243
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,180
Hell Palm?

244
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:04,490
Let's retreat!

245
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,460
No one can master

246
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,660
such a technique overnight.

247
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,730
You cultivated it in secret long ago.

248
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:17,500
You guys'd better hurry

249
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,690
and put a hit on me.

250
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,610
Let's see

251
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,730
who else will obey your command.

252
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,090
The Yellow Springs Pawnshop

253
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,570
isn't a duel arena.

254
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,210
Don't worry.

255
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,970
We didn't come here

256
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,090
to fight.

257
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:36,450
Shopkeeper Wang,

258
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,450
I'm afraid you haven't delivered

259
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,970
the entirety of your message yet.

260
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,730
You see, you guys appeared

261
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,500
in the middle

262
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,420
of our conversation.

263
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,180
Patriarch,

264
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,180
let me finish our conversation.

265
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,570
The key you're holding

266
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,260
can only

267
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,450
unlock the rooms.

268
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,090
You need another token

269
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,420
if you wish to retrieve the treasures inside.

270
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,140
What token?

271
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,900
It's this.

272
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,460
[Yellow Springs]

273
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:07,450
That's the token.

274
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,090
You may unlock

275
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,210
the room with the key.

276
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:12,810
And, you may retrieve the treasures inside

277
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,090
with the token.

278
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,090
Both are essential if you wish to retrieve the treasures.

279
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,090
No wonder the Three Officials of Soul Reapers' Hall

280
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,380
could always

281
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,500
command the Three Families around.

282
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,090
I know what you're thinking.

283
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:33,730
You're thinking

284
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,730
that you should kill us

285
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,660
and steal the token

286
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,300
while the Yellow Springs Pawnshop

287
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,450
can't react in time.

288
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:42,450
Or,

289
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:43,780
you would kill us

290
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,900
and Shopkeeper Wang.

291
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:54,210
If anyone dares to fight here,

292
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,300
the guns

293
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:57,970
and mechanisms here

294
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,180
aren't just for show, you know?

295
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,690
I just need to press a button,

296
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,180
and the treasures of Blood River

297
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,050
will be reduced to ashes.

298
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,300
All of your efforts will go down the drain.

299
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,730
Everyone,

300
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,140
please consider this

301
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,730
carefully.

302
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,540
Three Officials,

303
00:16:27,470 --> 00:16:28,500
could it be that you all

304
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,380
have acknowledged me and Su Muyu

305
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,420
as the leaders of Blood River?

306
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:33,900
What do you think?

307
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,780
You guys neglected one thing.

308
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:43,810
What is it?

309
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,020
We do not acknowledge the Soul Reapers' Hall.

310
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:47,730
And, we will stop acknowledging

311
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,570
the existence of the Three Officials.

312
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,810
You guys won't be included

313
00:16:57,830 --> 00:16:58,730
in the new Blood River.

314
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,700
It seems we thought too highly of ourselves.

315
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:06,330
However, don't you guys think

316
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,260
that

317
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,740
you're oversimplifying things here?

318
00:17:12,870 --> 00:17:13,980
This is an invitation.

319
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,220
Could it be that one of you

320
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,460
is getting married?

321
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,700
Is this a wedding banquet invitation?

322
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,260
You guys said you wanted an answer

323
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,740
and you wish to form a new Blood River.

324
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:28,850
If so,

325
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,610
you guys need to see

326
00:17:31,410 --> 00:17:32,570
the man stated in the invitation.

327
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,130
What we wish to form

328
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:36,220
has nothing to do with other people.

329
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,460
So naive.

330
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:41,460
As long as that individual in Tianqi City wishes so,

331
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,260
he can

332
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,940
obliterate all of the treasures here

333
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,330
with just one thought of his.

334
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:47,810
I assume

335
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,570
you guys are in need

336
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:50,460
of the treasures here.

337
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,060
Who's that individual?

338
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,890
The ancestors of said person

339
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,780
formed Blood River 100 years ago.

340
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:01,500
As for the rest,

341
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,460
you guys will find out

342
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,090
once you arrive at Tianqi City.

343
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,540
Keep your Hell Palm in reserve.

344
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,170
To kill in the Yellow Springs Pawnshop...

345
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,060
Only a lunatic like you

346
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,090
would try something like that.

347
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,980
You were right.

348
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,130
They would find us

349
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,740
even if we didn't do anything.

350
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,260
If so, let's follow their will

351
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,060
and head to Tianqi City.

352
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,260
Let's return to Blood River,

353
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,090
summon the heads of the Three Families,

354
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:40,810
gather our elite forces,

355
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,500
and storm Tianqi City.

356
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,410
Negotiate a deal, huh?

357
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,020
Who wants to negotiate a deal with them?

358
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,700
What a joke.

359
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,810
This is a game of chess.

360
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,220
If we use all of our pieces from the start,

361
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:53,940
we'll lose the upper hand.

362
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,300
You do have a point.

363
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:58,170
They think that we'll follow their will blindly.

364
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,940
They're underestimating us.

365
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,410
Therefore, right now, we have to make it as if

366
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,940
we kept the appointment

367
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,220
but didn't at the same time.

368
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,610
Indeed.

369
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,260
Therefore,

370
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,130
I shall head there alone.

371
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,570
You shall enter the fray alone.

372
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,810
I shall join the fray after that

373
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,540
and launch a surprise attack.

374
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,060
Return to Blood River.

375
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,220
I shall deliver the intel I gathered

376
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,780
at Tianqi City to you.

377
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,780
We need to form a foolproof plan.

378
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,740
Cross Blood River and you reach the Other Shore.

379
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,570
This should be

380
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:26,810
the last obstacle

381
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,780

From now on,

570
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,890
do not utter such preposterous words

571
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,130
again.

572
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,370
They didn't want to be the Umbrella Ghost

573
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,500
and the Undertaker.

574
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,130
They merely want to be themselves.

575
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:45,410
Actually, I'm the same.

576
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,330
I only wish to be Su Henshui,

577
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,980
not the Water Official.

578
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,850
Whose letter is this?

579
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,260
It's from your favorite Su Muyu.

580
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,020
He wants me to complete a request.

581
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,780
You guys said you would arrive on the second day.

582
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,060
I've been waiting for a few days.

583
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,500
You guys were the one who decided on that date.

584
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,170
We will come anytime

585
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,850
we like.

586
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,700
Sect Leader is inviting you

587
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,610
to a banquet that will be held in three days.

588
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,300
Attend it in secret.

589
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,260
Do not let anyone find out.

590
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:11,980
Sir,

591
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,740
why did you bring me here?

592
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,090
Are we here

593
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,260
to retrieve the treasures in Yellow Springs Pawnshop?

594
00:31:19,350 --> 00:31:20,260
I'm bringing you to see someone.

595
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,370
Who is it?

596
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,020
The Ferryman.

597
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,410
Mister, you've returned.

598
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,410
Hongying,

599
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,090
you ferry people every day.

600
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,850
How much is Yellow Springs Pawnshop paying you?

601
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,460
Mister,

602
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,650
to think that you still remember my name.

603
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:45,850
I ferry people here every day

604
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:47,850
without charging a single cent.

605
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,980
I'm merely waiting for my destined one to come.

606
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,460
If so, can the guy beside me

607
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,260
be your destined one, then?

608
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,020
I...

609
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,300
Sir,

610
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:01,130
are you going to sell me off?

611
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,700
Mister, do you know

612
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,220
what I meant when I uttered the phrase

613
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:08,940
"destined one"?

614
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:10,850
Your name is Hongying.

615
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,410
The surname Hong is very rare.

616
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,460
Is that your surname?

617
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,300
I do not have

618
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,300
a surname.

619
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,500
From today onward, you shall have one.

620
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,370
Your surname will be Mu.

621
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,020
He's the head of the Mu family.

622
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,220
That's what I meant by saying that he's your destined one.

623
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,170
Patriarch of Blood River,

624
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,570
are you trying to steal one of my men?

625
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,610
You can pick and choose

626
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:41,770
any items in the room

627
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,980
that will amount to the same value as her.

628
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,220
But now,

629
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,500
Hongying is mine.

630
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:47,300
The token they gave you

631
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,220
was a fake.

632
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,170
The Shadow Sect

633
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,940
has the real deal.

634
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,060
If so, I will owe you for now.

635
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:56,980
You may choose your items

636
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:58,940
once I retrieve the token.

637
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,780
It's a deal.

638
00:33:05,170 --> 00:33:05,740
Miss,

639
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:07,130
from today onward,

640
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,060
you're a member of the Mu family.

641
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:13,820
[Zhe]

642
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,220
It turns out that the enemy of Shadow Sect

643
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,850
is Xiao Ruofeng, the Prince of Langya.

644
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,090
The Four Guardians of Tianqi City and the Inner Security Division,

645
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,220
which were founded by him,

646
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,810
robbed Shadow Sect of their power.

647
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:28,460
Therefore, they gave

648
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,890
the Three Officials an order.

649
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,090
They instructed the Patriarch

650
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,300
to deal with Second Master Tang

651
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:35,260
to lure Tang Lianyue

652
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,260
out of Tianqi City.

653
00:33:36,630 --> 00:33:37,610
After that, they used us

654
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:38,890
to get rid of Tang Lianyue,

655
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:41,060
eliminating a powerful foe of theirs in the process.

656
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,090
This muddy affair in Tianqi City

657
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,940
is much more troublesome than I thought.

658
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,370
Given your identity,

659
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,170
you had to slip away from that place day after day.

660
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,370
Aren't you afraid that the Prince of Langya

661
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,220
might find out about you?

662
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,850
Many people knew

663
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,570
that I wasn't willing to remain at the imperial mausoleum.

664
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,330
If I kept watch

665
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,700
over the mausoleum

666
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,060
without doing anything,

667
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,290
I assume

668
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,690
[Zhuo Qing, Former Great Eunuch]
they need to be worried about that.

669
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:15,020
Speaking of which,

670
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:16,420
Sect Leader,

671
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:18,290
how's that pledge of loyalty

672
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,900
coming lately?

673
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:21,730
Just tell First Prince

674
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,770
to enjoy the show.

675
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,980
I will use Blood River

676
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,460
to eliminate

677
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,060
our common foe.

678
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,820
Excellent.

679
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:36,380
It's good that you're confident.

680
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:41,060
When will we meet the Umbrella Ghost?

681
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,090
He will attend the banquet

682
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,940
in three days.

683
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,420
If so, the sword qi that's approaching us,

684
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,690
who does it belong to?

685
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,610
He has an immense sword qi,

686
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,460
yet his killing intent is well-hidden.

687
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:05,170
A ferocious sword

688
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,610
that will devour its wielder

689
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,130
if he doesn't keep it in check...

690
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:11,250
Su Muyu!

691
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,290
How dare you?

692
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,500
So, you are Su Muyu.

693
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,090
Excellent.

694
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,570
We were supposed to meet in three days.

695
00:35:24,110 --> 00:35:25,290
But you're here today.

696
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,690
Why is that the case?

697
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,340
The goal of this trip

698
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:33,210
wasn't to let Shadow Sect seek out Blood River.

699
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,460
It's the opposite.

700
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,570
You wish to meet me in three days.

701
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:38,900
However, I wish to meet you

702
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,540
today.

703
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,090
You're quite different from the tales

704
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:44,610
I've heard about you.

705
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,940
Care to explain yourself?

706
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,770
Rumor has it that Su Muyu

707
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,130
resembled a swordsman

708
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,980
more than an assassin.

709
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:54,980
He had a gentle personality,

710
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,500
and he treated everyone with respect.

711
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,500
But when you came,

712
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,020
you drew your sword.

713
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,210
When you spoke,

714
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,210
you wanted to rob the host of his power.

715
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,210
Now, there are no longer any assassins left in Blood River.

716
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:09,900
As the head of the Su family,

717
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:12,170
I have to adopt a stronger attitude.

718
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,250
However, Sect Leader Yi, this is your residence after all.

719
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,020
I'm a guest.

720
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:18,610
It's indeed rude of me

721
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,130
to show up unannounced.

722
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:22,290
If you don't welcome me,

723
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,570
I can leave right now.

724
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,210
In three days,

725
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,250
you would've been able to enjoy

726
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,610
the Jiantian Feast prepared by Zhaiyue Restaurant.

727
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,170
What a shame.

728
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,020
Since

729
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,020
you're already here,

730
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,730
I have to host you somehow.

731
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:39,610
Crow.

732
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,380
Yes, sir.

733
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,690
Tell the kitchen

734
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,770
to prepare some dishes for us.

735
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:44,900
I need to have a chat

736
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,610
with Master Su.

737
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,020
Thank you.

738
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,170
Come.

739
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,610
Mr. Su,

740
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:57,290
please.

741
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,170
Mr. Su, I'm sure you're still perplexed.

742
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:06,770
Blood River and Shadow Sect

743
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,610
weren't related from the start.

744
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,020
However,

745
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:11,420
now, it seems

746
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:14,210
we're bound by countless invisible threads.

747
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,340
Soul Reapers' Hall

748
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,210
was the one that assigned all missions to Blood River.

749
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:20,780
We always thought

750
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,030
that someone in the martial world put a huge bounty on their targets

751
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:25,170
and hired Soul Reapers' Hall to put a hit on them.

752
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,420
I never expected Shadow Sect to be the one assigning our missions to us.

753
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,900
Speaking of that,

754
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,980
we need to trace back to the time

755
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,900
when Beili had first established its own state.

756
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,130
This is

757
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,420
a long stretch of history.

758
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:45,340
[Yi's Residence]

759
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,170
However, Su Changhe and I, who lead

760
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,460
the current Blood River,

761
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,860
have nothing to do

762
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,380
with the Shadow Guards that existed centuries ago.

763
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:57,570
I know.

764
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,060
You guys are Nameless.

765
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,340
You two aren't connected

766
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,420
to the lineage of Blood River.

767
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:04,540
You're wrong.

768
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,690
The current Blood River

769
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,380
is a true family.

770
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,980
And, we will choose our own paths.

771
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,170
You guys are too young.

772
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,770
It seems you guys don't know anything.

773
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:23,210
For example,

774
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,860
Wanjuan Tower.

775
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,340
Wanjuan Tower?

776
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,250
That's right.

777
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,020
Wanjuan Tower.

778
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:33,540
For the past few centuries,

779
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,570
Blood River was under Shadow Sect.

780
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,090
The address of Blood River,

781
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,210
which ordinary people could never locate,

782
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,020
Spider's Nests that were spread throughout

783
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,940
the world,

784
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,250
your true identities,

785
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,980
the martial arts you use, your weaknesses,

786
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,650
and your portraits

787
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:56,500
were all kept within the Shadow Sect.

788
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:58,820
If you attempt to betray us,

789
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,570
all this information

790
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,020
will surface in the martial world.

791
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:06,060
You all are assassins who've slain countless people.

792
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,340
When we look around,

793
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,780
the martial world

794
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,420
is filled with your sworn enemies.

795
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,540
By that time,

796
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,500
all of you

797
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,980
will be hunted down.

798
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,170
I know.

799
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,340
You guys will surely think

800
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,690
that the current Shadow Sect

801
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,290
only has an empty reputation

802
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,730
of an organization led by the emperor's father-in-law.

803
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,420
You think that we had fallen from grace

804
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,770
in Tianqi City.

805
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,420
You think that we're even inferior to Blood River.

806
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,090
What gives us the right

807
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,130
to be the master of Blood River?

808
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,570
However,

809
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,020
as long as I'm willing,

810
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,860
I can eradicate Blood River.

811
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,900
You guys wish to establish a new Blood River

812
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,060
and start from scratch.

813
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,420
You see,

814
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,500
it's good for youngsters to have lofty aspirations.

815
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,460
But sometimes,

816
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,900
they should stop

817
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,340
and assess their abilities first.

818
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,200
Do you guys truly think

819
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,690
that you can resist the years of control

820
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:22,770
of the Shadow Sect

821
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:25,940
with the likes of you?

822
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:31,340
Tell me your condition.

823
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,940
I allowed you guys to come to Tianqi City

824
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,690
because I needed you all to kill someone for me.

825
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:53,900
Who is it?

826
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,460
The Prince of Langya,

827
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:59,060
Xiao Ruofeng.

828
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,500
Blood River is the shadow that handles the martial world

829
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,090
on the Xiao imperial line's behalf.

830
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,770
The Shadow Sect

831
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,570
is the shadow that protects Tianqi City

832
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,900
in the dark.

833
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:15,980
If so, what happens in Tianqi City

834
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,130
should be unrelated to Blood River.

835
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,940
The Prince of Langya is a member of the Xiao imperial line.

836
00:41:21,630 --> 00:41:22,540
Assassinating him

837
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:26,170
would mean going against the beliefs of both organizations.

838
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,090
This isn't the duty of Shadow Sect.

839
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:31,540
You're just doing this for your own desire.

840
00:41:35,190 --> 00:41:36,130
Since that's the case,

841
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,940
you must offer something in exchange.

842
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,570
What do you

843
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,770
desire?

844
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,020
Everything you said just now

845
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,690
must vanish

846
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:46,940
from the world entirely.

847
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,090
From now on, Blood River

848
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,860
and Shadow Sect will be unrelated.

849
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,690
It seems

850
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,900
that's the end of our negotiation.

851
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:02,610
Crow,

852
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,170
see our guest off.

853
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,460
Sir, you know the best

854
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:21,130
about the task

855
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,690
you wish to assign to us.

856
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,250
The Prince of Langya has the most military strength in Beili.

857
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:37,610
Even the emperor

858
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,170
has to show him respect in the imperial court.

859
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:41,650
In the martial world,

860
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,420
he's known as the senior brother of Baili Dongjun,

861
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:44,980
the lord of Xueyue City.

862
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:47,610
If I kill him,

863
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,980
I'll offend the entire world.

864
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,900
I don't think

865
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,900
you have the right to negotiate a deal with me.

866
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,380
If word of Blood River spreads

867
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:17,730
across the jianghu,

868
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:20,340
then we, with nowhere to go,

869
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,540
will make Tianqi City

870
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,980
our first stop.

871
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,540
Maybe the world won't have us,

872
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,060
but we'll...

873
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,980
erase the Shadow Sect from this world.
