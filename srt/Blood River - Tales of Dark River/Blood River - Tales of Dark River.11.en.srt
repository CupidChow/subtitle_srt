00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:48,850
Miracle physician,

7
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,130
you must have been hungry.

8
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,130
I'll cook.

9
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,130
Well...

10
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,290
No need.

11
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,410
I...

12
00:01:59,070 --> 00:01:59,740
I'm not hungry.

13
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,570
You worked all day. How could you not be?

14
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,810
Today,

15
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,540
I even asked Miss Wang next door.

16
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,260
Turns out the dish I made yesterday

17
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,410
was missing one spice.

18
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,690
Fix that will improve the taste.

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,320
Su Muyu,

20
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,750
you go out every day,

21
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,700
walk around,

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,760
pick up groceries,

23
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,700
help me choose herbs,

24
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,400
and decoct them.

25
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,730
That's already a lot.

26
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,690
You don't need to cook as well.

27
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:24,060
You work harder every day.

28
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:25,170
As for the chores,

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,290
just leave them to me.

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,980
Su Muyu.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,450
How can you

32
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:56,540
master the sword...

33
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,500
Because...

34
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,450
...yet fail

35
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,380
at cooking noodles?

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,060
I'm not eating.

37
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:12,890
Fine.

38
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,600
It's your effort, after all.

39
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,170
When I go out tomorrow,

40
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,690
I'll buy flower cakes to make it up to you.

41
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,130
And ask Miss Wang again...

42
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,850
Su Muyu,

43
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,730
can you

44
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,340
promise me one thing?

45
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,410
All right. What is it?

46
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,220
Promise me

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,100
to spare Miss Wang and spare me.

48
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:41,010
Try a few more times,

49
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,540
I'll get it right.

50
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:44,380
Same with sword practice.

51
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:45,940
As for this bowl of noodles,

52
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,500
you'd better not eat it yet.

53
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:49,940
Wait till tomorrow.

54
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,940
Everyone in the martial world

55
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:52,820
trains with a sword,

56
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,730
yet only a few become Sword Deities.

57
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,540
There are so many physicians,

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,220
why am I the miracle physician?

59
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,290
Because of talent.

60
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,570
Everyone's born with different gifts.

61
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,170
Su Muyu,

62
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,040
some things

63
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,570
can't be forced.

64
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,780
When I first learned the sword,

65
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,170
I was clumsy too.

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,930
I can't talk you out of it, huh?

67
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:30,580
What's that?

68
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,850
They're chickens Mrs. Chen sent over.

69
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,930
She knows I'm learning to cook from Miss Wang,

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,340
so she sent them for practice.

71
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,580
Since fate points the way,

72
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,730
allow me to show a little skill.

73
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,050
I learned this from my master,

74
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:55,570
Herbal Chicken Stew.

75
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,050
How is it?

76
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,980
Smells amazing!

77
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:00,730
It tastes even better.

78
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:05,980
Go on, try.

79
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:07,140
Okay.

80
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,490
I didn't expect you to be such a good cook.

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,370
These days,

82
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,780
I've really made a fool of myself.

83
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,290
You flatter me.

84
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm only good

85
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,730
at this one dish.

86
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,540
When I was little,

87
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,540
my master taught it to me.

88
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,140
But later, every time I made it,

89
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,610
I'd think of him.

90
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,100
And every time I did,

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,730
I felt so sad,

92
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,980
so I stopped making it.

93
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,330
Never thought

94
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,680
after all these years,

95
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,590
my cooking

96
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,860
would still be this good.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,170
Sorry about that, miracle physician.

98
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,660
That was all when I was a kid.

99
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:07,370
I'm grown now.

100
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,930
I'm not hung up on something so small.

101
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,020
Besides, death

102
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,610
is just part of life.

103
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,460
Even a miracle physician

104
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:21,370
can't prevent it.

105
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:25,780
While I was cooking just now,

106
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,410
I realized

107
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,460
I wasn't sad anymore.

108
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,340
Thinking of him again,

109
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,290
my heart

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,730
felt warm.

111
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,410
So this is the famous Flower Cake.

112
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,330
It's delicious!

113
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,100
Su Muyu,

114
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,490
quick, have a piece!

116
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,730
We've been waiting forever.

117
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:15,780
It's been ages.

118
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,760
Why isn't he out yet?

119
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,430
The young master hasn't come out today?

120
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,250
- He's out! - He's out!

121
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,860
- He's out! - I'm instantly cured!

122
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,270
You're pregnant.

123
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,240
Pregnant...

124
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:29,020
What?

125
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,440
I'm not even married yet.

126
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,910
Kidding.

127
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:34,870
Your liver fire

128
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,580

129

Go line up over there.

some flower tea

132

please come earlier tomorrow.

looks quite handsome too!

Yeah!

145

He's a catch!

146
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,220
Look at his brows and eyes...

147
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:16,930
It's been a long time.

148
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:17,810
Yeah.

Thick brows, big eyes...

150

151

Today...

152
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,180
no more consults.

153
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,490
Keep the tokens you got today.

154
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,420
Come back tomorrow and queue in order.

155
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,130
Why stop so early today?

156

This fellow here

157
00:08:32,790 --> 00:08:33,930
came for a consult.

158
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,020
He has a serious infection.

159
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,500
If you don't leave now,

160
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,420
you might catch it,

161
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,540
and that would be bad.

162
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,450
Oh...

163
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,850
why didn't you say it earlier!

164
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,090
Let's leave!

165
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,550
- Move! - Go!

166
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,610
She should've said so!

167
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,570
This is the current dean of Shanqian Academy,

168
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,020
Xie Xuan.

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,140
The Scholar-Sword Deity!

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,020
I came to this city to read

171
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,570
and sensed

172
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,570
there's a most unusual guest,

173
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,210
[Xie Xuan, Scholar-Sword Deity]
so I paid a visit here.

174
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:08,570
You're the one

175
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,730
who never trained with a sword,

176
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,850
yet the first time you drew,

177
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,100
you looked every inch a Sword Deity,

178
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:13,760
Xie Xuan?

179
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,570
An honor at last!

180
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:17,450
I'm Bai Hehuai,

181
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,690
miracle physician of Medicine King Valley,

182
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,780
senior to Xin Baicao.

183
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,570
You're Mr. Xin's senior?

184
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:24,930
Right.

185
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,090
Fair and square!

186
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,540
I'm of the same generation as Sikong Changfeng.

187
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,330
He's half a disciple

188
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:30,970
of Mr. Xin.

189
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:33,210
So you're two ranks above me.

190
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,060
I should call you grand-master.

191
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:36,930
My apologies.

192
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,810
Greetings, Physician Bai.

193
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:40,850
So...

194
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,660
I'm that remarkable?

195
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,730
Didn't expect to meet you

196
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,610
in Nan'an City.

197
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,660
Did you visit here

198
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,970
just to meet me?

199
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,730
I wanted to know why you're in Nan'an City.

200
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,730
It's not to kill.

201
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,730
That's all I needed to know.

202
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,610
Since we've met,

203
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:03,610
why not stay for a meal?

204
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:11,260
Nice to see you smile at last.

205
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:25,380
Sir,

206
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,020
enjoy your meal.

207
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:31,810
Miss,

208
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,300
try these fresh-baked flower cakes.

209
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,850
You look new around here.

210
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,210
Are you here to sightsee?

211
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:41,380
No.

212
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:42,690
I'm looking for someone.

213
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,260
Oh, looking for someone?

214
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:46,900
Enjoy your meal.

215
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,330
They say, "I pick fresh every day;

216
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,570
good cooking has its secrets."

217
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,380
Cooking's like swordwork:

218
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,140
miss one move,

219
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,260
and nothing flows.

220
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:46,570
What you make

221
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,850
won't look good,

222
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,900
smell good,

223
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,020
or taste good.

224
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,690
Smells amazing!

225
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,140
Didn't expect you

226
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,660
to be a kitchen deity too!

227
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,690
I'm no kitchen deity.

228
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:09,850
I just read many recipes,

229
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,300
traveled many lands,

230
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,690
and tasted many dishes,

231
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,450
so I learned to cook plenty too.

232
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,260
The way of cooking

233
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,570
runs deep.

234
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,730
I'd like to hear more.

235
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:22,610
Su Muyu,

236
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,060
Xie Xuan...

237
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,500
You two changed careers?

238
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:28,610
City Lord Li.

239
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,140
City Lord?

240
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,570
City Lord...

241
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,900
This young lady

242
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,480
is Xueyue City's Second City Lord,

243
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,330
Li Hanyi,

244
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,660
You're Sword Deity Xueyue?

245
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,330
You must be

246
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,570
the miracle physician

247
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,380
who treated Blood River's Patriarch.

248
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,850
Didn't expect you to be so young.

249
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,260
And you're the one

250
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,140
who created the Floral Sword Art,

251
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,140
calling flowers with a single stroke,

252
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,090
Sword Deity Xueyue?

253
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:02,500
I am.

254
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,180
And the sword in your hand

255
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,660
is the one kept in Kunlun

256
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,730
that can freeze the sunset with a single slash,

257
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,020
the coldest sword under heaven,

258
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,090
Froststeel?

259
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,970
How good a sword is

260
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,090
depends on who holds it.

261
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,900
Why does this scene feel familiar?

262
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,810
The legendary Floral Sword Art

263
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,090
must be a stunning sight.

264
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,610
Care to let me see it?

265
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:33,330
Miracle physician,

266
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,420
Sword Deities don't draw lightly.

267
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:36,970
When they do,

268
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,060
the city's swept in snow.

269
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:40,690
True.

270
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,850
I don't draw lightly.

271
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,900
But meeting you...

272
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,210
I might draw at any time.

273
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,730
Aren't you two

274
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,300
friends?

275
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,970
We once fought side by side

276
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,300
against the Demonic Sect's leader, Ye Dingzhi.

277
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,420
But we're hardly friends.

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,810
In the jianghu,

279
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,020
no one wants

280
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:11,970
to be Blood River's enemy,

281
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,610
nor does anyone

282
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,500
want to be Blood River's friend.

283
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,780
City Lord Li and I

284
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,900
are quite close.

285
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,850
I'm senior to Xin Baicao of Medicine King Valley.

286
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,300
Your Third City Lord,

287
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,420
Sikong Changfeng,

288
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,450
was once trained at the Medicine King Valley.

289
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,420
He counts as half a disciple of Baicao.

290
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,780
So,

291
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,230
Sikong Changfeng

292
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,610
should call me grand-master.

293
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,730
You really put it to use.

294
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,330
Didn't expect someone so young

295
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,330
to be Medicine King's senior.

296
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,930
The real deal!

297
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,730
My apologies.

298
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:54,610
Not at all.

299
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,180
My rank's just too high,

300
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:57,540
so everyone thinks

301
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,810
I'm ancient.

302
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,850
Truth is,

303
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:02,600
my mother

304
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,300
is the blood sister of Wen Luoyu,

305
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,090
the Heir Consort of the Marquis of Zhenxi.

306
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,970
Your First City Lord,

307
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:09,260
Baili Dongjun,

308
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,570
is my cousin!

309
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,300
My senior is your cousin?

310
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,210
We're family.

311
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,660
Stay here

312
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,610
and eat with us.

313
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:19,500
Come!

314
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,090
Smells great.

315
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,260
You hold your liquor, miracle physician.

316
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,210
Naturally, bottomless.

317
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,260
And this wine

318
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:48,930
is really good,

319
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,500
with a hint of peach blossom,

320
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,610
and a touch of sweetness.

321
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,090
The peach note...

322
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,570
A friend from Wangchengshan Sect left it

323
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,970
after a consult.

324
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,140
It was brewed by his junior, the sect leader.

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,420
That junior's swordwork

326
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,260
is now legendary

327
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,380
across the jianghu nowadays.

328
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,000
True,

329
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,610
I haven't seen his swordplay.

330
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,090
But his wine

331
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,260
is indeed superb.

332
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,140
How's the wine?

333
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,570
Taste good?

334
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:26,300
It's great.

335
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,610
Miss Li,

336
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:32,180
you're stunning,

337
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:33,930
yet cold as frost.

338
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,140
Nothing seems

339
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,450
to move you.

340
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,060
I thought

341
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,500
you'd simply say "not bad,"

342
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,090
didn't expect outright praise.

343
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,720
Looks like this wine

344
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,760
really is good.

345
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,020
Dishes are all here.

346
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,420
Let's eat.

347
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,380
[Healing Hands]

348
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,300
I know why you're here, Miss Li.

349
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,130
Rest easy.

350
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,130
Blood River has no agenda in Nan'an.

351
00:17:08,590 --> 00:17:10,220
But the miracle physician's place in Qiantang City

352
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:10,890
was exposed,

353
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,980
so she moved to Nan'an,

354
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:13,850
As for me,

355
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:15,700
I needed treatment,

356
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,940
so I came along.

357
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,650
That day in Jiuxiao City,

358
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,020
I thought

359
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,850
even if you couldn't disband Blood River,

360
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,370
you'd be

361
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,170
the new Patriarch.

362
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,260
But in the end,

363
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,460
Su Changhe became Patriarch,

364
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,740
and you

365
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,980
came to Nan'an,

366
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,220
far from Blood River.

367
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,300
That's not the ending

368
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,330
Su Changhe promised me,

369
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,740
and it's a very, very bad one.

370
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,220
Your bias against Changhe

371
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,300
still runs deep.

372
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,610
Bias?

373
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,330
Xie Xuan said

374
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,220
your dear brother

375
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,940
may not be the worst man alive,

376
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,700
but he's surely

377
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,170
the most annoying.

378
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:06,130
His thick skin

379
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,890
is rare in this world,

380
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:09,940
a "classic" for the ages.

381
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,780
A "classic" for the ages? Seriously?

382
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:17,370
You're a bit drunk.

383
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,330
Those were Xie Xuan's exact words.

384
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,130
I only repeated them.

385
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,610
Didn't expect Sword Deity Xueyue

386
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,410
to speak ill behind someone's back.

387
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,940
Worse,

388
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,220
the other one badmouthing me

389
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,610
seems to be here too.

390
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,130
A brief spar

391
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,740
is more than enough.

392
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:55,740
We meet again.

393
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,940
I should call you Patriarch now.

394
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,980
You flatter me.

395
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,850
Just call me Changhe,

396
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,130
much friendlier.

397
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,650
You deceived me.

398
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,330
I've decided to kill you here.

399
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:11,570
I never liked Changfeng's choice.

400
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,540
An outfit like Blood River

401
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,020
has no place in the jianghu.

402
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,130
With Su Muyu as Patriarch, it could stand.

403
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,810
If I took over, you'd tear it out by the roots?

404
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,700
Looks like my reputation

405
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,780
really is that bad.

406
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,890
Your codename is your reputation:

407
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,890
the Undertaker.

408
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,850
Does the word

409
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,810
sound lucky to you?

410
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,510
The old Blood River

411
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:39,810
might not have needed to exist,

412
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,260
but we want to build a new Blood River.

413
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,890
A new Blood River?

414
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,260
One that doesn't live by killing,

415
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,330
no longer in the shadows,

416
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,740
yet walks beneath the jianghu.

417
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,460
How do you plan to change?

418
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,060
That's our affair.

419
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:57,890
What,

420
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,330
Xueyue City, the foremost city of the jianghu,

421
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,410
has grown so overbearing

422
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,170
it won't allow

423
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,460
any other sects to exist?

424
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,220
I couldn't be bothered to meddle,

425
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,810
nor do I want to.

426
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,300
I only promised Changfeng.

427
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:10,610
Alright.

428
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,330
Take it as your promise to me.

429
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,300
If the Blood River to come

430
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,020
is the same as before...

431
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,300
Su Changhe,

432
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,130
keep your head safe,

433
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,700
and I'll come take it.

434
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,570
What about Su Muyu's head?

435
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,220
You won't take his?

436
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,260
Why only mine?

437
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,890
I'll take his too.

438
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,980
Since you bookworm are here,

439
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,780
no need for me to linger.

440
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,220
Some person is an eyesore.

441
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,460
I'll come fight you another time.

442
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,460
Oh, she came to fight me?

443
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:00,130
Then let's not meet again.

444
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,060
What a fierce woman!

445
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,940
I've heard Blood River's Umbrella Ghost

446
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,130
and the Undertaker are close friends.

447
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,780
I never quite understood it.

448
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,330
You and he

449
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,980
seem to walk different paths.

450
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,330
But seeing you today,

451
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,170
a passage came to mind,

452
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:19,850
and I understand a little now.

453
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:21,460
What passage?

454
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,890
"Hearing snow outside the window,

455
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,650
so near, yet so far."

456
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,400
You mean the two of us

457
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,610
are close in distance,

458
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,780
yet worlds apart?

459
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:34,500
No.

460
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,330
The nearness and distance between you

461
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,810
depend on a single thought.

462
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,700
I hope your nearness this time

463
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,260
lasts till the end.

464
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,370
The meal's over.

465
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,650
The wine's gone.

466
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,650
She's said what needed saying.

467
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,130
I should go too.

468
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,260
Do you know why?

469
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,330
Back then, several family heads

470
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:10,570
ignored Blood River's rules,

471
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,500
yet had to seize the Dormant Dragon Sword

472
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,020
before daring to claim the Patriarch's title.

473
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,330
There must be something odd about the sword.

474
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,980
Something hidden in the hilt.

475
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:31,460
Yellow Springs Pawnshop...

476
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,300
The world's most secret bank,

477
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:36,370
and the most secret assassin guild...

478
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,540
What binds them?

479
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,940
All I know is,

480
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,950
the pawnshop keeps good things,

481
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,330
very, very good things,

482
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,130
worth a look.

483
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:55,020
We'll lead Blood River to the other shore

484
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:56,740
and erase its bloody reputation.

485
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,410
Stop living by the kill,

486
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,980
and found a sect in the light.

487
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,500
And the most basic, most important thing...

488
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,220
do you know what it is?

489
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,220
What?

490
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:08,940
Money, Su Muyu!

491
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,260
All the years of Blood River's funds

492
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,020
aren't at our base.

493
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:12,700
Then where?

494
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,260
Naturally, at Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

495
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,500
Then let's move.

496
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,130
Your days in Nan'an City

497
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,700
end tonight.

498
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,700
It was but a dream.

499
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,850
Dreams end.

500
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,330
I'll take the miracle physician

501
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,810
back to her room.

502
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,940
Sleeping here, she will catch a chill.

503
00:23:59,160 --> 00:23:59,850
Boo!

504
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,170
So you were faking sleep.

505
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,780
I... I was asleep,

506
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,980
but something

507
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,090
reeking

508
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:08,890
walked in,

509
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,220
and the stench woke me.

510
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,300
Miracle physician,

511
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:18,980
I have to go.

512
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:27,980
♪Blades have stained my youth...♪

513
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,330
Go on, go.

514
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,170
You've always had unfinished business.

515
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,330
This day

516
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:35,540
was bound to come.

517
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:40,850
But this place

518
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,130
is no dream.

519
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,260
It's your journey's end.

520
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,300
When you return in triumph,

521
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,460
this medicine shop

522
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,780
will still be here for you.

523
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,540
And all the pretty girls

524
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,460
in Nan'an City

525
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,700
will be here for you too.

526
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,330
Much obliged.

527
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,060
Come back soon...

528
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,570
and make me a proper bowl

529
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,850
of noodles.

530
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:14,610
All right.

531
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:23,540
♪I'm lucky to meet you♪

532
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,370
Reapers clear the way

533
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,700
as we reach Yellow Springs.

534
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,130
We've reached Yellow Springs,

535
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:46,130
so where are the Reapers?

536
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,650
Paper umbrellas ward off the yang energy.

537
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,160
The Yellow Springs reapers

538
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,460
do carry a chill,

539
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,300
creepier than Blood River.

540
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,170
Our Master sent us

541
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,860
to wait here a long time,

542
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,560
Patriarch of Blood River.

543
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:02,850
We've heard your Master

544
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:03,810
is most capable.

545
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:05,300
He even foresaw

546
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,090
we'd come here.

547
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,220
Then please, Sir,

548
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,980
and Master Su Muyu,

549
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,460
board the boat.

550
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:47,300
You must be the current Su family head,

551
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:48,500
Su Muyu?

552
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,780
Young master,

553
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,170
you're quite handsome.

554
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,850
Why so cold, young master?

555
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,370
Is it because

556
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,130
we're not acquainted?

557
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,650
Will you talk to me now?

558
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:13,850
All right, I'll stop teasing you.

559
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,260
You can change faces, Miss?

560
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,980
You sure I'm a "girl"?

561
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,090
Now I'm really confused.

562
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,220
What's your name?

563
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,220
They call me

564
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,810
Hongying.

565
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,980
[Hongying]

566
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,130
Unbelievable.

567
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,330
The Mu family can disguise too,

568
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,570
but compared to Hongying,

569
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,020
they're far behind.

570
00:28:57,830 --> 00:28:59,220
We're the Umbrella Ghost

571
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:00,330
and the Undertaker.

572
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,610
Putting on spooks before us?

573
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,570
That's rich.

574
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:06,170
