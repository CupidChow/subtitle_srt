Oh no.

00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,570
It seems we're going to die here.

7
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,290
Look.

8
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,620
The sky is getting dark,

9
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,740
yet we still haven't managed to break through the gate.

10
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,900
Just give up.

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,980
Back then, they even managed to impede

12

Su Muyu?

18
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,610
So, you neutralized the Drunken Dream Bone

19
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,980
on yourself, huh?

20
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,730
You truly bring unexpected surprises.

21
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,570
The battle has already begun.

22
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,010
Our swords are already unsheathed.

23
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,610
There's no need to care too much.

24
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:47,890
You have a point.

25
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,340
Go and do what you're supposed to do.

26
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,500
As for them,

27
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,220
we'll stall them for you.

28
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,890
Thank you.

29
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,170
It's my honor

30
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,820
to witness such changes.

31
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:03,260
Me too.

32
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,130
The direction he's heading in,

33
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:12,940
is it the Wanjuan Tower.

34
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,780
So, you guys lay dormant all this time

35
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,820

[Forbidden Ground, No Entry]

37
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,170
According to my plan,

38
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,660
I suppose most of the Shadow Sect's forces

39
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,010
have been transferred elsewhere,

40
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,170
including Wanjuan Tower.

41
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,340
But it seems the Shadow Sect's foundations

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,610
run deeper than we imagined.

43
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,220
You're pretty good.

44
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,540
It seems Master Su

45
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,570
has already started the fight.

46

Changhe,

47
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,930
is our current goal

48
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,160
to annihilate the Shadow Sect?

49
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:21,290
What has the Shadow Sect got to do with us?

50
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,660
That's the duty of Tianqi City.

51
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,460
Our current goal

52
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,140
is that building.

53
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,250
That building?

54
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,170
What's so special about it?

55
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,250
The Wanjuan Tower

56
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,580
houses the information

57
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,730
of all members in Blood River.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,700
Rumor has it that every detail was recorded

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,700
since birth.

60
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,170
Doesn't that mean...

61
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,900
We'll know once we enter the tower.

66

has invaded our sect under the lead

67
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,100

70

72
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,730
Water Official brought an expert impersonator with him

73
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,730
and broke into our prison under your guise.

74
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,050
Right now, Su Muyu

75
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,810
has exited the Shadow Prison.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,980

78
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,220

79
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,580
What is their goal?

80
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:21,980
I'm afraid

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,220
the attack on Fengxiao Temple is just a feint.

82
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,900
Their encirclement of Shadow Sect

83
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,220
seems to be a long-coming plot of theirs.

84
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,220
They pretended to attack Xiao Ruofeng

85
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,340
while borrowing a large number of our forces,

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,100
causing the security here to be lax.

87
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,220
What an elaborate plot.

88
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,850
It's a shame that they forgot something.

89
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,170
How could I rule over the Shadow Sect

90
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,100
all these years if I didn't have

91
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,980
a trick or two up my sleeves?

92
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,370
Within Wanjuan Tower,

93
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,610
I've left them

94
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,850
with a huge gift!

95
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,900
Why do they care about Wanjuan Tower so much?

96
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,170
What they truly fear

97
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,250
isn't the power of Shadow Sect.

98
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,780
It's the fact that the Shadow Sect

99
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,020
keeps all of Blood River's secrets.

100
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,540
As long as they destroy

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,340
all of the hidden documents

102
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,780
in Wanjuan Tower,

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,810
they can

104
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,780
hide their tracks entirely.

105
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,250
By then, they can establish

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,100
a new Blood River.

107
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:24,610
This time,

108
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,900

You'll never be able to discover the secret

112
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,540
behind No-Sword City's annihilation.

113
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,540
You bet on the fact

114
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,810
that they would yield to the coercion

115
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,100
due to their desire for freedom.

116
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,930
But you don't understand them at all.

117
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,410
They were able to get this far

118
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,220
because they didn't fear any coercion.

119
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,930
Each step they took was getting them closer to freedom.

120
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,930
I already gave you a reminder,

121
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,290

122
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,290

124
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:04,930

00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,300
that's what it seems like to outsiders.

192
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,530
Chancellor,

193
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,130
you really do know how to pick your timing, huh?

194
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,820
That's not the only thing I know.

195
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,610
I know how to buy time as well.

196
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,980
Chancellor, what a shame.

197
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:47,530
I suppose

198
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,650
I'm not in the mood tonight.

199
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,850
According to the rules set by our ancestors,

200
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,250
the eunuchs guarding the Imperial Mausoleum

201
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,250
are not to leave the premises.

202
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,370
And now, you're taking one more step away.

203
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,820
I haven't included

204
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,730
the number of steps you've taken previously as well.

205
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,490
Chancellor,

206
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:11,730
you see,

207
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:15,100
certain things are meaningless if you make them too obvious.

208
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,650
Indeed.

209
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,700
Certain things are meaningless

210
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,460
if we make them too obvious.

211
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,340
Chancellor, it seems

212
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,180
you're bent on stopping me today.

213
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,580
Not necessarily.

214
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,460
I just want to play a round of weiqi with you.

215
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,650
If we do engage each other in battle,

216
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,180
I suppose the entire Tianqi City

217
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,650
will tremble.

218
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,940
Ever since the great battle atop the Imperial City

219
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,530
between Baili Dongjun and Ye Dingzhi,

220
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,460
Tianqi City

221
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,610
has never welcomed such a spectacle again.

222
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:06,370
Let me put it this way.

223
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,700
Some of the spectacles happened deep at night.

224
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,220
They ended before dawn.

225
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,340
Many people couldn't witness them.

226
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,250
If, back then,

227
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:39,730
Mr. Li didn't inflict

228
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,100
a blow to my head,

229
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,580
I suppose

230
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,250
I would've engaged you in combat

231
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,530
today.

232
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,420
I wonder

233
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,940
if Mr. Li was a prophet

234
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,010
or he just wanted to bully me.

235
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,340
Stop overthinking it.

236
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,180
He merely wanted to bully you.

237
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,130
It's better for you

238
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,890
to play weiqi with me.

239
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,130
You stopped my arrow.

240
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,490
Good job.

241
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,490
I can tell.

242
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,970
It's either that you were injured

243
00:14:36,030 --> 00:14:37,010
or you just recovered from a serious illness.

244
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,730
Your zhenqi is very unstable.

245
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,370
But I'm sure you can't stop

246
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,220
my next technique, Seven Stars.

247
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,730
Seven Stars?

248
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,850
This is a bow technique passed down by my ancestors.

249
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,340
This technique had killed five warlords born of chaos.

250
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,610
You should feel honored that I'm using it

251
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,180
on an assassin like you.

252
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,220
The power of this arrow

253
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,490
is actually almost twice

254
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:20,700
the last arrow.

255
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:23,770
For Seven Stars,

256
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,180
each arrow is stronger than the last.

257
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,890
If you try to block another arrow,

258
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,340
your sword will surely break.

259
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:06,650
What is...

260
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:12,460
Is that Sword of Taiji?

261
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,340
An assassin like you actually knows how to use

262
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,490
the slowest sword art in the world, huh?

263
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,010
However, the next arrow

264
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,130
won't be as simple.

265
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,300
Is that so?

266
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:22,580
But it's also obvious that your technique

267
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,300
is consuming a lot of your stamina.

268
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,340
Please fire

269
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,250
your next arrow.

270
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
I'll leave this place to you guys.

271
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:44,650
I'll go and check on the head of the Su family.

272
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,340
All right!

273
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:53,220
So, this is the so-called Shadow Sect, huh?

274
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,180
You guys think that you can control Blood River when you're this weak?

275
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,940
Fools.

276
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,980
This is an artifact of Mu family,

277
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,290
the Celestial Ninefold Zither.

278
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,660
I couldn't find it

279
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,900
when I searched our sect.

280
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:40,940
It turns out

281
00:17:41,350 --> 00:17:42,700
that he was bringing it with him everywhere he went.

282
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,420
So, you're still alive.

283
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,180
You traitor.

284
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:54,050
As a member of the Mu family,

285
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,010
how dare you serve the Su family?

286
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,730
You idiot.

287
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,380
Blood River's rule has already shifted,

288
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,010
yet you're still talking about the Three Families?

289
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,570
The tide has already cast you away.

290
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,940
Time to die.

291
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,730
Together with the old Blood River.

292
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,490
I have one last arrow.

293
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,810
And you

294
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,420
will die for sure!

295
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:51,620
Grandfather.

296
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:52,660
Uncles.

297
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,090
You're finally here.

298
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,180
Are you reprimanding me for being late?

299
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:03,900
So, you two are

300
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,630
the current leaders of Blood River, huh?

301
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,380
You two do look very young.

302
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,730
I'm Su Changhe, the Patriarch of Blood River.

303
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,460
Greetings, elders.

304
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,980
The person next to me is Su Muyu.

305
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,900
He's the current head of the Su family.

306
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,660
Elders, may I know your names?

307
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,590
[Xie Biyou, Shadow Sect]

308
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,860
Xie Biyou.

309
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,240
[Mu Fusheng, Shadow Sect]

310
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,330
Mu Fusheng.

311
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,460
[Su Ziyan, Shadow Sect]
Su Ziyan.

312
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,570
So, your surnames are Xie,

313
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,330
Mu,

314
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,180
and Su?

315
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,220
Those are the surnames of Blood River's Three Families.

316
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,010
Who are you guys?

317
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,980
They're quite surprised upon hearing

318
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,010
our surnames.

319
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,330
Indeed.

320
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,700
We and the Three Families of Blood River

321
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,010
come from the same branch.

322
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,530
Back then,

323
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,220
some of our ancestors

324
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,700
joined the martial world

325
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,420
while some of them remained here.

326
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,290
The three of us

327
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,860
are the descendants of those

328
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,730
who remained in Tianqi City.

329
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,860
That only includes your ancestors.

330
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,530
It doesn't include us.

331
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,860
Chang He and I were born Nameless.

332
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,860
We bear no lineage of the Three Families.

333
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,700
So, the Three Families of Blood River

334
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,130
have already been

335
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,650
taken over by outsiders like you all.

336
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,420
No wonder you would invade our premises

337
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,420
and go against the Shadow Sect!

338
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,700
When the old fades, the new ascends.

339
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,810
That's the rule of the world.

340
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,770
Young men,

341
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,420
did you two come here

342
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,460
to infiltrate Wanjuan Tower?

343
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:46,770
Indeed.

344
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,090
However, there are

345
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,180
no treasures or martial arts manuals

346
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,010
within Wanjuan Tower.

347
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,620
It only harbors the secrets

348
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,330
of the world.

349
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,050
What exactly

350
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:00,180
is your goal here?

351
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,090
Since it harbors the secrets of the world,

352
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,570
naturally, it also harbors the secrets of Blood River.

353
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,420
Are you guys

354
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,810
trying to destroy Wanjuan Tower?

355
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,220
So what if we are?

356
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,900
Not only are we going to destroy Wanjuan Tower,

357
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,940
but we're also going

358
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,700
to sever the ties

359
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,220
between Blood River and Shadow Sect.

360
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,250
It seems

361
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,900
the wish of our pioneers

362
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,010
during the founding of our nation,

363
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,010
which was to protect the nation with its shadow,

364
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,900
has fallen apart.

365
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,420
It fell apart long ago.

366
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:36,660
Blood River and Shadow Sect stopped being

367
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,980
the shadow that protected the world long ago.

368
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,330
Now, we're the pawns

369
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,730
of those who fight for power

370
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,090
in broad daylight.

371
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,490
Do you think Nameless individuals like you two

372
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,980
can sever the ties of the two organizations?

373
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,700
I alone am enough.

374
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,620
Eighteen-Sword Array?

375
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,620
Let me exchange some blows with you, then.

376
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,380
My pleasure.

377
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:36,660
Uncle Zhe,

378
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,050
all of Shadow Sect's members have retreated.

379
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,860
I suppose they found out

380
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,040
that we had destroyed their den.

381
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,010
Since that's the case,

382
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:49,580
there's no point in keeping up the act.

383
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,140
Your Highness, your Realm-Rending Sword Art

384
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,430
is amazing indeed.

385
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,930
Mr. Su Zhe, your Heaven-Demon Sixteen Dances

386
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,700
is ferocious as well.

387
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,620
It's been so many years

388
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:01,420
since I last enjoyed a fight.

389
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,380
If so, we shall put a stop to our act.

390
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,940
But the final result of this conflict

391
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,770
will still depend on the two brothers

392
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,730
in Tianqi City.

393
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,050
Your Highness,

394
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,490
do you want a puff?

395
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,100
Mr. Su, you're too courteous.

396
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,770
If so,

397
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,620
why don't you have some preserved plums?

398
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,420
There's nothing left.

399
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,000
Your blow had crushed all of them.

400
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:33,980
What a shame.

401
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,270
Mr. Su, you're interesting indeed.

402
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,890
Preserved plums and a pipe,

403
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,860
lying on the ground with all fours, good night.

404
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:47,420
Abbot, you're wrong.

405
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,700
It should be "running with all fours, full of might."

406
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,220
Amitabha.

407
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,860
Even if you were to stop

408
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,530
the sharpest Puppet Razor Strings,

409
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:56,940
the only bladeless weapon

410
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,250
in the world,

411
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,530
you'll be ripped to shreds

412
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:01,810
the moment you block it.

413
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,090
You might still stand a chance to survive

414
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,010
if you use Hell Palm now.

415
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,570
The Hell Palm is unnecessary

416
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:22,530
to deal with an eccentric person like you

417
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,530
who doesn't even dare to face me head-on.

418
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:29,490
Back then, in our generation,

419
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,140
the Mu family

420
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,050
had the highest chance to rise to the top

421
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,010
because of you and me.

422
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,140
It's all your fault.

423
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,810
You didn't heed Master's words

424
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,660
and merely did what you liked.

425
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:41,940
It caused the Mu family

426
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,980
to be the weakest family

427
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,810
among the Three Families.

428
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,420
I...

429
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,770
I only live for my own sake!

430
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,490
If other people attack me,

431
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,180
I'll return the favor.

432
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,330
If other people want to kill me,

433
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:00,940
I'll kill them

434
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,220
before they can kill me!

435
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,250
If they want to make me bow

436
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,570
and succumb,

437
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,620
I will stand strong with my own strength!

438
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,700
Dance of 1,000 Butterflies!

439
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,180
This is when the real game begins.

440
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:54,940
He actually crushed the Celestial Ninefold Zither

441
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,530
without using Hell Palm.

442
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,380
I've lost.

443
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,810
That's right.

444
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,490
You've lost.

445
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,290
Now,

446
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,770
I finally understood

447
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,380
what Master meant back then.

448
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:40,940
Zizhe,

449
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,220
why do you live?

450
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,460
I live for the glory of the Mu family.

451
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,180
I, Mu Zizhe, wish to make the Mu family prosper.

452
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,250
I will make our family the leader among the Three Families.

453
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,810
Excellent.

454
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:01,770
Ciling,

455
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:02,620
what about you?

456
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,220
You're distracted again.

457
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:13,770
Ciling,

458
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,810
why do you live, then?

459
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,660
Of course I live for my own sake.

460
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,360
The Mu family

461
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,490
is made up of members of the Mu family.

462
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:24,490
If every member of the Mu family

463
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:25,530
can truly live for

464
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,460
their own sake

465
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,220
and become strong,

466
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,320
the Mu family will prosper naturally.

467
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,290
By then,

468
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,090
the Mu family could rule over the Three Families naturally.

469
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,900
If I can become the strongest member of Blood River,

470
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,490
naturally, the Mu family

471
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,770
will become the strongest clan in Blood River.

472
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:24,540
♪The wind still sighs, scattering fate's remains♪

473
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:31,420
♪The slanting rain moistens a youthful chain♪

474
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:35,220
♪In a fleeting glance, I gather frost and regret♪

475
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:39,220
♪Upon the board, I wager my soul to chase the moon again...♪

476
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:41,940
What a fool.

477
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,770
He's helpless.

478
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,090
Utterly helpless.

479
00:30:54,780 --> 00:31:01,020
♪The stubborn flame devours the calloused cocoon...♪

480
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,660
The question that Master asked us back then

481
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,290
had no meaning to it at all!

482
00:31:08,790 --> 00:31:09,860
If that's the case,

483
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,140
several decades had passed since then.

484
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,380
How would you know immediately

485
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,380
which question Mu Zizhe was referring to

486
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,180
right before

487
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:18,860
his death?

488
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,700
♪A fleeting breeze snuffs out the name I bore...♪

489
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,490
It's because every word uttered

490
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:27,530
by that old fool

491
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:28,700
was meaningless.

492
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,770
Blood River is meaningless.

493
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,010
The Mu family is meaningless.

494
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,860
Killing is meaningless.

495
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:43,940
Only the existence of I, Mu Ciling,

496
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:48,660
have my own meaning!

497
00:31:54,790 --> 00:31:55,810
I couldn't tell at all.

498
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,230
To think that you were a philosopher.

499
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,380
You...

500
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,220
You idiot.

501
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,380
Arrest them!

502
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,520
They came here much quicker than we thought.

503
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,930
Let's help Yu

504
00:32:13,930 --> 00:32:14,980
to stall them.

505
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:15,420
Let's go.

506
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,090
Why don't we head inside?

507
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,860
We should wait for Changhe's signal.

508
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:21,900
He said

509
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,660
he would only summon us

510
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,980
when it's absolutely necessary.

511
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,010
They must be idiots.

512
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,050
Why must they head inside and force a fight?

513
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,180
With your 1,000-Spider Array

514
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,940
and the mystical poison I invented,

515
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,530
the Shadow Sect

516
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,700
can be dealt with easily.

517
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,940
Miss Bai, are you anxious?

518
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,030
Aren't you anxious at all?

519
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,420
Don't worry.

520
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,490
The two brothers have never lost a fight

521
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:48,810
that they fought together.

522
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,220
Inside your sword lies an aura.

523
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:10,770
I saw it before.

524
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:12,770
It's Spring Rain Sword Aura.

525
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,010
Kid,

526
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,780
who exactly are you?

527
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,770
I'm Su Muyu of Blood River.

528
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,730
I'm also a vengeful spirit

529
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,330
of No-Sword City.

530
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,180
The lord of No-Sword City,

531
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,050
Zhuo Yuluo,

532
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,380
who is he to you?

533
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,420
He's my father.

534
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,980
Now that I'm looking at you,

535
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,700
you do resemble him a lot.

536
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,770
So, the lord of No-Sword City

537
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,090
actually has a descendant, huh?

538
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,180
And, his descendant actually became

539
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:43,460
a Nameless of Blood River.

540
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,290
This is interesting indeed.

541
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:48,220
Now, I understand

542
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,330
why you must visit

543
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,810
the Wanjuan Tower behind me.

544
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,250
It's because it contains

545
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,180
the secret of your background.

546
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,660
It also contains the secret

547
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,660
behind No-Sword City's annihilation.

548
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:00,700
That's right.

549
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:02,570
Therefore, no one

550
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:03,530
can stop me.

551
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,050
If that's the case,

552
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,090
we have no choice but to join hands.

553
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:22,860
You guys are truly shameless.

554
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:24,900
You three are trying to gang up on him.

555
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,740
If so, let me join the fight.

556
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:27,980
Changhe.

557
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,460
You should leave for now.

558
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,980
I know you're already exhausted.

559
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:32,460
You don't need to fight

560
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,420
as long as I'm still standing.

561
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,340
Although we have the same surnames,

562
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,130
they led a pampered life

563
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:39,980
in Tianqi City.

564
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,050
Generations had passed.

565
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,490
They're no longer the shadow

566
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,460
within the darkness.

567
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:46,210
Now, they're nobles

568
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,050
that live on the surface.

569
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,820
They've long forgotten

570
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,860
how to take one's life.

571
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,820
I didn't expect

572
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,210
to witness the true Eighteen-Sword Array again

573
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,740
in this lifetime.

574
00:35:14,670 --> 00:35:16,300
Back then, there were only 17 swords.

575
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,610
I never witnessed the 18th sword.

576
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,420
When the 18th sword is used,

577
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,260
winning or losing no longer matters.

578
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,050
Only one's life is at stake.

579
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,650
If so, let's see who the final victor is!

580
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:02,380
You would've died

581
00:37:03,190 --> 00:37:04,460
had we not joined hands.

582
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,530
You guys may leave.

583
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:11,900
I no longer wish to be an assassin.

584
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,780
The members of Blood River

585
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,980
no longer wish to do so either.

586
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,420
That's right.

587
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:18,780
But I think

588
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:20,690
you shouldn't leave anyone alive

589
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,460
now that you've shown them the 18th sword.

590
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,780
Although Changhe and I are Nameless,

591
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:29,900
we have companions

592
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,860
just like you all.

593
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,530
They have the surnames Su,

594
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,260
Xie, and Mu,

595
00:37:36,550 --> 00:37:37,460
which are the same as yours.

596
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,530
Emotions never mattered in Blood River.

597
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,800
However, I hope that they will be able to lead a life

598
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,610
where they can walk in the sunlight.

599
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,980
We were one from the start.

600
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,940
The Shadow Sect ruled over Blood River and the Three Families.

601
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,180
At the same time, they support our three families

602
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,360
in Tianqi City.

603
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,300
I don't dare to promise anything else.

604
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,380
But there's one thing I can promise.

605
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:11,820
From now on,

606
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,940
the Shadow Sect shall cease to exist.

607
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,570
Once you leave this place,

608
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,410
no one is going to cause trouble for you all.

609
00:38:23,150 --> 00:38:24,870
There are certain things that have to be changed.

610
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:29,940
We will reach the Other Shore eventually.

611
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,780
There should not

612
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,490
be endless night,

613
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,610
but light.

614
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:40,340
Excellent!

615
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,740
You've thoroughly impressed me.

616
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,090
Fusheng.

617
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:47,980
That's enough.

618
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:50,690
Yi Bu

619
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,940
wasn't a leader worth our service.

620
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:55,090
The three of us knew that

621
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,610
long ago.

622
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,740
Moreover, now,

623
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,890
the Four Guardians of Tianqi,

624
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,050
who serve the Prince of Langya,

625
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,530
reign supreme in Tianqi City.

626
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,900
The Shadow Sect

627
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:07,940
has fallen from grace long ago.

628
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,380
Instead of perishing together with him,

629
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,490
we should

630
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,490
seek another way out.

631
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,900
If so, Mr. Su,

632
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,570
let us part ways here.

633
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:27,530
I hope you can realize your wish

634
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,620
and bring forth a new Blood River.

635
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,940
The current Blood River is already a brand new organization.

636
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,460
It's just that its image in people's hearts

637
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:36,780
hasn't changed yet.

638
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,980
[Wanjuan Tower]

639
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,380
I suppose Yu has succeeded.

640
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,260
Miss Bai.

641
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,260
I don't think anything else will happen here.

642
00:39:58,550 --> 00:39:59,450
You should head to the inn

643
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,140
and meet up with the rest.

644
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:01,260
What about you?

645
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:03,690
Now that things have settled down,

646
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,170
it's time for me to deal with my personal affairs.

647
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:06,860
I won't be heading back.

648
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,170
All right.

649
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,740
Beauty Mu,

650
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,690
please look after yourself.

651
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:12,380
Farewell.

652
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:25,940
Why did you do that?

653
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:27,650
You wouldn't need to end up like this

654
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,690
had we fought together just now.

655
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,610
If we fought together just now,

656
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,260
both parties would've fought until the end.

657
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:39,530
It's been so long

658
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:40,420
since you used the 18th sword.

659
00:40:41,070 --> 00:40:41,690
Logically speaking,

660
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,240
once you cast the complete Eighteen-Sword Array,

661
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,420
no one would've survived.

662
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,870
But you actually spared those old fools.

663
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,340
If I must say, you should've killed them.

664
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,260
We have to start from scratch anyway.

665
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,490
There are certain things we have to start from scratch,

666
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,420
but not everything.

667
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,780
For example, we have to

668
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,260
reduce Wanjuan Tower to ashes.

669
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,010
Changhe,

670
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,090
the opponent we reserved for you is arriving.

671
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,170
If it's against him,

672
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:11,860
I can cast aside life and death, am I right?

673
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,420
Suit yourself.

674
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:15,300
All right.

675
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,420
Wait.

676
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:20,380
Su Muyu,

677
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,940
why do I feel like

678
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,980
you're the true Patriarch

679
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,380
while I'm just an errand boy?

680
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:32,740
I suppose I brought this upon myself.
