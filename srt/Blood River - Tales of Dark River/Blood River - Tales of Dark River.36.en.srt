[Episode 36]

5
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:40,930
Changhe,

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,620
Master Mu and Xuewei are dead.

7
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,180
Changhe!

8
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,410
I heard you!

9
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,710
They wouldn't have died

10
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,570
if we were around.

11
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,740
We're members of Blood River.

12
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:56,690
We're assassins.

13
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,490
To us, life-or-death situations

14
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,050
are as common as our meals.

15
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,660
So, to you,

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,490
the members of Blood River

17
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,980
are still assassins, huh?

18
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,610
We haven't reached the Other Shore yet.

19
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,500
And, we're still under the control of someone else.

20
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,060
Do you understand

21
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:24,450
First Prince's plan?

22
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,820
He wants the generals and marquises, who were blackmailed by him

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,570
by turning their family members into drugged puppets,

24
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,340
to cause a riot in Tianqi City

25
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,940
on the night before the Imperial Assembly.

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,340
At the same time, he'll bring out the Dragonseal Scroll.

27
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,100
He'll initiate both of these events

28
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:41,850
at the same time.

29
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,260
After that, he'll frame Prince of Langya for them.

30
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,290
Lastly, he'll show up to quell the chaos

31
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:47,690
by killing Prince of Langya.

32
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,820
With that, he'll absorb Prince of Langya's faction

33
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,170
and pave a path to the throne he desires.

34
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,570
Indeed.

35
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,060
If someone were to mention that plan to me

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,740
a few months ago,

37
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,010
I would laugh it off.

38
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,050
But now, it seems Prince of Langya

39
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,660
is in a tight spot as well.

40
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:06,980
On the battlefield,

41
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,780
Lei Mengsha was defeated and retreated to Mount Luolei.

42
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,500
In the imperial court,

43
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:12,220
the emperor no longer trusts him as much.

44
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,820
And, his main guardians

45
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,570
have left him one by one as well.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,340
So, Changhe, are you choosing to side with

47
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,500
the powerful to reap more profit?

48
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,380
I'm driven solely by profit.

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,410
That has always been my biggest strength,

50
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,610
hasn't it?

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,270
But Prince of Langya has a reputation

52
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,600
of making the world tremble.

53
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,690
Could he truly be this weak?

54
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,010
Could it be that he's using Blood River to his advantage?

55
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,780
Changhe, do you mean

56
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,380
Prince of Langya is acting weak on purpose?

57
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,500
Changli,

58
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,410
give me some time alone.

59
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,660
You can take a stroll around Tianqi City.

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,290
It's because

61
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,820
we'll leave soon.

62
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,410
It's indeed

63
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,850
a city worth longing for.

64
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,810
Especially at nighttime.

65
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:21,730
It's just like

66
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,220
the saying...

67
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:27,660
What is it again?

68
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,410
"In heaven stands the White Jade Capital,

69
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,610
with 12 towers and 5 cities.

70
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,900
Immortals brush my crown,

71
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,540
granting me eternal life with a touch upon my hair".

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,580
I suppose Tianqi City does live up to its name.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,810
I was admiring the moon on the rooftop alone.

74
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,780
But when I turn around,

75
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,410
a sword deity is standing right beside me.

76
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,460
Greetings, Li Hanyi, the Xueyue Sword Deity.

77
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,170
If you move,

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm afraid

79
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,290
my sword will draw blood.

80
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,580
Xueyue Sword Deity, what are you doing in Tianqi City?

81
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,250
If so, Patriarch,

82
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,250
what are you doing in Tianqi City as well?

83
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,810
We came here

84
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,810
for the same person.

85
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,980
It's Prince of Langya.

86
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,250
Patriarch,

87
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,810
you're getting better and better.

88
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,580
We can spar with each other in a few days

89
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,490
if the opportunity arises.

90
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,900
This is news from

91
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:34,660
the Inner Security Division.

92
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,740
[Imperial mausoleum, Zhuo Qing, Dragonseal Scroll]

93
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:50,290
I knew it.

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,140
Li Zhengqi.

95
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,490
Where are you?

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,780
Li Zhengqi?

97
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,170
Why did I give birth

98
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,250
to a useless fool like you?

99
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,700
How can you face

100
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,290
the ancestors of the Li family like this?

101
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:58,460
Useless fool.

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,290
You're a useless fool!

103
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,220
No wonder his son was forced

104
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,410
to seek out such a method

105
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,700
to increase his strength.

106
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:07,930
I thought he was

107
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,370
a kind father

108
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,850
when I saw him protecting his son back then.

109
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:14,900
Father!

110
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,610
I'll surely win the Golden Throne Contest.

111
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,580
I'll definitely win the position of deputy general.

112
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,900
You have to trust me.

113
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,780
Fine.

114
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,410
I shall wait for your good news.

115
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,850
Forget it.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,810
I didn't come here

117
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,540
to peek at your past.

118
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,410
How is it?

119
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:55,980
Your cultivation realm should be

120
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,250
completely stabilized by now.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,170
Uncle Zhe.

122
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,490
Why don't you need to take any medicine?

123
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,540
I'm not injured.

124
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,540
Why should I take medicine?

125
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,020
I merely

126
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,850
imparted some of my powers to you.

127
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,050
Moreover,

128
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,020
my daughter also gave me

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,980
an acupuncture treatment.

130
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,660
Right now,

131
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,410
I feel superb.

132
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,100
She told me

133
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:21,850
that she'd help me to regulate my body

134
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:24,410
to deal with the long-term backlash

135
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,250
sustained by

136
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,370
the practitioners of Divine-Demon Nirvana Art.

137
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,340
If it doesn't work out,

138
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,020
we can still depend on Baicao.

139
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,700
I suppose I can rest at ease

140
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,850
if you'll be fine after this.

141
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,530
That's all in the future.

142
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:40,890
She said

143
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,390
that once the issue in Tianqi City

144
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,250
has been resolved,

145
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,220
she would take me with her to Medicine King Valley.

146
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:47,890
She said

147
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,010
that there are several straw huts there.

148
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,060
There are also some cattle, sheep,

149
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,460
and a small vegetable plot.

150
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,890
I suppose

151
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,060
life there will be dull and uninteresting.

152
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,340
But luckily,

153
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,530
there's a valley

154
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,250
filled with all kinds

155
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,100
of mystical herbs

156
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:03,060
and

157
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,890
the number one Medicine King in the world.

158
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,340
She also said

159
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,010
that as long as they join hands,

160
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,130
even the envoys of Hell have to wait for decades

161
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,050
before they can reap one's life.

162
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,220
What do you think?

163
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,460
I think it's fine.

164
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,730
If the two miracle physicians treat you at the same time,

165
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,010
I'm sure you can recover completely.

166
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:32,580
That's not it.

167
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,220
That's not what I mean.

168
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,700
What I meant was,

169
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,020
what do you think about returning to Medicine King Valley?

170
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:41,770
Aren't you joining us?

171
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,220
All right.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,300
So, this is what it feels like

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:06,850
when one becomes a drugged puppet.

174
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,820
This is truly shocking.

175
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,420
I'll end the session for now.

176
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:16,890
Su Muyu?

177
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,180
Master.

178
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:33,770
I'm fine.

179
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,730
Li Zhengqi

180
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,300
has never met Su Muyu before.

181
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,370
Therefore,

182
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,530
that wasn't his inner demon.

183
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,770
It was my inner demon.

184
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,770
The Dragonseal Scroll surfaces, the world changes its face.

185
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,580
When turmoil arises, Prince of Langya seals it.

186
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,340
The Dragonseal Scroll surfaces, the world changes its face.

187
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,890
When turmoil arises, Prince of Langya seals it.

188
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,420
The Dragonseal Scroll surfaces, the world changes its face.

189
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,300
Shut up!

190
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:05,220
Stop singing it!

191
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:06,130
Go away!

192
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,420
This never ends.

193
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:19,850
Your Highness,

194
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:22,010
tomorrow's the Imperial Assembly.

195
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:23,650
But for some reason,

196
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,610
the young beggars on the streets

197
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:27,250
were singing that rhyme.

198
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,850
They also wrote the rhyme

199
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,890
on the walls of the streets.

200
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
The people are saying

201
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,710
that the Imperial Assembly

202
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,580
is the day you ascend the throne in front of all officials.

203
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,820
I suppose that's appropriate.

204
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,610
In the presence of all officials,

205
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:47,300
the Mandate of Heaven was conferred.

206
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,850
As the generals pledged their allegiance,

207
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,420
the Imperial Star moved eastward.

208
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,060
And,

209
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,580
many of the generals under you

210
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:00,300
have delivered confidential letters to you.

211
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:05,940
What did they say?

212
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,530
They were confidential.

213
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,530
I dare not read them.

214
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,460
I kept them in your study room.

215
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,460
I'll bring them here.

216
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:14,700
No need for that.

217
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:16,530
Later,

218
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,180
take this fire pit with you.

219
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,820
Burn all of the letters.

220
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,300
Do not leave

221
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,370
a single word behind.

222
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,010
Yes, Your Highness.

223
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,980
Are we actually sending them to retrieve that item?

224
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,340
Don't worry.

225
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,060
Since Su Muyu

226
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,370
has already agreed to it,

227
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:34,770
he'll surely give it his all.

228
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,820
This time,

229
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,250
I was the one who implicated Su Muyu and his men.

230
00:12:41,030 --> 00:12:41,700
Therefore,

231
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:43,340
both he and I

232
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,580
have to complete

233
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,300
our respective tasks.

234
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,490
Bring me my fur cloak.

235
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,460
Your Highness, are you heading out?

236
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,770
It's time to enter the palace.

237
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,490
This time,

238
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,420
Ms. Wan'er helped us out of kindness.

239
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:17,850
But her house was burned down

240
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,770
because of it.

241
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:21,130
I truly feel guilty about it.

242
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:24,700
Master,

243
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,830
Yu knew that you would say that.

244
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,420
Therefore, he told me this

245
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,460
while you were preparing the prescriptions.

246
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,300
He said

247
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,420
Blood River

248
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,130
would compensate Ms. Wan'er with a huge manor after this.

249
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,460
After all,

250
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,730
they have plenty of money in Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

251
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,100
Master,

252
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,060
this is the last step, right?

253
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,490
Once you complete this prescription,

254
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,580
will it serve as a cure to the puppet poison?

255
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:47,820
Naturally.

256
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,340
Master,

257
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,220
why did you separate it into two pots?

258
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,460
And, the herbs inside

259
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,340
are different.

260
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:54,700
Your decoction is thick

261
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:55,820
while mine

262
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,340
is so clear, just like spring water.

263
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,300
I thought I was boiling water.

264
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,980
This pot

265
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,420
is the cure to the puppet poison.

266
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,010
As for that pot,

267
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,300
I have my own use for it.

268
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,100
I see.

269
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,100
Yu.

270
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,140
[Imperial mausoleum, Zhuo Qing, Dragonseal Scroll]

271
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,890
It's tonight.

272
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,820
We still haven't received any news from Changhe yet.

273
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:31,890
Yu.

274
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:33,700
Are you

275
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,340
the only participating member of Blood River tonight?

276
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,580
That's right.

277
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,340
I'm the only participating member.

278
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,940
I shall slay the specter, banish the shadow, and shatter the light.

279
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:49,220
After that, we'll leave Tianqi.

280
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,700
A new Blood River

281
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,130
will be born

282
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,770
tomorrow.

283
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,980
You didn't allow me to join you.

284
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:00,820
Is it because

285
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,700
tonight will be perilous?

286
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,820
Indeed.

287
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,340
Tonight will be perilous.

288
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,650
Life and death hang upon a single instant.

289
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,370
But this is the path I chose

290
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,530
as the leader of Blood River.

291
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:29,460
Therefore,

292
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,980
when there are obstacles ahead,

293
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,610
I shall split it open

294
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,420
with my sword.

295
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,010
You may look gentle and easy to converse with,

296
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,770
but when you decide on something,

297
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,130
no one can persuade you to change your mind.

298
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,220
But Yu,

299
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,340
you're much different

300
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,490
compared to the past.

301
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,490
You have to be careful.

302
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,530
I'll wait for your return.

303
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,220
The breeze is cold.

304
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,490
And, the crows are cawing outside.

305
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,460
Why didn't you close the window

306
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,820
and block out the inauspicious aura?

307
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:19,490
Inauspicious aura?

308
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:22,850
That's the present I'm giving to Prince of Langya.

309
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,980
I'm listening to the mourning theme

310
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,060
sang by the crows,

311
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,370
which is meant for my uncle.

312
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,250
After tonight,

313
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,220
Prince of Langya will become a permanent stain

314
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,850
on the records of history.

315
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,700
He intended to rebel.

316
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,490
In order to blackmail the officials,

317
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,420
he kidnapped their sons

318
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,220
and even poisoned them.

319
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:51,700
He tried to use them

320
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,250
to create

321
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,890
an army that neither sleeps nor rests.

322
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,130
That's truly terrifying.

323
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:03,490
As for us,

324
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,830
we're the righteous ones who have no choice

325
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,660
but to step in and stop him.

326
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,290
This time,

327
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,460
I won't lose again.

328
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:13,860
It's because his days are numbered.

329
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,090
And, he's all alone.

330
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,090
You may leave first.

331
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,090
Yes, sir.

332
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,250
Lord Haoyue,

333
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:30,700
who served First Prince

334
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,730
together with us, died this morning.

335
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,090
He died from a snake's venom as he failed his mission.

336
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,180
Someone silenced him.

337
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,220
So, I suppose your grandson

338
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,660
is simply grieving his own kind,

339
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,570
like a case of the fox mourning the hare, huh?

340
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,140
Mu.

341
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,660
Mind your words.

342
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,490
We're a family.

343
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,420
There's no need to be too formal.

344
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,290
His Highness is summoning you.

345
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:57,290
Do not let him wait for too long.

346
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,530
If so, Grandfather,

347
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,570
granduncles,

348
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:00,860
I shall take my leave first.

349
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,010
Mu.

350
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,420
Hurry, have a seat.

351
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:11,220
Once His Highness

352
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,530
ascends the throne tomorrow,

353
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,050
and we render merit in founding the new dynasty,

354
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:18,220
when that grandson of yours

355
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:21,330
is able to go on an expedition with the new Pillar State General,

356
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,770
which is General Dian,

357
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,490
he'll understand

358
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,940
all of your painstaking efforts.

359
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,860
But Xie, Mu,

360
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:33,940
just like what the child

361
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:35,180
was concerned about,

362
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:38,700
do you guys truly think First Prince

363
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,220
is worth serving?

364
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,730
Why not?

365
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,570
First Prince

366
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,460
hails from the imperial lineage itself,

367
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,860
and is the legitimate heir to the throne.

368
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,620
He is the manifestation of light itself.

369
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,330
Is there a better master than him?

370
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,810
Moreover,

371
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,700
the bow is already drawn.

372
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,290
The shot has to be fired.

373
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,860
There's no

374
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,570
turning back.

375
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,900
Xuanwu Guardian,

376
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,770
if I turn into a monster,

377
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,290
my father will never let you off!

378
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:28,860
Xuanwu Guardian,

379
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:29,730
what should we do now?

380
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,900
If they die here,

381
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,530
I'm afraid

382
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,250
the Inner Security Division will be blamed for this.

383
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:41,620
The antidote has arrived.

384
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:42,730
Thank you.

385
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,250
The antidote has arrived?

386
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:45,730
Give it to me.

387
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:46,900
You caused trouble for us.

388
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:47,900
You'll take it last.

389
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,330
Keep them under control.

390
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,980
There's something off about their condition.

391
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:53,980
One mouthful per person.

392
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:54,810
No extra dosage.

393
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,650
Yes, ma'am.

394
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,620
Hurry and give me the antidote!

395
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,550
I beg you!

396
00:19:58,050 --> 00:19:59,200
Give it to me!

397
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,480
Give it to me first!

398
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:02,900
Ms. Yumo, it's all thanks

399
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:03,730
to your timely arrival.

400
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:04,980
I'm just here to deliver the antidote.

401
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,180
If you want to thank someone,

402
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,980
you should thank Miss Bai.

403
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:10,050
Miss Bai.

404
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,180
Is the antidote ready?

405
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,420
Yes, it's ready.

406
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,530
It took me a lot of effort to make it.

407
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:18,980
Ms. Yumo,

408
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,530
you must keep it safe.

409
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,250
Don't worry.

410
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,140
How should one consume this antidote?

411
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,090
Just take one mouthful,

412
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,420
and they will be cured.

413
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,220
Thank you.

414
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:37,770
It took her a lot of effort

415
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,050
to create this antidote.

416
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,180
Hurry and give it to me!

417
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,770
I'll surely pay her a visit

418
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:43,420
and thank her personally once this is over.

419
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,420
Give me a little more.

420
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,290
Give me a little more.

421
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,050
What's going on?

422
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,570
Is there something wrong with the antidote?

423
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,700
How could there be anything wrong with the antidote

424
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,250
made by Medicine King Valley?

425
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,530
It's you again.

426
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:17,090
That's right.

427
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,420
I'm back.

428
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:20,810
Your favorite senior brother

429
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,460
is here as well.

430
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,050
Senior Brother?

431
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,330
Although Martial Aunt has neutralized

432
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,810
the poison in them,

433
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,900
it will only end if you neutralize

434
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,700
the caster's poison

435
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,490
or eradicate them

436
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,250
completely.

437
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,010
Martial Aunt never read that book.

438
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,940
Therefore, she doesn't know about it.

439
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,730
But now, we know.

440
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:46,810
As for you,

441
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,140
it's time to die.

442
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,700
What a shame.

443
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,220
I thought Martial Aunt would be here as well.

444
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,140
I wanted to get rid of her too.

445
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:03,980
I guess I'll deal with you guys first.

446
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:15,330
You recognize that he's your senior brother, right?

447
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:17,380
But he no longer

448
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,420
recognizes you.

449
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,010
Such killing

450
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,660
is truly exhilarating.

451
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,380
Shut up!

452
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,380
Are you okay?

453
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,530
Why aren't you using your three hidden weapons?

454
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,220
If I cast everything aside

455
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,220
and use all of my hidden weapons,

456
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:50,810
even if I do win the duel,

457
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,530
Senior Brother's body will be broken beyond repair.

458
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:55,900
It seems

459
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,460
you still need me.

460
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,490
100-Spider Array,

461
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,420
rise!

462
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:20,730
Spider Woman,

463
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,290
do you actually think

464
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:23,770
you can kill

465
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,050
a Gold-Body Puppet

466
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,290
with those spiders of yours?

467
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,620
What if all of my spiders

468
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,620
had consumed this?

469
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:31,810
The antidote has already merged into their bloodstream.

470
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,050
Does that mean

471
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,810
it can neutralize your puppet poison?

472
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,180
Yumo!

473
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,140
Watch out!

474
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,940
That hurts!

475
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,010
This is Senior Brother's first time speaking

476
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,460
after encountering us.

477
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:14,900
The antidote

478
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,460
is starting to work.

479
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,530
Don't go there!

480
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,770
He absorbed Xuewei's poison before this.

481
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,180
After that, he absorbed all of the poison mist

482
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,660
at He-Yu Clinic.

483
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,140
Now, his body is filled with poison.

484
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,180
Have you lost your mind?

485
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:32,140
The poison in his body

486
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,050
has been basically neutralized.

487
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,330
I just need to expel

488
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,530
the rest of the poison with my zhenqi,

489
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,570
and he'll be fine.

490
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,770
But the other poisons in his body aren't neutralized yet.

491
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:39,660
It doesn't matter.

492
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,050
I'm Tang Lianyue.

493
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,180
Such poisons

494
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:43,770
won't affect me!

495
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:48,490
Lianyue.

496
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:51,900
Lianyue.

497
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:54,330
Senior Brother.

498
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,250
Lianyue,

499
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,140
kill me.

500
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:05,330
My internal organs

501
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,490
are all broken beyond repair.

502
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,460
Just kill me.

503
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,660
You want to die?

504
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,770
You wish!

505
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:25,900
Tang Lianyue!

506
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,810
Everyone will die if the poison mist

507
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,250
enters the building!

508
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,140
Senior Brother!

509
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,380
Kill me!

510
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,980
Kill me!

511
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:46,860
Lianyue!

512
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,490
Remember what I told you!

513
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:52,860
When someone

514
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,660
blackmails you

515
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:56,730
with my life,

516
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,290
you don't need to care.

517
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,730
Just charge ahead!

518
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,660
Did you hear me?

519
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,860
Do it!

520
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:16,620
Lianyue!

521
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:34,900
Yumo!

522
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,810
I'm truly sorry.

523
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,010
Lianyue.

524
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,220
I'll entrust Tang Clan

525
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,940

who blocked my attack on your behalf,

530
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,900

you ruined it just like that!

These three

537
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,010
were experts

538
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:32,330
nearing the Free-Heaven level.

539
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:33,860
It's a shame

540
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,900
that they weren't as talented as your senior brother.

541
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,220
They cannot become Gold-Body Puppets.

542
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:39,490
However,

543
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,420
they are more than enough

544
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,530

marry me

552
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,980
or not?

553
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:42,770
I will.

554
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,290

If so,

00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:07,180
can you come to our Falling Stars Pavilion, then?

557
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:13,660
No one has held a wedding there before.

558
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:16,810
Okay.

in front of Yu and the rest.

572
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,860
With rivers raging

573
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,330
and thunder splitting the sky,

574
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,490
I will ride the red phoenix to take you as my bride.

575
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,570
Silly boy.

576
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,730
Phoenix doesn't exist

577
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,570
in this world.

578
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,460
♪You are well, just as you were at the start♪

579
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,730
It does exist.

580
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:06,940
♪Do not long for the sorrow of separation♪

581
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:17,660
Is that...

582
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,290
Outside of Pipa Pavilion of Jiujiang,

583
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,660
I was known for my three hidden weapons.

584
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,460
The first one is

585
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,140
Cries of 1,000 Birds.

586
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:26,770
The second one is

587
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,220
Skywrath Thunder.

588
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:29,900
As for the third one,

589
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,940
it's unleashed when I use Cries of 1,000 Birds

590
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,730
and Skywrath Thunder at the same time.

591
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,770
It's called Phoenix Descent!

592
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,290
This is...

593
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,220
So, phoenix does exist, huh?

594
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,180
I'll take you with me.

595
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,050
Ruojin,

596
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,620
you summoned me here.

597
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,940
I suppose you have something to discuss.

598
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,700
I heard

599
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,730
that there was a commotion

600
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,180
in Tianqi City today.

601
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,420
Ruojin,

602
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,250
were you referring

603
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,980
to the children's rhyme?

604
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,660
Could it be

605
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,700
that you also think

606
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,140
I would stage a rebellion

607
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,770
during tomorrow's Imperial Assembly?

608
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:18,090
There was one more Dragonseal Scroll.

609
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,860
It's been so many years.

610
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:21,860
Is it still nowhere to be found?

611
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,570
Indeed.

612
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:25,620
But it'll definitely

613
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,570
show itself today.

614
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,090
Ruofeng,

615
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:37,860
I trust you forever.

616
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,700
But you need to know this.

617
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,290
Not everyone in this world

618
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:45,250
live by absolute principles,

619
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,770
unlike you.

620
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:53,570
Tonight,

621
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,290
I will retrieve the Dragonseal Scroll

622
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,770
on your behalf.

623
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,010
As for tomorrow's Imperial Assembly,

624
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:01,010
nothing will

625
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,770
go wrong.

626
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,250
I can rest at ease

627
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,290
upon hearing that from you.

628
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,380
The snacks were great.

629
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,090
The drinks were excellent as well.

630
00:35:05,550 --> 00:35:06,740
Jin Xuan, I suppose

631
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,380
you were the one who prepared them.

632
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,380
I was just doing my duty.
