00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,980
[Episode 14]

5
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,380
Blood River kills anyone,

6
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,330
doesn't it?

7
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,020
I'll put

8
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,290
the hardest man to kill

9
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,410
before you.

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,240
No need to

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,060
rush your answer.

12
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:51,100
Think it over and...

13
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,330
And?

14
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,490
If you turn your head,

15
00:01:57,790 --> 00:01:58,540
will it

16
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,570
fall off?

17
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,100
Relax.

18
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,290
I won't kill you.

19
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:11,660
Su Muyu's life

20
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,890
is still in your hands.

21
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,890
How could I kill you?

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,010
Sir.

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:18,980
Get lost now.

24
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,220
Since Su Muyu

25
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,500
is your guest,

26
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,940
make sure you serve him fine food.

27
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,500
He can't take spicy food.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,570
Remember that.

29
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:08,730
Sir,

30
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,450
you looked like

31
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,010
you were going to kill him just now.

32
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:13,380
Yes,

33
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,540
I was.

34
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,610
I almost couldn't hold back.

35
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,060
Good thing you did.

36
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:23,760
Let it be then.

37
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,440
I hope

38
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,130
they can treat Muyu well.

39
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,360
[Xiao Ruofeng, Prince of Langya]

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,940
Your Highness, your Drifting Swan Goose and Swallow move

41
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,940
has improved again.

42
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,340
It's a stealth art

43
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,850
taught by Mr. Li.

44
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,260
Oh, that Mr. Li.

45
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,780
Though Mr. Li

46
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,100
had led

47
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,610
the best academy for years,

48
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,260
he'd always

49
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,820
had an unconventional spirit.

50
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,890
Besides ordinary swordplay and martial art skills,

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,890
he excelled in

52
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:04,980
mystic arts

53
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,730
and deceptive arrays.

54
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,220
If he knew

55
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:10,610
I used this method

56
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:13,060
to slip past everyone and come drink here,

57
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,660
I wonder

58
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,780
if he'd shake his head.

59
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:20,700
Your Highness,

60
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,980
what would you like to drink?

61
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,140
The usual?

62
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,370
The usual.

63
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,140
Sure.

64
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,540
If I hadn't followed him all this way,

65
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,660
I'd never have found him.

66
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,170
The Prince of Langya's drinking here?

67
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,610
Sir?

68
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,220
You startled me.

69
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,490
My apologies.

70
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,810
Drinking alone

71
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,370
at this hour,

72
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,340
without guards

73
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,370
or curious eyes around,

74
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,850
that's rare.

75
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,220
Even the finest liquor

76
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,980
turns bitter

77
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,050
when drunk in sorrow.

78
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,780
Who are you?

79
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,980
Please clear

80
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,660
the guests outside.

81
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,490
Go to my residence to see my butler

82
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,050
for compensation for today's loss.

83
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:43,540
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,980
The new Patriarch of Blood River,

85
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,700
Su Changhe.

86
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,460
You're confident.

87
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,700
Ambitions

88
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,020
must be great enough

89
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,370
to make one fight for them a whole lifetime.

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,370
For killers like us,

91
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,100
the greatest ambition

92
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,900
is to kill the hardest man to kill.

93
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:19,660
Interesting.

94
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,900
That

95
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,370
deserves a toast.

96
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,460
I didn't expect

97
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,580
the well-celebrated

98
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,050
Prince of Langya

99
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,580
to be drinking alone

100
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,100
in a tavern.

101
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,540
You're lonely.

102
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,020
I've followed you for a long time.

103
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,700
You have no one around you.

104
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,370
Today,

105
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,730
you deliberately hid

106
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,000
from everyone.

107
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,660
Because you wanted

108
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,660
to see

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,540
how Tianqi

110
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,610
or this world would turn out

111
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,900
without you.

112
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,540
Will it remain the same?

113
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,370
Were all your choices

114
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,220
over the years

115
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,490
not worth it?

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,930
If you weren't a killer,

117
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:22,900
I'd love

118
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,850
to have a drink with you.

119
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,050
What a shame.

120
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,410
The world can't go on

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,140
without you.

122
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,700
In the light, the people look up to you.

123
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,020
In the shadows,

124
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,540
we're waiting for you.

125
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,900
It's been a long time

126
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,660
since I've had a proper fight

127
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,050
in Tianqi City.

128
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:08,070
You didn't draw your sword.

129
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,630
Are you trying to stall?

130
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:12,810
I've forgotten how to draw my sword.

131
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,660
Forgotten?

132
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,450
I once had a sword

133
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,570
called The World's Third.

134
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,100
It was named after my master,

135
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,220
Mr. Li's sword

136
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,100
called The World's Second,

137
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,300
which meant,

138
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,980
"I'm the second in the world.

139
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,540
Who dares claim first?"

140
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,850
Then your World's Third

141
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,420
must've been the greatest swordsmanship

142
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,450
after Mr. Li,

143
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,180
who led the academy.

144
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,450
I honestly should've switched with that brat

145
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,450
for this mission.

146
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,260
But I can't perform that move.

147
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,330
I remember

148
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,180
how joyous it was when I created it

149
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,180
and how heroic it was when I wielded the sword.

150
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,180
But now,

151
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,850
when I lift the sword,

152
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,450
it feels empty.

153
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,090
The Haoque Sword

154
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,020
doesn't answer me.

155
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,850
Haoque?

156
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,180
It's just a sword.

157
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,180
A famed sword

158
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,690
has its own spirit.

159
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,330
No.

160
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,570
Your sword

161
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,020
may be grand enough to embrace everything,

162
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,660
but to me,

163
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,810
it's hollow and pale.

164
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,210
Your sword aura

165
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:39,020
contains too much benevolence.

166
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,670
It lacks

167
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,090
killing intent that can take someone down.

168
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:43,660
I don't fear

169
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,260
a sword like that.

170
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,330
Because in everyone's eyes,

171
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:52,420
this world has never had a place

172
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,610
for me.

173
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,380
Your sword kills the human heart.

174
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,970
It can suppress the wielder's urge.

175
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,570
I'm different.

176
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,930
When I draw my sword,

177
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:24,020
I draw to kill.

178
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:25,380
True.

179
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,660
No sword

180
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,660
can really

181
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,450
embrace the whole world, after all.

182
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,850
Sir,

183
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,140
I can't stop her.

184
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,660
[Li Xinyue, Guardian Azure Dragon]

185
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,260
Why are you drinking here alone?

186
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:56,780
Do you think

187
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,060
you're still that willful prince you once were?

188
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,060
Xinyue.

189
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,180
The Four Guardians of Tianqi,

190
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,850
Guardian Azure Dragon.

191
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,690
I knew

192
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,260
Blood River coming to Tianqi

193
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,260
couldn't mean anything good.

194
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,540
You're not like Su Muyu.

195
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,180
Hanyi told me,

196
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,660
if I see you, don't hesitate.

197
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,930
Heart Sword Rain from Sword Heart Tomb.

198
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:40,330
Your killing intent is more extreme than mine.

199
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,930
Looks like

200
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,450
my Heart Sword Rain isn't fierce enough

201
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,450
to shut your mouth.

202
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,020
Break.

203
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,060
It's you.

204
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,300
Yes.

205
00:12:34,630 --> 00:12:35,300
It's me.

206
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,930
Even if you came, it wouldn't help.

207
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,300
This is bad.

208
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,730
It's been a long time,

209
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,210
Mr. Su Zhe.

210
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,140
You have a good memory, Your Highness.

211
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,300
You remember me.

212
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,420
Death-Chasing Bell.

213
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:58,810
Life-Seizing Rings.

214
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,780
I wouldn't dare forget.

215
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,450
I'm no longer part of Blood River.

216
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,260
Spare our lives.

217
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,660
What do you say?

218
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,300
Back then, when I was escorting the Marquis of Zhenxi,

219
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,930
someone paid Blood River a hefty price

220
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:14,970
for my life.

221
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:16,850
Even though Mr. Su Zhe

222
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,090
had the upper hand,

223
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,450
he spared us.

224
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,850
Xinyue,

225
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,900
please let Mr. Su leave.

226
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:28,380
If we let them go,

227
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,420
it'll cause endless trouble.

228
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,260
Must we fight?

229
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,380
Xinyue,

230
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:37,610
please let Mr. Su leave.

231
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,970
Su Muyu can't cook,

232
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,810
but he's good at picking pastry.

233
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,610
This is nice.

234
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,660
I wonder

235
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,140
if the Shadow Sect treated him well.

236
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,090
Did they feed him bran and scraps

237
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,610
like a prisoner?

238
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,450
What happened to them?

239
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,380
What's going on?

240
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:23,930
Save them first.

241
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:25,500
We'll talk later.

242
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,180
Both of them look like they're about to die.

243
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:27,930
Who do I save first?

244
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,450
Save the Patriarch.

245
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,610
I'm fine.

246
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:32,380
No.

247
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,210
I... I can still hold on.

248
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,570
Not pretending this time?

249
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,570
It's not that.

250
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,330
I almost died.

251
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,930
I just played dead.

252
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,570
When she saw I wasn't a threat,

253
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,930
she spared me.

254
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,690
That's why I'm not badly hurt.

255
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:49,810
Unlike the Patriarch.

256
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,850
He was struck

257
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,970
by the sword rain.

258
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,020
Shut up.

259
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,730
Who did you run into?

260
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,850
This is terrifying.

261
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,570
Guardian Azure Dragon of Tianqi,

262
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,090
the heir to Heart Sword.

263
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,610
I'll try to stop the bleeding.

264
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,380
Piece of work.

265
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,730
I'm in bad shape.

266
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,690
Why are you still insulting me, Miss Bai?

267
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,420
Apply this medicine

268
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,690
all over Su Changhe.

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:35,730
Three times a day.

270
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,540
Get more from me when you run out.

271
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,090
This will do?

272
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,210
I'd say

273
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,210
it's a waste to use it on him.

274
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,690
Spill it.

275
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,260
What are you plotting this time?

276
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,540
You made yourself look so pitiful.

277
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:52,850
It's frightening,

278
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,730
but

279
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,930
there's no inner injury at all.

280
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,300
You're putting on an act.

281
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,260
I heard you failed to kill Prince of Langya.

282
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,930
We were about to succeed,

283
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,380
but Li Xinyue, Guardian Azure Dragon, arrived suddenly.

284
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,420
Why didn't you stop her?

285
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,500
I didn't know you'd strike

286
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,300
at Diaolou Cottage.

287
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,060
Nonsense.

288
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,330
Opportunities vanish in the blink of an eye.

289
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:36,420
How could we possibly have time to inform you?

290
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,780
Besides,

291
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,930
the Shadow Sect has spies all over the city.

292
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,900
We sent signals,

293
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,420
how did you not know?

294
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,660
Yet Li Xinyue got there before you.

295
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:50,330
I'm telling you,

296
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,610
if our Patriarch dies,

297
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,810
I'll lead the entire Blood River

298
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,660
to fight you to death.

299
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,380
You're gravely injured now.

300
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,090
Will there be another chance?

301
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,570
We missed this one.

302
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:06,460
Prince of Langya

303
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,130
will definitely increase his guards.

304
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,020
It'll be much harder

305
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:11,500
to kill him a second time.

306
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,130
Right.

307
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,570
In many cases,

308
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,570
you only get one chance.

309
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,500
No.

310
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,780
There still is.

311
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,610
What do you plan to do, Sir?

312
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,460
I'll gather all Blood River elites from the Three Families and enter Tianqi

313
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,890
to kill him.

314
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,370
The Blood River elites enter Tianqi?

315
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:40,330
Believe me.

316
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,370
No one will notice.

317
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:44,170
By the time they do,

318
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,410
they'll already be dead.

319
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,330
I've shown my sincerity.

320
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,700
I hope Sect Leader Yi

321
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,740
will show his

322
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:52,890
by sending enough men

323
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,780
to help.

324
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,410
All right.

325
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,980
I see your plan.

326
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:24,780
Even though Su Muyu

327
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,570
and you

328
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,410
are powerful,

329
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,810
once you enter the vast Tianqi City,

330
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,740
you're like a pebble

331
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,060
dropped into a pond.

332
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,060
But if an army of demons

333
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:36,370
with swords

334
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,410
enters Tianqi,

335
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,170
it'll be like countless pebbles

336
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,460
thrown into the pond,

337
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:43,130
stirring up huge waves.

338
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,980
Yi Bu won't refuse.

339
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,570
He has no reason to.

340
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,300
You're indeed

341
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,980
a piece of work.

342
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:07,610
Sir,

343
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,130
I met with Su Changhe today.

344
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,610
They planned an assassination

345
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,780
of Prince of Langya

346
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,570
and nearly succeeded.

347
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,780
Nearly succeeded?

348
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,610
So they yet to succeed?

349
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,810
Yes, sir.

350
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,700
The mission failed,

351
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,020
and Su Changhe is seriously injured.

352
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,300
But at the same time,

353
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,780
he swore enmity against Prince of Langya.

354
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:40,940
He asks to rally all Blood River elites

355
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,740
to enter Tianqi City.

356
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,260
All Blood River elites?

357
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,170
If anything goes wrong,

358
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,410
Tianqi City will be plunged

359
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,460
into horrific chaos.

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,980
Sir,

361
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,020
are you suggesting

362
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,850
we stop Su Changhe?

363
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,020
No.

364
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,370
Give him the approval.

365
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:11,650
As long as Su Muyu is under my control,

366
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,260
I bet he won't act recklessly.

367
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,540
It seems Drunken Dream Bone

368
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,740
does more than strip one of their martial skills,

369
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,650
it also sends them

370
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,300
into a strange trance.

371
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,570
I thought I was the only one in this prison.

372
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,610
You must've been poisoned

373
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,300
and can't use your inner force, right?

374
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:53,650
Otherwise,

375
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,090
you would've sensed

376
00:20:55,090 --> 00:20:55,890
my presence a long time ago.

377
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:57,300
Yes.

378
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,850
I've been poisoned.

379
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,370
What's your name?

380
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,260
I'm Su Muyu, sir.

381
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,060
Su Muyu.

382
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,220
That's a nice name.

383
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,500
How should I address you, sir?

384
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,220
My surname is Zhuo.

385
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,170
Zhuo?

386
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,810
Why are you imprisoned here?

387
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,780
Someone wanted to use me,

388
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,330
someone wanted to kill me,

389
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,540
someone wanted to save me,

390
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,300
and I ended up here.

391
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,890
All because of what others wanted.

392
00:21:38,510 --> 00:21:39,780
What about you?

393
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:47,940
Yue'an,

394
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,020
live on.

395
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,850
When you grow up, become a sword deity

396
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,300
and rebuild No-Sword City.

397
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,060
Father.

398
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:05,980
Take care.

399
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,060
Father.

400
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,220
Father.

401
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:16,890
Father.

402
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,940
Father.

403
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,890
Father!

404
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:30,610
Father!

405
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,940
I'm seeking an answer.

406
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,220
What answer?

407
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,650
Something I have to know.

408
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,810
If it's something you must know,

409
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,460
why haven't you found it

410
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,130
after all these years?

411
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,540
Because

412
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,570
once I know the answer,

413
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,060
there's something I must do.

414
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:09,170
Something I couldn't do

415
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:11,940
back then.

416
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,890
Back then, you say?

417
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,090
I believe it won't be long before I can.

418
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:18,810
But first,

419
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,300
you need to get out of here.

420
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,300
It's said that in the Shadow Sect's prison,

421
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,850
people die,

422
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,570
no one ever leaves alive.

423
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,370
My friend will come to save me.

424
00:23:28,510 --> 00:23:29,570
Someone from Blood River

425
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:31,330
actually call another person

426
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:32,610
a friend?

427
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,780
You're different.

428
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,300
What if he never comes?

429
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:39,980
Then I'll take the chance

430
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,540
to rest.

431
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,260
You don't seem wary of me at all.

432
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,170
You're telling me everything.

433
00:23:47,350 --> 00:23:48,220
Because

434
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:49,740
your surname is Zhuo, sir.

435
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:51,980
Just because of a surname?

436
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,300
Yes.

437
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,460
Because my father's

438
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,090
surname is Zhuo.

439
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,020
I know it's you.

440
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:17,090
Father.

441
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,570
Yue'an,

442
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,130
you don't seem surprised

443
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,020
to see me again.

444
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,220
Drunken Dream Bone

445
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,170
sends one into a drunken dream.

446
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,130
I'd already guessed as much.

447
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,780
Even if all this is just an illusion,

448
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,270
I still can't help

449
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,700
but want to talk with you.

450
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,650
Yue'an,

451
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,220
you've suffered

452
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:41,740
all these years.

453
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,410
Father,

454
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,330
I'll find the one behind

455
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:48,130
the fall of No-Sword City

456
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,370
and restore

457
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,060
the honor that was once ours.

458
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:53,540
How have you been all this time?

459
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,300
It must've been tough

460
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:58,780
coming this far alone.

461
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:00,850
Not entirely.

462
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,700
All these years,

463
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,740
I've had my friends by my side.

464
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,850
Drunken Dream Bone

465
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,170
is acting up.

466
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:26,060
Yue'an,

467
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,780
I've always believed

468
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,780
you'll bring No-Sword City

469
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,060
back into the martial world.

470
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:32,700
But more than that,

471
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,370
knowing you've had friends by your side

472
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,260
all these years

473
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,570
brings my heart peace.

474
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:42,170
Father.

475
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:12,850
Something feels wrong here.

476
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:14,610
It's barely night,

477
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,090
and there's not a soul on this street.

478
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:20,810
Why are you smiling?

479
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:24,810
It's the Chinese New Year's Eve.

480
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,130
Naturally, the streets are empty.

481
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:30,260
Even the usually busiest vendors

482
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,370
have gone home.

483
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,020
What's so surprising about that?

484
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,780
It's the Chinese New Year's Eve today?

485
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,780
Smells great.

486
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,410
It really does.

487
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,260
What's that?

488
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,300
It smells like fried tofu.

489
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,220
It's a kind of dish

490
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,460
common folk make for the Chinese New Year.

491
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,570
They use puffy tofu

492
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:57,980
and deep-fry it.

493
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,020
For rich households,

494
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,810
they stuff them with meat.

495
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,610
I want to try some.

496
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:06,810
Go grab a few.

497
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,500
Chinese New Year's Eve

498
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:11,510
is one of the few good days in the year

499
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:13,220
for the poor.

500
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,370
Don't cause them trouble

501
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,540
on a day like this.

502
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,090
Fine.

503
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,090
Did you look forward to the Chinese New Year when you were a kid?

504
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,060
Of course.

505
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,780
It was

506
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,260
one of the rare good days

507
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,220
of the year.

508
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:33,170
No matter how many troubles

509
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,130
the past year brought,

510
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,890
when the new year began,

511
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,810
all those worries

512
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,330
seemed to disappear.

513
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,330
Everyone

514
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,330
ate happily,

515
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,410
and when dawn broke,

516
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,090
everything started anew.

517
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,650
You sound so bookish.

518
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,330
I heard people say

519
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:56,090
they like the Chinese New Year

520
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:57,700
because it's the only time

521
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,980
they get to eat

522
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,410
what they usually can't afford.

523
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,260
That's true for ordinary families.

524
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,650
When I was a kid, we were quite well off.

525
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,090
So I never really felt that way.

526
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,610
I forgot

527
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,300
you were born

528
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:14,500
with a silver spoon.

529
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,890
You've never celebrated the Chinese New Year?

530
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,740
As far back as I can remember,

531
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,570
my brother and I were always wandering.

532
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,090
Later, we joined Blood River.

533
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,500
There's no such thing

534
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,570
as a celebration there.

535
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,300
So

536
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,810
I've never had one.

537
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,810
It's a shame

538
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:56,260
no taverns are open today.

539
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,220
Otherwise, I'd buy you a drink.

540
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,020
Jeez.

541
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,260
Who's there?

542
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,940
Don't be afraid, madam.

543
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,500
We're just travelers passing through.

544
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:15,810
We'll rest a while

545
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,020
and be on our way.

546
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:21,040
It's the Chinese New Year.

547
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,500
You're still traveling?

548
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,170
Yes.

549
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,810
We had something to attend to

550
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:26,810
and got delayed.

551
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,130
Changhe,

552
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:28,810
let's go.

553
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,500
Sons.

554
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:36,220
On Chinese New Year's Eve,

555
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,220
only inns in big cities

556
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,300
stay open.

557
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:42,060
The nearest big city

558
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:45,020
is eight to ten hours away.

559
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,170
Why don't you

560
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,810
come have dinner at my place?

561
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,780
Sons,

562
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:55,890
please.

563
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,540
I beg you to keep an old woman company.

564
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,370
Come have dinner.

565
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:04,890
Alright.

566
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:07,810
Come on.

567
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:37,570
Have some tea.

568
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,810
Have a seat.

569
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,610
I'll make you a meal.

570
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,300
Sit. Make yourselves at home.

571
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:48,890
Aren't you worried it's a trap?

572
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,260
I'm not.

573
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,570
Are you afraid?

574
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,220
How can it be?

575
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,460
Smells like fried tofu.

576
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,320
Dinner's ready.

577
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,980
On a day like this,

578
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,370
everyone should sit down

579
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,330
and eat a bowl of steaming rice.

580
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,700
Are you

581
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,500
still traveling?

582
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:35,060
If your parents knew

583
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,810
you had nowhere

584
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,020
to stay tonight,

585
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,090
they'd be heartbroken.

586
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,090
This fried tofu smells amazing.

587
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,460
I could eat

588
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,300
a whole bowl of rice.

589
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,650
Are you all right, madam?

590
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,710
My Yuanxu

591
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,410
used to say the same thing.

592
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:18,640
He loved

593
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,650
my fried tofu.

594
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,940
I'm sorry.

595
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,570
It's fine.

596
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:36,410
He promised to return after the war

597
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:38,170
for the Chinese New Year.

598
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,700
Just now,

599
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:42,940
I heard a noise outside

600
00:32:44,270 --> 00:32:46,650
and thought it might be his companions

601
00:32:47,030 --> 00:32:49,810
bringing wrong news.

602
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,410
I thought

603
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,850
he'd come back.

604
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,330
I didn't expect

605
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,260
to see you instead.

606
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,220
I'll take you

607
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:06,260
as those he sent

608
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,460
to spend the Chinese New Year with me.

609
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,060
Alright, enough talk.

610
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,980
Eat first.

611
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,130
I'll fry you

612
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,700
some eggs.

613
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:42,890
Sit.

614
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,890
It's a kind gesture from the old lady.

615
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:49,540
Go on, try it.

616
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,370
The fried tofu is delicious.

617
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,460
But it's different from what you said.

618
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,690
This old lady may be poor,

619
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,770
but she added some meat.

620
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,170
She saved this for her child.

621
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,820
Even after they told her

622
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,540
he was dead,

623
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,340
she still holds hope.

624
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,980
This is my first reunion dinner

625
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,570
in my life.

626
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:48,900
Madam,

627
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,610
come eat with us.

628
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,090
What generosity.

629
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:53,820
Who'd have thought

630
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,030
Su Muyu, famed for his good reputation,

631
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,020
would leave nothing behind,

632
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,250
yet the ruthless Undertaker

633
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:01,980
left a silver ingot.

634
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,900
I put five copper coins here

635
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:08,770
after the meal.

636
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,460
Only five?

637
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,730
That's all I have.

638
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,460
Pauper.

639
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,250
