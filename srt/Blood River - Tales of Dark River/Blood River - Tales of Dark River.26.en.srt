Senior.

00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,570
You've spent all these years

7
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,620
practicing martial arts, huh?

8
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,900
To save lives,

9
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,410
a physician must know how to protect himself first.

10

Senior.

11
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,940
What a pity. You're being naive.

12
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,060
Senior, oh, senior.

13
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,060
I never thought

14
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,010

Come.

20
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,130
Let's go to the lantern festival.

21
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,220
Why has this courtyard

22
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,430
been quiet

23
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:30,260
since Su Muyu's departure?

24
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,450
Where is that cheerful daughter of mine?

25
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,060
I just think

26
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:41,820
Su Muyu

27
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,730

28
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,890
and keep things to himself.

29
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,290
And he's fine

30
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,610
making himself mentally exhausted.

31
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,500
Compared to Su Changhe,

32
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,060
Su Muyu isn't half bad.

33
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:00,610
You could figure out what's on Su Muyu's mind,

34
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:02,030
but you would never do the same

35

38

the idea of Master Mu paying the Wangchengshan Sect a visit

68
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:40,100
sounds rather frightening.

69
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,780
Turns out Master Mu

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,850

I don't think we're friends yet.

75
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,980
There's no telling what.

76
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,730
Death Summons, huh?

77
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,620
Is this how the Tang Clan

78
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,540
entertains a guest?

79
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,050
Since this is your turf,

80
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,910
why must you

81
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,290
hide your faces

82
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,140
in our presence?

83
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,580
Where is Tang Linghuang?

84
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,460
He agreed to see us.

85
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,660
Even if he left the city to greet us in advance,

86
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,340
why isn't he here?

87
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,540
What makes you think

88
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,140
that I'm not Tang Linghuang?

89
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,340
If you were Tang Linghuang,

00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,020
this peach wood sword of mine

91
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,050

92
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,850
Are you saying

93
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,460
that I'm less than him?

94
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,020
I never said so.

95
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:51,700
Xuewei.

96
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,700
How dare you try to poison us.

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,580
How pathetic.

98
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,850
Pathetic?

99
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,730
My family has practiced dark arts for years.

100
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,370
When it comes to using poison,

101
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,980
we're as good as

102
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,780

Through the art of sigils, the true flame is revealed.

That's the Tang Clan's Fourfold Blackwater Formation.

107
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,930
Trying to use your poison in the presence of Poisonous Blossom?

108
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,610
Ridiculous.

109
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,220
This is awe-inspiring.

110
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,410
This lady

111
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
has managed to refine

112
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,170
her poisoning technique to such an exquisite state.

113
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,100
Poisoning technique?

114
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:02,290
It's more than that.

115
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,250
I bet this will

116
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,460
get more interesting.

117
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,900
Mister.

118
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:23,250
Our presence here means no harm.

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,980
Why must you

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,730
resort to violence?

121
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,540
You're from the Blood River,

122
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:29,730
so there's nothing good.

123
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,170
I got it now.

124
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,700
That lady

125
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,940
is a poisonous person.

126
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,580
I never expected the Mu family of Blood River

127
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:37,610
would manage to train

128
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,980
such a poisonous person.

129
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,940
That's Poisonous Blossom from the Blood River.

130
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,700
I want her.

131
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,180
I get it now.

132
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,820
The Tang Clan

133
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,890

134
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,890
That's why you're not happy

135
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,700
about our presence here.

136
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,820
Nonsense!

137
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,010
My body is all poisonous.

138
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,890
You sure are courting death.

139
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,610
What's going on?

140
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,980

Blood blooms beneath the skin.

143
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,220
A single cut means instant death.

144
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,650
Why do they remain unharmed?

145
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,530
Could it be

146
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:04,730
that there are poisonous persons like Xuewei

147

148
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,100
I get it.

149

Both of them

150
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,890
are the drugged puppets

151
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,980

152

They're numb.

153
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,580
They show no fear.

154
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,250
And they're immune to all poisons.

155
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:22,940
I see it now!

156
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,850
Xuewei!

157
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,490
How rare.

158
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,180
I never thought there'd be

159
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,730
such a perfect poisonous person in this world.

160

Who are you?

161
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,530
You'll find out soon.

162
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,980
Take her away.

163
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,370

164
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,180
Never underestimate the Tang Clan.

Where did this little white snake come from?

167
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,490
That's a Death-Chasing Serpent.

168
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,650
Death-Chasing Serpent?

169
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,340
Every disciple of the Medicine King Valley

When faced with deadly danger,

172
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:47,400
we secretly release the Death-Chasing Serpent.

173
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,470
It will crawl over mountains and rivers,

174
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,400
traveling all the way

175
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,850
to find another disciple of the Valley.

176
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,180
I never knew about that.

177
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,700
Baicao

178
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,460
is always such a cautious one.

179
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,490

What were you here for?

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,890
I was the Umbrella Ghost of the Blood River then.

194
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,340
What else could it have been for?

195
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,940
I see.

196
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:51,540
[Jingsi Teahouse]

197
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,460
What are they doing, Su Muyu?

198
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,580
Do you get it?

199
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:09,650
Thirty Thousand.

200
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,700
Four Bamboos.

201
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,340
It's called Mahjong.

202
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,370
It's very popular here in Jin City.

203
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,900
They drink tea and play mahjong,

204
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,870
or pull up a stool

205
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,450
and gather around for a "Dragon Gate Array" session.

206
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,730
That's daily life for the people of Jin City.

207
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,610
Dragon Gate Array?

208
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,610
Is that some powerful formation?

209
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,010
Well, you could say that.

210
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,500
Their posture when gathered together

211
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,510
looks just like General Xue of the old dynasty

212
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,850
when he encircled the northern tribes.

213
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,380
But with Tang Clan guarding inside Jin City

214
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,700
and Wangchengshan Sect defending the outside,

215
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,300
peace has reigned for years.

216
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,790
Why would Jin City folk

217
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,370
need to set up any "Dragon Gate Array"?

218
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,180
It's just a saying.

219
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,340
They just gather to gossip

220
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,460
about whatever's been happening lately.

221
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,220
So basically, they're just bragging together.

222
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,420
Su Muyu.

223
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,940
Why is it that I'm the one asking questions,

224
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,100
and you're answering them?

225
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,700
Have we switched roles all of a sudden?

226
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,490
Wasn't it you

227
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,530
who always knew nothing

228
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,580
about stuff?

229
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,770
Back then, to deal with a powerful enemy,

230
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,650
I stayed in Jin City for three whole months.

231
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:18,770
So I got to know this place quite well.

232
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:19,980
Mahjong!

233
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:28,730
That means you've won, right?

234
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,340
Of course I have.

235
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,700
[Lei Yunhe, Lei Clan]
128 points in total! Pay up!

236
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,820
That's sheer luck, brat.

237
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,850
Come on, again!

238
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:38,220
Still playing?

239
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,060
Who are you? We're in a game!

240
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,130
We have no time to entertain you.

241
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:43,580
Master Mu.

242
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:44,490
You brat!

243
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:46,460
What's that supposed to mean?

244
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:47,890
Is he insulting me?

245
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,010
That's the slang here.

246
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,610
He was just greeting you warmly.

247
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,980
How funny.

248
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,530
This gentleman sure is full of humor.

249
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,130
Brat.

250
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,100
If you hadn't sounded so sincere,

251
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,420
I'd have thought you were provoking me.

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,180
Master Mu.

253
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,300
Is that how you greet people here?

254
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,700
Patriarch and Master Su.

255
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,100
Why didn't you inform me of your presence here

256
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:40,980
in advance?

257
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,490
I could have made preparations early.

258
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:43,980
This friend of mine

259
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,300
stayed in Jin City for three months then.

260
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,890
You were the one who hosted him, weren't you?

261
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,220
Yes.

262
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,250
Yes, yes.

263
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,220
So you taught him to greet people

264
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:55,820
by calling them brat?

265
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:57,180
Well...

00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,120
[Master Mu, Jin City Mole]
I was only joking

268
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,980
with Master Su.

269
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,440
I didn't expect Master Su

270
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,130
would take it seriously.

271
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,390
After that, I...

272
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,220
I...

273
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,370
I didn't explain it.

274
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,010
No wonder Liu Yilong seemed so furious

275
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,100
when I was having a duel with him

276
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,730
then.

277
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,060
That's actually an insult, huh?

278
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,060
Pardon me, I...

279
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,130
Because you always acted like

280
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,370
a polite assassin?

281
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,370
You even greet people before killing them.

282
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,340
I bet Liu Yilong was so mad

283
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:27,700
that he couldn't even hold his sword well

284
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,180
when you called him that.

285
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,650
That's enough.

286
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:36,610
All right, I'll stop laughing.

287
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,420
You mood changes faster than the weather here in Jin City.

Yes, sir.

291

without notice.

292

With your status,

00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,220
you can come and go as you please.

296
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,770
Why would you inform me of it?

297
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,890
That was a slip of the tongue.

298
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,850
That was a slip of the tongue.

299
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:00,420
I misspoke.

300

What I mean is

302
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,940
I already told you so long ago.

303
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,330
In fact,

304
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:05,900
they've been waiting here

305
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:06,900
for us too.

306
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,140

Who?

308
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,810
One is Mu Xuewei.

309
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,180
Poisonous Blossom?

310
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,980
As the other one,

311
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:17,020
you haven't met him

312
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:17,930
after years of being stationed here in Jin City.

313
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:18,870
However,

314
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,360
he's now your family head.

315
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,490
And that's Mu Qingyang.

316
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,460
Well...

317
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,050
You haven't seen them before?

318
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,490
I swear.

319
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,940
I really haven't seen them.

320
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,530
If Mu family head

321
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,770
ever came to my teahouse,

322
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,090
how could I not know?

323
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,380
The situation looks bad.

324
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,420
I'd say it's very bad.

325
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,980
Changhe.

326
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:52,010
Where is Yumo?

327
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:53,510
Before entering the city,

328
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,570
she was still with us.

329
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,140
Yumo

330
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,660
went ahead of us

331
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:58,530
and infiltrated the Tang Clan.

332
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,050
She infiltrated the Tang Clan?

333
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,220
They say Tang Fort is nothing but dangerous.

334
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:09,570
But it doesn't seem hard to get into it.

00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,130
You're pretty agile.

339
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,180
Don't move.

340
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,710
Stay still

341
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,900
or don't blame me

342
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,140
for being merciless.

343
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,620
Who exactly are you?

344
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,290
That Fingertip Blade of yours seems nice.

345
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,730
And it looks somewhat familiar to me.

346
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,330
Who taught you that?

347
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,420
Why do you ask?

348
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,940
Are you threatening me?

349
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:55,320
I actually figured it out.

350
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:57,280
You're Tang Lianyue's disciple,

351
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:57,940
aren't you?

352
00:18:58,640 --> 00:18:59,570
How do you know that?

353
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,490
I knew it.

354
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,250
Like master,

355
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,250
like disciple.

356
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,250
How foolish.

357
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,460
I just probed into it,

358
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,940
and you told me everything.

359
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,090
You tricked me?

360
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,290
You just asked me a question.

361
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,050
You asked who I am.

362
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,570
I can tell you now.

363
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,220
I am...

00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,770
Would someone like my master

373
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,460
have a woman he adores?

374
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,290
But even if he did have one,

375
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:54,010
he wouldn't tell us for sure.

376
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:56,180
What an adorable disciple.

378
00:19:59,480 --> 00:19:59,980
All right.

My name is Tang Lian.

382
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,570
Lian, as in lotus flower.

383
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,090
Your master is Tang Lianyue,

384
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,420
and you're Tang Lian.

385
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,330
How amusing.

386
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,460
Tell me where he is.

387
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:13,740
Take me to him.

388
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,900
Wait!

389
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,540
Even if my master has someone he loves,

390
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,200
what proof do you have

391
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,260
that you're the one?

392
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,860
You need proof for that?

393
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:26,730
Fine.

394
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:35,980
Looks familiar, doesn't it?

395
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,980
That's Master's Fingertip Blade!

396
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:39,900
Yes.

397
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,660
Your master gave it to me.

398
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,120
He said

399
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,010
it was our token of affection.

400
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,090
Do you believe me now?

401
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,980
Surely you don't think

402
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,250
a weak woman

403
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:51,290
like me

404
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,490
could have seized his personal weapon

405
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,220
by force, do you?

406
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,250
But...

407
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,660
Mistress.

408
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,900
My master has been in seclusion lately.

409
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:05,420
Even I haven't seen him for a long time.

410
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:08,010
Seclusion?

411
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,980
After entering the Lianyue Pavilion,

412
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,000
he hasn't come out since then.

413
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:14,070
Martial Uncle said

414
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:15,010
that he went into seclusion to cultivate.

415
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:16,860
Right there.

416
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,660
He's in seclusion because he doesn't know I'm here.

417
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,290
He'll show himself

418
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:24,490
if I go to him.

419
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,730
That won't do, Mistress.

420
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,880
There are two inner-hall martial uncles guarding outside the Lianyue Pavilion.

421
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,380
They're always strict when it comes to that,

422
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,530
even though you're close to Master.

423
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,090
I've asked to see Master several times,

424
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:35,940
but I was always turned away.

425
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:39,980
Is that so?

426
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,460
Mistress!

427
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,570
Mistress.

428
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:51,420
There's certainly something off

429
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,570
about Uncle Fulu and Uncle Tianlu.

430
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,090
What do you mean?

431
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,420
By seniority, those two

432
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,010
are considered Master's elders.

433
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,460
Why would they be guarding for him?

434
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,730
Only one of them did that.

435
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,380
Now both of them are here...

436
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,010
Could it be

437
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,050
that Master...

438
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,570
I'll go check on it.

439
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,660
Mistress!

440
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,700
Who's there?

441
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,380
Uncle Tianlu.

442
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,090
You're here too, Uncle Fulu.

443
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,050
It's you, Tang Lian.

444
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:38,810
Can't sleep again?

445
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,700
I'm missing my master,

446
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,770
so I'm here to have a look.

447
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,420
Your master is in seclusion.

448
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,090
Looks like

449
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,140
this seclusion of his

450
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:48,860
is truly important.

451
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:50,700
Martial Uncles, thank you

452
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,860
for staying up to guard him.

453
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,220
Fulu.

454
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,490
There was some noise above just now.

455
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:01,860
I'll go check on it.

456
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,620
What is he trying to do?

457
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:24,810
Stop!

458
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,490
This is…

459
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:43,940
Tang Lianyue.

460
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,250
Master!

461
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,940
Master.

462
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,220
How could this be?

463
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,220
This is…

464
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,700
Who are you?

465
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:14,660
Go!

466
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:15,700
Get help!

467
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,980
You must wait for my return.

468
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:30,380
No.

469
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,250
Why not?

470
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:37,980
No matter

471
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:40,220
how gifted the brat is,

472
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,570
he's as temperamental as his master.

473
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,570
Now

474
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,530
he already knows his master is trapped by us.

475
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,660
We can't let him live.

476
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:49,770
Hold on.

477
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,460
Only he and Tang Linghuang know

478
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,180
where the hidden weapons vault is.

479
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,260
Before we figure that out,

480
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,460
Madam won't let us kill him.

481
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,460
Tang Lian is his only disciple

482
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,220
as well as his weakness.

483
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:17,050
Tianlu.

484
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:18,980
Lock him up

485
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:19,940
somewhere for now.

486
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,520
I'll go report to Madam

487
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,460
about what just happened.

488
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,860
I'm back.

489
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:35,940
Well,

490
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,940
what did you find?

491
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,860
I snuck into the Tang Clan

492
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,330
and ran into Tang Lianyue's young disciple,

493
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,900
Tang Lian.

494
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,490
Only then did I learn

495
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,620
that Tang Lianyue has been trapped in the Lianyue Pavilion.

496
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:43,770
To protect me,

497
00:25:44,070 --> 00:25:44,770
Tang Lian was caught

498
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,530
by Tang Tianlu and Tang Fulu.

499
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,090
We must go back and rescue them.

500
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,220
Don't panic, Yumo.

501
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,700
Tell me more about it.

502
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,260
Some unknown thing

503
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,630
has frozen Tang Lianyue solid.

504
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,620
Within three chi,

505
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,310
no living thing can approach me.

506
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,700
It's the Frostmoon Cocoon.

507
00:25:58,350 --> 00:25:59,900
Miss Bai ever brought that up.

508
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,140
It's extremely rare,

509
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:03,560
but it can instantly freeze

510
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,480
even a master.

511
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,130
However, it doesn't last forever.

512
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,420
Perhaps they're there every day to replenish its effect,

513
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,070
keeping Tang Lianyue under control long-term.

514
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,530
As for why they don't kill him,

515
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,290
maybe they need

516
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,250
something from him.

517
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:16,700
Maybe

518
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,180
Qingyang and Xuewei

519
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,700
are inside the Tang Clan too.

520
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,330
Has something happened

521
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,770
to Qingyang and Xuewei?

522
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,660
Yes.

523
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,010
The Tang Clan

524
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,250
is truly a hostile place.

525
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:30,980
Although it's dangerous,

526
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,290
we must enter the Tang Clan again.

527
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,010
However, we need

528
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,180
to come up with a thorough plan first.

529
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,840
Those we sent to Jin City

530
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,940
haven't returned yet?

531
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:44,860
No.

532
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,420
We've lost contact

533
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,540
with both the new envoys

534
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,220
and the disciples stationed in Jin City.

535
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,220
We could still send Xuanwu Guardian missives then.

536
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,980
Now, even that's impossible.

537
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,530
So we believe

538
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,940
something major

539
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:00,810
is about to happen in Jin City.

540
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,010
If that's the case,

541
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,860
it must be tied to the Tang Clan.

542
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:11,180
What happens in the Tang Clan is a martial affair.

543
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:13,660
It has little to do with the Baixiao Hall.

544
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,660
Yet

545
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,180
Tang Lianyue

546
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:17,380
from the Tang Clan

547
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,380
is my close friend.

548
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,660
He's a man of principle,

549
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,490
so why hasn't he returned to Tianqi City

550
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,010
to report in a long time?

551
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,900
If the Tang Clan changes,

552
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,860
the entire martial world will change.

553
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,460
Any word from the Blood River?

554
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:32,250
Su Changhe, Su Muyu, and the rest

555
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:33,860
are already in Jin City.

556
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,140
However, we haven't heard from them

557
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,700
since then.

558
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,140
Just relying on the Blood River

559
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,460
won't put my mind at ease.

560
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,620
We need to send

561
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,660
someone capable and reliable

562
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,810
to the Tang Clan.

563
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,120
[Tang Clan is in turmoil.]

564
00:27:48,150 --> 00:27:49,340
[Second City Lord, please go check on it on Guardian Azure Dragon's behalf. Ji.]

565
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,810
What a hassle.

566
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,010
It's been days.

567
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,570
These Tang Clan men just won't give up.

568
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:26,770
Could it be

569
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,460
this is where my life ends?

570
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,490
Go.

571
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,010
If there are any Blood River disciples in Jin City,

572
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,220
come to my rescue!

573
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,180
He's over there!

574
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,140
Give chase!

575
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,730
Looks like you're here

576
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,700
after being chased by your enemy.

577
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:17,770
Are you

578
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,420
from the Wangchengshan Sect?

579
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:21,530
Wangchengshan Sect?

580
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,290
Do I look like a Taoist to you?

581
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,810
Li.

582
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,250
Do I look like one?

583
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:40,810
Mister.

584
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,050
Saving a life

585
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,490
is a sacred act.

586
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,380
I have many rare treasures,

587
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,530
and I can trade them with you.

588
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,940
I'm not interested in that.

589
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,530
Just tell me

590
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,380
who your enemy is.

591
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,290
It's the Tang Clan.

592
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,490
Tang Clan?

593
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,770
You're in luck.

594
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:12,730
I won't ask your name

595
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,730
or where you're from.

596
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,250
If the Tang Clan wants you dead,

597
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,090
I'll save you.

598
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,180
Get on.

599
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,090
Where do you think you're running?

600
00:30:30,270 --> 00:30:31,660
Thunder shakes the heavens and earth.

601
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,050
One strike splits the sky for ninety thousand miles!

602
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,250
Thank you for saving me.

603
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:18,940
Aren't you curious why I saved you

604
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,690
at the mention of the Tang Clan?

605
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,140
If you don't want to tell me,

606
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,180
I won't ask you.

607
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,620
Asking too many questions brings trouble

608
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,940
in this martial world.

609
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,220
You're a wise man.

610
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,940
My surname's Lei.

611
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:33,770
Lei...

612
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,290
Lei?

613
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,810
Lei as in Lei Fortress?

614
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,330
That's right.

615
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:41,570
The Lei Fortress

616
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,900
never gets along with the Tang Clan.

617
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,380
Causing them trouble now and then

618
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,010
sounds fun to me.

619
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,700
You're their enemy,

620
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,620
so I saved you.

621
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,490
You saved the right man, then.

622
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,290
If I make it out alive this time,

623
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:00,250
I'll be sure to give them some trouble

624
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,330
to repay your kindness.

625
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,580
[Refined Brew, Serene Mind]

626
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,380
Those are Soul-Calling Paper Butterflies.

627
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,980
Soul-Calling Paper Butterflies...

628
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,220
That must be Master Mu.

629
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,220
Yes.

630
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,180
Only Master Mu

631
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,700
can summon Soul-Calling Paper Butterflies.

632
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,810
When one appears,

633
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,220
the underworld gates open

634
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,460
and ten thousand butterflies follow.

635
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,980
Mu Qingyang resorted to this Soul-Calling Paper Butterfly.

636
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,140
Looks like

637
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,290
he...

638
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,090
That's good news.

639
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,090
Mu Qingyang is still alive.

640
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:43,460
But the bad news is

641
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,660
Mu Qingyang

642
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:46,250
is about to perish.

643
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,220
Let it lead us there.

644
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:49,460
Sure.

645
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,700
Wait for me here.

646
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,420
May I know your name, mister?

647
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,530
I must remember

648
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:12,810
the favor you've shown me.

649
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,900
My name is Lei Yunhe.

650
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,530
It's the Twin Cranes of Lei Clan.

651
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:18,770
I've heard of you.

652
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:19,620
What an honor.

653
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,730
I have some business to attend to,

654
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,290
so I must go now.

655
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,940
I hope you

656
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,140
will cause them trouble

657
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,570
as promised.

658
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:28,810
Li.

659
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,180
Let's go.

660
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,010
What an interesting man.

661
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,980
The Umbrella Ghost of the Blood River.

662
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:24,650
Who would've thought

663
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,090
I'd run into you here?

664
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,460
Elder Tang Tianlu of the Tang Clan.

665
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,460
We've met before.

666
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,210
Is this how

667
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,460
the Tang Clan

668
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,570
greet its guests?

669
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,090
Who would ever mistake the Umbrella Ghost of the Blood River

670
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:43,300
for a guest?

671
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:45,210
It's said

672
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,260
that you often appear

673
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,570
on cold, rainy nights.

674
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,050
Like how an underworld reaper

675
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:53,900
or a wandering soul would do.
