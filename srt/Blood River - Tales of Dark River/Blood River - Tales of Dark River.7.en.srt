[Episode 7]

6
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,330
Please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

7
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,020
and inherit the title of Patriarch.

8
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,180
Lord Kui, please wield the Dormant Dragon Sword

9
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:58,210
and inherit the title of Patriarch.

10
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,900
All, rise.

11
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,850
I promise you.

12
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,010
When this is over,

13
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,940
I will take you home,

14
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,170
with honor

15
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,260
and in freedom.

16
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,500
Sir.

17
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:19,570
Sir,

18
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,850
Senior Fanhua

19
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,170
was killed by the Su family

20
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,450
while seizing the Dormant Dragon Sword.

21
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,740
In the days after,

22
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,410
Senior Jinke, who was to receive him,

23
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,010
was ambushed,

24
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,890
no remains found.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,890
Fanhua,

26
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:37,780
your health was poor,

27
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,170
so no wine for you,

28
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,450
only tea.

29
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:42,980
You even said

30
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,140
tea would help you live longer.

31
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,540
But I told you,

32
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,380
We're assassins.

33
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,260
We dance with death.

34
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,760
If fun lasts a day,

35
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,780
we make it count.

36
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,290
My condolences, Sir.

37
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:11,420
[Xie Ba, head of the Xie family]

38
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,780
Where is Xie Qidao's disciple?

39
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,810
Xie Buxie lost to Su Muyu,

40
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,490
and then...

41
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,100
went missing.

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,810
No trace since?

43
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,540
You mean

44
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:39,050
Xie Buxie defected?

45
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:40,980
I dare not say that.

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,540
In Blood River,

47
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,170
there is no "missing".

48
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,460
If he left without leave,

49
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,730
that is desertion!

50
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:50,540
Send two men to find him.

51
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,610
Also,

52
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,930
send word to Xie Qidao

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,580
to come

54
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,250
to Jiuxiao City.

55
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,730
Regarding Uncle Qidao...

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,220
I visited him before,

57
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:02,850
but...

58
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,250
he drove me out.

59
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,020
Everything has a price.

60
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:11,460
If he wants to shield

61
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,380
his disciple,

62
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,330
he will pay for it!

63
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,080
Blood River

64
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,730
is not some martial sect.

65
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,100
He doesn't get to shut in and train!

66
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,640
And now...

67
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,220
Who allowed you to stand?

68
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:33,460
On your knees.

69
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:35,730
Kneel three days straight!

70
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:50,810
Sir.

71
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,780
Who killed him?

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,580
The Su family.

73
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,290
Su Zhe.

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,070
His gold ring

75
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,400
would cause wounds like this.

76
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,050
The Su family

77
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,500
actually sent that monster.

78
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:33,700
They all stand

79
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,790
with the Patriarch?

80
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,610
Likely not.

81
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,260
He showed up

82
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,640
to kill the miracle physician

83
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,520
of Medicine King Valley,

84
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:42,800
but for some reason

85
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,490
he suddenly killed our men.

86
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,410
I fought with my life

87
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,980
to bring back the young master's body.

88
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,460
Rise, all of you.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,490
In Blood River, we live on the edge.

90
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:58,370
That's the way of things.

91
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,900
Even if the dead is my son,

92
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,460
you need not mourn!

93
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:10,930
Who's coming?

94
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:17,490
The Death Coffin?

95
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,140
Locked inside The Death Coffin

96
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,460
is that madman.

97
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,340
Sir,

98
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:23,610
you must not open this coffin.

99
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,370
It's far too dangerous!

100
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,610
The Death Coffin

101
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,100
has been under the watch of the Soul Reapers' Hall.

102
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,540
Why is it here?

103
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:31,410
I requested it from the Soul Reapers' Hall.

104
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,810
Since they agreed to lend it,

105
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,850
it shows their loyalty lies

106
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,460
with our Mu family.

107
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,290
Ah, Changhe...

108
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,490
either you don't act at all,

109
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,540
or when you do,

110
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,660
you plunge Blood River into chaos.

111
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:13,980
Master,

112
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,900
stop mocking me.

113
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:18,060
Look at me.

114
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,300
Mu Zizhe beat me to a pulp.

115
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,100
I'm not as tough as you claim.

116
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,850
Xie Fanhua is dead,

117
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,140
you know that, right?

118
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:30,780
I killed him.

119
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,460
That guy

120
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,100
was already

121
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,010
half dead anyway.

122
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,340
The Xie family

123
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,870
had long wished him dead.

124
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,180
Without his death,

125
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,360
those younger ones

126
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,400
couldn't step into view.

127
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,010
If Xie Fanhua were healthy,

128
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,890
there's no doubt

129
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,370
he'd be the Xie family's next head.

130
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,490
You killed him,

131
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,010
that's on your record.

132
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:56,850
But killing Mu Bai...

133
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:59,490
you went too far.

134
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,100
What?

135
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,980
Mu Bai is dead too?

136
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,020
Who did it?

137
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,010
You don't know?

138
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,700
Su Zhe.

139
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,180
Who sent him?

140
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,850
We're doomed.

141
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,220
Uncle Zhe's usually

142
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,650
the laziest of us,

143
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,770
why so eager this time?

144
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,650
Since he killed Mu Bai,

145
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:26,910
if I run into Mu Zizhe again,

146
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,310
he'll skin me alive!

147
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,920
Mu Zizhe is a madman.

148
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,740
Now you've killed his son,

149
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:36,640
he won't just skin you,

150
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,690
he'll skin

151
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,740
the whole Su family.

152
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,490
For the past hundred years,

153
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,530
Blood River had its infighting.

154
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,300
But the standoff among the Three Families

155
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,130
never changed.

156
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,730
This time

157
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:56,890
may be different.

158
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,850
Master,

159
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,460
this really isn't on me.

160
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,820
Uncle Zhe did it himself.

161
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,060
I sent him to kill

162
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,940
the miracle physician,

163
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,820
not Mu Bai.

164
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,100
Enough.

165
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,010
What's done is done.

166
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,250
Since that's the case,

167
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,610
we may as well

168
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,060
make all Blood River bear the name Su.

169
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,370
Master, you're bold and brilliant.

170
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,230
I, Su Changhe,

171
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,510
will follow you to the death!

172
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,800
You'll die for me,

173
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,720
but what about Su Zhe?

174
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,370
Uncle Zhe...

175
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,610
what about him?

176
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,130
Master feared Mu Zizhe's revenge,

177
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,010
so he just sent a unit

178
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,120
to reinforce Su Zhe.

179
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,530
But they found

180
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,690
Su Zhe didn't fight Su Muyu,

181
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,560
instead he chose to travel with Su Muyu

182
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,340
and that miracle physician

183
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:03,420
back to the Spider's Nest.

184
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,220
So Su Muyu turned Uncle Zhe

185
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,490
to his side?

186
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,490
Master.

187
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,220
Just now...

188
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:28,730
Buxie came back.

189
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:33,420
[Xie Qidao of the Xie family]

190
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,010
He's back?

191
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,980
The task is done?

192
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,220
He said nothing about it,

193
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,370
just left this.

194
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:58,060
He fought Su Muyu.

195
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,940
This is the eighth move he mastered?

196
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,510
Buxie said

197
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,250
this still isn't the true eighth move.

198
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,610
He needs a few more years to roam.

199
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,340
He'll return once he finds the answer.

200
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,010
He's mad.

201
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,420
In Blood River,

202
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,810
if one goes roaming the martial world

203
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,870
and stays out over ten days,

204
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:25,280
the Soul Reapers' Hall's kill writ

205
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,540
will be issued

206
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,460
without hesitation.

207
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,700
That's the second matter.

208
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,420
We received a letter from the family head.

209
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,490
What does it say?

210
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,580
I can't bother reading

211
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,730
their usual nonsense.

212
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,700
Just tell me straight.

213
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,890
The head says,

214
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,370
Xie Buxie's ignored the mission

215
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,820
and left Blood River without leave,

216
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:46,730
a capital offense.

217
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,850
But if you will come out

218
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,060
to Jiuxiao City

219
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,130
and aid the Xie family,

220
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,060
they'll ask the Soul Reapers' Hall

221
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,130
for a writ

222
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,060
pardoning Xie Buxie.

223
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,610
Xie Ba...

224
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,820
is quite the schemer.

225
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,940
[Luojiuxiao Inn]

226
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:16,980
Medicine time.

227
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:19,580
Feed me.

228
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:20,610
Hey...

229
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,490
What?

230
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,650
Shouldn't you feed me

231
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:26,180
after you hurt me?

232
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,340
I'm not clinging to you for life anyway.

233
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,340
Count yourself lucky.

234
00:14:00,390 --> 00:14:01,770
Such a thoughtful young lord.

235
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,530
Stalling me with this trick

236
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,820
isn't a good idea.

237
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,100
Your wounds will heal,

238
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,250
and I...

239
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,460
will seek the Patriarch

240
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,420
to avenge Second Master Tang.

241
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,250
Bitter medicine.

242
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,420
Then wait till I'm healed,

243
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,100
and we'll talk.

244
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,340
After all, a Xuanwu Guardian

245
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,010
should pay his debt first,

246
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,130
then seek revenge.

247
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:45,250
Uncle Zhe.

248
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:51,010
That noise you made yesterday

249
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,220
was way too loud.

250
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,460
I heard it all.

251
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,700
Do you really want to be Patriarch?

252
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,250
You think I'm fit for it?

253
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,370
No.

254
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:01,700
If my daughter

255
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,650
takes a shine to you,

256
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:03,850
absolutely not.

257
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,700
If she doesn't,

258
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:07,890
then maybe.

259
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:13,460
You jest, Uncle Zhe.

260
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,460
News came from outside

261
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:19,370
that Xie Fanhua is dead.

262
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,580
Changhe killed him.

263
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,130
Mu Bai is dead too.

264
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:25,700
I killed him.

265
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,340
Didn't Mu Bai already flee?

266
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:36,610
So what do you think?

267
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,890
Changhe was behind that.

268
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:44,100
Mu Qingyang secretly joined

269
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:45,370
Changhe's faction.

270
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,580
And on Changhe's orders,

271
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,370
he killed Mu Bai

272
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:50,490
to frame you.

273
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,220
That brat...

274
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,940
He even schemes against me.

275
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,730
He killed two young masters with one strike,

276
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,300
seeming to cripple two families,

277
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,460
but really dumping the blame on the Su family.

278
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,010
This Blood River chaos

279
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:08,770
has shifted

280
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,130
from Three Families racing to kill the Patriarch

281
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,460
and seize the Dormant Dragon Sword

282
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,370
into a full-blown free-for-all.

283
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,580
The greatest gains

284
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:17,770
often come

285
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,220
from the greatest chaos.

286
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,460
Changhe's game

287
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,060
has reached its endgame.

288
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,770
I should've guessed

289
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:30,250
he wasn't helping

290
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:31,490
the Su family.

291
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:33,770
He wanted the Dormant Dragon Sword himself.

292
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,820
But even with the sword in hand,

293
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,820
it's not over.

294
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,300
Things were never as simple

295
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,420
as Changhe thought.

296
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,100
Looks like

297
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,130
you have a plan of your own.

298
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:17,940
The poison's nearly cleared.

299
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,530
Has the young miracle physician returned?

300
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,730
Long time no see,

301
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:40,460
Sir.

302
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,330
Zhe?

303
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,010
Why did you

304
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,050
suddenly show up here?

305
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,090
Did that brat Su Jinhui

306
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,940
send you to kill me?

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,240
Years ago,

308
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,200
I once risked my life

309
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,860
for you.

310
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,620
Now we meet again,

311
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,940
Sir,

312
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,190
you actually think

313
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:11,460
I came to kill you?

314
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,250
That stings.

315
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,330
Isn't it so?

316
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,090
It was, at first,

317
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:25,050
but my daughter said

318
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:26,660
if we took the fee,

319
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,330
we must cure you.

320
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,180
I listened to her.

321
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,980
Your daughter?

322
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,380
The Wen family of Medicine King Valley...

323
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,700
No wonder.

324
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:44,770
So,

325
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,460
I should thank you, Sir.

326
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,420
If not for that business with you,

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:49,860
I'd have had no way

328
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,180
to reunite with my girl.

329
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,090
Miracle physician indeed.

330
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,290
Yes.

331
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,380
Your poison

332
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,620
is mostly cleared.

333
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:13,860
But remember:

334
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,010
for the next few days,

335
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:16,700
don't use inner force at will,

336
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,860
or all is wasted.

337
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,220
So you used Soul-Swap Technique

338
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,730
to probe my memory

339
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,610
to seek your father.

340
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,380
And to cure your poison, too!

341
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,770
I didn't lie to you.

342
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,860
Look,

343
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,250
you're back

344
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:35,940
to being healthy.

345
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:40,050
About the fee we agreed on,

346
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,460
shouldn't we settle that?

347
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,330
Everything I promised

348
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,260
will be paid in full.

349
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,140
I'm just curious,

350
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,720
miracle physician,

351
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,380
how did you cure me?

352
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,490
I used Soul-Swap Technique

353
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,010
to share your senses,

354
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:57,980
so I also tasted

355
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,490
that poison's agony

356
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,770
throughout your body.

357
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:02,770
But in the process,

358
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,220
I found

359
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,380
among the body's 720 points,

360
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,330
one point

361
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,900
untouched by that poison.

362
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:11,730
That's the Zhiyang point.

363
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,380
So I used a silver needle

364
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:15,420
to herd the poison

365
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:16,810
and drive it all

366
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,810
into Zhiyang.

367
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:21,090
Then you set one more needle

368
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,220
to vent the toxins out?

369
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:25,810
"Vented them out"?

370
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,180
Not that simple.

371
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,730
This poison

372
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,810
should've been incurable.

373
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,420
Only one way:

374
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,090
life for life.

375
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,860
Life for life?

376
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,700
You need someone

377
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,140
with superb inner force

378
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,050
to cover Zhiyang with a palm

379
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:54,140
and draw the poison out.

380
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,860
That means

381
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,940
taking it into himself.

382
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,810
Then here's the question:

383
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:02,010
in this Spider's Nest,

384
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,090
who would trade a life

385
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,090
for you, Sir?

386
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,660
It was Kewen.

387
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,180
I still remember

388
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,250
the day we entered the Spider's Nest together.

389
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:26,810
Back then,

390
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,660
you could barely stand.

391
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,570
Yet before him,

392
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,420
you kept a steady front,

393
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,530
never lowering your guard.

394
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,530
But that very man

395
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,860
before whom you refused

396
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,530
to drop your guard,

397
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,810
he gave up

398
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,010
his life for you

399
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,140
in the end.

400
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,860
Sir,

401
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,680
what was there

402
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:49,220
between you two?

403
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,400
Simply put,

404
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,290
they were once brothers who shared a bond.

405
00:21:58,750 --> 00:21:59,680
Later one became

406
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,490
the almighty Patriarch,

407
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,460
the other

408
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,770
a hunchbacked, ugly gatekeeper.

409
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:08,180
That's about it.

410
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,490
Where is he now?

411
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,570
He's gone.

412
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:22,570
Uncle Arhat,

413
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,660
you really won't wait

414
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,380
for the Patriarch to wake?

415
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,490
No.

416
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,530
Even if he wakes,

417
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,180
there's no need to meet again.

418
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,090
What lay between us

419
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,900
is wiped clean

420
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,010
from this moment.

421
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:49,940
As for this Spider's Nest,

422
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:53,810
handle it as you see fit.

423
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,770
If the Patriarch is fine,

424
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,180
then this Spider's Nest

425
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,220
should now belong to Medicine King Valley.

426
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,290
Very well.

427
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,900
That young miracle physician

428
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,090
is a fine girl.

429
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:16,810
Never thought

430
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,900
you would tease others.

431
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,900
Only at the brink of death

432
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:24,810
do people truly see themselves

433
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,900
and win their freedom.

434
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,220
Now,

435
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,980
I'm no longer of Blood River,

436
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,250
nor Mu Kewen of the Mu family,

437
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,460
nor the keeper

438
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,620
of this Spider's Nest.

439
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,420
Without these burdens,

440
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,680
I suddenly feel

441
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,100
living in this world

442
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,490
seems to have

443
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,090
a bit more flavor.

444
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,620
And I no longer

445
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,220
wish so much to die.

446
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:06,700
Uncle Arhat...

447
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,950
I've heard

448
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,920
your story with Su Changhe.

449
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,380
You're much like

450
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,330
me and Mingce in our youth.

451
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:21,860
Oh, Mu Mingce

452
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:25,250
was the Patriarch's name back then.

453
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:28,570
I hope

454
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,220
the ending between you two

455
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,140
can be different

456
00:24:34,550 --> 00:24:35,460
from ours.

457
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:11,940
He said

458
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:12,860
what he owed you

459
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:14,420
is paid this time.

460
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,660
And what you owe him...

461
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,900
leave it to the next life.

462
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,570
For the rest of his days,

463
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,860
he won't be Mu Kewen,

464
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,940
nor belong to Blood River.

465
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,380
No more meetings.

466
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:34,940
He's drawn almost all the toxins

467
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,660
from your body,

468
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,250
but traces remain.

469
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,860
I'll clear it with acupuncture

470
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:42,180
over the next few days.

471
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:43,900
But remember:

472
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,430
for these days,

473
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:46,930
do not stir your inner force,

474
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,220
or it may return.

475
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,420
So,

476
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,220
does what comes next

477
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,530
have nothing to do with us?

478
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,660
Then please, Sir,

479
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,290
write the Soul Reapers' Hall.

480
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,020
I'm leaving.

481
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,190
Tell them not to send killers after me.

482
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,770
I gave you a chance,

483
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,600
but you stayed.

484
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,770
Some choices

485
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,090
don't allow regret.

486
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,290
Do not misuse your inner force.

487
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,330
Uncle Zhe,

488
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,250
let me speak with the Patriarch

489
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:39,940
before we decide.

490
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,660
You're right.

491
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,100
Go talk first.

492
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,260
If talk fails,

493
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,220
I'll collect your body.

494
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,430
Uncle Zhe, I hope

495
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,580
you won't have to.

496
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,070
The miracle physician

497
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,700
has cleared my poison.

498
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,180
Muyu,

499
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,830
you fulfilled

500
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:28,490
your own promise.

501
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,570
I'll grant you freedom.

502
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,140
Come here.

503
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,820
Back then outside the Wailing Abyss,

504
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:44,940
with one sword

505
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,460
I planted the Life-Death Contract in you.

506
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,980
The seven-year term nears.

507
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,530
Only my inner force can dissolve it.

508
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,490
That is our pact.

509
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:52,770
Now,

510
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:54,810
I'll purge it for you.

511
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:56,980
No need, Sir.

512
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:58,700
The poison

513
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,980
was cured years ago.

514
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:03,770
What?

515
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,770
When I mastered the Eighteen-Sword Array,

516
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,460
sword qi flooded my body

517
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:10,570
and by chance that Life-Death Contract

518
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,290
was dispelled.

519
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,770
So that's it.

520
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:22,020
I always thought

521
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,290
you risked your life to guard me

522
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:28,290
because of the shackle of the Life-Death Contract.

523
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,700
You once saved my brother and me

524
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,720
outside the Wailing Abyss.

525
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,140
That kindness

526
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,900
was worth my sword at your side.

527
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,180
And the day I became a Kui,

528
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,180
I swore with the Twelve Zodiacs

529
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,290
an oath as well.

530
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,770
Not by coercion,

531
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,460
nor for profit,

532
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,620
but for...

533
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:00,900
loyalty and duty.

534
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,220
I believe

535
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,050
that's simply how it should be.

536
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:14,380
Thank you.

537
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,530
Just doing my duty.

538
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,220
Don't say that again.

539
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:29,730
I prefer

540
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,660
the word earlier:

541
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:32,980
loyalty.

542
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:38,940
Blood River's Furnace

543
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,900
can't teach that word.

544
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:44,010
My father taught me that.

545
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,090
The Sword God Zhuo Yuluo!

546
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,380
He truly was remarkable.

547
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,220
I always remember

548
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,090
what he told me:

549
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,770
in this world,

550
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,530
honor bonds and keep your word.

551
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,050
Forget either,

552
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,980
and you lose the right to wield a sword.

553
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,330
Honor bonds, keep your word...

554
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,770
Just for those words,

555
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:23,940
you will guard me to the death,

556
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,330
at any cost?

557
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,010
Some costs are off-limits.

558
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,330
What cost?

559
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:32,860
Su Changhe...

560
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,220
he must not die.

561
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,220
Muyu,

562
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,380
I'm already old.

563
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,180
Though the poison's gone,

564
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,420
I have only a few years left.

565
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,810
Who do you think

566
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,530
should bear

567
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,770
this Dormant Dragon Sword?

568
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:21,260
[Qingming today; cold wind blows, grudges dissolve]

569
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:25,260
[Ghost Gate opens, Yin and Yang reunite]

570
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,290
No flowers, no wine in the Qingming rain.

571
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:44,770
Blades and swords mark the road of no return.

572
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,330
What a perfect day,

573
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:54,730
just Su Muyu's kind of weather.

574
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,730
Have you thought

575
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,420
of a name?

576
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,940
I want the name Su Muyu.

577
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:05,530
Why?

578
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,460
That day my family was slain,

579
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,490
my father shielded me,

580
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,460
