[Episode 34]

5
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:42,930
Tang Lianyue!

6
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,930
Don't touch him!

7
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,180
That was too dangerous.

8
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,260
Our opponents are tough.

9
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,030
We should retreat for now.

10
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,490
- But... - Let's go!

11
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,130
You were hit by his Poison Palm.

12
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,010
Even if you're the Xuanwu Guardian,

13
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:10,100
there's no way you can resume the fight.

14
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,260
Let's retreat for now.

15
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:13,290
We'll think of something later.

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,850
Xuanwu Guardian of Tianqi City...

17
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,260
He's extraordinary indeed.

18
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,340
He would've taken my life

19
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,380
if you guys were one step later.

20
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:39,980
Don't you agree?

21
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,730
You would've died long ago

22
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,660
had he used his hidden weapons.

23
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,130
If so, why didn't he use them?

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:49,890
Tang Lianyue is very intelligent.

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,660
He found out about the identities

26
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:52,730
of the people here.

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,890
He guessed that we came here

28
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,610
to deal with Prince of Langya.

29
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,100
If he killed any of us

30
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,060
and left his hidden weapons here during the process,

31
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,450
perhaps

32
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,660
it would become an indication

33
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,290
that he was after Prince of Langya.

34
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,850
What should we do with them, then?

35
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:16,980
Everyone,

36
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,730
please leave for now.

37
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,850
I'll send my men to notify you all

38
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,690
about the new gathering spot later.

39
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,500
Let's hurry.

40
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,410
Prince of Langya.

41
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,220
Master Su.

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:50,410
Master Su, please don't worry.

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,260
No one tracked me on my way here.

44
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,500
No one would know

45
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,340
that you guys are here.

46
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,850
Your Highness, your mentor is Mr. Li of the Academy.

47
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,570
You were renowned for

48
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,220
your martial arts long ago.

49
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,980
I have no cause to worry about.

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,690
Your Highness, people once called you

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,980
the Elegant Gentleman.

52
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,260
Your wits and intellect are second to none.

53
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,660
And, your cunningness knows no bounds.

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,380
Indeed.

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,660
You were only willing to put your complete trust in me

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,980
after I risked my life in our duel.

57
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:18,340
Within Tianqi City,

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,610
even a person

59
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,610
like me

60
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,930
has to walk every step

61
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,730
as if I'm walking on thin ice.

62
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,340
Therefore,

63
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,810
I can't afford to make mistakes.

64
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,780
Master Su,

65
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:29,780
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,490
I heard from Second Master

67
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,930
that the situation at Nanjue was critical.

68
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,140
Guardian Azure Dragon and the elite soldiers under your rule

69
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,810
have already gone there to assist them.

70
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,580
Guardian White Tiger was nowhere to be found.

71
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,700
Guardian Vermilion Bird, Sikong Changfeng,

72
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,580
returned to the martial world many years ago.

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,580
Right now,

74
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:48,020
only Tang Lianyue is assisting you.

75
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,050
This should be

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,220
your weakest position

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,930
ever since you helped your brother

78
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:53,930
to obtain the throne.

79
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:55,730
Master Su,

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:56,980
it seems

81
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,580
you understand the situation here

82
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,250
very well.

83
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,900
Of course, some of them were coincidences.

84
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,610
For example, Lei Mengsha got himself trapped.

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,700
However, for some of them,

86
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,900
I suppose you did them on purpose.

87
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,700
You made yourself look weak on purpose.

88
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:15,900
What are you waiting for?

89
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:24,610
My opponents

90
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,810
will only strike

91
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:27,660
when they think I'm weak enough.

92
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,850
And, what I desire

93
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,100
is for them

94
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,340
to strike me.

95
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,850
By then, you'll require my help.

96
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,250
Indeed.

97
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:38,930
By then,

98
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:40,660
I'll still be very weak.

99
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,250
I'll be so weak

100
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,540
that I can't even

101
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,220
protect myself.

102
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,980
Therefore, Master Su,

103
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,220
I require your help

104
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,460
for certain matters.

105
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,050
Now that I'm looking at it,

106
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,900
was Blood River's arrival in Tianqi City

107
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:56,740
a move you planned

108
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,580
long ago?

109
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,250
I cannot plan a move that far ahead.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,410
I was merely following the flow.

111
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,660
However, regarding my promise to you,

112
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,100
I'll definitely

113
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,340
keep it.

114
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:11,930
All right.

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,490
All those who were struck by the puppet poison

116
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,170
were people of Tianqi City

117
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:20,610
who possessed military strength.

118
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,930
With this leverage,

119
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,460
even if I have no control over them,

120
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,170
they won't dare to act recklessly.

121
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:29,460
Yong,

122
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,700
I'll tell you this one last time.

123
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,900
Once you make this choice,

124
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,020
there's no turning back.

125
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,540
Uncle,

126
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:41,370
I never turn back.

127
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:46,140
For all that you see when you turn back

128
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,100
is unbearable.

129
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:01,050
Mother!

130
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,370
Mother,

131
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,930
are you okay?

132
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,610
Why are you still doing such needlework?

133
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,540
I'm fine.

134
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,900
It only pricked my finger. I'm not bleeding.

135
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:13,730
Look.

136
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,140
Your father loves

137
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,370
the needlework I make.

138
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,410
I made him a belt

139
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,170
since I had nothing to do.

140
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,140
And, I made a pair of winter boots for your uncle

141
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,340
and grandfather each.

142
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:24,290
Come, sit here.

143
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,460
Why are you here today?

144
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,580
Was schoolwork difficult for you?

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,540
Not at all.

146
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,580
My teacher even praised me for my intellect.

147
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,780
When Father heard about it,

148
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,410
he granted me a set of scholar's tools.

149
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,250
There's no school today.

150
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,020
That's why I came back to visit you.

151
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,700
Good boy.

152
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,580
Will Father be coming here today?

153
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,660
Perhaps.

154
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,140
Your Highness,

155
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,980
please make a plea on Her Highness's behalf.

156
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,410
Now, His Majesty visits Consort Xuan every day.

157
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,250
It's been so long since he visited us.

158
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,460
You're his first child.

159
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,460
His Majesty doted on you the most in the past.

160
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,610
- You should... - Diancui!

161
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,220
That was unnecessary.

162
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,220
Pay no heed to her words.

163
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,540
Study well

164
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,900
and make me proud.

165
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,540
Your Highness!

166
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,980
Your Highness, we're in trouble!

167
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,610
Your Highness,

168
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,370
there's something wrong with the Ministry of Revenue's accounts,

169
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,460
which were under Lord Dian's supervision.

170
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,340
His Majesty is enraged.

171
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,460
He intends to punish him!

172
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:35,380
[Dian's Residence]

173
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,980
[Dian's Residence]

174
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,850
I suppose your father still has a conscience.

175
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,730
He merely ordered your grandfather to retire.

176
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,130
Perhaps

177
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,530
Father was lenient with him

178
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,180
as Mother belonged to the Dian family.

179
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,610
I suppose he wouldn't bother

180
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,940
to finish off a lone stray dog.

181
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,490
But Yong, don't worry.

182
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,940
I'm joining the military

183
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,100
to fork out a new path

184
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,100
for our family.

185
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,340
I will become your new source of strength.

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,890
You must look after your mother

187
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:08,580
in Tianqi.

188
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,420
Yong,

189
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,300
you're the only kin

190
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,820
I have.

191
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:54,490
Uncle, you're also

192
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,180
the only blade I can hold

193
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,770
without injuring myself.

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,530
Your Highness,

195
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,490
Xuanwu Guardian and the members of Blood River

196
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,180
have headed to Doom Abyss together.

197
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,010
Blood River again?

198
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,650
Su Changhe already agreed to

199
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,610
join hands with us.

200
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,940
Why is Blood River

201
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,730
still obstructing us from executing our plans?

202
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,250
Haoyue.

203
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,100
Go and find Su Changhe.

204
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,130
If he continues to be on his retreat,

205
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,940
our cooperation

206
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,180
will be called off.

207
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,130
By then, we shall

208
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,100
eradicate

209
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,610
every single Blood River member

210
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,460
in Tianqi City.

211
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:39,940
Yes, Your Highness.

212
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:40,980
Your Highness.

213
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,730
Why don't you send me there?

214
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:49,010
After all, if you trace back to our roots,

215
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,820
I suppose I'm a part of them as well.

216
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,340
That'll do.

217
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,610
Besides that,

218
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,180
try to locate

219
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,180
the current hiding spot of Su Muyu and his men.

220
00:10:58,550 --> 00:10:59,300
You may eradicate them

221
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,610
without notifying Su Changhe

222
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,580
when it's necessary.

223
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,490
How did it go?

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,580
Yu,

225
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,370
we've already found out about the secret

226
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,220
behind the drugged puppets in Tianqi City.

227
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:17,610
However, our opponents were too strong.

228
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,490
We had no choice but to retreat.

229
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,890
Yumo and Tang Lianyue

230
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,490
have already returned to Prince of Langya's Manor to report back.

231
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,580
Su Muyu,

232
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,850
we should leave for now.

233
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,700
The situation in Tianqi City is much more complicated than we thought.

234
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:26,770
I don't think

235
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,220
this is worth it.

236
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,100
Xuewei,

237
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,340
go and ask Changli

238
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,180
about Changhe's retreat.

239
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,220
Yu,

240
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,100
do you intend to give up as well?

241
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,700
I don't want people

242
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,490
to use Blood River as a political tool.

243
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,460
You guys may leave with Miss Bai first.

244
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,420
I'll wait for Changhe's news.

245
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,220
We'll return to Blood River

246
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,130
after I rendezvous with him.

247
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:01,850
Yu,

248
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04,220
you're still the same.

249
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:05,700
You don't know how to lie at all.

250
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,060
You want us to take Miss Bai with us

251
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,850
while you'll clean up the mess yourself.

252
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,100
I can't afford to leave.

253
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,420
Miss Bai.

254
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,700
Why is that the case?

255
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,650
Tianqi City is facing turmoil

256
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,530
due to the drugged puppets.

257
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,300
And, the puppet spell was developed by

258
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,820
an outcast of Medicine King Valley.

259
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,730
Right now, I have the highest seniority among its members.

260
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,300
I can't just leave without doing anything.

261
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,010
But now,

262
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:34,530
the Patriarch is on a reclusive retreat.

263
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:35,850
Master Su

264
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,850
is also heavily wounded.

265
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,220
With our strength,

266
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,850
I'm afraid we won't be able to contribute much

267
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,340
on this battlefield.

268
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:45,890
Who said so?

269
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:46,730
Fadog?

270
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:51,980
Fadog.

271
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:52,770
Uncle Zhe.

272
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,370
I'm here for you, my girl.

273
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,300
Who actually wounded you?

274
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,490
I'm going to rip him to shreds.

275
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,850
Fadog, you're too late.

276
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:05,580
Su Muyu

277
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,580
already avenged me.

278
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,300
You brat.

279
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,530
Good job.

280
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:18,730
Your Highness.

281
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,340
Ms. Yumo, I've long heard of your name.

282
00:13:23,670 --> 00:13:24,340
But this is

283
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,890
our first encounter.

284
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,730
Initially, I wanted to see you

285
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:28,940
when Blood River came to Tianqi.

286
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,130
It's just that...

287
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:31,060
It's just

288
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,180
that Lianyue wasn't around back then.

289
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,890
Therefore, there was no need to see me.

290
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,700
Your Highness, you're quite humorous.

291
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:39,980
Please have a seat.

292
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,010
Thank you, Your Highness.

293
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,010
I came from the Academy.

294
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,940
Back then, Master told us

295
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,490
that being interesting

296
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,490
could attract girls better

297
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,220
than being powerful.

298
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,820
Therefore,

299
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,340
everyone was interesting

300
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,340
in their own way.

301
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,490
Lianyue lived with the Tang Clan since young.

302
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:04,980
He was

303
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,340
already uninteresting

304
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,300
when he got to know us.

305
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,370
And, I couldn't change him

306
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,610
even after all these years.

307
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,180
Therefore, Ms. Yumo,

308
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,250
I wonder

309
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,650
what you like about him.

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,820
I used to like him.

311
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:23,940
But now,

312
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,300
I no longer like him.

313
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,220
Why is that the case?

314
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,300
He's too timid.

315
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,130
I like bold men.

316
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,850
For example,

317
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,730
a valiant man such as yourself, Your Highness.

318
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:45,940
Your Highness!

319
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,100
Ms. Yumo,

320
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,460
Lianyue is a good man

321
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,850
whom you can entrust yourself to.

322
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,060
Not me.

323
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,850
Your Highness, what do you mean?

324
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,220
It's because among the men I know,

325
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,650
Lianyue is the only man

326
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:15,770
who will not change a single bit

327
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,020
when he's sure

328
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:18,610
that he can

329
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,130
provide you

330
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:22,180
with a lifetime of happiness,

331
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:23,340
unless he dies.

332
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,700
Only then

333
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,220
will he dedicate his true feelings to you.

334
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,820
Other people

335
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:31,770
cannot do so.

336
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:35,300
Your Highness,

337
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,770
this isn't the time for this.

338
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,730
Master once told me

339
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,180
that discussions of relationship

340
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,730
are suitable

341
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,850
no matter when we initiate the conversation.

342
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,940
The Imperial Assembly will be held soon.

343
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,060
But coincidentally, many of the sons of noblemen

344
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,220
were struck by the puppet poison

345
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,100
at this particular timing.

346
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:54,650
It's obvious

347
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,010
that First Prince is plotting something.

348
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,180
And, rumors about you have been circulating

349
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:00,820
around Tianqi City.

350
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,180
I'm sure he's targeting us.

351
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,370
Actually, I think

352
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,530
both have their own merits.

353
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,530
One of them can express his love at any time.

354
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,730
He expresses it in a direct

355
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:13,610
and carefree manner.

356
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,610
Therefore, it's always ferocious

357
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,010
at the start.

358
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,370
As for the other one, he only expresses his love

359
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,940
after everything has settled down.

360
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,300
It always feels a bit too calm.

361
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,100
Therefore, the beautiful lady has

362
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,300
to endure more hardships.

363
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,300
However,

364
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,460
Lianyue

365
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,340
is a great man.

366
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,490
Your Highness,

367
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,250
what's with the eccentric speech?

368
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,610
It's as if you...

369
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,220
Yumo.

370
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,610
Do not spout nonsense.

371
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,730
You knew what I was going to say, didn't you?

372
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,220
If so, how can that be considered nonsense?

373
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:58,820
Do you mean

374
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,490
as if I'm telling you my last will?

375
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:03,940
Perhaps

376
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,180
I am telling you my last will.

377
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:06,730
Your Highness!

378
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,810
Forget it.

379
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:12,490
What did you say again?

380
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,900
You said many sons of noblemen

381
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,290
were struck by the puppet poison.

382
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,660
Which family do they come from?

383
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,290
We only managed to identify some of them.

384
00:17:22,830 --> 00:17:23,570
We haven't identified the rest.

385
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:27,530
Why did you come back, then?

386
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,420
Go and find them.

387
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:30,140
Find every single one of them.

388
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:31,390
Protect them all.

389
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,220
After that, figure out a way to neutralize the poison.

390
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,220
But remember,

391
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,530
you must finish these operations

392
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,730
as soon as possible.

393
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,570
If not, things will go south

394
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:42,090
when their fathers and brothers gather at Tianqi

395
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,220
for the Imperial Assembly.

396
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:46,330
Perhaps

397
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,570
something worse will happen.

398
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,090
Understood.

399
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,090
Changhe,

400
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,570
are we going to die here?

401
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:15,140
That won't happen.

402
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,090
I'll surely take you with me

403
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,220
and escape from here.

404
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,090
What about Mother and the rest?

405
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:23,330
Can we still rescue them?

406
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,530
We can.

407
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,700
Both of us will survive.

408
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:34,290
Changhe.

409
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,140
Changli?

410
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,250
Are you okay?

411
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:37,730
Changhe,

412
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,140
you should go.

413
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,290
Just leave me behind.

414
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:44,250
I'm bleeding so much.

415
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,220
I don't think I can survive!

416
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:47,860
No.

417
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,290
Just go!

418
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,090
Just go!

419
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,540
Go!

420
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,420
Changhe!

421
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,020
Just go!

422
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,370
Just leave me behind!

423
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,090
Changhe!

424
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,140
Go!

425
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,180
Changli!

426
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,010
Changhe!

427
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,140
This time,

428
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:34,860
we're not running away.

429
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,250
Ignorant fool,

430
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,010
it seems you have a death wish.

431
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,220
Who would have the nerve before the King of Hell

432
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,380
to make me face death?

433
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,050
Even the King of Hell

434
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,570
distances himself from me when he sees me!

435
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,730
Finally.

436
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,180
Didn't I already tell you?

437
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,860
Changhe is in a reclusive retreat.

438
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:04,330
No one is to enter his chamber.

439
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,570
In a reclusive retreat?

440
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,220
Your Patriarch promises to form an alliance with us.

441
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,010
But he disappeared

442
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,220
after making the deal.

443
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,660
And, the rest of Blood River

444
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:19,180
is obstructing us from executing our plan too.

445
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:21,620
It's all because

446
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,380
Changhe received a blow from Prince of Langya back then.

447
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,530
He sustained internal injury.

448
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:30,380
Could it be...

449
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,570
I heard

450
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,420
that every level of the Hell Palm

451
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,140
unveils a new world.

452
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,380
Once one reaches the ninth level,

453
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,980
one can form his own world.

454
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,180
This is my first time

455
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,620
witnessing

456
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,900
a cultivator who has reached the ninth level of Hell Palm.

457
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:51,770
It's you, old man.

458
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,700
Patriarch of Blood River,

459
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:00,050
we have met again.

460
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,980
It seems you guys joined First Prince's faction

461
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,250
after leaving Shadow Sect.

462
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,250
I knew I had the right mindset back then.

463
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:13,660
I should've gotten rid of

464
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,290
all my opponents.

465
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,810
I wonder

466
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,380
if Muyu would regret his decision

467
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,220
if he could see this.

468
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,730
If we wish

469
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,700
to remain in Tianqi for a long time,

470
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,980
we have to find a worthy master to depend on.

471
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,070
His Highness

472
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,620
is quite a good option.

473
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,730
If not,

474
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,180
why would you and I

475
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:35,860
encounter each other

476
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,700
here?

477
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,570
What do you think?

478
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:41,050
Now that the deed is over,

479
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:44,660
the Three Families of Tianqi

480
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,010
and Blood River

481
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,140
are willing to acknowledge you as the Patriarch.

482
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,860
Once His Highness ascends the throne,

483
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:55,140
we shall replace

484
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,570
the current Inner Security Division

485
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,730
and walk in the sunlight officially.

486
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:03,900
Let's go.

487
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,490
It's been quite some time since I last met His Highness.

488
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,530
Now that I've reached

489
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:10,860
the ninth level of Hell Palm,

490
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,460
I wonder who will

491
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,530
be the first

492
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,620
to have a taste of it.

493
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,010
Lianyue was meant to live beneath

494
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:31,290
the open skies of the martial world.

495
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,490
Does one become more talkative

496
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,330
as they accumulate more life experiences?

497
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,900
You're the same as Sikong Changfeng.

498
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,290
You two like to express your sentiments

499
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,900
while admiring a gorgeous view.

500
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,140
You and I have plucked the same number of flowers and leaves.

501
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,570
But among your harvest,

502
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,460
there are three pieces of peach blossom leaves.

503
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:55,940
Therefore,

504
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:57,730
you've lost.

505
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,530
Forget it.

506
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,700
Deliver this message to Sikong Changfeng on my behalf.

507
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:04,660
I'm going to head to Tianqi.

508
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,490
I'm not sure when I'll return.

509
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,900
I suppose the life I was leading

510
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,570
was too restrained.

511
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:15,090
That's why I'm feeling sentimental

512
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,770
now that it has come to this.

513
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,900
I suppose a life like yours

514
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,460
is great.

515
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,220
You lead a carefree life.

516
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,290
Your mother sent you here to protect me in secret.

517
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:27,940
Sorry for the trouble.

518
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,050
So, do you regret the decision you made?

519
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,620
If, one day,

520
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,250
you encounter an expert,

521
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,810
and you have a chance to challenge him to a duel,

522
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,490
but you'll fail and won't be able to wield the sword again

523
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,770
if you challenge him.

524
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,530
Will you regret the fact

525
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,420
that you challenged him to a duel?

526
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,250
I won't.

527
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,220
That is also my answer.

528
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,180
Life is just like the Peach Blossom Coin

529
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,290
used for divination on Mount Wangcheng.

530
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,490
Only one side can face upward.

531
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,010
If I want to lead a serene life,

532
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,330
I have to cast away the carefree martial world life.

533
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,770
If you wish to experience peerless swordsmanship,

534
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,380
you have to bear the consequences of challenging him.

535
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,570
That's frustrating.

536
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,290
What I meant was

537
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:32,530
I won't lose to him.

538
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,220
If so,

539
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,810
I shall head to Pleasure House first.

540
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,290
Beauty,

541
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,730
I'll go and enjoy your performance again when I'm free.

542
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,810
Sir, I'll surely reserve a good seat

543
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,660
for you.

544
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,530
Boss.

545
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,700
You guys are here as well.

546
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,900
You instructed Patriarch to tell us

547
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:06,980
that we no longer need to be

548
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,220
the masked Twelve Zodiacs.

549
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,570
But fighting by your side

550
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,180
is something exciting.

551
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,460
Therefore,

552
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,660
we've returned.

553
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,180
Your new blade looks great.

554
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,090
I retrieved this from Yellow Springs Pawnshop.

555
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,010
It cuts through iron like butter.

556
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,090
Boss,

557
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,980
don't worry.

558
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:28,090
Our martial arts

559
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:29,420
have improved quite a lot as well.

560
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,380
Could we leave Tianqi City right now

561
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,050
if we didn't listen to that lass?

562
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,900
If it's possible,

563
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,530
Uncle Zhe, I hope you can take Miss Bai with you.

564
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,290
As for the affairs of Tianqi City,

565
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:52,730
allow Changhe and me to deal with them.

566
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:06,980
If that's the case,

567
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,090
I don't think it'll work.

568
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,700
Look at your current state.

569
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,140
What do you think you can do?

570
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,860
If you don't want your body

571
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,770
to be riddled with holes, just like mine,

572
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,420
the best way is for you

573
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,140
to stop using martial arts

574
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,140
and rest and recuperate under my daughter's care

575
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,380
for a few months.

576
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:27,700
Only then will you be able to recover completely.

577
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,700
I'll try to recover as soon as possible.

578
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,700
Uncle Zhe, please don't worry.

579
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,380
How could I?

580
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,620
You and I suffered the same type of injury.

581
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:38,900
I could tell this at first glance.

582
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:40,860
The current you is...

583
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,940
If a breeze were to come right now,

584
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:47,940
you'll dissipate like

585
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:48,660
the incense smoke.

586
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:51,660
Uncle Zhe, not only did you survive,

587
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,570
but you also retained

588
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,730
your reign as the top martial artist of Su family.

589
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,330
I know this better than you.

590
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,770
If the current me

591
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:09,620
has to fight with my all,

592
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:12,860
if I have to fight with someone on equal terms as I,

593
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,900
I'll surely die from it.

594
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,220
That's the consequence of the grave injury

595
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,940
I sustained back then.

596
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,140
Even Xin Baicao

597
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,770
won't be able to treat my condition.

598
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,810
I wish

599
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,730
to entrust my daughter to you in the future.

600
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,770
Therefore, I don't want you to end up like me.

601
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:35,770
Uncle Zhe.

602
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:39,140
I have my own plans.

603
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,980
My foot!

604
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,050
Your final plan

605
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,900
is to forfeit your own life.

606
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:49,420
If she gets together with someone like you,

607
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,180
she'll become a widow in the end.

608
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,330
But I suppose we don't have a choice.

609
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,730
That's the person you are.

610
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,290
That's why you're Su Muyu.

611
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,810
Since both you and my daughter

612
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,810
have already decided,

613
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,290
let me

614
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,460
do you a favor.

615
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,290
Uncle Zhe, you mustn't.

616
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,620
Why not?

617
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,380
If you use this art,

618
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:23,250
you'll receive a serious backlash!

619
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,090
Don't worry.

620
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,620
I won't die yet.

621
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:27,460
I'll live on

622
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,940
so that I can look after my daughter.

623
00:29:31,550 --> 00:29:32,180
Su Muyu.

624
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:33,940
You don't have a choice.

625
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,660
You have to accept my zhenqi.

626
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,810
If not, I'll die

627
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,530
from exhausting all of my zhenqi.

628
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:57,940
Su Muyu,

629
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,140
once you overcome this ordeal,

630
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,570
you should leave the martial world.

631
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,490
Leave the martial world?

632
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:08,220
For example,

633
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,980
you can return to Nan'an City.

634
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:12,940
You can be a medical apprentice for the rest of your life.

635
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:14,730
You can help my daughter

636
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,010
to sell,

637
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,050
crush,

638
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:17,980
and brew herbs.

639
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,220
Once the sun sets,

640
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,810
you can make a bowl

641
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,530
of terrible noodles for her.

642
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,330
After that, my daughter

643
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,900
will reprimand you

644
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,730
while she finishes the noodles.

645
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,420
You will

646
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,810
feel embarrassed over it.

647
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,380
The next morning,

648
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,010
you'll go and buy osmanthus cakes for her.

649
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,180
Don't you think

650
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,010
that's pretty nice?

651
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,250
I can't just make terrible noodles for her

652
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,140
for the rest of my life.

653
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,660
I'm sure you like it as well.

654
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:54,980
I can live in Nan'an City.

655
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,620
I can lead a peaceful life there.

656
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,250
But what about the members of Blood River?

657
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,810
If they are allowed to roam free across the martial world,

658
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,140
they'll eventually die

659
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:13,460
where no one can find them.

660
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:18,140
You're a responsible man.

661
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,090
Uncle Zhe, I believe

662
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:21,330
that you were once a responsible man as well.

663
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,140
After all, you're the former Kui.

664
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,290
And, you're from the main family.

665
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,010
You were supposed to inherit the title of Patriarch.

666
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,050
I guess so.

667
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,140
Back then,

668
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,700
I had lofty aspirations.

669
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,700
I merely wanted

670
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:38,940
to make my name known throughout the world.

671
00:31:39,790 --> 00:31:41,730
I wanted to fight for the world's number one title.

672
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,330
What happened after that?

673
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,660
After that,

674
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,380
I found love.

675
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,420
Since then, I have only wished

676
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,860
to leave the martial world

677
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,330
and lead a secluded life with her.

678
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,250
Blood River,

679
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,530
and the martial world,

680
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,480
none of them was as enticing as

681
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,900
watching a sky full of stars with her.

682
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:04,380
You're inferior

683
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,180
to me.

684
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:07,980
It seems like

685
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,660
I'm the best man

686
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,730
in the world.

687
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:16,620
Fadog,

688
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,730
what are you doing?

689
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,090
This should be the Divine-Demon Nirvana Art.

690
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,530
Rumor has it

691
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:25,810
that when one

692
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,700
has sustained grave injuries,

693
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,140
they can exchange their life for another.

694
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,810
Although it has been modified,

695
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,700
and the user won't die from it,

696
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,620
the user

697
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,330
will receive a serious backlash.

698
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:37,250
Uncle Zhe has truly given his all

699
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,860
for Su Muyu's sake.

700
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,900
I heard that Tianqi City hasn't been peaceful

701
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,620
recently.

702
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,420
Assassins attacked Flying Tiger General's Residence at night.

703
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,490
It was quite the commotion.

704
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,490
Dian Ye?

705
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,330
Who has he offended?

706
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:11,770
I have

707
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:13,770
no idea.

708
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:15,730
I think

709
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,860
it's some martial artists.

710
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,570
Martial artists, huh?

711
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,460
If that's the case,

712
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,700
shouldn't we ask Ruofeng about it?

713
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,050
It seems those martial artists

714
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:36,010
are Prince of Langya's acquaintances.

715
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,420
Martial artists like them

716
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,140
actually dared to attack a general

717
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,700
in Tianqi, huh?

718
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,220
They're too bold for their own good.

719
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,860
Relay my order to Dian Ye.

720
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,660
I'm granting him permission

721
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,620
to conduct a citywide manhunt for the assassins.

722
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,730
He can dispatch as many of the elite troops under him.

723
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

724
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,420
Now, I've reached the ninth level

725
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,810
of Hell Palm.

726
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:08,010
It feels as if the vast world

727
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:09,210
is but the size of my palm now.

728
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,050
By the way, old man,

729
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:13,820
were you unable

730
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,740
to reach the ninth level of Hell Palm

731
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,010
even after all these years?

732
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:20,530
The Hell Palm the Three Families of Tianqi practices

733
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,690
is different from the one

734
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,610
you guys are practicing.

735
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,820
The arts and manuals we have

736
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,740
are incomplete.

737
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:31,130
We can only reach the eighth level at most.

738
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,170
Even if you and I were on the same level,

739
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,210
I will be inferior to you.

740
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,940
I see.

741
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:38,940
I thought

742
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,900
you were merely ungifted.

743
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,420
I suppose that's correct as well.

744
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,610
But Patriarch,

745
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,650
do you know why

746
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,530
the Three Families of Tianqi

747
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,090
only have incomplete arts

748
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,340
and manuals?

749
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,820
Please tell me about it.

750
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,420
It's because Hell Palm

751
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,490
is a sinister art.

752
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,650
Those who reach the highest level

753
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,210
will receive a serious backlash.

754
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,940
Therefore, the manuals

755
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,940
we had in Tianqi City

756
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,170
were modified.

757
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,820
We cannot utilize

758
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,780
all of their power.

759
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,650
As for those in Blood River,

760
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:14,050
the original copy was kept within your organization

761
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,900
in order to seek out more power.

762
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,130
Long time no see,

763
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,820
Patriarch.

764
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,170
Do you know

765
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,460
what happened when you were away

766
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:36,210
on your reclusive retreat?

767
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,050
I heard that my friends at Blood River

768
00:35:38,110 --> 00:35:38,980
almost died.

769
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,210
The head of Su family almost died as well.

770
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,340
As for He-Yu Clinic,

771
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,980
it was almost leveled overnight.

772
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:48,050
Do you guys know

773
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,940
that I'm furious right now?

774
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:53,010
It's all because you all were messing around.

775
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:53,650
Messing around?

776
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,780
Sir Zhuo Qing,

777
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,570
say, what if I mess around

778
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,070
and kill the prince in front of me

779
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,050
with one blow?

780
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,460
Will you be able to stop me?

781
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,420
Such audacity!

782
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,300
If it were the past version of you,

783
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,010
there was no way you could achieve that.

784
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,690
However, if it's the current you we're talking about,

785
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,210
there's a 50% chance

786
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:25,530
you'll be able to take Yong's life.

787
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,340
