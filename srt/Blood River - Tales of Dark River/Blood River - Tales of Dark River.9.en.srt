[Episode 9]

5
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:43,820
Sir.

6
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,050
The Dormant Dragon Sword!

7
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,570
Why is the Dormant Dragon Sword here?

8
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,020
Each Patriarch of Blood River

9
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,690
holds two Dormant Dragon Swords.

10
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,180
The two blades

11
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,940
were forged from the same meteoric iron.

12
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,540
The only difference is,

13
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,100
the one in my hand

14
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,170
hides Blood River's secret.

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,220
The other one is in your hand.

16
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:21,060
If Su Jinhui can truly wield it,

17
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,170
we'll wait until he quells

18
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,260
the turmoil in Blood River.

19
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:25,410
Then,

20
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,010
I will hand this blade

21
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,380
to him as well.

22
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,260
If he cannot,

23
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,820
then that sword

24
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,340
will fully ignite

25
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,540
the three family heads' ambitions.

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,730
And those men

27
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,060
will in the end

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,260
be consumed by their own ambition!

29
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,060
Only when they step back

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,610
will the more promising young

31
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,660
have a chance to rise,

32
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,610
a chance

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,220
to break free.

[Luojiuxiao Inn]

35
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,610
Given he's that smart,

36
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,940
he must know this Fingertip Blade is missing,

37
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,290
and that I took it.

38
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,570
But...

39
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:12,100
he didn't ask for it back.

40
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,940
That's tacit approval.

41
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,170
Then...

42
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,700
does that make it a token of love?

43
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,020
You're awake.

44
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,780
What took you so long to get back?

45
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,690
You were gone forever.

46
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,810
I'm starving.

47
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,580
If you're fine, go down and eat.

48
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,220
Who says I'm fine?

49
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,580
I still need someone to look after me.

50
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,220
I haven't fully recovered.

51
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,850
How about...

52
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,250
you feed me?

53
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,700
Why are you so nice to me today?

54
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,410
Eat properly.

55
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,490
No talking.

56
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,290
Got it.

57
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,700
You...

58
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,490
you're leaving?

59
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,980
I was always going to leave.

60
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,290
Besides,

61
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,900
you're almost healed.

62
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,250
You're here.

63
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,250
You knew I'd come?

64
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,930
You're a lot like me when I was young.

65
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,540
When you were young,

66
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,850
were you already such a piece of work?

67
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,100
You seem

68
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,700
to hate showing

69
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,220
your truest self.

70
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,170
Afraid of being seen through?

71
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,850
Before,

72
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,540
I kept you down,

73
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,460
and you didn't dare raise your head.

74
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,850
Now that my edge is gone,

75
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,730
do you feel

76
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,930
your chance has come?

77
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,780
Since you so enjoy

78
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,470
reading people's minds,

79
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,580
why not take a guess

80
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,580
why I came

81
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,910
and what's my plan?

82
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,140
You want

83
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:58,460
the head of the Su family.

84
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:02,700
Su Changhe,

85
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,700
you're merely the Nameless.

86
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,810
Nameless Su Muyu

87
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,850
has no right to inherit the Patriarch.

88
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,170
You as well

89
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,610
have no right to inherit

90
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,220
the head of the Su family.

91
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,250
So you did look down on me.

92
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,540
The title of Su family head

93
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,060
doesn't interest me.

94
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,100
What I want is something

95
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,060
Blood River has never seen done

96
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,010
in past centuries.

97
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:41,370
What I aim to achieve

98
00:08:42,270 --> 00:08:43,370
is a vow

99
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:45,100
no one in Blood River could even imagine.

100
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,460
I...

101
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,300
will change Blood River.

102
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,010
Good.

103
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,130
Changhe,

104
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,340
your Inch Sword

105
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,940
is impressive.

106
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,530
But beating me

107
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,580
won't be easy.

108
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,010
My sword may be broken,

109
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,890
but I

110
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:24,850
am still

111
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,300
Su Jinhui.

112
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,130
Just a declawed tiger,

113
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,610
a blind dragon,

114
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:37,650
nothing to worry about.

115
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:50,980
Nice moves.

116
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,370
Back then,

117
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,820
if not for the Su family's help,

118
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,340
you two would've been dead.

119
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,340
At Wailing Abyss,

120
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,460
Muyu carried me out on his back.

121
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,010
Patriarch took the strike,

122
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,180
and that was his choice.

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,180
We had no choice

124
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,180
entering Blood River.

125
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,940
But we'll step onto the other shore ourselves.

126
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:16,890
And you...

127
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,300
is a relic of the old era.

128
00:10:24,910 --> 00:10:25,580
You're wounded inside,

129
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,980
no match for us.

130
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,450
Su Changli...

131
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,420
The tide in Blood River

132
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:31,340
is turning.

133
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,010
Uncle Qiu, are you thinking

134
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,770
it'd be better if the master showed up?

135
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,400
You've run

136
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,460
so many celestial-rank missions.

137
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:47,220
You never move

138
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,100
without a sure win.

139
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,490
I bet

140
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:52,730
you've waited long for this.

141
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:54,490
And this time,

142
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,770
the result will be the same as always.

143
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,890
You really do know me.

144
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,420
How touching.

145
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,430
I spent six full years

146
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,000
gathering this organization.

147
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,100
Its name...

148
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,000
is The Other Shore.

149
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,460
The Other Shore?

150
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,220
You want to change Blood River?

151
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,130
That's right.

152
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,390
Cross Blood River

153
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,460
and you reach the Other Shore.

154
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,650
There should be no endless night,

155
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,890
but light.

156
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,700
Stirring, isn't it?

157
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,200
You're one of this family,

158
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,260
raised from birth

159
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,630
as an assassin.

160
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,370
Would anyone truly choose

161
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,340
to be born

162
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:02,940
a tool for killing?

163
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,490
Why do others bask in sunlight

164
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:07,490
while our three families

165
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,730
must live in darkness?

166
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Have you really never wanted

167
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,040
to change that?

168
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,460
When I was forced as a child

169
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:17,640
to learn the killing arts,

170
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,610
of course I asked those things.

171
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,980
But after all these years,

172
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:23,820
our hands,

173
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,340
are soaked in blood.

174
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,940
What right do we have

175
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:28,410
to talk of change?

176
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,010
Exactly.

177
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
Though I see you

178
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,760
as a fellow traveler,

179
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,180
I didn't give you this ring.

180
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,180
Because though you're awake to it,

181
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,840
you've long lost your nerve.

182
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,180
We're different.

183
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,420
We're still young.

184
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,100
As the storybooks say,

185
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,850
we're in our prime.

186
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,560
We haven't strayed far

187
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,820
from the age

188
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,700
when blood runs hot.

189
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,400
We still remember

190
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,830
that undimmed youth's heart,

191
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,530
youth's will.

192
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,370
So long as a young heart

193
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,580
still beats in our chest,

194
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,490
we know no fear,

195
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,010
no regret,

196
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,100
no surrender.

197
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,420
Did you kill Master Su?

198
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,010
Uncle Qiu,

199
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,060
you're a good man.

200
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,400
In this filthy, stained

201
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,170
Blood River,

202
00:13:38,170 --> 00:13:38,890
you're one of the few

203
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,700
worthy of respect.

204
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:45,060
The new Blood River

205
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,650
has no place for Su Jinhui.

206
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:49,980
He isn't dead.

207
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,850
Take him and leave.

208
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,530
Live well.

209
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,420
Maybe one day,

210
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,060
out in the jianghu,

211
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,420
you'll hear "Blood River"

212
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:02,980
and be surprised.

213
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,010
All right.

214
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,820
I'll be waiting.

215
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,980
Farewell, Uncle Qiu.

216
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:33,820
[Sword Qi Soars]

217
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,130
Changhe,

218
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,850
the rest of the Su disciples are secured.

219
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,980
Why not kill him?

220
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,060
Yeah.

221
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,610
Why not?

222
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:01,820
What's our next move?

223
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,820
head to the Mu family,

224
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,820
and strike when we can?

225
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,610
Where did Su Muyu go?

226
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:09,490
He returned to the Spider's Nest.

227
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,700
Then we'll go to the Spider's Nest.

228
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,820
Mu Ciling took the Dormant Dragon Sword.

229
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,530
It's in Mu hands now.

230
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,530
What good is the Spider's Nest then?

231
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,940
The Xie family

232
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,820
has already ringed the Mu compound.

233
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,440
Why don't we wait

234
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,400
until they bleed each other,

235
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,340
and snatch the Dormant Dragon Sword?

236
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,580
Since The Other Shore formed,

237
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,460
we've prepped for this day.

238
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:36,940
As our leader,

239
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,650
you shouldn't play favorites now,

240
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,650
saving your brother's life.

241
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,650
What did you say?

242
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,290
War is upon us.

243
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,240
Stay calm!

244
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,340
If you kill me,

245
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,490
what "new Blood River" is left?

246
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,100
Do you plan

247
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,140
to leave the Patriarch's position

248
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:01,890
to him?

249
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,130
Listen closely.

250
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,980
With Su Muyu's nature,

251
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,250
unless he's dead,

252
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,460
he'll stop at nothing

253
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,100
to run that sword down.

254
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,090
Since he chose

255
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,060
to return to the Spider's Nest

256
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,180
instead of chasing Mu Ciling,

257
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,500
that means

258
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,870
there's a problem with that sword.

259
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,730
Only a fool like Xie Ba

260
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,940
will fight the Mus

261
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,250
to the bitter end.

262
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:32,700
If you're that stupid,

263
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,580
then go and join him in death.

264
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:37,010
Since that's so,

265
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:37,940
the air's clear now.

266
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:38,890
Why make a scene?

267
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:41,010
- Changhe! - Besides...

268
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,340
You were right about one thing.

269
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm keeping

270
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,690
Su Muyu's life.

271
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,940
Anyone else can die,

272
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,300
but not him.

273
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,530
No means no, unless...

274
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:56,890
I die.

275
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,140
Wait for me at the Spider's Nest gate.

276
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,010
Yes.

277
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:15,140
[Luojiuxiao Inn]

278
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,440
Yin the Tiger.

279
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,360
Sir.

280
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:38,010
If things turn dire,

281
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,650
take the miracle physician

282
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,180
and get out first.

283
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:42,090
Understood.

284
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,090
Sir,

285
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:44,520
do you think

286
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,570
Su Muyu can't handle

287
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,490
the ones outside?

288
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,610
With his sword,

289
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,940
Su Muyu is unstoppable.

290
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,500
But in this world,

291
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,050
one man and one sword

292
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,940
can't change everything.

293
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,090
But...

294
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,980
We have a visitor.

295
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:09,220
Who is he?

296
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,050
Tang Lianyue of the Tang Clan.

297
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,140
At last, we meet,

298
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,700
Blood River's Patriarch.

299
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,700
Xuanwu Guardian of Tianqi City,

300
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,660
the honor is mine as well.

301
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,380
Why does everyone

302
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,810
call me

303
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,250
the Xuanwu Guardian of Tianqi City?

304
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,660
I just came to kill you

305
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,770
to avenge my second uncle,

306
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,770
not for Tianqi City.

307
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:41,420
You're still too young.

308
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,180
Your second uncle, Second Master Tang,

309
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:46,530
left the jianghu long ago.

310
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:49,620
He wouldn't even stay with the Tang Clan.

311
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:51,220
He hid alone

312
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,420
in bleak, remote

313
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,820
Liaoluo City.

314
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,460
Such a man...

315
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,650
why would anyone

316
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,810
ask me, Blood River's Patriarch,

317
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,380
to personally kill him?

318
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,050
Who hired you?

319
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,490
Assassins don't name clients.

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,770
That's the rule.

321
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,330
I can only tell you one thing.

322
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,400
Second Master Tang

323
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,080
is who backs you most

324
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,510
in the Tang Clan.

325
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:17,700
They summoned you to Shuzhong,

326
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,570
but you refused.

327
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,420
Among the elders,

328
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,110
only he

329
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,180
stood with you.

330
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,010
I see.

331
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,700
Thanks for the reminder.

332
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,900
But I'm still here to kill you

333
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,330
to avenge him.

334
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,050
Then by all means,

335
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:38,700
take my life.

336
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:41,210
Sir,

337
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,420
you're in no shape to fight.

338
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,010
If it's Blood River business,

339
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,490
so be it.

340
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:52,460
But this one

341
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,490
is only my enemy.

342
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,460
So I must answer personally.

343
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:58,620
Besides,

344
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,860
the Twelve Zodiacs aren't his match.

345
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,570
Even a tiger near death

346
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,250
has its pride,

347
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,380
and a Patriarch

348
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,380
his duty.

349
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:14,380
No one move!

350
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,330
Stand down.

351
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,530
Show me your skill,

352
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,010
Blossom...

353
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:28,530
Shower!

354
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:34,380
Someone acted before us.

355
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:35,700
Do we go in now?

356
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,290
Watch and wait.

357
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,980
We'll move when Changhe returns.

358
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,720
Truly my good brother.

359
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,020
You do know me.

360
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,410
Right before I do

361
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,760
the most important thing,

362
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:46,960
you asked to meet.

363
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,380
I have something for you.

364
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,250
If I may choose,

365
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,490
I hope it's the Dormant Dragon Sword.

366
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,330
Go to Tianqi City.

367
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,960
Set foot there

368
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,610
and someone will come for you.

369
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,280
With your skill,

370
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,810
you can slip past them

371
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,880
and reach where your secret lies.

372
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,910
Give these keys

373
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,250
to the one who guards your secret.

374
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,090
He will open the boxes

375
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,650
meant for you

376
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,410
and Su Changhe.

377
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,900
From then on,

378
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,330
your names

379
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,980
within Blood River

380
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,050
will be erased forever.

381
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,530
Also,

382
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:30,420
the secret you seek,

383
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,570
the fall of No-Sword City,

384
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,860
is inside.

385
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:42,530
Is that truly what you want?

386
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,660
To leave Blood River

387
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:48,250
and claim real freedom.

388
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,810
You fought so hard

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,730
to shield the Patriarch

390
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,940
just for these two keys?

391
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,090
The three families' chaos is beyond repair.

392
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,460
We can dissolve Blood River in the turmoil.

393
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,700
Then we gain freedom

394
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,680
and everyone

395
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,570
gets a choice.

396
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,770
So that was your plan.

397
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,140
Use their infighting

398
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,700
to drain the power-seekers,

399
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,570
and finally,

400
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:16,980
leave Blood River

401
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,640
with those who think like you.

402
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,450
Su Muyu.

403
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,530
You're sharper than I thought.

404
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,940
But...

405
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,860
I have a gift

406
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,140
for you too.

407
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,090
The Other Shore?

408
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,570
Cross Blood River

409
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,010
and you reach the Other Shore.

410
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,860
There should be

411
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,420
no endless night,

412
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:01,860
but light.

413
00:24:07,270 --> 00:24:08,470
Remember back then,

414
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,530
when we finished a mission

415
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,290
and passed the Canglan River,

416
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,570
you stared at the water

417
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,530
and asked me

418
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,420
a question:

419
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:21,010
when would we reach the Other Shore?

420
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,050
I want to tell you now:

421
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,730
it's tonight.

422
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,570
But this night

423
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,570
will be Blood River's night of blood.

424
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,180
Blood is where change begins.

425
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:38,900
Su Muyu,

426
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,900
you're too kind.

427
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,620
Everyone has a bottom line.

428
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,010
Yours is even higher than my ceiling.

429
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:49,120
It vexes me,

430
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:52,180
and has for years.

431
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,070
If you still mean to stop me,

432
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,660
then let's fight.

433
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,570
Winner calls it.

434
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,090
If you win,

435
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,860
I'll dissolve Blood River with you.

436
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:05,530
If I win,

437
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,770
you'll walk with me to the other shore.

438
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,180
Changhe,

439
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,770
no one knows you better than I do.

440
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,140
You may lead Blood River to the light,

441
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,730
but your ambition

442
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:21,090
will also drive many into the abyss.

443
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,600
And Blood River

444
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,180
is not as simple as you think.

445
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,220
Behind the Patriarch and the Soul Reapers' Hall,

446
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,980
there's a stronger hand.

447
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,250
Stronger?

448
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:33,570
Yes.

449
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,240
Even if we become

450
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:38,250
Patriarch and head of the Su family,

451
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,700
we won't rule it all.

452
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,570
Even the Patriarch

453
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,700
is just a blade in someone else's hand.

454
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,440
If we can found a new Blood River,

455
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:53,900
then that Blood River

456
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,380
belongs only to the two of us.

457
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:57,770
That hidden hand

458
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,860
and those stubborn family heads

459
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,840
will be cut down in the end.

460
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,290
Su Muyu,

461
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,380
when did you grow so timid?

462
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:11,980
To stand against them,

463
00:26:12,830 --> 00:26:13,810
many will die,

464
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:16,050
and the price will be heavy.

465
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,980
I want them

466
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,290
to survive.

467
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:21,900
As you said,

468
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,810
I'm an ambitious man.

469
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,010
Unlike you,

470
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,570
a free spirit.

471
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,700
Su Muyu,

472
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,490
we've always walked

473
00:26:34,550 --> 00:26:35,530
different paths!

474
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,570
You say you'll be a good man

475
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,530
in Blood River.

476
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,010
That's naive.

477
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,810
Those you won't kill, I'll kill.

478
00:26:57,510 --> 00:26:58,890
The sins you won't bear,

479
00:26:58,890 --> 00:26:59,870
I'll bear.

480
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,980
Even if you want to leave Blood River,

481
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:04,860
I'll pave the road for you.

482
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,570
But if you die,

483
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:10,220
I won't see you off,

484
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:15,180
even if they call me the Undertaker.

485
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,180
Do you remember

486
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,490
what I told you

487
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,250
when we escaped Wailing Abyss?

488
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,050
If you're strong enough,

489
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:30,140
you earn the right to be naive.

490
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:39,140
And now,

491
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:43,860
aren't I naive in my own way?

492
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,450
Sword Deity Xueyue,

493
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,360
what do you think?

494
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,170
City Lord Li.

495
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:56,990
Long time no see,

496
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:57,860
Su Muyu.

497
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,590
My junior says

498
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,940
a new Patriarch in Blood River

499
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,140
will shake the jianghu,

500
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,530
so he invited me to judge.

501
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:08,330
He says

502
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,140
you're the best choice

503
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,290
for Patriarch.

504
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,240
Once I kill Mu Mingce,

505
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,300
take the Dormant Dragon Sword,

506
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,100
and unite the three families,

507
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,460
he'll take it, want it or not.

508
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,290
I believe you.

509
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,360
Cruel as you can be,

510
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,140
you keep your word.

511
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,620
You've got a good eye.

512
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,330
Hold him off for me.

513
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,530
I'll handle business.

514
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:35,140
But now I see

515
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,250
an even better end.

516
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:38,460
What?

517
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,760
What Su Muyu said:

518
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,480
dissolve Blood River.

519
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,990
A jianghu without Blood River

520
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,570
is truly best.

521
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:48,940
Excellent.

522
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,620
Trouble at the Nest.

523
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,900
Changhe,

524
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,440
your men acted?

525
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,020
Without me,

526
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,250
they wouldn't dare.

527
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:02,860
It was Tang Lianyue.

528
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,090
He's got his own vendetta.

529
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,620
Skywrath Thunder!

530
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,810
Shame the sky's clear tonight,

531
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,570
or I'd call lightning down,

532
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:21,250
and Sir,

533
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,220
you'd already be dead.

534
00:29:36,310 --> 00:29:37,010
Sir.

535
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,940
A blade is forged by grinding,

536
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:42,010
and plum scent by bitter cold.

537
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,140
That poison

538
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,420
has one distinct trait:

539
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,530
a resilience

540
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:46,810
like the plum blossom.

541
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,570
Even with antidote,

542
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,860
if you stir inner force too soon,

543
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,290
it'll surge back.

544
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:55,180
Looks like

545
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,010
the poison has relapsed.

546
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,330
No need for me to strike,

547
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,380
you'll die soon anyway.

548
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:02,330
Freshly cured,

549
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,730
after this fight,

550
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,250
not even deities can save you.

551
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:06,810
In that case,

552
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,730
I'll take my leave.

553
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,050
Sir, fare well

554
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,570
on your way to the Underworld.

555
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,250
Sir,

556
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:20,660
we must treat it now.

557
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:23,690
No need.

558
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,040
I can feel

559
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,180
my end is near.

560
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,160
Even an immortal

561
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,090
can't reverse it.

562
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:38,220
Miracle physician,

563
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,380
is there any other way?

564
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,670
Freshly cleared of poison,

565
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,460
he shouldn't have stirred the inner force.

566
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,180
He could've lived a few more years.

567
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,490
But just now...

568
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,580
No need to blame yourself.

569
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,810
My sins run deep.

570
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,460
Even in the Underworld,

571
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,660
before Yama,

572
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,380
he'd judge me

573
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:03,810
beyond saving.

574
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:05,860
Sir...

575
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,050
Muyu,

576
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:13,860
Changhe,

577
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,570
come with me.

578
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,140
I have words for you.

579
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,400
The rest of you,

580
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,970
wait here.

581
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,250
Understood.

582
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,140
Muyu,

583
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:44,800
I always thought

584
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,980
you risked everything to protect me

585
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,530
because of the Life-Death Contract.

586
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,090
What contract?

587
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:53,900
No matter.

588
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,380
It's already undone.

589
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,620
I used to think

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,260
the world had cast me aside,

591
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,950
until the day I learned

592
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,290
you'd already cured the Life-Death Contract.

593
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,420
I suddenly realized

594
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,330
I'd underestimated you

595
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,250
and myself.

596
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,050
These years, I stayed by you

597
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:18,940
because I believed

598
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,860
you were worth guarding.

599
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,290
Good.

600
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,770
Very good.

601
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,940
When I was young,

602
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,810
Kewen and I were like brothers,

603
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,700
like you and Changhe.

604
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,510
Later, fighting for the Patriarch's position,

605
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:41,570
I lost much.

606
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,900
And Kewen alone

607
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,980
came to this Spider's Nest.

608
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:49,940
I thought

609
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,940
he'd abandoned me too,

610
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:53,860
yet in the end

611
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:56,290
he gave his life

612
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,430
to save me.

613
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:06,330
Sadly,

614
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,380
some things

615
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,530
don't change,

616
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,220
ever.

617
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,010
Muyu,

618
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,210
you have your own plan, don't you?

619
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:24,290
Your ultimate aim

620
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,290
is to dissolve Blood River,

621
00:33:27,310 --> 00:33:27,980
right?

622
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:30,730
Yes.

623
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,220
If I leave alone,

624
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,420
those of the Spider Shadow won't meet a good end.

625
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:38,710
I don't want them

626
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,980
living in killing every day.

627
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,810
Only by disbanding Blood River

628
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,420
can they gain real freedom,

629
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,130
live like ordinary folk

630
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,460
and walk in the sun.

631
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:55,460
If Blood River scatters like rain,

632
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,090
no matter how strong those powers are,

633
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:02,380
it won't matter.

634
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,730
And you,

635
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,980
Changhe?

636
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,490
You want to command Blood River

637
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,380
to change it,

638
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:14,530
right?

639
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,740
There's much I want to change.

640
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,820
This is only a start.

641
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,380
I can hand you this sword,

642
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,130
though I'd rather

643
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,530
give it to Muyu.

644
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,300
When I was young,

645
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,650
I thought as you do.

646
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:49,570
But for now,

647
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,340
you don't yet know.

648
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,900
The cause you seek to achieve

649
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,490
will be far harder

650
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,300
than you imagine.

651
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:58,690
The ones you must defeat

652
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,490
aren't just Su Jinhui,

653
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:02,130
nor only me,

654
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,110
but ones stronger than us

655
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:09,190
and many times more fearsome.

656
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,090
Together, Su Muyu and I

657
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,370
have yet to lose.

658
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:14,940
The Soul Reapers' Hall

659
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,050
isn't worth a mention.

660
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,870
The Soul Reapers' Hall

661
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,610
is only a puppet

662
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:25,050
they planted in Blood River.

663
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,050
For centuries,

664
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:29,710
all know

665
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,440
Blood River is the most fearsome

666
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,330
under heaven.

667
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,540
But the truth of it

668
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,010
is hid even from its

669
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:40,860
own killers

670
00:35:41,590 --> 00:35:42,940
Then what is the true face

671
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:45,380
of Blood River?

672
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,310
The truth

673
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,840
can't be told in a few words.

674
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:52,940
The secret hides

675
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,740
in the secret passage in my room.

676
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,380
After I'm gone,

677
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,860
you're free to see it.

678
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:01,780
But even if you don't,

679
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,440
when you finally wield

680
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:07,110
this Dormant Dragon Sword,

681
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:10,420
they'll come for you.

682
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:19,860
The sword's here.

683
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,610
I leave it to you two.

684
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,610
Sir...

685
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,650
Muyu,

686
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:40,210
I've always felt this way.

687
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,650
Since I became Patriarch,

688
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:47,340
I held

689
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:51,520
Blood River's highest power

690
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,120
and glory.

691
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,510
But I was like a ghost

692
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,690
cast aside by the three families.

693
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,300
Only days ago,

694
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,420
seeing Kewen die for me,

695
00:37:08,190 --> 00:37:09,010
seeing you

696
00:37:10,510 --> 00:37:12,090
choose to shield me

697
00:37:12,190 --> 00:37:14,090
even after my poison was cleared,

698
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:19,090
did I realize

699
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,300
I was never alone.

700
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,460
Muyu,

701
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:31,530
thanks for staying by my side

702
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,260
all these years.

703
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,210
If not for your kindness back then,

704
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,420
the two of us

705
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,570
would never have left Wailing Abyss.

706
00:37:54,550 --> 00:37:55,380
Back then,

707
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,340
I only meant to use

708
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,010
the strength you two had.

709
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,900
Your original aim,

710
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,880
our ending,

711
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:06,400
and the final choice,

712
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,460
they're not the same thing.

713
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,870
I learned skills in Blood River,

714
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,980
and how to be a man from my father.

715
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,490
My father taught me

716
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,090
loyalty comes first.

717
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,740
Loyalty...

718
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,980
When I was young,

719
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,860
I also wanted to found

720
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,300
a different Blood River.

721
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,530
But later I found

722
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,860
I was turning

723
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,300
into one of them.

724
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,090
And you,

725
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:51,420
Su Muyu,

726
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,050
you're someone

727
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,090
who never changes.

728
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:03,900
Leave.

729
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,460
Leave.

730
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:09,940
Once you're gone,

731
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,380
I'll set a great fire

732
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,980
and burn myself and this Nest

733
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,690
to ash.

734
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:20,980
Say no more.

735
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,980
This is my choice.

736
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,170
Sir...

737
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:39,170
may you find bliss beyond.

738
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,260
I thought you'd urge me

739
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,130
to seek the miracle physician again.

740
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,170
Everyone has

741
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,300
their choice.

742
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,050
And every choice

743
00:40:02,150 --> 00:40:03,380
has its meaning.

744
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,900
I'll surely fall into hell,

745
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,130
so I hope

746
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,380
we never meet again.

747
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,260
It's been a while. No action yet?

748
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:38,650
Could the boss have...

749
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,260
Someone's heading in.

750
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,900
Changhe said, wait for his word.

751
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,940
Then whatever happens,

752
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,050
we don't act on our own.

753
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,090
In this world,

754
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,130
you're the only one

755
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,260
I'll give this sword to.

756
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,530
Honestly, I think

757
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,570
you'll find it easier

758
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,420
to win support.

759
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,570
The Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow

760
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,460
can die for you, after all.

761
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,900
While The Other Shore lot

762
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,420
only draw steel on me.

763
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,570
As we agreed:

764
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:10,780
you be Patriarch,

765
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,260
and I'll head the Su family.

766
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,530
Figures.

767
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:20,940
Even if I yield to you,

768
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,650
you still won't take it.

769
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,980
Every moment

770
00:41:23,030 --> 00:41:24,300
you want to leave this place,

771
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:26,730
cut ties with Blood River.

772
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,040
Why do you insist on staying?

773
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,570
Because not everyone

774
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,160
is wantless like you.

775
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,740
Some want to be heroes,

776
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,170
some, knights-errant.

777
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:41,490
Some want

778
00:41:41,490 --> 00:41:42,930
great wealth,

779
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,340
some want a famous name.

780
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,400
Blood River is strong.

781
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:49,950
Together,

782
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,940
we can make and change so much.

783
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,780
I have ambition,

784
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,650
and they have desires.

785
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:57,980
Better than wandering the world,

786
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,300
grip the sword in your hand

787
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:00,980
and fight to the end

788
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,340
against those bad guys

789
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:04,260
who'd rule our fate.

790
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,940
Well said!

791
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,610
Kill them all,

792
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,940
and you'll purge this poison for me?

793
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:19,010
Yes.

794
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:21,340
They're the Su family's

795
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,570
two strongest:

796
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,900
Su Muyu

797
00:42:24,510 --> 00:42:25,980
and Su Changhe.

798
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:27,860
You're Water Official

799
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,980
of the Soul Reapers' Hall?

800
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,420
Your speech just now was well put.

801
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,420
Only a pity.

802
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:34,860
What's the pity?

803
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,130
A pity...

804
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,380
you aren't the one we chose.

805
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,280
Don't worry.

806
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:42,690
I won't step in.

807
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,400
As one of the Three Officials,

808
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,420
I prefer to watch

809
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:47,440
from the sidelines.

810
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,260
Strong as you are,

811
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:51,570
you still won't

812
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,860
be a match for Mu Ciling.

813
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:54,690
I disagree with much

814
00:42:54,710 --> 00:42:55,900
of what Changhe said,

815
00:42:57,190 --> 00:42:58,380
but one thing

816
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,260
was no empty talk:

817
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,010
together, the two of us

818
00:43:03,670 --> 00:43:04,860
have never lost.

819
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,420
