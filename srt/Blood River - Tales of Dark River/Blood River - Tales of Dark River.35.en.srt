00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,460
There's a 50% chance

6
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,740
you'll be able to take Yong's life.

7
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,660
I do want to try.

8
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:50,850
But you'll die too.

9
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,690
I think that price

10
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:56,850
is not worth it.

11
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,330
Yeah.

12
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,020
Staying alive matters more.

13
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,260
I'm really angry right now, though.

14
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,500
Your miracle physician

15
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,220
wrecked our plan.

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,130
Plan?

17
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:18,820
You never told me

18
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,130
any plan of yours.

19
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,010
Before I went into seclusion,

20
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,100
I told them

21
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,010
not to act rashly.

22
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,540
Just keep the clinic open.

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,610
So why did keeping the clinic open

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,100
bring deadly trouble?

25
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,130
Sir,

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,260
It's all

27
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,570
just a misunderstanding.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,810
Just some

29
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,980
sudden turns.

30
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,100
But now,

31
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,820
we're curious

32
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:48,730
whether...

33
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:56,060
you and Master Su

34
00:02:56,630 --> 00:02:58,890
picked different allies.

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,290
Su Muyu doesn't know my choice.

36
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,170
He's still all in on the Prince of Langya.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,010
I don't agree.

38
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,010
The Prince of Langya can give him

39
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,780
the help he wants

40
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,890
but not me.

41
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,540
Because I want to be No.1 in the jianghu.

42
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,940
From the first time I met you,

43
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:30,780
I knew,

44
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,340
Sir,

45
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,100
you were ambitious.

46
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,290
This is a truth-testing snake,

47
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,820
a gift sent to me

48
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:54,100
from Nanjue.

49
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,450
It carries a rare poison

50
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,690
that kills on contact.

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,010
Yet it's gentle by nature.

52
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,220
When you touch it

53
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,100
in ordinary times,

54
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,060
it won't react at all.

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,610
But if you touch it

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,730
while telling a lie,

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,980
it can sense

58
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,130
even the slightest change.

59
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,850
And it will snap at you.

60
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,540
Sir,

61
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,540
care to try?

62
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,170
Interesting.

63
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,140
Why did you and Master Su

64
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,100
choose differently?

65
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,930
Why not side with the Prince of Langya?

66
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,020
Just like you,

67
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,250
once you're high up,

68
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,930
the next step is reaching the peak.

69
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,780
Even with the Prince of Langya helping us,

70
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,930
Xueyue City stays No.1.

71
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:49,980
But if you

72
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,610
topple the Prince of Langya,

73
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,720
then Blood River

74
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,980
will become emperor of the jianghu.

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,340
Bold talk.

76
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,810
"Emperor of the jianghu"?

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,020
That's quite the arrogance.

78
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,810
If Su Muyu

79
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,020
blocks our plan,

80
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,490
would you kill him?

81
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,340
Kill Su Muyu?

82
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,780
Don't ask something so out of line.

83
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,410
That's costly.

84
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,140
It doesn't matter

85
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,780
who you will kill

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,540
or won't kill.

87
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:56,020
We share an enemy,

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,660
and that's enough.

89
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,100
Next,

90
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,540
I'll tell you

91
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,730
our plan.

92
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,250
I hope your plan

93
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,320
won't let me down.

94
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,370
My patience is limited.

95
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:17,140
Then we start

96
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:20,900
from His Majesty's accession.

97
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:27,780
[Qiushui Cottage]

98
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,380
Good wine.

99
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,850
It goes straight to the head.

100
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,410
Tonight,

101
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,540
you've drunk plenty.

102
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,290
Because I won't get drunk tonight.

103
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,220
Shameless as it sounds,

104
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,580
a by-any-means plan

105
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,460
to reach the goal.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,590
But it suits me,

107
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,750
perfectly.

108
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:58,660
Then, Sir...

109
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,170
Tianqi City will be yours.

110
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,700
Changhe,

111
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,610
since you left seclusion,

112
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,730
you seem different.

113
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,290
Nonsense.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,900
I've barely been out.

115
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,730
It's not about time.

116
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,360
You just look

117
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,730
harder to read.

118
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,410
Is it because of the Hell Palm?

119
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,490
That old man Mu said...

120
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,250
No need to worry.

121
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,370
I know what I'm doing.

122
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:51,540
When have I ever lied to you?

123
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,340
You have.

124
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,170
You said you'd found a great place,

125
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,190
no worries about food or drink.

126
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,320
And then,

127
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,490
you dragged me into Blood River.

128
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:05,170
Blame it on Su Muyu.

129
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,580
But look at you,

130
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,930
you're grown,

131
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,100
yet still like a kid,

132
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,490
rambling,

133
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,490
and worrying.

134
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,220
When will you stand on your own?

135
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:15,810
No matter.

136
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,460
As long as I'm here,

137
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,580
you can stay behind me.

138
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,810
So,

139
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,900
do we go find Muyu and the others?

140
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,340
No.

141
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,700
And don't tell them I'm out.

142
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,980
Tonight,

143
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,300
I'll take a good walk around Tianqi City.

144
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,490
Changhe,

145
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,700
we really don't tell Muyu?

146
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,490
He won't agree.

147
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,530
I have my plan.

148
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,580
Have you found where they are?

149
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:06,220
They pride themselves on hiding.

[of Sweetwater Lane in the south]
also Mu by name.

152
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,300
And we're good at tracking.

153
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,250
Your Highness,

154
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,820
we've located Su Muyu

155
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:21,700
and their hideout.

156
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,820
Your Highness,

157
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,220
a report from General Dian Ye:

158
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,530
His Majesty has granted him authority

159
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,340
to sweep the city for the General's Residence assassins

160
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:31,980
and execute them on the spot.

161
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,650
Interesting.

162
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:42,990
But we just met

163
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,020
with Su Changhe

164
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,210
and strike them next,

165
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:45,980
isn't that a bit...

166
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,370
What Su Muyu does

167
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,580
isn't Su Changhe's to control.

168
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,770
Likewise, how can I control

169
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,940
what the Flying Tiger General

170
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,850
wants?

171
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,370
Give that hideout location

172
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:06,580
to my uncle,

173
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,420
and let him

174
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,850
do as he sees fit.

175
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:13,940
Understood.

Greetings, Your Highness.

177

how is Uncle Zhe?

No big problem.

189
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:27,940
Good.

You alone

198
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,700
are too dangerous!

201
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,700
and Master Su has fainted.

202
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,610
So, I call the shots in Blood River.

203
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,770
You should all listen to me.

204
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,650
Move now.

208
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,370
why not come with us?

209
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:57,890

210
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,700
they'll catch us fast.

211
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,730
I'll stay here

212
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,940
and stall them with a mist formation.

213
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,180

214
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,940

215

222

224

233
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,340

00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,700

235

259
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,730
True.

263

are far bolder as well.

264
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,340
But on a wrong board,

265
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,610
if you keep playing,

266
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,980
you'll lose it all.

267

Well,

268
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,700
I'm not afraid to lose.

269
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,250

275
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,340

279
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,700
There'd be no game today.

280
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:43,700

and spare you a way to live.

291

It's a poison array.

292
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,530

308
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,570
it means

309
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,330

we'll die here together...

315
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:02,220

Of course,

387
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,140
it could also be

388
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,980
someone lured them away on purpose.

389
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,840
So, Xueyue Sword Deity,

390
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,050
will you help me?

391
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,290
By my mother's wish,

392
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:45,980
I only protect you.

393
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,290
For anything else,

394
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,860
she said not to heed you.

395
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:53,860
[Under the Open Sky]

396
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,140
Someone is spreading

397
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,010
the puppet poison in Tianqi.

398
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,640
You should know

399
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,720
how terrible

400
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:05,730
the drugged puppet art is.

401
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,770
Of course I do.

402
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,940
But that poison

403
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,770
is deadly on the battlefield,

404
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,660
not in Tianqi City.

405
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,570
So, the poison

406
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,220
is just a feint.

407
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,140
They want to split our forces

408
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:21,490
and draw our eyes.

409
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,460
What truly matters now

410
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,220
is the Dragonseal Scroll.

411
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,420
Tell me,

412
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:33,620
what if

413
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,900
the Dragonseal Scroll appears

414
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,940
with my name on it,

415
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,700
and I refuse?

416
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:40,730
What will happen?

417
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,180
If the throne is unrightful,

418
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,660
any with dragon's blood

419
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,810
can claim it,

420
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,980
and the realm falls to chaos.

421
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,250
The Langya army in the south

422
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:55,250
is already locked in fierce battle.

423
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,380
And my father...

424
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,490
is at death's door.

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,140
Tianqi's main guardians

426
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,290
have all been redeployed.

427
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,460
Your health is this poor.

428
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,810
And the Imperial Assembly is near,

429
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:14,490
when all the generals and lords

430
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,660
will converge on Tianqi.

431
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,250
If someone steers it,

432
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,730
if chaos comes,

433
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,810
you won't hold it down.

434
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,860
Xueyue Sword Deity,

435
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,530
your first point

436
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:29,900
was exactly right.

437
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,220
Right now,

438
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:33,420
the Dragonseal Scroll

439
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:34,730
is the bigger problem

440
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,900
to solve.

441
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:37,530
But,

442
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,900
I've searched for years

443
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,330
and never found it.

444
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,180
So I'll wait for the day

445
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,490
they can't hold back.

446
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:46,330
They'll make a play at the Imperial Assembly.

447
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,370
I just need the chance

448
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,620
to intercept it

449
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:51,620
before it appears.

450
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:52,940
That's all.

451
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,620
So,

452
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,330
one thing you said

453
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,530
was off.

454
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,730
Listen,

455
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,700
here in Tianqi,

456
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,010
no matter when chaos breaks,

457
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,380
I, Xiao Ruofeng,

458
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,010
can always hold it down.

459
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,940
How's it going?

460
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,220
Where is Master Mu?

461
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,490
Ms. Wan'er's home is burned to the ground.

462
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,940
The Jinwu Guard

463
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,140
lines the whole lane.

464
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,380
They claim

465
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:31,770
all ones inside

466
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,010
were slain.

467
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,420
Then...

468
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:39,380
Master Mu and Miss Xuewei...

469
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,660
The guard is tight.

470
00:26:42,030 --> 00:26:43,940
We found no chance to slip in,

471
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,530
so we saw no bodies.

472
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,050
Maybe,

473
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:48,900
it's planted news

474
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,050
to mislead us.

475
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,570
If they escaped,

476
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:53,570
they should've reached us by now!

477
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:03,180
A squad of soldiers

478
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,290
have surrounded this area too.

479
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,090
Are they Jinwu Guard too?

480
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,250
No.

481
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,010
Doesn't look like it.

482
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,220
I'm Jia Feng, Commander of the Inner Security Division.

483
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,980
By order of the Prince of Langya,

484
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,380
I'm here to protect you.

485
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,570
Under an investigation,

486
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,110
[Kind Heart, Skilled Hands]

487
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,500
I've completely sealed off

488
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,250
three nearby alleys.

489
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,460
Be it the Jinwu Guard and the Court of Judicial Review,

490
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:33,570
none of their men can set foot here.

491
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,420
If you're here to investigate,

492
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,490
I'll ask your Prince of Langya

493
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,530
for one person.

494
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,700
Name him.

495
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:42,140
The son of Li Xian, Deputy Commander

496
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,250
of the Jinwu Guard.

497
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,730
Understood.

498
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,140
I'll take my leave.

499
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:02,980
Su Muyu...

500
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:05,940
Last night,

501
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:08,180
Master Mu and Xuewei

502
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,700
stayed behind in that courtyard.

503
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:23,050
What's wrong?

504
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,460
A spider bit me...

505
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:25,220
What?

506
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:26,010
- Spider? - Spider?

507
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,180
- Spider... - Spider...

508
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,330
It's a tracking Spider.

509
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,460
Tracking Spider?

510
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,620
- Tracking Spider! - Tracking Spider!

511
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,420
Last time,

512
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,730
someone was bitten at Doom Abyss.

513
00:28:35,790 --> 00:28:36,460
Was that you?

514
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,090
Yes.

515
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,620
I thought I was just unlucky.

516
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,530
- Run! - Now!

517
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:44,940
That way!

518
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,940
- Move! - Go!

519
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:54,940
Useless!

520
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,940
Tell the guards outside.

521
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:57,900
Run!

522
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,700
Got it!

523
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,570
Stay back!

524
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,700
Stay back!

525
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:06,220
Trying to run away?

526
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,050
Too late.

527
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:12,660
Spider Woman.

528
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:14,090
It's me.

529
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:28,940
Your signal arrow won't help now.

530
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,290
Everyone in this manor

531
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,700
has already been dealt with.

532
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,570
As expected of the Xuanwu Guardian from Tang Clan

533
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,980
and Blood River's Spider Woman,

534
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:45,180
you kill without a sound.

535
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:46,770
Come with me.

536
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,730
Confess everything.

537
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,620
Watch out!

538
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,490
Haze swept clear,

539
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,250
moon shines afar.

540
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:14,940
Everyone,

541
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,810
I'll go on ahead.

542
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,050
Dead?

543
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:21,660
What now?

544
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,530
He was struck by snake venom.

545
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,290
What do we do with the people here?

546
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,380
Don't kill me!

547
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,860
I'll send word for the Inner Security Division

548
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,940
to seal this place off.

549
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,140
Their identities are too sensitive.

550
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:46,660
For now, we can't let them

551
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,460
return to Tianqi.

552
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:55,700
[Flying Tiger General's Residence]

553
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:58,900
Your Highness.

554
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,380
Fengxi Manor was attacked.

555
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:03,860
The area was sealed

556
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,620
by Tang Lianyue.

557
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,810
Lord Haoyue was poisoned

558
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,700
and is dead.

559
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:09,420
Understood.

560
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,860
Your Highness doesn't seem to care.

561
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:15,090
Just a bunch of pieces.

562
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,180
Since they're pieces,

563
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,140
whose hand they fall into

564
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:20,810
makes no difference.

565
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,900
You may go.

566
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:27,530
Let them hold that hot potato

567
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,620
and really savor

568
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,980
what panic feels like.

569
00:31:35,830 --> 00:31:36,290
Understood.

570
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,900
The Imperial Assembly is almost here.

571
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,900
Lords and generals

572
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,900
are filing into the capital.

573
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,180
Those who back us

574
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,250
will gather in Tianqi.

575
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:01,330
Plus that powerful item,

576
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,660
this will become the best chance

577
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,730
to wipe out all our enemies.

578
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:10,330
The time to draw blades at last...

579
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,250
is close now, Uncle.

580
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:16,810
You visited the palace last night.

581
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,050
Did he say anything?

582
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,980
It no longer matters what he said,

583
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,570
Uncle.

584
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,460
Since he didn't detain me at court,

585
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,330
it means he tacitly allows my moves.

586
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,570
He might even be waiting

587
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:35,730
for my duel with the Prince of Langya.

588
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,700
An overlooked prince

589
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,490
and a prince whose merit outshines the throne,

590
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,900
either way,

591
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,380
it's a deal

592
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:50,050
that costs him nothing.

593
00:32:51,790 --> 00:32:53,010
My father

594
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,050
was suspicious by nature,

595
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,290
loving yet ruthless,

596
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,770
born to rule.

597
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:02,860
Yong...

598
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,050
I will always remember

599
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,690
the day my mother died,

600
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,010
the freezing palace,

601
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:17,290
the cold stares,

602
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,290
and those

603
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,900
fake sobs.

604
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,220
From that day on,

605
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,700
I began preparing

606
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:28,900
for this day to come.

607
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,290
I'll draw my sword to cut off

608
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,420
all injustice.

609
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:36,770
I'll take back

610
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,220
all that should be mine!

611
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,730
I will...

612
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:42,530
stand alone at the pinnacle!

613
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:45,700
[Still Waters]

614
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,010
The Jinwu Guard wouldn't leave the lane.

615
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,300
We staked out half a day for an opening.

616
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,700
With the Inner Security Division's help,

617
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,010
we slipped into the courtyard

618
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,900
and took all the important items

619
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,050
Master Mu had hidden in advance.

620
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,170
Still no bodies found?

621
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:12,460
No.

622
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:15,650
Only this.

623
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,860
Have the Inner Security Division men outside

624
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,610
send word to the Prince of Langya.

625
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,650
On cooperation,

626
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:43,090
I'll assist him with all my strength.

627
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,690
But aside from that,

628
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,130
Blood River has debts in Tianqi

629
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:50,050
to be paid in blood.

630
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,490
We will not leave

631
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,780
until they're settled.

632
00:34:56,510 --> 00:34:58,300
If this runs against his plan,

633
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,900
tell him not to block us.

634
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,570
Understood.

635
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,780
What happened,

636
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,850
Muyu?

637
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,570
What exactly happened?

638
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,610
I just passed by Ms. Wan'er's place

639
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,460
and found the whole courtyard burned down.

640
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,210
And on my way back,

641
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,210
Men of the Inner Security Division were everywhere.

642
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,340
Did...

643
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:25,740
something happen?

644
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:28,980
That base was exposed last night.

645
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,740
We were attacked in the night.

646
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,710
Uncle Zhe had just used the Divine-Demon Nirvana Art

647
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,610
to finish healing me.

648
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:37,940
We couldn't fight

649
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,690
and had to withdraw.

650
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,860
Qingyang and Xuewei stayed to cover us,

651
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,530
and they didn't make it back.

652
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:50,980
What do you mean...

653
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:54,820
they didn't make it back?

654
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:12,740
Yu,

655
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:14,860
we used to treat

656
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,050
a partner's death

657
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,820
as something

658
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,130
we took for granted.

659
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,090
But now,

660
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,130
everything is different.

661
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,260
On the road to the Other Shore,

662
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,490
how many partners

663
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,650
will we lose?

664
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,050
What about Changhe?

665
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,530
Where is he?

666
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,940
I've already sent Yin the Tiger

667
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,900
to call him back.

668
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,010
This isn't the time for seclusion.

669
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,380
Yu,

670
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:04,380
the Patriarch is no longer in the chamber.

671
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,610
He's gone?

672
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,460
That means

673
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,210
he's completed training and left seclusion,

674
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,860
yet didn't return to us at once.

675
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,210
Where did he go?

676
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:19,300
Su Muyu,

677
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,610
has he ever acted on his own

678
00:37:22,630 --> 00:37:24,170
without telling you?

679
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,210
In my memory,

680
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,490
only once.

681
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,610
When?

682
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,090
When he tried to kill the former patriarch

683
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:35,260
to seize the Dormant Dragon Sword.

684
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:38,860
Maybe

685
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,460
the Patriarch has other plans?
