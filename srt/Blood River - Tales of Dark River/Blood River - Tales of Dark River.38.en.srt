he would fire a signal arrow.

33
00:04:58,510 --> 00:04:59,520
And then, I'd take my sword

34
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,540

If I take my sword with me,

39
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,730
you have to come with me by hook or by crook.

56

00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:21,820
Xiao Yong also knows

189
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,220
that he cannot

190
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,370
get out of this that easily.

191
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,250
Therefore, he confessed by writing a petition.

192
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:28,850
He said that he was partly responsible

193
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,010
for Dian Ye's crimes.

194
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,610
He was willing to be imprisoned in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

195
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,420
give up on his title as a prince,

196
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,580
and never involve himself in political strife again.

197
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,820
Is...

198
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,060
Is that all?

199
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:43,980
What about Prince of Langya?

200
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,420
Is he satisfied with this ending?

201
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,610
His Highness wasn't satisfied at all.

202
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,180
He submitted a memorial impeaching First Prince.

203
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,100
And, he submitted evidence of

204
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,490
First Prince's participation in the rebellion.

205
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,220
But on the second day,

206
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,820
His Majesty has already permitted Xiao Yong's request.

207
00:14:58,630 --> 00:14:59,530
His Highness wanted to seek an audience with His Majesty,

208
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,940
but His Majesty refused it.

209
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,420
Is the Dragonseal Scroll still nowhere to be found?

210
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,580
That's right.

211
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,420
It seems as if someone has retrieved it before us.

212
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:08,890
The Inner Security Division will continue

213
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,300
to investigate the case.

214
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:16,490
Head back now.

215
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,530
None of your answers was satisfying.

216
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,060
Patriarch, what do you plan to do next?

217
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,180
Me?

218
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,850
We'll talk about it after Su Muyu regains consciousness.

219
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,900
I'll heed his will once he wakes up.

220
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,950
After all, he was the one who decided to come to Tianqi.

221
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:32,700
If he doesn't regain consciousness,

222
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,220
I'll unsheathe my sword and hunt them down.

223
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,010
Xiao Yong will die.

224
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:40,820
Prince of Langya

225
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,850
will die as well.

226
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:46,580
Go now.

227
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,130
Was I too harsh

228
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,820
to your lover just now?

229
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,490
You were gentler

230
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:17,820
compared to your usual attitude.

231
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,740
You went through

232
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,250
a life-or-death situation with your beloved.

233
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,820
Why does it feel like you're unhappy about it?

234
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,850
Look at the current situation.

235
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,470
How can I be happy about it?

236
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:34,610
Yumo,

237
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,420
right now,

238
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,530
you're the only dependable member of the Mu family.

239
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:40,100
I understand.

240
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,060
From now on,

241
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,220
I'm the head of Mu family.

242
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,940
I'll set aside

243
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,250
my feelings and relationships.

244
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,340
Will you be able to achieve that?

245
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,850
Don't worry.

246
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:56,650
And,

247
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,890
since he has already given me his promise,

248
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,370
there's no need for me to be impatient.

249
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:04,980
Go now.

250
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,090
You're finally awake.

251
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:12,570
She...

252
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,660
White cranes fly south,

253
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,860
gazing across the Huai River.

254
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,730
Miss Bai didn't suffer

255
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,770
during her last moments.

256
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,570
Using my Inch Sword,

257
00:18:40,310 --> 00:18:40,730
Uncle Zhe, he...

258
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:47,620
You know this too.

259
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:49,980
Uncle Zhe always does a clean job.

260
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,980
It already ended

261
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,080
before Miss Bai felt anything.

262
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,530
Uncle Zhe said

263
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,900
that since you were unconscious,

264
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,660
he had no choice

265
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,330
but to do it on your behalf.

266
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,330
They waited a few days for you,

267
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,420
but you didn't regain consciousness.

268
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,010
Therefore, Uncle Zhe will escort her body

269
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:17,900
back to Medicine King Valley first.

270
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,090
From now on, each Qingming,

271
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:23,860
on the day of remembrance,

272
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,330
they'll prepare a pot of wine for you

273
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,220
in Medicine King Valley.

274
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,050
They'll wait for you.

275
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:07,250
Where's Night Crow?

276
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,900
According to Yumo,

277
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,620
she should've been reduced to ashes

278
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,380
by Phoenix Descent.

279
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,660
What about Xiao Yong?

280
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:20,860
He confessed to his crimes.

281
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,050
However, his father

282
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,900
managed to keep him alive.

283
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,900
He would only be imprisoned at the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

284
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,770
Prince of Langya asked us about the decision we would make.

285
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,460
I said I would heed your will

286
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:35,220
after you regain consciousness.

287
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:54,530
Your Highness.

288
00:20:59,240 --> 00:20:59,900
Has Su Muyu

289
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,330
regain consciousness?

290
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,010
Not yet.

291
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:05,940
I only met Su Changhe.

292
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,290
What did the Patriarch of Blood River

293
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,940
say?

294
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:20,700
According to him,

295
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,660
if Su Muyu regains consciousness,

296
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,770
he will heed his will.

297
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,620
If he doesn't regain consciousness,

298
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,330
he'll kill Xiao Yong.

299
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,290
He'll kill you as well.

300
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,620
Perhaps

301
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,250
my life will end before he hunts me down.

302
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,490
Who are you?

303
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,900
I came here to pay my final respects

304
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,860
to the person behind you.

305
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,050
Such audacity!

306
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,090
Am I audacious?

307
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:38,580
A good friend of mine

308
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,870
rescued your son.

309
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,810
But the person behind you

310
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,730
took her life away.

311
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,220
Shouldn't I come here to pay my final respects?

312
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,490
So, it's you guys.

313
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,420
But he has already confessed to his crime

314
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,530
and will be sent to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

315
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,290
His Majesty has already issued an imperial decree.

316
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,180
His life now rests

317
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,980
in the hands of Heaven.

318
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:02,090
I am

319
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,250
Heaven itself.

320
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,530
Your Highness, are you planning to go into confinement?

321
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,660
Master Su,

322
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,290
you guys have already won.

323
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,090
Prince of Langya and his men

324
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,620
would surely keep his promise to you.

325
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,420
They'll allow Blood River

326
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,770
to walk in the sunlight.

327
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,700
Why do you

328
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:34,980
have to do this?

329
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,620
So, a prince

330
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,050
can kill at will, huh?

331
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,900
Even if one has to accept punishment,

332
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,420
they can survive

333
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,810
as long as they give up on their title, huh?

334
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,900
I haven't stepped into the Imperial Astronomical Bureau yet.

335
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,660
I'm still a prince.

336
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,380
Do you know

337
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,000
what sort of crime it is

338
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,330
to kill a prince on the streets?

339
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,570
If you do so, Blood River

340
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,530
will never be able

341
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,220
to walk in the sunlight.

342
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,090
A shadow will always remain one.

343
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,140
It'll disappear when it makes contact with sunlight.

344
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,380
You guys will become

345
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,730
the most-wanted criminals of Beili.

346
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,380
Each of your portraits

347
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,810
will be posted

348
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,980
at the most obvious spots of every city.

349
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,530
When Qingyang and Xuewei died,

350
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,290
Yumo asked me a question.

351
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,570
Once,

352
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,580
the death of our companions

353
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,710
were nothing special

354
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:38,140
to us.

355
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,180
But now, everything has changed.

356
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,660
How many people still have to die

357
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,570
in order for us to reach the Other Shore?

358
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,620
I have my own choice.

359
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,730
That is to avenge Miss Bai,

360
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:00,730
Qingyang,

361
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:01,900
Xuewei,

362
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,810
and every companion

363
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,290
who was manipulated by you all.

364
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,860
There's a certain meaning

365
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,780
behind my choice.

366
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:21,770
From now on,

367
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,460
the entire Tianqi City

368
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,570
will remember the name of Blood River.

369
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,570
No one can manipulate us

370
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,980
like pawns again.

371
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,290
It's because they've already witnessed

372
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:38,180
the price they have to pay for doing so.

373
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:15,810
Darn it!

374
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,660
What's the matter?

375
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,380
Did you feel his presence as well?

376
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,290
What are you looking at?

377
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:12,290
Nothing.

378
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:28,860
Su Yunxiu,

379
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,490
how's my daughter doing?

380
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,860
She's fine.

381
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,290
Don't worry.

382
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:35,250
Since I've stepped in,

383
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,900
I'll save her no matter what.

384
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:37,570
But,

385
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,290
there's one condition.

386
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,380
What is it?

387
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,380
Tell me.

388
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,770
I have to take the miracle physician with me for the time being.

389
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:45,980
But why?

390
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,010
I need to cultivate

391
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,050
a martial art after this.

392
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:52,420
I need another miracle physician to be on standby

393
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,220
next to me.

394
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,420
And, I don't want to be targeted by Su Muyu.

395
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,980
It's very troublesome.

396
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,290
You know my personality too.

397
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,900
If you dare to utter a single word to him,

398
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,380
Bai Hehuai

399
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,980
will never return to your side again.

400
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,530
Say,

401
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,140
what will Su Muyu become in the future?

402
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,860
This is truly intriguing.

403
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:35,420
Right when

404
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:37,010
he's about to step into the light,

405
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,490
he's plunged into the dark abyss again.

406
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,380
We're going to leave Tianqi City soon.

407
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:54,770
We're here to bid you farewell, Prince of Langya.

408
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,660
Perhaps you guys

409
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,050
shouldn't have killed Xiao Yong.

410
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,810
There are many ways to resolve the situation.

411
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,380
But you guys just have to choose

412
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,530
the one that's unsalvageable.

413
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,980
Everyone says that I'm a lunatic.

414
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,810
Actually,

415
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,420
my buddy is the same.

416
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:19,900
Your Highness,

417
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,020
perhaps Blood River's Other Shore isn't

418
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,980
what we expected it to be.

419
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,980
What we wish to become

420
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,810
are people who can stand beneath the light,

421
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,460
not pawns meant for those fighting for power.

422
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,090
If Xiao Yong was sent to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau,

423
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,980
under the surveillance of

424
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,810
Qi Tianchen, the Chancellor,

425
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,980
it would be difficult for him to rise again.

426
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,730
But now that Xiao Yong is dead,

427
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,570
that'll complicate

428
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,180
a lot of things.

429
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,010
Perhaps in the past,

430
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,940
Blood River stood in the shadows.

431
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,700
Perhaps in the future,

432
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,330
Blood River still isn't able

433
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,700
to walk in the sunlight.

434
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:56,980
But at the very least, right now,

435
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,900
we carry with us a justice of our own.

436
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,090
And, within that justice,

437
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,460
Xiao Yong deserves to die.

438
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,380
If anyone dares to use us

439
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,570
as pawns again,

440
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,530
don't blame us for rising up and taking control.

441
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,900
Changhe and I will return to Blood River.

442
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,900
From now on, we'll tread on our own path.

443
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,810
We'll reach the Other Shore eventually,

444
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,460
no matter how tough the journey will be.

445
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,220
All right.

446
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:36,570
If so, I hope that we won't be enemies

447
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,290
the next time we meet.

448
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,220
But it's difficult for us

449
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,290
to become friends as well.

450
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,490
Farewell.

451
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:19,810
Chancellor,

452
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,380
First Prince Xiao Yong

453
00:31:21,590 --> 00:31:22,770
was assassinated on his way

454
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:24,180
to the Imperial Astronomical Bureau.

455
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,380
Who did it?

456
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:30,090
I only saw one of them before.

457
00:31:30,550 --> 00:31:32,010
Back then, he was outside our bureau.

458
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,770
But you drove him off with your talisman.

459
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,700
Perhaps

460
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,660
I was too narrow-minded back then.

461
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:49,460
The head of Su family

462
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,980
is worth an encounter.

463
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:25,530
What's the matter?

464
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,330
Will you regret it?

465
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,570
We put in so much effort for this.

466
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,700
But everything went back to square one

467
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,010
after you killed him.

468
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:46,530
Prince of Langya won't be able to help us out.

469
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:48,900
He's going to die soon.

470
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,490
He wishes to pave a path

471
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,530
for those he cared for before his death.

472
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,330
But the people he cared for,

473
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,140
the path they'll take

474
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,730
is vastly different from ours.
