5
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,130
So this is a pharmacy too?

6
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:44,210
Which master is in charge here?

7
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:45,660
Me.

8
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,540
Who is she?

9
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:50,770
You?

10
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,390
Young lady,

11
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,100
get inside and help your master grind the herbs.

12
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,290
Stop making trouble out here.

13
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,540
May I ask, sir,

14
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,180
if your Fengmen point aches faintly

15
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:06,740
around 3 to 5 a.m. each day?

16
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,220
How did you know?

17
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,570
It must be from hard labor

18
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,690
when I was young,

19
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,060
so now I suffer.

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:15,220
That makes sense.

21
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,610
Then why does your Baihui point

22
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,170
throb without stopping

23
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,780
from 9 to 11 p.m.?

24
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:21,820
You did farm work back then,

25
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:22,610
but surely

26
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,260
you didn't damage your head doing it.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,610
Hey...

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,130
If you leave this untreated,

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,010
I'm afraid

30
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,380
you'll be meeting the King of Hell.

31
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,690
Every word is spot-on!

32
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,890
Spot-on!

This physician is amazing!

34
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,170
You're a real miracle physician!

35
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,340
I've sought help for years,

36
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,450
spent so much time and effort,

37
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,610
all to cure

38
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:39,660
this body of mine.

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,450
But,

40
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,820
though I've had plenty of prescriptions,

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,340
nothing has helped.

42
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:44,730
Miracle physician, save me!

43
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,340
Please, save me!

44
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,450
You said you did manual work

45
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,450
when you were young.

46
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,820
After that,

47
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,890
did you rinse off?

48
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,450
Of course.

49
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,330
The well water there

50
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,340
is ice-cool.

51
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,690
After the heavy work,

52
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,890
I'd pour it over my head.

53
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,060
That felt great.

54
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,450
There it is.

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,290
Hot and cold colliding,

It's not an external illness,

58
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,500
but you hurt your insides.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,500
I'll write you a prescription.

60
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,500
When you get home,

61
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,410
take it for forty-nine days,

62
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:15,500
and you'll be cured.

00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,130

I'll be second.

Can you charge me less?

81
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:47,570
No consult fee.

82
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,850
Half off the medicine.

162
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,600
Farewell.

Some patients today were plants,

171
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,540
but tomorrow the real ones

172
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,370
will flood our door.

173
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,850
If it's just you two,

00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,580
this clinic of ours

175
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,050
might shut in a day.

176
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,780
So you still need me!

177
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,340
Muyu.

178
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,020
Give it a cut.

Not bad!

181
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,140
Straighter than Changhe's slices.

182
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,780
Muyu, you're a sword deity!

183
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,810
Our swords are so different in length.

184
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,900
How's that comparable?

185
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,170
Would a sword deity

186
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,850
use his blade to slice watermelon?

187
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:53,410
I'll go cook for you.

190
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,660
I've made a decision.

191

I'm taking a long trip.

192

Some things

193
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,890
need to be settled.

194
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,610
If not,

195
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,700
they'll be a knot in the heart.

196
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,730
Even if

197
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,340
you're happy

198
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,250
most days,

199
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,540
once you think of that hurdle,

200
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,900
your smile just vanishes.

201
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:30,930
Go!

202
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,730
As long as

203
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,460
you don't risk your life,

204
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,580
it's fine.

205
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,850
Thank you.

206
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,250
Since I've learned the hidden past,

207
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,300
I should do something for my family.

208
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,850
Yours isn't a killer's sword.

209
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,460
It's a sword that seeks justice.

210
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,100
Think it through.

211
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:57,220
From now on, be a swordsman,

212
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,820
not a killer.

213
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,180
At least...

214
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:02,890
for the time being,

215
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,580
I want a new role

216
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,610
to seek an answer.

217
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,060
What role?

218
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,530
Young master

219
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,300
of No-Sword City.

220
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,250
And what answer?

221
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,700
Wushuang City is peerless under heaven.

222
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:20,980
But in the Way of the Sword,

223
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,940
it can't claim "peerless"

224
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,940
before No-Sword City.

225
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:27,980
I see.

226
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,650
You want to...

227
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,250
challenge

228
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,180
Wushuang City!

229
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,670
[Song Yanhui of Wushuang City]

230
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:50,250
Yushu.

231
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,490
Are seeds really that tasty?

232
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,340
Master,

233
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,580
is sword practice that fun?

234
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,890
Sword practice isn't fun.

235
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,340
But I've trained since I was little.

236
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,120
If one day

237
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,180
I'm not allowed to train,

238
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,130
I'll feel

239
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,340
life has no meaning.

240
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:12,980
Master,

241
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,580
when will you start teaching me?

242
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,250
You're dropping the seeds?

243
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,300
No rush.

244
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,010
You're born gifted.

245
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,580
Every bit of carving

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,250
is critical.

247
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,650
My master once told me,

248
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,490
I was born for the sword.

249
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,340
I've trained hard for decades,

250
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,010
yet...

251
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,650
Li Hanyi, who came after me,

252
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,820
has become the Xueyue Sword Deity,

253
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,300
while I'm still stuck.

254
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,650
I'm running out of time.

255
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:52,820
Master,

256
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:55,490
you come to the lake every day

257
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,460
but do nothing.

258
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,220
Is there

259
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,980
some treasure in the lake?

260
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,250
Yes.

261
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,300
Master,

262
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:14,580
what's this?

263
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,890
This is the most precious treasure

264
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,060
of our Wushuang City,

265
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,340
the Peerless Sword Coffer.

266
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:22,100
Inside this case

267
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,220
are thirteen famed swords.

268
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,700
One is called Daming Vermilion Bird.

269
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,300
In the Register of Famous Swords,

270
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,460
it ranks second.

271
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,180
If it's "peerless",

272
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,610
why isn't it first?

273
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,300
First is the Emperor's sword.

274
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,890
Daming Vermilion Bird is the martial world's sword,

275
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:40,130
so it dares to claim "peerless".

276
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,420
Master.

277
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:14,770
Master,

278
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,300
where's the sword?

279
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,180
So it is.

280
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,460
I've trained for thirty years.

281
00:12:23,510 --> 00:12:24,100
Today,

282
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:27,010
I tried opening it for the first time.

283
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,460
But in the end,

284
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,420
I wasn't the one it chose.

285
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,290
Heaven wills it.

286
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,100
Can't we

287
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,420
just open the coffer?

288
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,220
The coffer has a spirit.

289
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,670
Only when it meets the one it accepts

290
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:43,850
will it open and yield a blade.

291
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,530
Let me try.

292
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,420
But you've never trained with a sword.

293
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,850
Precisely because I haven't.

294
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,010
Maybe this coffer

295
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,340
likes a blank slate.

296
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:03,700
All right.

297
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:30,890
Master,

298
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,340
this sword...

299
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,130
is so beautiful!

300
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,340
This is the Peerless Coffer's

301
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,220
fabled Jade Ruyi.

302
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,460
Master,

303
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,220
just now, the coffer

304
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,700
really opened for me!

305
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,010
Yushu.

306
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:54,850
Yushu!

307
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,420
Seems at the end,

308
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,320
[Liu Yunqi of Wushuang City]

309
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,130
Wushuang City

310
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,340
can still be peerless.

311
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:38,650
Master.

312
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:39,770
Master.

313
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,410
Did the coffer open earlier?

314
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,690
Was it me who opened it?

315
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,370
Let me tell you a story.

316
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:52,250
Come.

317
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:57,100
When I was young,

318
00:14:57,550 --> 00:14:58,490
I once loosed a sword strike.

319
00:14:59,320 --> 00:14:59,850
That stroke

320
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:01,580
pierced the clouds

321
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,490
and burned red like dusk.

322
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,250
Even the southbound swallows

323
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,770
turned to look back.

324
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:11,770
After that,

325
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,610
my master

326
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:13,820
changed my name

327
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:15,850
to Song Yanhui.

328
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:18,890
Today,

329
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,730
I'll give you a new name too, okay?

330
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:22,700
Master.

331
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,420
What will you name me?

332
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:26,610
From now on,

333
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,730
you'll be called Wushuang.

334
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,130
Wushuang?

335
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,370
What about my surname?

336
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,340
No need for one.

337
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,850
Just Wushuang.

338
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,420
Hereafter when people think of the Peerless Coffer,

339
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:40,770
and speak of Wushuang City,

340
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,650
it will be because of you.

341
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:43,850
Because

342
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,250
you are Wushuang.

343
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,370
I believe in you.

344
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,850
You will achieve

345
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,340
what I could not.

346
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:54,650
All right.

347
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,370
Master.

348
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,820
I'll be Wushuang from now on!

349
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:57,700
Good.

350
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,770
I won't be gone long.

351
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,580
I'll be back soon.

352
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,250
You made so much food.

353
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,730
I really can't take it on the road.

354
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,180
Then leave the pastries

355
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,060
to me.

356
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,180
I'll take care of them.

357
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,130
I'd go with you,

358
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,220
but,

359
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:24,370
since you want to play

360
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,340
No-Sword City's young master for a while,

361
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,530
my identity at your side

362
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,610
would spoil the scene.

363
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,180
If he can't carry,

364
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,370
I'll handle.

365
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,940
Like you'd get the chance!

366
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,940
What's this?

367
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,590
I sent people to fetch it

368
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:01,990
from Villa of Famed Swords.

369
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,660
If you're challenging Wushuang City,

370
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,250
you'll need a fine blade.

371
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,090
She's right.

372
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,900
To keep your cover,

373
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,420
you can't use your umbrella sword,

374
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,090
nor a cheap iron one

375
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,900
you can buy anywhere.

376
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:19,620
This blade is called Crane Feather.

377
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,330
Crane as in white crane.

378
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,460
Feather as in plume.

379
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,140
Win at Wushuang City with it,

380
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:27,620
and your name will spread.

381
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,090
Consider it

382
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,900
as also making a name for me.

383
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,010
This must be pricey, right?

384
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:46,620
You bet.

385
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,620
It cost our clinic

386
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,050
three months' earnings.

387
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:54,490
This pricey gift

388
00:17:55,550 --> 00:17:56,620
truly says a lot about your feelings.

389
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:06,490
Not bad.

390
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
I've got great taste.

391
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:10,140
A fine sword

392
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,420
and a beauty,

393
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:12,940
what a pair!

394
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,090
Besides,

395
00:18:19,290 --> 00:18:20,290
one more item for you.

396
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:30,180
What's this?

397
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,940
It's my little pet.

398
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,050
Lend it to you for protection.

399
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,940
Take good care of it.

400
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:39,940
All right.

401
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,940
I won't let you down.

402
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,660
Looking at you now,

403
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,420
you do seem a roaming hero!

404
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,090
Maybe

405
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,420
he was meant to be one.

406
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,660
He's leaving.

407
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,290
So shouldn't you

408
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,140
head home too?

409
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:01,980
You're kicking me out already?

410
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:04,980
Well, it can't be helped.

411
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:05,940
I do need to go.

412
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,290
Those so-called "family" back in Blood River

413
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:09,490
are nothing compared to you.

414
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,660
They're not reliable at all.

415
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:13,900
Enough talk.

416
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:15,810
While everyone's still here,

417
00:19:16,070 --> 00:19:17,010
let's polish off these pastries

418
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:17,980
together.

419
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,530
You can't finish them anyway.

420
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:37,290
Stake more!

421
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,010
Rest easy.

422
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,700
You'll all come out ahead.

423
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,780
[Tianxia House]

424
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,770
Sir,

425
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:49,660
right this way.

426
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,110
Boy, take the horse.

427
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:51,570
Coming!

428
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,220
This way, honored guest.

429
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,570
Our Tianxia House

430
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,000
can't match the fame

431
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,010
of Thousand-Gold Tower in Tianqi City,

432
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,810
Beauty Manor in Sangu City,

433
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,590
or Xiaoyao City of Qingzhou's Hundred Cities.

434
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,770
We rank last of the Four Great Casinos.

435
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,670
Besides,

436
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,700
unlike the other three

437
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:10,860
that serve

438
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,770
nobles and merchants,

439
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,220
our Tianxia House

440
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,220
mostly hosts

441
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,620
folk of the martial world.

442
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:19,810
That's the biggest difference.

443
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,140
Because

444
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,330
behind Tianxia House

445
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,810
stands

446
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,290
the famed city of arms,

447
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,090
the peerless Wushuang City.

448
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,140
Wushuang City...

449
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,380
You wish to reach Wushuang City?

450
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,380
Yes.

451
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,770
But to enter,

452
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:42,700
you need a Wushuang Token.

453
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,620
Right.

454
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,180
Ten li from here,

455
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,380
there's only one road

456
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,730
with a dozen checkpoints.

457
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,900
Each one checks your token

458
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,180
before you pass.

459
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,420
But...

460
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,770
that token's hard to get.

461
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,090
A friend said

462
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,570
there's a way here.

463
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,490
Naturally.

464
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,860
Name your price.

465
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,250
This is Tianxia House.

466
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:11,900
Nothing here

467
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,220
is sold.

468
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:14,860
Only...

469
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,570
gambled.

470
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,180
You need to wager

471
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:22,090
something valuable you have.

472
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,140
Win,

473
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,180
you take the token.

474
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:26,570
Lose,

475
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,010
your stake stays behind.

476
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,810
I'll bet.

477
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,090
- Big! - Small!

478
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,400
Very well!

479
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,810
This way, sir.

480
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,140
Here

481
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:48,250
is your table.

482
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,490
I'm no gambler.

483
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,460
But since I'm here,

484
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,140
I'll follow the house rules.

485
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,290
I have a 1,000-tael note.

486
00:21:58,070 --> 00:21:58,980
Will that do?

487
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,050
As I said,

488
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,810
you must stake

489
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,980
something precious.

490
00:22:08,110 --> 00:22:09,100
A banknote

491
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,290
plainly isn't it.

492
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,490
What we want is...

493
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,050
that stuff.

494
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,530
Sorry.

495
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:23,490
This sword

496
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,420
means a lot to me.

497
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,420
I do have a Dragon's Tear Pearl.

498
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,490
Would that count as rare?

499
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,700
Dragon's Tear Pearl...

500
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,810
It's said

501
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,810
this bead holds great power.

502
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:37,460
If one cultivates inner skill

503
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,940
wearing it day and night,

504
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:40,900
in half a year,

505
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,860
his body will undergo

506
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,810
marvelous changes.

507
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,010
Good eye, sir.

508
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:48,290
It is a fine piece.

509
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,660
Worth the wager.

510
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:50,980
How do you want to bet?

511
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,660
Tianxia House rules:

512
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,730
the guest decides.

513
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,530
We offer table games and beast bouts.

514
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,330
Which will you choose?

515
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,530
Are table games

516
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,090
the ones downstairs?

517
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:14,910
Yes.

518
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,620
Dominoes, Madiao Cards, Big/Small, and Cover-and-Guess.

519
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,530
And beast bouts

520
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,770
are our house's

521
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,140
signature specialty:

522
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:25,900
cockfights, dogfights, cricketfights,

523
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,180
and horse, pigeon, and dog races.

524
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,660
Take your pick.

525
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,380
Do you offer spider fights?

526
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,330
Eight-eyed wolf spiders.

527
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,770
Well informed, sir.

528
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,490
Then,

529
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,900
which one will you back?

530
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,420
Must I choose one from them?

531
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:05,620
Unless

532
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,530
there's another option.

533
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,980
I have a spider too.

534
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,050
I'll pit it against both.

535
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,810
If it wins,

536
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,290
I win.

537
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:23,700
How about it?

538
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,140
Eight-eyed wolf spider

539
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,810
is no common spider.

540
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,010
Your box

541
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,770
is barely half the size

542
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,940
of a wolf spider's.

543
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,810
How can one beat two?

544
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,180
Sir,

545
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,290
aren't you overconfident?

546
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,810
Then let's try.

547
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,290
Settled.

548
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,090
Hey, out.

549
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:13,530
What's this?

550
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:18,250
Go.

551
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:34,220
Oh...

552
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,090
This is a White-Ghost Spider!

553
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,980
The very one of legend

554
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,980
that can take on a hundred!

555
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,380
Then I won

556
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,810
the Wushuang Token, right?

557
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:09,040
You carry a peerless sword,

558
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,370
bear a Dragon's Tear Pearl,

559
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,780
and casually produce

560
00:26:11,790 --> 00:26:13,350
a rare White-Ghost Spider.

561
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,050
Your birth must be uncommon.

562
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,980
With such standing,

563
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:19,050
why come to my house

564
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,720
for a Wushuang Token?

565
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,660
What's your aim

566
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,730
visiting here today?

567
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,220
I won.

568
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,900
Give me the token.

569
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,660
I followed your rules,

570
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,900
so please

571
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,570
follow yours.

572
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,860
Fine...

573
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,530
I'll take you to it.

574
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,770
Much obliged.

575
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,220
[Lord Haoyue of Tianxia House]

576
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,050
This way.

577
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,730
Master.

578
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:18,050
It's been ages

579
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,330
since anyone came in here.

580
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,810
I won at Tianxia House,

581
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,660
so I should get the token.

582
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,530
Yes.

583
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,010
The token is already yours.

584
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:31,620
But guests of your skill

585
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,490
are rare indeed.

586
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:34,490
Our house wishes

587
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:35,940
to know you better.

588
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:37,900
Do those behind the wall

589
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,620
wish to know me too?

590
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,490
As I expected,

591
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:01,620
you were really

592
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,220
extraordinary.

593
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,490
As I said,

594
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,380
the token

595
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,180
is already yours.

596
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:15,980
I'll take my leave.

597
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,570
As you wish.

598
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:22,010
Hero, wait!

599
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:22,940
Please wait!

600
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,250
Please wait!

601
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:27,700
What is it?

602
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,460
If someone stops you on the way,

603
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,660
just say

604
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,360
you ordered a Soul-Chasing Crossbow

605
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,700
from Yuexia Smithy in Wushuang City,

606
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:38,660
and you're here to pick it up.

607
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,330
Got it.

608
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,660
Poison on it.

609
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,490
What do you mean?

610
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,050
Planning a mutiny, are you?

611
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,420
I'm your Patriarch.

612
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,810
Careful.

613
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,770
He isn't poisoned.

614
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,330
What about Yumo and Changli?

615
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,420
Those who back you

616
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,620
have all been poisoned

617
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,420
and are now confined.

618
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,660
Su Luandan did this, didn't he?

619
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,140
I really underestimated him.

620
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:07,810
Eat your fill!

621
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,530
Okay!

622
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,380
In this heat, watermelon hits the spot!

623
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,570
Come share some!

624
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:14,570
But we have to...

625
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,050
No one is coming.

626
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,050
Get over here.

627
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,620
Eat with us.

628
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,010
Quick!

629
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,250
Today, eat all you want.

630
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,050
As much as you like, hear me?

631
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:40,380
Get me another slice.

632
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,090
So sweet.

633
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:43,940
Misters.

634
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:47,680
Misters!

635
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,190
This melon's really sweet!

636
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,660
Yeah.

637
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,090
Sure is!

638
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,460
This watermelon

639
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:53,570
was brought all the way

640
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:54,770
from Nan'an City.

641
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,980
So,

642
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,980
eat up.

643
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,250
Halt!

644
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,420
Who are you?

645
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,660
Daring breach Wushuang City's checkpoint?

646
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:09,860
Apologies.

647
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:13,490
You looked too busy to notice me just now,

648
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,660
so I took the liberty.

649
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:17,420
I have a Wushuang Token.

650
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,570
[Wushuang]
I'm here

651
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,660
because I ordered a Soul-Chasing Crossbow

652
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:22,460
from Yuexia Smithy in Wushuang City.

653
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,050
I came to pick it up.

654
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:25,420
Not right.

655
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:27,090
What's not right?

656
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,030
Show the token first,

657
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,610
then step forward.

658
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,010
As it stands,

659
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,530
you passed three horse-lengths

660
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:34,420
before showing the token.

661
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,010
Out of order.

662
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,490
My apologies.

663
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,330
I'd like to pass now.

664
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:48,620
May I?

665
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,490
Can a dead man

666
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:57,940
still stand up?

667
00:31:58,510 --> 00:31:59,590
Can a tree made into a boat

668
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:00,770
be planted back?

669
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,120
Can rice boiled to porridge

670
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,460
turn back to fried rice?

671
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:05,840
- No! - No!

672
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,490
Exactly!

673
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,840
No good!

674
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,460
Then, mister,

675
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,220
how should it be?

676
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,620
These three horse-lengths,

677
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,570
one thousand taels each.

678
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,180
Three horse-lengths,

679
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:19,620
that's three thousand total.

680
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,420
You're joking.

681
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:25,770
That Soul-Chasing Crossbow

682
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:27,860
isn't worth three thousand taels.

683
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,090
Even if I need it,

684
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,250
I wouldn't make

685
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,490
such a losing deal.

686
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,290
Wushuang City's famous across the land.

687
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,290
It's surely not short of three thousand taels.

688
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,330
Wushuang City isn't,

689
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,530
but I am!

690
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,250
Besides, you're veiled,

691
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,220
and won't even show your real face.

692
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,460
How do I know

693
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,050
what intent hides under that veil?

694
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,140
Sorry.

695
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,850
I've had a strange illness since childhood.

696
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:56,250
My face can't be in sunlight,

697
00:32:57,270 --> 00:32:58,220
or it breaks out in red sores.

698
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:00,460
So I travel veiled.

699
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,140
Please understand.

700
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:04,980
All right then.

701
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,250
Out of pity,

702
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,490
three hundred taels.

703
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:09,980
Not a coin less!

704
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,180
Hand it over!

705
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:18,660
Move along.

706
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,290
We've struck gold this time.

707
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:21,710
- Sure have, look at that. - Come on.

708
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:22,490
Split it with me.

709
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:26,770
Wait!

710
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,530
What now?

711
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,900
You sighed just now.

712
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,700
What was that about?

713
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,840
I just felt sorry for you.

714
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,250
Wushuang City, once No.1 under heaven,

715
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,700
sets up all these checkpoints

716
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,940
just to squeeze travelers.

717
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,730
I've long admired

718
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,770
Wushuang City's renown.

719
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,660
But this experience today

720
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:58,860
really disappointed me.

721
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,010
"Once"?

722
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:02,980
Kid,

723
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,070
Wushuang City has always

724
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,210
been the top power.

725
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,900
Spouting nonsense here,

726
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,200
you're not afraid to die?

727
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,050
These days in the jianghu,

728
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,980
No.1 is Xueyue City.

729
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,780
That's not just

730
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:17,740
my opinion.

731
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,260
If you think Wushuang City is stronger,

732
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,090
then tell me,

733
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,740
who beat Ye Dingzhi by half a palm

734
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,010
and saved the realm?

735
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,740
Which of today's Five Sword Deities

736
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,610
is named after a city?

737
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:35,300
Who is the No.1 Spear Deity?

738
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,130
None of them hail from Wushuang City.

739
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,420
So why call Wushuang City No.1?

740
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:40,570
You brat...

741
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,460
Sitong,

742
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:46,420
return his banknote.

743
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,690
Senior...

744
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,570
Return it!

745
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,170
But...

746
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,260
Here.

747
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:52,860
Take it!

748
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,980
You're right.

749
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,100
Doing this is shameful.

750
00:34:58,550 --> 00:34:59,090
However,

751
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,820
you insulted Wushuang City.

752
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,980
I can't let it slide.

753
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,460
Dare face me in a bout?

754
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:08,820
From Tianxia House to here,

755
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,130
Wushuang City has let me down.

756
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,860
So much I'd rather leave now.

757
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,740
Looks like without a lesson,

758
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,490
you'll never learn!

759
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:37,740
Heavenly Pass Spear!

760
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:38,980
Senior, no!

761
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,340
If someone dies here,

762
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:40,780
we'll also...
