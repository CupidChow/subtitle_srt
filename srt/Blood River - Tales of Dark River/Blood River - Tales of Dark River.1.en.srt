The martial world of Beili is vast and turbulent.

6
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,900
Xueyue City in the south,

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,260
Wushuang City in the east,

8
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,050
and the Tang Clan, together with other prestigious sects,

9
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,820
built the brilliance and order of the martial world.

10
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,490
But beneath the brilliance,

11
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,820
there must be shadows.

12
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:54,980

00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,020
the most mysterious assassin organization.

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,620
Once you join Blood River,

15
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,620
you live only as someone's blade.

16
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:06,540
Still, there are those who seek light in the dark,

17
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,730
hoping to reach the shore amid raging currents.

18
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,260
The tide of Blood River

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,820
begins

20
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,220

[Second Master Tang, Tang Clan]

29
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,610
The snow comes too late for spring,

30
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:50,290
and turns into flying petals on the courtyard trees.

31
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,340
I thought the winter

32
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,220
had ended.

33
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,450
People our age

34
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,260
are always impatient

35
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:11,130
for winter to pass.

36
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,220
But somehow, just as it ended,

37
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,570
it snowed again.

They kill ministers and nobles

41
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,140
in the imperial court,

42
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,810
or wipe out entire sects

43

in the martial world.

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,810
Right or wrong, good or evil.

45
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,250
It means nothing to them.

46
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,050
You've led such an organization

47
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,250
for thirty years.

48
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,250
You must be tired.

49
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,730

would've long gone cold.

53
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,660
Thirty years ago,

54
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,370
we had a duel,

55
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,610
but there was no winner.

56
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:57,980
As per our pact,

57
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:00,490
I returned to lead the Blood River,

58
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,980
and you assisted Grand Master Tang

59

in rebuilding the Tang Clan.

60

Thirty years later,

we meet again to continue the duel.

62
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:08,810
Yes.

63
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,370
I've lived in seclusion in Liaoluo City for years.

64
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,100
It's time to stretch my body.

65
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:18,930
I've been waiting for this day.

66
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,610
I was too arrogant when I was young.

67
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,460
I tried to catch one of your hidden weapons with my bare hands

68
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,900
and nearly died from the poison.

69
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,050
I won't fall for that again.

70
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,580
You may be able to catch a few of them,

71
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:19,340

What a brilliant move.

75
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,170
It's been a long time

76

since I've had such a great fight.

77

The duel

78
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,930
we promised thirty years ago

79
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,980
is for victory,

80
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,170
not for life.

81
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,250
To an assassin,

82
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,100
there's no victory or defeat,

83
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,220
only life or death.

84

Shame?

86
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,370
What a shame

87
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,580
that your swift slash just now

88
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,900
drained most of your zhenqi.

89
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,700
And what a shame

90
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,340
that you thought you were the one in control.

91
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,140
Little did you know,

92
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,100

93
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:08,580
Muyu,

94
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,980

96
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,050

Old fellow,

102
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,250

during our duel.

104
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:49,730

and get the best physician

114

to heal you.

115
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,300

How long do you think

the Three Families have waited to hear

121

Yes.

00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,650
There was once a woman who told me

192
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,940
that betel nuts are bad for health.

193
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:06,060
Do you want one?

194
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,940
No thanks.

195
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:21,250
Since when

196
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,220
have you become so polite?

197
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,770
I learned that from Su Muyu.

198
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,650
An assassin should have manners

199
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,300
when visiting someone's door.

200
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,530
But this miracle physician

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,340
doesn't seem to welcome us.

202
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,220
Perhaps King of Medicine's martial senior

203
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,060
is old,

204
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,100
and his hearing has gone.

205
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,130
Knock harder.

206
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,010
Uncle Zhe,

207
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,490
are you knocking?

208
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,220
You looked more like trying to kill him.

209
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,130
Aren't we here to kill him?

210
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,460
Who's that?

211
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,060
Making such noise.

212
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,010
My ears will go deaf.

213
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:03,940
Young lady,

214
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,180
may I ask if your master

215
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,420
is at home?

216
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,730
My master

217
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,940
has gone out to see patients.

218
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,820
How about this?

219
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,180
I'll look for him.

220
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,890
That would be a great help, young lady.

221
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:28,460
What did you do?

222
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,250
Oh, my apologies. My hand slipped.

223
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,370
Here.

224
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,370
This is Scented Ointment.

225
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,650
Rub it on your face,

226
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:40,820
and in less than one hour,

227
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,980
that red mark

228
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,180
will disappear.

229
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,010
Ridiculous.

230
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,530
The Scented Ointment that can be tracked by medicine snakes.

231
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,730
He thinks such tricks will fool me?

232
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:10,730
Young lady,

233
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,100
are you a physician?

234
00:14:13,510 --> 00:14:13,940
Why?

235
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,650
Do I not look like one?

236
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,580
I'm sorry.

237
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,530
I didn't mean to offend you.

238
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,300
Mister,

239
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,530
are you asking for directions?

240
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:21,770
You have keen eyes, young lady.

241
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,010
May I ask

242
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,890
if there's a medicine hall nearby

243
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,010
called Baihe?

244
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,340
Are you here to see a physician?

245
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,490
I'm quite skilled myself.

246
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,850
You can ask for my help.

247
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:33,580
Someone in my family is seriously ill,

248
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:34,700
and he specifically asked for

249
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:35,890
the miracle physician of Baihe Medicine Hall.

250
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,530
Anyway, thank you for your kindness.

251
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,370
How do you know

252
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,370
I'm not

253
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:43,010
from Baihe Medicine Hall?

254
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:44,980
Could it be that you are...

255
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,300
Of course I am.

256
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,490
Young lady, please

257
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,010
take me to your master.

258
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:51,580
My master?

259
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,700
He can't come here right now,

260
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,580
but he told me

261
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,220
a guest was coming

262
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,980
from very far away.

263
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:03,890
It must be you, I suppose.

264
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,820
He asked me to go with you first.

265
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,180
I hope you don't mind.

266
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:11,580
I'm in a rush,

267
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,770
so please mount up.

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,490
We've arrived.

269
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:37,250
Sir.

270
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,820
You've come just in time, sir.

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,650
Something's wrong

272
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:41,700
with the Patriarch.

273
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:43,010
Where's the miracle physician?

274
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,940
I'm standing

275
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,730
right in front of you.

276
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,890
How can you not see me?

277
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,180
Is she the miracle physician?

278
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:49,820
No.

279
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,010
Fine, I'll leave.

280
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:51,890
Please don't be offended.

281
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,370
She's the miracle physician's disciple.

282
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,980
She came on her master's behalf

283
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:57,340
to check the Patriarch's condition.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,850
Please come with me.

285
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,060
I feel

286
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,100
there's a ghost inside.

287
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,850
Don't be afraid, young lady.

288
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:57,530
Sir.

289
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,490
The last time I saw you,

290
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:09,940
you were just

291
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,700
a dirty kid with snot hanging.

292
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,660
The last time I saw you,

293
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,460
you were

294
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,530
a god of killing

295
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,010
who was ready to draw your blade at any time.

296
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,620
I'm still ready to draw my blade anytime.

297
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,620
Only my hair has turned white.

298
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,180
My hands

299
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,090
are still stained crimson.

300
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,490
Enough talking.

301
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,660
Let me read your pulse

302
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,660
to see if you

303
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,140
can still draw your sword.

304
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,290
Put away your killing aura.

305
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,490
If you scare me

306
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,220
and my hand trembles,

307
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,730
your Patriarch

308
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,620
will be done for.

309
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,140
Snow Falls on a Plum Blossom?

310
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:16,770
That's right.

311
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,380
How are you still alive?

312
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,420
My Kui

313
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:26,050
took the blow for me.

314
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:28,330
Only half a plum hit me.

315
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,900
I'm barely holding on.

316
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:33,180
That's the Second Master Tang's

317
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,490
signature poison.

318
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,460
It's said to be the top poison of the Tang Clan,

319
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,660
ranked second in the world,

320
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,530
second only to the poison created by the Wen family head,

321
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:40,810
Illusion.

322
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:41,730
They say

323
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:43,460
no one but Second Master Tang himself

324
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,700
can cure it.

325
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,330
Where's Second Master Tang?

326
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,220
I killed him.

327
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,220
I didn't know the Patriarch of Blood River

328
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,330
would take a killing mission himself.

329
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,490
Young lady,

330
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,140
can you cure it?

331
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,530
There's a saying in Medicine King Valley.

332
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,860
"As long as one's not dead, they can be saved."

333
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,050
However...

334
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,140
Tell me what you need.

335
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,660
Speak plainly.

336
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:14,620
That's what I wanted to hear.

337
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:15,980
Of course,

338
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:17,180
I can heal him.

339
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,530
As long as...

340
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,980
As long as?

341
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,380
...you can pay well.

342
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:41,290
Looks like

343
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,530
she's seen through your trick.

344
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,250
She threw the bottle away

345
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,730
as soon as she left the manor.

346
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,010
Seems we were wrong.

347
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:49,860
Wrong about what?

348
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,730
We let the real miracle physician slip away.

349
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:53,810
Fortunately,

350
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,730
I made some preparations.

351
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,380
Alright.

352
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,620
Find me a place to stay.

353
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,490
It's too much trouble running back and forth.

354
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,140
Aren't you sending your master over?

355
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,050
My master?

356
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,940
He passed away a long time ago.

357
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,730
Why do you all keep trying to make him

358
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,420
crawl out from the grave?

359
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:19,250
What?

360
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,700
The King of Medicine's martial senior is dead?

361
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:25,490
Muyu,

362
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:26,940
you're mistaken.

363
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,770
The person before you

364
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,620
is the martial senior

365
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,330
of the King of Medicine.

366
00:20:31,790 --> 00:20:33,860
The last disciple of Li Yuzhen,

367
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,940
the founder of Medicine King Valley,

368
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,660
Bai Hehuai.

369
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:39,940
[Bai Hehuai, Medicine King Valley]
I'm Bai Hehuai, a physician.

370
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,330
Greetings, sir.

371
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,980
Greetings, Lord Kui.

372
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,530
Lord Kui, I'm peckish.

373
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,330
Forgive me, Miss Bai.

374
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,290
We're in the wilderness.

375
00:20:58,750 --> 00:20:59,980
It's hard to find good food.

376
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:01,380
This is all we have.

377
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,420
That's all right.

378
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,570
Having something to eat is good enough.

379
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,460
Better than

380
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,140
having to eat

381
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,490
my martial senior's herbal cooking in the Medicine King Valley.

382
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,900
You must be wondering

383
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,730
how I know your identity.

384
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,180
Since you and the Patriarch are old acquaintances,

385
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,700
you must've heard of us.

386
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,090
When I was little,

387
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,290
my master used to tell me stories

388
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,810
to make me study medicine.

389
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:23,420
In his stories,

390
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,570
there was often

391
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,860
an organization called Blood River.

392
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,700
It's formed by Su, Xie, and Mu,

393
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,220
the Three Families.

394
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,620
Their leader

395
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,140
is known as the Patriarch.

396
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,730
Under him

397
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:36,420
is a direct assassin unit called Spider Shadow.

398
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,670
[Rat, Snake, Ox, Rabbit, Dog, Tiger]
The strongest twelve

399
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,000
[Horse, Dragon, Pig, Sheep, Chicken]
take the Earthly Branches

400
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,050
as their code names,

401
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,860
and their commander

402
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:43,900
is Kui.

403
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,380
The people I saw today

404
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,380
all wore animal masks,

405
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:49,660
but you alone

406
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,660
wear a blood-red demon mask

407
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,380
and stand beside the Patriarch.

408
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,380
Who else could you be

409
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,940
but Kui?

410
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,700
Your understanding of us

411
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,460
is much deeper than I imagined.

412
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,380
I also know

413
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,620
every Kui

414
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,660
is trained

415
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,180
as the future Patriarch.

416
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,860
The last Kui

417
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,180
is

418
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,090
dead?

419
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,420
I'm sorry.

420
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,290
I couldn't tell you

421
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,290
about such confidential matters.

422
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,570
But the last Kui

423
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,180
is my father.

424
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,570
Can't I even ask about that?

425
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,730
You must be kidding, Miss Bai.

426
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,180
Forget it if you don't believe me.

427
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:40,900
Whether someone lives or dies

428
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,900
seems to be a secret to you.

429
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,530
But given your sensitive identity,

430
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,330
you're awfully conspicuous.

431
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:46,940
Why not keep that a secret instead?

432
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,050
I once asked my senior the same thing.

433
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,420
As assassins,

434
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,290
we should do everything possible to conceal our identities.

435
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,290
Why do we

436
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:55,980
wear it so plainly

437
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,330
on our faces?

438
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,090
What did he say?

439
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,220
"It's a sense of ceremony.

440
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,620
You don't understand a thing."

441
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:06,860
Why are you suddenly slurring your words?

442
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,140
I'm not slurring,

443
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:09,810
he is.

444
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,380
That reminds me.

445
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,620
Could the man I saw

446
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,460
during the day

447
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,860
be from your sect?

448
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,050
Does he carry

449
00:23:20,110 --> 00:23:21,010
a staff

450
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,290
with golden rings on it?

451
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,660
So Uncle Zhe came too.

452
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,620
And the other one who plays with a dagger.

453
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,570
That's Changhe.

454
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,140
Chen the Dragon,

455
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,330
get ready.

456
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:33,290
Take Miss Bai and go now.

457
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:34,250
Yes, sir.

458
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,980
Where are we going?

459
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,460
Jiuxiao City.

460
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,660
No one knows Changhe better than I do.

461
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,620
We've definitely walked into his trap

462
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,490
by now.

463
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,380
Yu,

464
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,530
everything is set.

465
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,420
Miss Bai,

466
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,730
this is Mao the Rabbit.

467
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:50,310
[Mao the Rabbit, one of the Twelve Zodiacs of Spider Shadow]

468
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,050
Go with her.

469
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,570
Take care.

470
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,330
Lord Kui,

471
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,660
I hope we'll meet again

472
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,770
in Jiuxiao City.

473
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,220
Don't call me Lord Kui.

474
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,330
Just call me Su Muyu.

475
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,730
Su Muyu.

476
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,570
That really is a beautiful name.

477
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:04,530
See you.

478
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,330
You said you made preparations.

479
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,290
And we're just waiting here?

480
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,940
The Xie's blade, and the Mu's ghost.

481
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:29,570
They're getting impatient.

482
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,810
But I'm different.

483
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,250
I'm lazy.

484
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:33,770
It's better to follow

485
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:34,860
those who hustle.

486
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,570
I may be slower,

487
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,180
but never late.

488
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,140
You broke the news to them,

489
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,290
and both families sent people here?

490
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:47,460
You sly kid.

491
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,460
Master Su sent you over.

492
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,980
He's determined to take that seat.

493
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:55,660
The cleverest me and the strongest you.

494
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:56,700
Uncle Zhe,

495
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,660
once Blood River's top assassin,

496
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,940
the previous Lord Kui.

497
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,690
[Mu and Xie have arrived at the abandoned post on the outskirts. ]

498
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:10,750
[Only one of the Three Families has yet to show up.]

499
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,980
An abandoned post on the outskirts?

500
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,620
The show's about to start.

501
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:16,980
Let's go, Uncle Zhe.

502
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,860
Master Su

503
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,900
must be anxious by now.

504
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,980
As expected

505
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,810
of the infamous Umbrella Ghost.

506
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:34,940
This line marks the boundary.

507
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,180
Please don't cross it.

508
00:25:38,070 --> 00:25:39,240
[Xie Qianji, the Xie family]
Purple Boot Ghost and

509
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,530
Blade Yama of the Xie family.

510
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,180
[Xie Jinke, the Xie family]

511
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,700
You shouldn't be here.

512
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,050
What a bore.

513
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:47,250
You saw through us

514
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,420
right away.

515
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,050
But our family head heard

516
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,460
that the Patriarch had been badly injured.

517
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,860
He was anxious

518
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,420
and wanted to bring him back

519
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,730
to the main hall for treatment.

520
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,530
The Patriarch is fine.

521
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,980
Whether the Patriarch is fine,

522
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:01,860
please allow me

523
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,490
to see him

524
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,940
and confirm.

525
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,460
Otherwise,

526
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:07,900
I can't explain it.

527
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,180
What does that

528
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,570
have to do with me?

529
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,700
You don't want us

530
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,860
to see the Patriarch.

531
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,250
Do you intend

532
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,490
to delay the treatment we offer?

533
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,570
That would be one good reason.

534
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,010
But for that reason to hold,

535
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,460
there's only one possibility.

536
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:27,810
Kill you?

537
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,330
That's right.

538
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,330
A blade hidden in the umbrella?

539
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,770
Why not show it?

540
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,700
The Xie family's Wind Whirling Blade.

541
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,140
Impressive.

542
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,330
Die!

543
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,330
Do you really think I'm that weak?

544
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,490
Inch Blade.

545
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,700
Good one.

546
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,770
Tell your family head.

547
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,660
If he withdraws now,

548
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,810
the Patriarch

549
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,420
will pretend

550
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,330
nothing happened.

551
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,730
If he keeps being stubborn,

552
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,460
don't blame the Spider Shadow for being ruthless.

553
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,420
Are you going to

554
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,380
spare us?

555
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,250
Fellow members of the Blood River

556
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:08,660
are family.

557
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:10,380
Let's go.

558
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,180
You're here.

559
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,250
You don't look pleased

560
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,090
to see me,

561
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,050
my Lord Kui.

562
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,420
I knew you'd come,

563
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,660
but I hoped you'd come later.

564
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,530
Master Su asked me to relay a message.

565
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,730
You're part of the Su family.

566
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,420
Now I am Kui,

567
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,180
the ghost among men.

568
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,700
I belong to Blood River,

569
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,420
not to any single family.

570
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,330
You're always so serious.

571
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,980
No fun at all.

572
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,900
When you were a Nameless,

573
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:50,290
you woke up early to practice swordwork.

574
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:50,730
You were

575
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,140
a hardworking practitioner.

576
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:53,530
Later, when you became an assassin,

577
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,570
every mission

578
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,660
you completed

579
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,420
was flawless.

580
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,010
Now you're a Kui,

581
00:28:58,550 --> 00:28:59,770
and you're still so diligent.

582
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,220
The Patriarch is dying soon.

583
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,180
Are you going to throw your life away

584
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,010
for him?

585
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,380
The Patriarch is fine.

586
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,180
You shouldn't have started

587
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,330
this rumor.

588
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,010
If he were fine,

589
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,570
why would he have looked for

590
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,330
Xin Baicao's martial senior?

591
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:19,730
If you kill him

592
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,460
and take the Dormant Dragon Sword,

593
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:22,940
you could get

594
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,290
what you want most.

595
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:25,860
Freedom.

596
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:27,420
Right.

597
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,140
Leave the Su family. Leave the Blood River.

598
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,730
Go wherever you want.

599
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:32,980
Do whatever you like.

600
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,330
You know

601
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,730
Blood River has

602
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,570
never allowed that.

603
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,290
Yet Master Su

604
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,010
is willing to make an exception for you.

605
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:42,420
What if I say no?

606
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,420
We are the Sus.

607
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,420
We've lived in the Su residence for so many years.

608
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:49,810
You've only followed him

609
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:51,380
for years as a Kui.

610
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,420
How deep can your bond with him

611
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,700
be compared to the Su family?

612
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,460
I don't care

613
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,250
what you think.

614
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,220
Right now I am Kui,

615
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:00,620
and my duty is

616
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,250
to keep the Patriarch safe.

617
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:03,420
Everything

618
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,980
or every condition

619
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,420
mustn't

620
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,730
go beyond this.

621
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:21,380
Yes.

622
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,940
That's right.

623
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:24,730
I replied to Master Su

624
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:25,980
exactly the same thing.

625
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,090
I knew

626
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,010
you'd say that.

627
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,250
And?

628
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,090
And he said,

629
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:33,090
"If that's the case,

630
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,700
kill him."
