1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,130
I've made an appointment with Meen for you.

2
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:02,300
I asked you two to go on a date,

3
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,380
Ai chose me,

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:05,430
Would you like to have dinner with me?

5
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,400
Is this your friend?

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,650
If this is an airplane, I'll fix it for you.

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:12,550
Where does his mother want me to sleep now?

8
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:13,500
Sleep with me.

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,730
Smelly bird,

10
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,950
you're messing with me before the sun comes out.

11
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,030
Ter, do you want me to wait for you?

12
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,500
-You go first. -Senior Bright, okay.

13
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,530
See you later.

14
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:59,100
Hello No

15
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,600
Is this a couple's outfit?

16
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,600
It's so sweet.

17
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,180
Hello,

18
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:09,830
everyone. What's the gossip?

19
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,750
This time, it's going to be exciting.

20
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,930
If it's not,

21
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,500
You're going to be blown up.

22
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,650
Very exciting.

23
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,080
It's definitely a big deal.

24
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,730
Gosh, is it really that exciting?

25
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,930
Tell me,

26
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,830
as long as No knows, the whole world will know.

27
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,850
How can the people in Dormitory 3 not know?

28
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,530
If you have a fart, just let it go.

29
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,900
You're so inky.

30
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,750
If you don't tell me, we'll leave.

31
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,300
No need to say it. Let's go.

32
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:43,530
Someone from Dorm 3 went to Dorm 2 for the night.

33
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,430
What nonsense are you talking about? No,

34
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,680
you're from Dormitory 3.

35
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,530
You meddle in other dorm buildings,

36
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,680
Yeah. Where did you hear that?

37
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,330
I never talk nonsense.

38
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:58,930
I have evidence for everything I say.

39
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,800
What evidence?

40
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,780
Nonsense. You'll know it together

41
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:07,230
when the time is right.

42
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:09,900
I never talk nonsense. Just wait and see.

43
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,480
You brat got enough appetite and ran away.

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,780
What are you doing?

45
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,050
[ Senior, I heard that someone from Dormitory 3 came to sleep in our dorm last

46
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,530
night. ] [ Oh, my God.

47
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,600
Who is it? ] = I'd like to know whose dorm I went to sleep in. =,

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
[ Our dorm building is very popular. ] [ If someone really came to sleep, when

49
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,330
did he leave? ] About the

50
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:55,030
advanced mechanical engineering major,

51
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,550
You should know that there are two forces,

52
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:01,250
static static load,

53
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:02,580
And motivation,

54
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:05,200
there are several kinds of motivation,

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,680
Such as repetition,

56
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,650
impulse,

57
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:08,850
gravity

58
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,650
[ What are you

59
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,050
doing? ] Or centrifugal force. Wait. Who sent you a message early in

60
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:16,550
the morning?

61
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,000
My brother is so popular.

62
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,650
No, bro.

63
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,280
Actually, I want someone to post it too.

64
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,230
Send me a message this morning.

65
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,880
Get back to your class.

66
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,780
Do you want me to send it to you?

67
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,380
I'm so free every morning,

68
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,250
and you're taking classes seriously.

69
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,400
There's only one specification

70
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,730
that you can't read back, right?

71
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,730
Give it up, Meen.

72
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,950
It's been so many years,

73
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,230
And there are so many people talking to you.

74
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,780
Why don't you try to open your heart?

75
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:05,380
As for Bright, I think you'd better let it go.

76
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:11,650
If I could give up so easily, I would have given up long ago.

77
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:14,500
But you can't stand it if you keep worrying like this every day.

78
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,850
I'll give up.

79
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,450
Thank you, Manow.

88

right,

89
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,500
here are your mid-term exam results.

90
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:46,380
You have to take the final exam well.

91
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,730
Class dismissed.

92
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,650
I don't think even time is good.

93
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,730
All right, we're about the same.

94
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,500
There's not much difference between our scores.

95
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,500
Let's cheer together during the final exam.

96
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,950
How about this?

97
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:07,030
I got good grades in this course.

98
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,400
Let me tutor you. Ai,

99
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,780
What do you not understand?

100
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,550
What I don't understand is that I thought I could do well in the exam.

101
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,800
I've taken this course.

102
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,200
Let me tutor you.

103
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,430
Songkhram

104
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,830
came quietly and scared me to death.

105
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,730
I didn't go to the aviation teaching building today.

106
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,080
I had a public class,

107
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,280
So it's around here.

108
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,500
Why are you so annoyed?

109
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,580
I can really tutor you.

110
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,700
I was at the top of the list in the exam last semester.

111
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:38,850
Well,

112
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,680
aren't seniors majoring in aviation busy?

113
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,980
You'd better spend time tutoring yourself.

114
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,700
Aviation majors are mostly practical classes,

115
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,630
and my flat time is already very high.

116
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,080
Don't worry about me.

117
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,850
I have a lot of free time to tutor Ai.

118
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,980
No one can be as lucky as my dorm manager.

119
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,500
Everyone is eager to tutor him.

120
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,700
With Bright Songkhram,

121
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,930
I'm sure I'll be at the top of the list in the next exam.

122
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,200
Forget it.

123
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,950
My mom is not feeling well.

124
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,530
I'm going home this weekend.

125
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,830
Go back to stay with my mom.

126
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,980
It's okay.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,950
I can tutor you

128
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,380
at your house.

129
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,050
Yes. I can tutor you at your house.

130
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:22,930
Darn Bright.

131
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:49,530
Ai, your room is so neat.

132
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,500
Help me tidy it up when you are free.

133
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,550
Bright,

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,530
your room is neat too.

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,130
In Dormitory 2,

136
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,580
your room is the tightest.

137
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,050
If you want to clean it up, you can go to my room and help clean it up.

138
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:01,650
I've become a hero in the chaos room.

139
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:03,780
Everyone who goes in will nag about it.

140
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:07,400
You don't even know how to tidy up the room. Why don't you just go back to the furnace and rebuild it?

141
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,950
Are you here to visit my room?

142
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,130
Are you here to tutor me?

143
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,850
Tutoring.

144
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,530
You'd better come here for tutoring.

145
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,250
Where are the notes?

146
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,980
68. 2 equals... Ai

147
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:47,130
will go downstairs for dinner at six o'clock.

148
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,180
Hello, Songkhram. Hello,

149
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,200
auntie.

150
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,250
Are you okay?

151
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,730
All right,

152
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,880
I was discharged after staying in the hospital for two nights.

153
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:59,250
It's a little dusty lately. Take care of yourself.

154
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:01,980
I wear a mask every time I go out.

155
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,080
Thank you, kid.

156
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,650
I'm here to bother you today.

157
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,150
I'm not bothering you at all. You're here

158
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,800
to help Ai. I'm here

159
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,480
to help my mom. This is Bright.

160
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,900
I've always mentioned it to you.

161
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:17,250
I've always mentioned your child. What did Ai

162
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,200
say about me? Auntie,

163
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,480
it's about studying. About school.

164
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,180
Bright is excellent.

165
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,000
I always have to rely on him.

166
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,580
Thank you, son.

167
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,130
I'd love to. Auntie,

168
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,750
As for Ai, I can tutor him at any time.

169
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,650
I'll go downstairs later.

170
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,980
And you don't have to prepare too much to eat.

171
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,930
In case you have to work a little harder,

172
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:42,780
son,

173
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,680
I'll go downstairs and get ready to eat.

174
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,200
-Make yourself at home. -Kids. -Okay,

175
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:46,780
Auntie.

176
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,400
Go on.

177
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,980
It's really a little bit. Auntie,

178
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,380
is it too little? The baby

179
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,250
won't have enough to eat later. I'll get some more. -Auntie,

180
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,630
it's okay. Auntie. -Mom, Mom, Mom,

181
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,450
I'm just kidding. Auntie,

182
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,950
that's enough.

183
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:18,880
Mom, Songkhram is just being sarcastic.

184
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,380
And he likes to be sarcastic. Ai,

185
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,650
do you usually eat like this?

186
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,150
No wonder you're so fat.

187
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,530
I don't exercise at ordinary times. That's why my mom does a lot

188
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:33,050
because you're here.

189
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,230
Thank you, Auntie.

190
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,880
Thank you, Auntie.

191
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,900
Delicious food like this may need to be eaten more often.

192
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,450
Who allowed you to come?

193
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,230
Ai

194
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:45,800
Why are you talking like that?

195
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,300
It's just some food.

196
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,250
Your friend is here to tutor you.

197
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,300
Yes.

198
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,600
Did mom cough again?

199
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,430
Asthma is always like this,

200
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,450
and the weather is not good recently,

201
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:02,930
That's why I'm allergic.

202
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,530
Mom, you need to rest more.

203
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,200
We can ask the staff to help us with the things in the store.

204
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,250
Okay. Now

205
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,800
the new employees are starting to become skilled.

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,980
I just need to prepare for them in the morning.

207
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,930
I'll be able to rest later.

208
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,430
That's great.

209
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,880
I don't want to see you go to the hospital again.

210
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:22,700
Let's eat.

211
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,030
I have something delicious.

212
00:12:36,030 --> 00:12:37,530
I'll go get it. Wait a minute.

213
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,900
Ai

214
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,100
Mom,

215
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,600
isn't this Lao Chili sauce?

216
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,550
This is my favorite.

217
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,150
-Where? -Let me try.

218
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,230
It's still so delicious.

219
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:11,030
Do you still eat this? Doesn't it stink?

220
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,830
This house doesn't stink at all.

221
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,730
Do you want to have a try

222
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,780
where

223
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,300
It's delicious.

224
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,330
Really?

225
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,380
That's enough. How about

226
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,230
giving it to me?

227
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:36,550
It's delicious.

228
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,100
See? I said it's delicious.

229
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,730
Bring it here.

230
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,830
You'll finish it later.

231
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,450
Let's share the food together.

232
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,400
Mom,

233
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,480
do you still have it? Mom

234
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,550
finished the third chapter during the day.

235
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:53,030
Let's continue with Chapter Four and Chapter Five later.

236
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,080
You tutor Chapter 4,

237
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,380
and I'll tutor Ai Chapter 5 later,

238
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm going to take a shower.

239
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,850
You guys talk first.

240
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,330
Don't mess up my room.

241
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,580
-Yes. -Hurry back.

242
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:15,450
You're really diligent.

243
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,100
I wanted you to tutor me so much before,

244
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,430
but didn't you think about tutoring me?

245
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,000
When this became the matter of Ai,

246
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,250
you really did your best.

247
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,750
I told you I like Ai.

248
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,400
You and I both like Ai.

249
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,380
Do you think I'll let you get close to Ai easily?

250
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:34,700
You and I have been friends for four years.

251
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,680
I don't want to hold a grudge against you because of this.

252
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,980
OK

253
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,780
Then.

254
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,950
You and I can compete fairly.

255
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,730
If Ai chooses you,

256
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,980
I'll quit.

257
00:14:48,450 --> 00:14:51,380
If Ai chooses me, you have to give up too. Bright

258
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,100
can do it too.

259
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,300
Let's wait and see who Ai will choose?

260
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,130
What are you choosing?

261
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,750
Are you choosing which part to tutor you first?

262
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:02,850
Yes, that's right.

263
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,450
That's how I can be prepared.

264
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,550
Yeah, that's right,

265
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,380
Songkhram. You sat on my bed before you showered.

266
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,780
Am I just going to sit down instead of sitting down?

267
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,250
I don't like people wearing dirty clothes on my bed.

268
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,550
Get down here!

269
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,400
I'm just sitting down, that's all.

270
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,900
Don't make life so complicated,

271
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,530
Jerk!

272
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,630
All right,

273
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,930
where you sleep, your pillow,

274
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:27,430
That's how you can smell me.

275
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,980
No, come down right now.

276
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,350
Or I'll let you sleep outside the room.

277
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,850
If you let me sleep outside the room,

278
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:34,600
I'll tell your mother.

279
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,930
Come down. It's rude of you

280
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,550
to sleep in someone else's house.

281
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,350
I'm only telling you to take a shower

282
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,600
once after that,

283
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,830
Yes, I'm going to take a shower OK

284
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,980
Let Bright tutor you Chapter 4,

285
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,830
I'm back to tutor you Chapter 5

286
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,800
Go ahead!

287
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:02,930
Here we go.

288
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,000
Let's start with this question.

289
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,880
This requires the theoretical knowledge of the freshman year,

290
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,130
Ai

291
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,100
Tell me,

292
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:12,030
How can I turn on the warm water?

293
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,980
Press the button and adjust the temperature

294
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,400
after the light comes on. -Come on. -Ai, which one

295
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:23,450
of these five is conditioner and which one is shampoo?

296
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:24,550
Which one is shower gel?

297
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,830
Which is which?

298
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:27,250
Sky Blue is shampoo

299
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,780
with conditioner in it,

300
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,050
The pink one is shower gel,

301
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,350
the transparent one is for washing your face,

302
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,450
Yellow feet washing,

303
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:33,400
white,

304
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,730
Forget it. Hey,

305
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,050
don't forget it.

306
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,380
Come in and have a look.

307
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,980
That's how he likes to attract people's attention.

308
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,050
Don't bother with him.

309
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,980
Bro, using biology in mechanics,

310
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,030
I don't quite understand, bro.

311
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,530
This is not difficult As long as we start from here,

312
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:55,030
Ai I can't find toothpaste

313
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,330

Are you naked?

317
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,150
Do you want me to get dressed and take a shower?

318
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,280
Have you finished taking a shower?

319
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,250
Why are you in such a hurry to brush your teeth?

320
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:25,780
Not yet.

321
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,750
Ai

322
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,530
What's wrong again?

323
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,450
I forgot to bring the bath towel in.

324
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,750
Give it to me.

325
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:51,180
You have so many questions.

326
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,200
[ Lip: Jerk ] Jerk Bright Where's my

327
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,100
bath towel?

328
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,300
How am I supposed to get out of here?

329
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:17,080
Hey, why should I

330
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,030
ask you something?

331
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,900
You're such a problem child.

332
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,930
That's right.

333
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:26,650
Your mom said you often told her about Bright,

334
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,100
what did you say?

335
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,700
What are you gossiping about?

336
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,930
That's right.

337
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,550
I didn't say anything.

338
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,950
I was talking to my mom about studying together.

339
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,730
Then.

340
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,330
Did you tell your mom about me?

341
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,050
No.

342
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,480
I didn't study

343
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,530
with you. What do you want me to say?

344
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,180
Bright and I have been studying together since freshman year.

345
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,600
Isn't it normal for me to tell my mom?

346
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,550
About Bright and Touch,

347
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,430
I told my mom.

348
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,180
Yes.

349
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:15,730
Do you want to ask me anything else?

350
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,980
You can't tutor me today, can you?

351
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,150
Yes. Come on.

352
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,180
Coaching, tutoring.

353
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:23,730
-Let's start here. -Yes.

354
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,100
What are

355
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,600
these three formulas?

356
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,730
The length of that quadrilateral

357
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,880
multiply by the width,

358
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,330
Yeah, you know

359
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,880
that too. -That's 2D, right? -Yes.

360
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,550
Here are 3D and 3D.

361
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:38,580
Long times wide times high,

362
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,180
why do you suddenly know?

363
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:41,630
Awesome.

364
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,550
Well, now that we find this value,

365
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,700
here,

366
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,000
We just need to find these two values.

367
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,700
Go on.

368
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,580
Understand?

369
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,400
Understood. -Yes.

370
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,680
Are you done?

371
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,650
It's over.

372
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,200
We've been tutoring you like this.

373
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,650
You have to do it,

374
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,280
Ai. I've learned a lot today,

375
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,950
Thank you, Bright

376
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:31,880
Yes.

377
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:36,480
I'll sleep in your bed today.

378
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,950
Stop. You have to

379
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,630
sleep on the floor.

380
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,380
I'll bring the mattress to take a shower later.

381
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:43,600
I'll take a shower too.

382
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,080
Of course I can sleep in your bed.

383
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,230
Bright is not as nosy as you are.

384
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,730
That's Bright. He can sleep on the couch.

385
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,480
Who says I can sleep on the couch?

386
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:55,480
You really like to think for others.

387
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,800
No matter what, you two have to sleep on the floor tonight.

388
00:20:59,200 --> 00:20:59,930
Yes.

389
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:19,380
-Mom. -Ai, I'm

390
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,250
sorry, kid.

391
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,080
The employee suddenly called to ask for leave.

392
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:31,600
Mom has cooked the chicken and cooked the meal.

393
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:33,430
Can you help me, son?

394
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:35,180
-Yes, Aunty. -Yes, Aunty.

395
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,200
I'm going to take a shower first.

396
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,100
Bright. -Stop. -I'm

397
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,050
going to take a shower.

398
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,500
You've been taking a shower

399
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,950
for a long time. -I'll

400
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,450
go first. -I'm sorry. Bright, come back. -I'll go first. -I'll

401
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,530
wash first. You're slow.

402
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,530
Can you get by today?

403
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,100
I'll cut the chicken here,

404
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,230
Bright. You'll order and collect the money.

405
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:01,300
Songkhram,

406
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,350
you clear the table,

407
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:03,780
And help deliver food.

408
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,100
Hainan chicken rice needs meat, no skin, no internal organs and blood,

409
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,430
Hainan chicken rice needs chicken breast, skin, blood, no liver,

410
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,550
Hainan chicken rice needs chicken leg meat, no blood,

411
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:11,530

without coriander,

414
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:16,880
Fried chicken rice should be crispy with blood and liver,

415
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,500
I want a large portion of mixed Hainan chicken rice,

416
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,600
Fried chicken with skin, boiled chicken without skin,

417

A large portion of soup with wax gourd,

a large portion of soup with wax gourd,

420
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,830
Hold on.

421

-Take it. -Yes.

422
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:46,750
Table 1 is here.

423
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:51,150
Brother, why do I have cucumbers in this? -Yes.

424
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:53,600
Why don't I have cucumbers?

425
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,950
This meal is still a lot.

426
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,130
I'm sorry. I'll change it for you later.

427
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:03,030
Cucumber

428
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:05,480
for you. Help yourself. I'm sorry.

429
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,180
It's yours.

430
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,550
I didn't order this.

431
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,180
Sorry, I sent you the wrong table.

432
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,950
I'm sorry,

433
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,630
yours is ready,

434
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,430
This belongs to this man.

435
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,550
Yours

436
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,130
Don't I have crispy meat?

437
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,200
My soup doesn't have coriander Why does my soup have coriander?

438
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,600
I'm sorry. I'll change it right away.

439
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,050
Change it. Table 2

440
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,300
needs crispy soup without coriander,

441
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:46,380
Why didn't you put it away like this

442
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,580
in the first place,

443
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:53,450
-This is soup without coriander. -Okay. -This is

444
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,500
crispy meat. -Thank you.

445
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,630
All right,

446
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,230
Here you are

447
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:05,100
I want a large portion of mixed Hainan chicken rice,

448
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,300
fried with skin and cooked without skin

449
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,850
What?

450
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,930
Oh, it's fried with skin, not just skin.

451
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:15,780
I'm still confused, saying fried chicken only needs skin. -Ai,

452
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,450
change it. -Yes,

453
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,730
Mix large portions, not pure fried ones,

454
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,200
but cooked ones without skins.

455
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,050
What?

456
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,980
-I'll go. -A

457
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,350
large portion of

458
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:30,500
mixed Hainan chicken rice is

459
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,680
not only fried with pure skin, but

460
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,980
cooked without skin.

461
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,500
Isn't that what I said?

462
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,330
You didn't make it clear.

463
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,100
I don't remember it well.

464
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,480
I'm sorry,

465
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,530
Ai. It's okay.

466
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,580
I'll do it again.

467
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,500
Is my meal ready?

468
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,250
I'm working on it.

469
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,950
All right, it's done,

470
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,680
brother. I want leg root meat for my big Hainan chicken rice. Is that okay?

471
00:24:58,730 --> 00:24:59,830
Sorry, I forgot to mention,

472
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,050
those are drumsticks.

473
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,830
It's meat close to the drumstick.

474
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,280
I want the real leg root,

475
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,880
but not the drumstick part.

476
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,500
OK.

477
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:19,930
I want a large portion of chicken rice, chicken breast, 50 boxes of skin,

478
00:25:19,930 --> 00:25:22,150
20 boxes of blood and liver,

479
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,000
Blood instead of liver,

480
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,750
and calf meat with 100 boxes of skin,

481
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,450
No liver or blood for the rest.

482
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,100
Okay.

483
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,100
How are your grades?

484
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,580
Close to full marks. Isn't that great?

485
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,250
Yeah, I'm so happy for you.

486
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,680
I'm here to make up lessons for you.

487
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,900
It must be because of my remedial classes that I can get close to full marks.

488
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,750
It's all because of you.

489
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,100
Thank you.

490
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,180
By the way, my mom wants to treat you and thank you for taking care of the store for her.

491
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:01,280
Senior Ai, Senior Bright, Senior Touch, Senior Songkhram,

492
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,330
Hello,

493
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,530
Senior Ai, Senior Bright, Senior Touch, Senior Songkhram,

494
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,200
what's going on?

495
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,730
Are you all right?

496
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,830
Hello,

497
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,350
Auntie. Why are you here?

498
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,780
Long time no see.

499
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,800
I was just passing by and stopped by to see you. Where's

500
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,980
Ai? Is he coming home today?

501
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,450
Come on,

502
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:39,550
I'm preparing food for his friend, right?

503
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:42,200
They made an appointment to make up classes for Ai

504
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,000
and set up a shop for me,

505
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,600
I'm also looking after the store

506
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:54,080
for you. -Yes. Who are Ai's friends?

507
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,130
I told you. -I'm kidding. I've never made meatballs,

508
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,450
tiger

509
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,780
cubs, pig cubs,

510
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,250
Aunty is here. Whose son is he?

511
00:27:03,250 --> 00:27:06,150
My son... -Yes, mother's

512
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,450
son. Take the whole piece of pork.

513
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,450
Mom,

514
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:17,130
Songkhram and Bright came to my home that day to help me with my tutoring,

515
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,330
I know how to do it.

516
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,130
Awesome.

517
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:23,450
You have to study hard and don't bother your friends to make up lessons for you.

518
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,680
Okay, Mom.

519
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,280
Why are you here to make up lessons for Ai?

520
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,980
You didn't even call me Songkhram. Didn't you learn everything?

521
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,080
What lessons do you have to make up?

522
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,080
How can I make up lessons for you?

523
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,100
You don't even have a shadow every day.

524
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,680
I saw you playing bitcoin.

525
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,580
Be careful. This thing goes up and down.

526
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:51,150
If you accidentally fall, it hurts.

527
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,680
Did they make it public?

528
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,350
Look, did they go there alone?

529
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,230
I remember Pong has a date.

530
00:28:03,230 --> 00:28:06,500
If you go out with our friends, you'll make a big news.

531
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,350
Mom, is this cooked?

532
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,200
Not yet. -Yeah, okay.

533
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,630
It's mine. It's my

534
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,930
aunt. -Yes.

535
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,300
Can we have some wine?

536
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,650
You really need to cut it down.

537
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:36,950
Otherwise, it won't work tomorrow.

538
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,130
Auntie, you're the best. Thank you.

539
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,580
Touch-Drinking at home can drive me crazy.

540
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,980
I've never been crazy.

541
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,980
No, I didn't.

542
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,530
I'll get going then.

543
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,250
You may not be able to let go with the adults around,

544
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,800
but if you need anything else, just say it,

545
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,630
-Okay. -Thank you, Auntie.

546
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,580
Let me help you.

547
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,700
Ohm, go talk to your friends.

548
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:34,400
Actually, I don't know Ai's friends very well,

549
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,600
I think you two had a good chat,

550
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,350
but actually people in the school don't like them very much.

551
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:46,300
Like an inner gangster,

552
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,000
very violent.

553
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,980
Who are you talking about?

554
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,430
Songkhram

555
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:56,050
always uses force,

556
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,430
You can remind Ai.

557
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,130
But I think SongKhram is a good boy.

558
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:09,330
Take care of me at the hospital,

559
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:11,150
help make up classes,

560
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,480
You even came to my shop to help.

561
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,200
I think Ai might have feelings.

562
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,550
It's impossible.

563
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:23,200
As far as I know,

564
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,280
Ai and Bright are secretly dating,

565
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:30,900
They've been here since freshman year.

566
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:35,730
No matter what, I'd better leave tonight.

567
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,500
Goodbye.

568
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,330
Cheers!

569
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:49,480
Finish it.

570
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,580
Ai, don't be so slow.

571
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,780
Go on, go on.

572
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,450
What's the rush?

573
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:01,280
Be in a hurry.

574
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,500
1 2，

575
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:06,180
Cheers

576
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,330
The cup will be broken even if you do it once.

577
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,900
What time is it?

578
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,980
I don't think he can do it anymore.

579
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,030
I'll take him upstairs first.

580
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,480
Yes.

581
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,550
Touch

582
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,250
let him sleep on the floor,

583
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:25,200
Yes, I see.

584
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:26,900
What are you doing? -I'm leaving.

585
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,650
Let's go. I'll take you upstairs.

586
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:30,100
Continue. It's the floor,

587
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,750
not the map. Hold the cup. Are you done? -Oh, no.

588
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:33,830
Then why are you holding it?

589
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,830
Don't forget,

590
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,930
I want to sleep on the bed.

591
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,630
You're good. Walk well. Hey,

592
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:46,730
he didn't take off his shoes.

593
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:50,830
Take off your shoes!

594
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,730
Yes. Take it off.

595
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,500
Your house is done.

596
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,730
Just leave.

597
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,400
It's so heavy.

598
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,900
Lie down first.

599
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:26,230
Touch, come down and get some sleep.

600
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,930
Ai will kill you.

601
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,330
Come here.

602
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,030
= Diary of Love =.

603
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,550
It tastes really good.

604
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,250
Plain boiled water?

605
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,000
What plain boiled water is wine?

606
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:41,430
You lied to me and replaced you with plain boiled water.

607
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,300
I might have to go now.

608
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,050
My mom just called me.

609
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,180
Why are you in such a hurry to go back?

610
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,330
Let's play together first.

611
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,030
Uh, where's a table full of delicious food?

612
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,230
Where are you rushing to?

613
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,480
Let's meet another day.

614
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,780
My mom really called me.

615
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:56,450
I'm sorry.

616
00:33:56,450 --> 00:33:57,750
Mm-hmm.

617
00:33:57,750 --> 00:34:00,430
Are you drunk and trying to run away?

618
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,730
That's it for now. Let's go.

619
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,000
Take good care of yourself.

620
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,750
Why are you in such a hurry?

621
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,000
I don't know.

622
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,550
Do you want some?

623
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:18,530
-That guy. -That one is fine.

624
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,200
Don't drink any more.

625
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,480
I'm happy. Where are you taking Meen?

626
00:34:35,650 --> 00:34:37,400
I called Manow just now,

627
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:41,280
and he said you have an activity tomorrow morning. I'm afraid you can't get up. He asked you to mind your own business. Have you ever cared about

628
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:45,200
me?

629
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,000
You're drunk, Meen.

630
00:34:50,230 --> 00:34:52,800
This is my business. It has nothing to do with you.

631
00:34:59,050 --> 00:34:59,850
Don't drink any more.

632
00:34:59,850 --> 00:35:01,300
Let's go. I'll take you back to your apartment.

633
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:04,800
I can go back by myself. I have a lot of friends.

634
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,780
I'll take him back later.

635
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,250
None of your business.

636
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:18,280
Meen, you're a grown-up. You're not a kid anymore.

637
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,750
Yes.

638
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:23,250
Where are you going? Are you going to tell me?

639
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,550
I'm going to pee. Do you want to look at me?

640
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:40,480
They're all back. What are you doing here?

641
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:45,580
I drank a lot of wine. I'm drunk. I can't drive.

642
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,050
Is someone like you drunk?

643
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:48,430
You only drank a little.

644
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:53,030
Stop! Stop! Stop!

645
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:55,850
Last time you sat on my bed.

646
00:35:55,850 --> 00:35:57,200
Your smell is all over the bed.

647
00:35:57,330 --> 00:35:59,680
Do you remember your taste?

648
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,200
You're the only one who has that dirty smell.

649
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,530
You smell on the bed but you don't want to change the sheets.

650
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,950
I don't want to drag me to take a shower with you.

651
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,350
I'm telling you. Let me see. You won't give it to me.

652
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,580
I can watch it today.

653
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,080
Love Diary,

654
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,950
Songkhram came home to help with the lessons,

655
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:35,850
Songkhram is so cool looking for money to pay off Ohm's debt.

656
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,150
Songkhram yelled about the powder bottle,

657
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:44,780
and he secretly asked me to sleep in dormitory building 2.

658
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,880
Songkhram took me to the hospital to visit my mother.

659
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,200
You stayed with me when I was troubled,

660
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,150
and wasted four years.

661
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,530
What's wrong with you? You're smiling

662
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,630
alone. No.

663
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,900
Something fishy.

664
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,880
Aren't you going home today?

665
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,300
I want to stay with you for a while.

666
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,830
Let me help you.

667
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,630
When will it dry if you wipe it like this?

668
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,300
I have hands. I can do it myself.

669
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,250
Let me help you.

670
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,880
My hair is so short.

671
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,900
Let me help you.

672
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,300
When you're quiet,

673
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,850
you're cute when you're not angry.

674
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,580
I can go on.

675
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,330
-Go take a shower. -Yes. Go take

676
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,000
a shower.

677
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:39,230
UIT will hold a sorority for your dorm building.

678
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,280
Exactly

679
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,600
Dormitory outdoor fraternity,

680
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:46,950
everyone can come to socialize with each other and get to know each other.

681
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,930
We'll hold an event in the outer mansion and stay for one night.

682
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,730
But not everyone will go together.

683
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,580
For those who will go to two dorms at a time,

684
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,730
I've prepared to draw lots.

685
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,980
Lucky boys like you are very lucky.

686
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,450
Because you can draw lots first,

687
00:39:02,450 --> 00:39:03,730
please

688
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,800
extend your hand.

689
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,280
Jon from Dormitory 1

690
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,500
is paired with Ladies'Dormitory 3.

691
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:22,480
Dormitory 3,

692
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,630
girl

693
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,750
Aren't you too happy?

694
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,450
Songkhram

695
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,150
Okay,

696
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,080
Let me open it for you.

697
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,850
Come in and get it.

698
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,950
Here, here.

699
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,450
I got it in the wrong place.

700
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,400
Are you done?

701
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:44,080
Are you done?

702
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,680
All right, all right.

703
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,880
Do you need me to smoke it for you?

704
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:50,400
Songkhram is a match,

705
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:53,900
just like everyone thought.

706
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:02,950
We're going to the beach for a night.

707
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:07,900
Wait,

708
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,850
let's go with No. 3 Boys'Dormitory.

709
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,930
You have to be good and don't make trouble for me.

710
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:22,730
Everyone, brothers and sisters in Building 3, listen up,

711
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,480
I hope you can pay attention to this matter.

712
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,050
All I can say is,

713
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,130
it must be very exciting.

714
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,630
What's so exciting about you?

715
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,300
There must be some exciting news in this outdoor friendship,

716
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,430
because No is ready to explode,

717
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:37,000
The one in Dorm 3 who came to sleep in our dorm. -Who

718
00:40:38,150 --> 00:40:39,730
is it? -Who is it?

719
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:40,550
Do you want to know?

720
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,880
I'm sure everyone will know about it this time.

721
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,950
I want to know who it is. I'll see you at the outdoor fraternity.

722
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:49,900
-Do you want to know? -I'm sure I

723
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:51,250
will.

724
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,080
Make yourself at home.

725
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,880
Think of it as your own room. I'll give it to you today.

726
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:15,630
Here you are

727
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,600
Think of it as my own room?

728
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,480
I can't imagine it's my own room.

729
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,550
You really like airplanes.

730
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,400
Yes.

731
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,400
That's my dream since I was a child.

732
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,430
I want to fly like a bird.

733
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,350
I like to fly.

734
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,730
If one day I can fly the plane into the sky,

735
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,830
then I should be very happy.

736
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,700
You'll make it, Songkhram. Here you go.

737
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,250
This is your dress.

738
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,330
Leave me alone first. I'll take a shower first.

739
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,330
Yes, go ahead.

740
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,830
Can you help me clean the room?

741
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,100
It's so neat,

742
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:31,830
no one will think I must have a wife

743
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:36,250
and get dressed.

744
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,230
Take your clothes to the toilet

745
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,150
without wearing them. Do you like to show off?

746
00:42:40,430 --> 00:42:41,750
Why are you blushing?

747
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,980
Do you see me being shy?

748
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:51,030
I'm not shy.

749
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:01,650
Well, if you're not shy,

750
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,980
just put on your clothes.

751
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,530
What should I do so that I can live with you.

752
00:43:08,530 --> 00:43:10,030
No, Senior Bright,

753
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,930
you've known each other since high school, haven't you?

754
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,730
Are you feeling better?

755
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,180
Did you bring the scanner from school?

756
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,580
It must be someone from my dorm.

757
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,300
Reveal.

758
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,100
1，

759
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:22,150
2，

760
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,830
3，
