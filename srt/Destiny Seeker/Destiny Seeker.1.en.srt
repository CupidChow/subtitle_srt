1
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,330
OK The time is just right.

2
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:57,700
It takes 20 minutes from the 5th floor to the 1st floor.

3
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,180
Hello, senior.

4
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,700
I always see you at this time.

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,300
You're as drunk as ever.

6
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,130
You know it's not like I'm more drunk than this.

7
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:18,100
I see you every morning.

8
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,180
Look at you.

9
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,600
-Don't drink too much. -Got it, Dad.

10
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,700
Hi,

11
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,030
Senior Ai.

12
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,980
The water is not hot,

13
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,980
the lights are on for a while, the ceiling leaks,

14
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:32,880
The dormitory next door is too noisy, the network signal is not good, I can't do my homework,

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:34,550
I didn't get all the roll call exams,

16
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:36,530
I got A and F exams, and I went on and on.

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,730
What's the problem this time?

18
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,230
The water isn't hot Senior,

19
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,100
I'm not a repairman.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,500
Go inform your creditors.

21
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,150
You're not a repairman but do you have the heart to leave me alone?

22
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:49,380
Room Op 607 in sophomore year,

23
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,650
isn't the water hot?

24
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,550
I'll report it as soon as possible and ask someone to handle it.

25
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:54,830
Thank you, senior.

26
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,780
The water is too cold. I haven't showered for days.

27
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,200
Jerk, you're so sloppy.

28
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,150
Ai,

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,950
I only have five minutes left.

30
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:06,830
It's okay

31
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,900
if you have a fart, Senior.

32
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:11,200
I just want to ask you about the new meatball restaurant downstairs.

33
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,880
Have you eaten it? Is it delicious?

34
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,780
You stopped me just to tell me to eat meatballs while standing there,

35
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,780
but there are a lot of people waiting in line

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,230
and I haven't even eaten them yet.

37
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:22,480
So have you tasted it?

38
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:27,230
I'll skip class tomorrow and wait in line to buy meatballs. I'll tell you when the time comes.

39
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,650
Really?

40
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,280
You're awesome.

41
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,430
I'm being sarcastic, idiot.

42
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,830
It's so boring.

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:33,900
I'm leaving.

44
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,500
Anyone who wants to talk to me can wait till tonight.

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,480
Smelly bird playing with me early in the morning?

46
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,100
This is the Unicorn Institute of Tecnology & Innovation University.

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,500
The acronym UIT is well known to many,

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,280
UIT is a famous start-up university in Asia,

49
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,800
where there are only engineering majors.

50
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,850
A young man who dreams of starting his own company.

51
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:49,330
You're so crowded that you want to go to school here.

52
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,080
Because there is an opportunity to get promotion and investment from the sand table presentation.

53
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,250
Every year, investors from leading companies in Asia

54
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,430
will be the judges of senior students'graduation project promotion meetings,

55
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:03,950
to finance projects for sustainable development.

56
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:07,980
It can be said that the opportunity to get 10 million start-up funds is not far away.

57
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,900
The teaching here is very strict,

58
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,300
students have to stay inside,

59
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,150
Living in a dorm that's not easy at school is definitely not easy either,

60
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:20,830
because UIT has a different dorm selection system from any school.

61
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,980
Of course, no school is the same.

62
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,300
= 3 years

63
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,980
ago = Hello,

64
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,880
Here you are.

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,680
Go that way.

66
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:40,980
-Thank you. -You're welcome.

67
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,530
Hello,

68
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,980
Hello,

69
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,280
my name is Touch,

70
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,930
What's your name?

71
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,280
Ai

72
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:52,050
Ai, nice to meet you.

73
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,030
Have you just arrived?

74
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,380
Which major?

75
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,300
Auto major.

76
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,030
What about you?

77
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:00,280
I majored in automobile,

78
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,300
so I'm curious about what this is, right?

79
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Kind of.

80
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,230
This is a UIT badge.

81
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,880
It's similar to Apple Badge.

82
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:11,880
What's it for?

83
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,430
It can be used to choose the dorm.

84
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,350
Do you mean it's for choosing the dorm?

85
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,330
Yes,

86
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:20,330
I guess there must be a surprise today.

87
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,550
Like tug-of-war,

88
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,330
glass bridge,

89
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,880
Have you watched too many Squid Games?

90
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
Junior,

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,550
are you here to gather

92
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,600
six dorm leaders?

93
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,550
I don't think so.

94
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,630
Yeah, it looks too ordinary, doesn't it?

95
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,980
If you're named,

96
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,680
you and I have to be in the same group.

97
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,400
What name do you want?

98
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,230
Are you the head of the dorm?

99
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,980
Are you pretending to lie to me?

100
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,680
Touch, your brain is too big.

101
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,930
For today's dorm exam,

102
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,100
Each of you will take the exam in 6 exam rooms.

103
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:01,580
Each examination room has a different way of taking exams.

104
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:05,430
After all the exams, your scores will be recorded on the UIT badge.

105
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,600
So you'll know which dorm you'll be staying in?

106
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,850
This badge will be with you for 4 years.

107
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,400
Keep it safe for me.

108
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,850
Because it is the symbol of UIT students.

109
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:18,650
And use it as your pass to and from the dorm.

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,080
Ai. -Yes.

111
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,280
You can have

112
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,480
all the dorms you want?

113
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,400
Professional exam?

114
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,600
Do you think UIT is that simple?

115
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:41,880
I think this exam room is definitely not easy.

116
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,030
If we write the wrong answer,

117
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,950
our seats might crack.

118
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,080
Then I fell down and got flooded,

119
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,230
and I failed the exam,

120
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,300
It's also possible.

121
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,000
It makes me nervous.

122
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,680
Everyone who comes here,

123
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,700
please take your seats.

124
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,400
For this exam,

125
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,630
you have 30 minutes.

126
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,180
Before you choose the answer,

127
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,830
you have to think it through.

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,330
Once you choose it, you can't go back. The program

129
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,530
will automatically terminate the exam when the modification time is up.

130
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:15,000
Who hasn't finished answering the questions?

131
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,100
You will get the corresponding score.

132
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,550
No matter how many answers you get,

133
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,280
the program will count the intermediate scores.

134
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,980
There is no exam paper on the iPad.

135
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm not Einstein.

136
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,100
Touch, you abandoned me.

137
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,450
What the heck? Why are you doing this so fast?

138
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,280
The dormitory exam is so cruel.

139
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,250
Is this a professional Olympic competition?

140
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,350
It's been a long time.

141
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,230
Yes.

142
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:58,500
Isn't that Senior?

143
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,280
Sorry, Senior.

144
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,080
Oh, no. I should've dressed up

145
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:10,730
like this. Thank you.

146
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,300
You're not a senior.

147
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,050
Everyone,

148
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,650
you can enter the examination room now.

149
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,830
Hello, everyone.

150
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
This is the examination room for physical fitness.

151
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,250
You are the first group to enter this exam room,

152
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,080
the three items you need to take the exam are.

153
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,930
Run,

154
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,300
Push-ups,

155
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,800
and plate support,

156
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,630
I guess we must be exhausted.

157
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,100
It's totally different from the exam just now.

158
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,980
It was a brain-racking knowledge test just now,

159
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,850
and this exam room needs to exhaust physical strength,

160
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:04,980
Look at Pop.

161
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,800
You look so relaxed.

162
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,300
I don't like it,

163
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
I would laugh if I gasped.

164
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,680
Don't you think he's too calm?

165
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,430
I don't think so.

166
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,630
If you're ready,

167
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:19,900
please step out of the first row.

168
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,700
Start

169
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,500
Darn! Is this a human or a machine?

170
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,580
It's too fast.

171
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,780
Sports maniac.

172
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:43,050
He only has strength but no brain.

173
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,680
Why are you mad at him?

174
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,780
I don't think I can get in here without brains.

175
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,900
Yes, yes.

176
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,280
Maybe it doesn't match his character.

177
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,580
Can we make it through the tribulation?

178
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,730
Can you do it? Come on,

179
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,700
junior.

180
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,080
I'm cheering for you.

181
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,380
I'm not good at it.

182
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,150
What?

183
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,050
What are you talking about?

184
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,100
Who is the fart senior?

185
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,750
No.

186
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,430
He's just too nervous.

187
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:27,280
Please step out of the next row.

188
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,280
Can you hold on? Ai

189
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,580
is not going to die, is he?

190
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:58,380
I'm going to throw up.

191
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm about the same as you.

192
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,050
That guy is quite arrogant.

193
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,480
Hello

194
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,100
and welcome to the third exam room,

195
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,550
This exam room will test everyone's handsome value and charm value,

196
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,250
what the hell is the handsome value?

197
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,330
There are three items in total-as

198
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,200
the name suggests, it's probably about face value test, but

199
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,150
I don't mean... -The first one measures face shape, looks

200
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:31,550
and looks depends on each person's aesthetics. -The second test is skin. Is this also a test? -The third test is plain face,

201
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:34,030
The distance from the bridge of the nose to the brow,

202
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:35,700
120 mm.

203
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,430
It's strange that he didn't pass the exam.

204
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,050
That face is perfect.

205
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,380
Just like the sculpture,

206
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,300
the sculpture of the foot is similar.

207
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,080
There are so many handsome guys.

208
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,830
The man next to him is also very handsome.

209
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,600
Eyebrows,

210
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,480
every senior's measurement is so accurate.

211
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,280
That's right.

212
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,080
This one looks more handsome.

213
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,130
Younger,

214
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:59,650
much better than that jerk.

215
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,380
The first impression is really not good.

216
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:11,930
Stay here.

217
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,400
The foundation is so thick,

218
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,530
do boys still wear makeup nowadays?

219
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,150
A lot, bro. Many people

220
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,300
are taking care of themselves now,

221
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:27,850
Or are you

222
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,580
wearing makeup?

223
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,700
I'm so original.

224
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,350
You have a good foundation.

225
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,050
Yes,

226
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,000
you can smile.

227
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:50,950
Not bad.

228
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,550
Yours is good too.

229
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:55,800
What? You

230
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,400
got goose bumps.

231
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,650
You're not bad, either.

232
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,580
Do you know each other well?

233
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,600
With you and me,

234
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,550
not yet,

235
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,630
But soon,

236
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,850
Songkhram,

237
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,480
My name is Songkhram.

238
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,500
Who wants to know your name?

239
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,650
Your name.

240
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:26,780
Wealth,

241
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,230
what do you think will happen to this room?

242
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,350
Can't you guess?

243
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,450
Every room is different,

244
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,830
I think this room is a different kind of

245
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,250
knowledge and strength and handsomeness.

246
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,300
What else?

247
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,200
You don't have to guess. You'll find out when Senior comes.

248
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,630
Ai

249
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,000
Ohm,

250
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,700
I didn't expect to see you today.

251
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,550
How are you doing,

252
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:49,900
bro? -Are you okay? -I'm fine.

253
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,550
Ohm, this is Touch. My new friend,

254
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,800
Touch. This is Ohm.

255
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,400
He's my direct senior.

256
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,950
Hello. How was the test in the room?

257
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,350
How's Auntie doing, bro?

258
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,480
My mom is fine.

259
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,880
How about you? We haven't seen each other much.

260
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,650
You didn't come to the family dinner last time.

261
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,380
I was a little busy during that time. Hello,

262
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,650
everyone,

263
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,730
This test room is different from other rooms,

264
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,700
which is why we let everyone wear casual clothes.

265
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,930
In order to see how you're dressed,

266
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,150
do you judge from how you're dressed?

267
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,130
Brand?

268
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,430
Price?

269
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,900
That's right. I can't believe it.

270
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,300
It's really not easy.

271
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:41,130
One moment you look good and the other you're dressed up.

272
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,400
You're so weak. Just give in.

273
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:55,900
Please put your watches, necklaces, rings and decorations,

274
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,100
on the velvet plate that Senior prepared for you,

275
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:01,250
No one is wearing a fake. Don't be shy.

276
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,400
I thought I was going into a bar.

277
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,980
How can seniors take such a test?

278
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,400
But your relatives should be able to pass this room.

279
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,900
Dressed like that,

280
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,180
I thought he was a showcase in the mall.

281
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,250
Finally, please take off your clothes and trousers,

282
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,950
no matter how many of them you have.

283
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,230
Take off all of them.

284
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:20,050
Including underwear,

285
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,630
brand, model and price

286
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,530
are very important. -Do you really want

287
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,300
to take them off? -Yes.

288
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,700
Ai, are you done taking it off?

289
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,080
Yes.

290
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,350
What do you think, bro?

291
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,650
Did your underwear pass?

292
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,150
I think the test in this room is the weirdest.

293
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,280
I'm sure I'll get very few marks.

294
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,430
-I'm not wearing underwear. -Come on. -I'll go.

295
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:57,830
Really?

296
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,480
I'm kidding.

297
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,500
What do you think of the test in the next room?

298
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,380
I think it's going to reverse more and more.

299
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,480
I can do it, right?

300
00:16:08,730 --> 00:16:09,700
Good for you.

301
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,100
Come on,

302
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,030
Ai. Move. Move. Move.

303
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,080
He sucked the water from three of them.

304
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,130
Order it. Order it.

305
00:16:14,130 --> 00:16:15,950
Yes, I'm going to be an eel.

306
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,030
I'm going to be an eel. Order it.

307
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,650
Yes, it's on fire.

308
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,650
I hit it.

309
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,050
That guy is dead.

310
00:16:23,050 --> 00:16:25,030
-Ai, look at the hole. -Let's go.

311
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:27,250
-Dong Dong. -Move. Move. Move. That's

312
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,700
it.

313
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,580
It's really exciting.

314
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:41,800
Bro, I think I like the test in this room the most.

315
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,430
Let's guess the pictures in the comic book,

316
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,730
and play attacking and defending.

317
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,930
It's super fun.

318
00:16:45,930 --> 00:16:47,400
I can tell by your face.

319
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,680
You're good, too.

320
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,830
You guessed right about every anime.

321
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,300
Playing games is also a leading level.

322
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,130
I think you should be able to get a good score for this room.

323
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,700
I'm the most confident in this room.

324
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:58,030
Let's go to the last room.

325
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,650
Do you want to choose the rules between musical instruments and art

326
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:05,250
and let it be?

327
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,800
Yeah, it's really literary.

328
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:08,030
What do you want to choose?

329
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:10,000
Musical instruments or art?

330
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,750
I might choose art.

331
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:12,650
Are you good at drawing?

332
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,250
No.

333
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:16,750
I can draw whatever I want when choosing art,

334
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,400
but I don't know how to play musical instruments at all.

335
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,380
Look, I have a house and Yun Duo. All right,

336
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:39,530
let's welcome the dorm manager to speak.

337
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,980
Thank you all for participating in today's dorm selection.

338
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:50,150
I'm sure you're all tired,

339
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:54,530
I think you all want to know which dorm everyone is in?

340
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,300
The staff will call everyone's names later.

341
00:17:57,530 --> 00:18:01,000
The person who was called came to the information desk with the UIT badge.

342
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,050
If there's a room with the highest score,

343
00:18:03,930 --> 00:18:04,880
which dorm will you be in?

344
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,680
The highest score of Jay is in Room 5,

345
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,130
and 70 points are assigned to Dorm 5.

346
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:16,550
Thank you.

347
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,700
The next one, Ohm, please.

348
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,880
If your relative goes up,

349
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,550
which dorm do you think he will be in?

350
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:26,930
It must be Dorm 4, bro.

351
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,300
Ohm's highest score comes from the test in Room 4.

352
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,000
85 points Ohm is assigned to Dorm 4,

353
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,330
see? I got it right.

354
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,680
It's strange that you guessed it wrong.

355
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
Your relatives are all dressed up like that.

356
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:42,400
Next, please invite Bright to the stage,

357
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,000
which dorm do you think this kind of person can go to?

358
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,380
This is super easy.

359
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,680
He's so handsome. He must be Dorm 3.

360
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,700
Bright's highest test score comes from the test in Room 2.

361
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,730
94 points Bright is assigned to Dorm 2,

362
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,680
see? You guessed it wrong.

363
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:02,530
Who would have thought the score would be so intense?

364
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:03,830
I admit defeat!

365
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:05,100
Touch, please.

366
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,200
Touch's score comes from the test in Room 3.

367
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,580
82 points. Touch is assigned to Dorm 3.

368
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:27,200
I'll go. Look, I'm handsome, too. I was assigned to Dorm

369
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,750
3. I'll go. I'm also a good-looking brother.

370
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,780
OK OK

371
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,580
I'm happy for you too Handsome guy in Dorm 3

372
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:36,580
If you're in the dormitory of the game Can we still meet?

373
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,650
-I haven't been called yet. -Calm down. The

374
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,250
next person's name is really special.

375
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,850
Let's welcome Songkhram,

376
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:49,680
who's the hardest to guess. I don't know which dorm he'll be in. Any

377
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,950
dorm is fine as long as he doesn't share the same dorm with me,

378
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,880
86，

379
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,530
98，

380
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:02,380
98,

381
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:07,080
the highest score I got when I went to both rooms was the same.

382
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,200
He really is like a god.

383
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,430
But the scores are the same. What should we do?

384
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,400
If the score is the same as this,

385
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,950
it depends on you.

386
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,630
If students with similar scores have the right to choose which dorm to go to,

387
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,030
but someone with such a high value like him,

388
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,450
You should be with someone with a high value

389
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:26,950
and think it through. You're in such good health,

390
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,730
If you're in Dorm 2 with the seniors,

391
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,330
you'll have a long-term future with your PE stick.

392
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,400
Playing so many sports

393
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,280
makes your muscles so tense

394
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:41,280
that you tend to grow old quickly.

395
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,780
You only have a high face value but no strength.

396
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,150
Do you have no brain?

397
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,550
Songkhram is so handsome.

398
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,650
What do I like? Handsome?

399
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,930
Pretending to be B is so lame,

400
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,830
which dorm do you think he will choose?

401
00:20:57,550 --> 00:20:58,430
I don't know.

402
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,330
I chose Dorm 2,

403
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,880
Songkhram made such a smart decision.

404
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,250
The chairman of Dorm 3 will be very sad.

405
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,930
I chose Dorm 2,

406
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,980
because I think there should be something like me in this dorm,

407
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:17,130
I like sports like sports,

408
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,880
I think face value is just appearance,

409
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,380
I'm good-looking.

410
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,750
But if I'm in a dormitory related to sports,

411
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,880
I can still develop my sports skills.

412
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,980
You look good. But if you're overconfident,

413
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,930
be careful to get punched in the face.

414
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,350
That's why I should stay strong all the time.

415
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:42,050
Gosh, it's so cool.

416
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,080
Songkhram is so cool.

417
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,230
He's so handsome and cheap-mouthed,

418
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,580
I don't think you like him at all, do you?

419
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:51,080
Look, the two dorm leaders on the stage just now,

420
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,230
they all quarreled because of him.

421
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,830
Well, speaking of dorm leaders,

422
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,100
I like seniors. They're

423
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,130
so cool as dorm leaders.

424
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:58,830
You can sit on the chair and choose your junior.

425
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,280
When I was a senior, I also wanted to sit in a chair like this and choose my junior.

426
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,530
You can do it if you want.

427
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,500
I'm not messing with you.

428
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,430
I think it's just been a while.

429
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:10,300
Now that you're the president of Dorm 3,

430
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,380
you can sit in a chair and choose your junior to enter the dorm.

431
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,630
Be quiet,

432
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,600
Touch. Go and do your work.

433
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,350
I still remember that year when you said

434
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,830
you could do it if you wanted to.

435
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,100
I'm not messing with you.

436
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,680
In the end, you were elected as the president of Dorm 3.

437
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,600
You get what you hate, man,

438
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:30,000
You're annoying

439
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,000
You two

440
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,130
haven't liked each other since the first day.

441
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,200
If it were someone else, we would have been together long ago.

442
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,580
Okay, okay.

443
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,050
You must have found the right person.

444
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:12,630
Brother, did you do well in the test just now?

445
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,080
Running and doing push-ups and tablet support,

446
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,850
I really can't do it,

447
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:17,800
I can't either.

448
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
The junior who's chatting over there,

449
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,230
do you still choose the dorm?

450
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:25,580
Laugh at your sister.

451
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,330
Be quiet.

452
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,230
Dorm 3 depends on the face value,

453
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,650
and scores according to three rules,

454
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:38,780
One face shape,

455
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,250
two skin,

456
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,750
Is San Suyan

457
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,680
serious? Judge,

458
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,430
Don't bother me. I'm just

459
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,800
looking at the screen. I really want to see the real thing.

460
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,080
I said don't bother me yet.

461
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,950
Can't you understand human language?

462
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,250
Did you laugh at me just now?

463
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,200
I'm asking you a question, right?

464
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,980
Dumb? No answer.

465
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,280
Get out of the way. I just went to the bathroom

466
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,030
to wash my hands.

467
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,850
It's really out of the way.

468
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,650
You just went to the toilet and didn't wash your hands before you touched me.

469
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:37,880
Dirty,

470
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,350
Disgusting,

471
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,350
Annoying.

472
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,830
Complain. Complain.

473
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,830
Hello, everyone.

474
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,100
It must be tiring for you to come here after a lot of trials,

475
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:03,200
It may be a joke to you, sometimes it's true and sometimes it's false,

476
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,480
but our UIT dormitory selection system

477
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,250
is really strict.

478
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,580
You have to be strict, too.

479
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,400
I know you're excited to find a senior who's in tune with you.

480
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,550
So are we.

481
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:13,850
But you know what?

482
00:25:13,850 --> 00:25:15,980
No matter which dorm you live in,

483
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:19,280
everyone here is my brother.

484
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,400
Whether it's a senior

485
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,800
or a junior?

486
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,550
We all have only one goal,

487
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,250
to find the right person I'll go

488
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,980
This senior is so cool.

489
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,900
I love it so much

490
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:35,880
that whoever I call will give a speech on stage

491
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,100
with his UIT badge,

492
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,350
Which one do you like?

493
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,780
It's none of your business. I want to talk to you nicely

494
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,400
and ask you to answer me nicely.

495
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:49,650
It's unlikely that the one I like is also the one you like.

496
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,800
I'm just asking.

497
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,130
Do you want to know what you like?

498
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,980
What do you like?

499
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,050
Are you choosing a junior to enter the dorm?

500
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:00,550
That's right.

501
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:03,330
Which junior do you like?

502
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
I didn't ask about your dishes.

503
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,550
I won't talk to you.

504
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:12,780
The next junior, Pluster.

505
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,000
He's so much like you.

506
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,950
Cool.

507
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:22,150
Too pretentious.

508
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,050
The scores are the same?

509
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,300
If you have the same score, you can choose your own dorm,

510
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,900
between No. 2 and No. 3.

511
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,830
Choose number 3.

512
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,530
Because we're better than roommates here.

513
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:36,700
Because we are family members,

514
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,230
the life of students in our school

515
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,200
is neither difficult nor bad.

516
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,780
With your ability,

517
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:45,430
and the atmosphere of Dorm 3,

518
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,930
You will have more confidence to accomplish more things.

519
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,730
Let's choose No. 2.

520
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,200
Study well, exercise well, and be in good shape,

521
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,080
if you choose Dorm 2,

522
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:00,030
You will definitely be the best in all fields.

523
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,200
Narcissistic.

524
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,300
You're being rude again.

525
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,730
I didn't spill it.

526
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:07,630
Number 2-3,

527
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,150
number 2-3,

528
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,630
This scene is so familiar.

529
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:13,830
I think I've seen it somewhere.

530
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,780
Yes,

531
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,450
between Senior Songkhram No. 2 and Senior Ai No. 3,

532
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:22,180
Make your choice.

533
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,650
I choose.

534
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,980
Senior Songkhram, Dorm 2.

535
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:48,280
Since they graduated and moved out,

536
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,200
there are only sophomores and juniors living together.

537
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,400
But I don't have roommates in my senior year.

538
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,250
So I need you to find a freshman

539
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,950
to live with a senior?

540
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:06,930
Okay. Dismissed.

541
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:14,650
Congratulations, Songkhram and Ai.

542
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,850
I've already thought about it.

543
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:22,000
The dormitory leader of No. 2 is only Songkhram,

544
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,100
and

545
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,950
the dormitory leader of No. 3 will never have anyone but you. Ai, please take care of Nucleus.

546
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,200
That's why I want handsome Ai to take care of me.

547
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:40,450
And Songkhram will take care of her.

548
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,400
I have all kinds of secrets and gossip in UIT Academy.

549
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,180
I know it clearly.

550
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,030
Very accurate and exciting.

551
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:53,300
If there's anything you don't understand or need help,

552
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:59,730
you can ask me for help.

553
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:04,400
Yeah,

554
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,580
I'm chatting with a handsome guy.

555
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,900
What are you thinking?

556
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,900
The dorm manager wants a roommate.

557
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,800
Mind your own business.

558
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,050
The plan failed, didn't it?

559
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,650
She came to me herself.

560
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,930
I didn't force him.

561
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:27,780
What should I do?

562
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,750
I didn't lose.

563
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:32,030
And that junior doesn't meet my requirements.

564
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,280
Just keep an eye on him.

565
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:36,330
Don't let him seduce my roommate.

566
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,800
You should keep an eye

567
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
on your roommate. Don't seduce my roommate.

568
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,400
Nervous,

569
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,600
You're being unreasonable.

570
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,930
Sa Po,

571
00:29:48,050 --> 00:29:49,130
who are you talking about?

572
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,050
The seniors will meet at Judy's shop at 8: 00 this evening, and the senior seniors will treat us to this

573
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,100
event.

574
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,050
Come and enjoy yourself.

575
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,830
Pluster, right?

576
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,180
Plaster

577
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:08,730
No, Senior.

578
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:10,950
That's a band-aid for wounds.

579
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,280
I added plus.

580
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,330
Do you like it?

581
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,430
Now?

582
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,350
Okay.

583
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,580
Sharp enough. No wonder

584
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Songkhram likes you.

585
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:25,980
Speak of the devil.

586
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,930
-Your senior is calling. -Hello. -I see

587
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,100
him. Being with him is like

588
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:31,650
being with you.

589
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:34,430
Please take care of him.

590
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:36,760
I'm calling you because I need your help.

591
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:37,730
What is it?

592
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:39,200
I'm going to change stores tonight.

593
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,950
You know Judy very well, don't you?

594
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:45,000
Cheers!

595
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,050
Cool

596
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,230
Senior, the one from Dorm 2 is here.

597
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,650
I want to know more people.

598
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,850
I know a ghost.

599
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,080
Just wait and see.

600
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
Ai, have you been here long?

601
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,430
It's been a while.

602
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,030
There's a lot of people in this shop. -Well,

603
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,530
not many at first,

604
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:23,080
But it's been so crowded since you came here.

605
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,700
It's annoying.

606
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,500
Touch, wait for me.

607
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,400
-Go to the

608
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,300
toilet. -Mm-hmm.

609
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,700
Songkhram, where are you going?

610
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:38,830
I'll make some wine for you.

611
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,230
Why are you drinking with

612
00:31:40,850 --> 00:31:42,300
Bright first? Senior Bright.

613
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,400
What's wrong with you?

614
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,780
You invited him here for a drink when you knew you couldn't do it,

615
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,830
you're really shameless.

616
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:54,380
What does that have to do with you?

617
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:55,630
You've been working since noon.

618
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,100
What did I do?

619
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,480
You must have thought too much.

620
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:00,950
You've been quite arrogant all day.

621
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:03,330
If you still bother me at night,

622
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:05,300
are you the only one who can come to this shop?

623
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:07,800
I know you did it on purpose.

624
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,900
You heard me. I told my junior to come to this shop.

625
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,750
Are you crazy? Go back to sleep when you're drunk.

626
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,250
Drunken cat.

627
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:21,800
Gossip beast,

628
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,330
It's rubbing up.

629
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,950
How is it? Are you drunk?

630
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:31,880
Why is your face so smelly today?

631
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,100
It was good at first,

632
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,730
but it wasn't good after you came to me.

633
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:37,030
What did I do?

634
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,680
I mean your friend.

635
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,030
It's quite arrogant.

636
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,450
That's how it is at school.

637
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,930
What does he want?

638
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:44,050
What did he do?

639
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,350
He's been throwing things around and going crazy.

640
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,480
It started at noon.

641
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,530
You followed me to the toilet just now.

642
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,400
Why don't you go to another store?

643
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,550
Why don't you go to another store?

644
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,350
You nag even when you're not drunk,

645
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,930
and you nag even more when you're drunk.

646
00:33:02,350 --> 00:33:03,580
Who are you talking about

647
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:08,730
and gossiping when you don't have enough ears?

648
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,080
The good stuff in Dorm 2,

649
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,130
those who are not in Dorm 2 won't have a chance to drink it.

650
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:23,380
Exclusive to the person in Dorm 2 and his family.

651
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,700
Cheers!

652
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:32,880
Hello.

653
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:37,700
Meen, this way. Meen

654
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,430
is handsome enough every day.

655
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,250
You still need to

656
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,830
dress up. I'm sorry,

657
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:46,430
I came as soon as I finished my work.

658
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,550
It takes a long time to get together with friends.

659
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:52,100
Everyone, this is Meen in our dorm,

660
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,230
Senior Meen,

661
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,430
Pond-Meen

662
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,750
is just like on TV,

663
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,250
In the TV series you acted with Pond,

664
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,600
I like you so much.

665
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,480
You're even more handsome than the TV series.

666
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:05,250
My sister likes Pond-Meen very much,

667
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,700
and goes to all the fan meetings.

668
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,900
Are you busy lately?

669
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,480
I'm so happy that I can live in Dorm 3.

670
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:15,480
My name is Nano. I graduated from Wellington College of Engineering.

671
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,530
Please give me your advice.

672
00:34:18,430 --> 00:34:19,980
Junior is so good at chatting.

673
00:34:20,430 --> 00:34:22,000
Don't worry.

674
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,530
We still have a lot of opportunities to chat with him.

675
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,080
What do you mean?

676
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,650
Your roommate?

677
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,700
Senior... I need to pee.

678
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:33,300
I need to go to the toilet first.

679
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,380
Where are you going,

680
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:42,530
Pluster? Go to the toilet.

681
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,200
Here, drink these first before you go. Yeah,

682
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,900
drink them first.

683
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,600
Oh, my god. I really finished it.

684
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,280
Come back later. Brother,

685
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,030
Plug is great.

686
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,080
It's really my junior.

687
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,630
Come on, honey. Let's go.

688
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,830
Cheers!

689
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,230
What do you think this is about?

690
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,430
I don't know either. Ask him.

691
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,530
Don't be interested.

692
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:22,130
That's so arrogant,

693
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:26,730
Songkhram. I'm like this. Ai,

694
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,880
why do you always come to me to look for trouble?

695
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,880
Just because you're in Dorm 3?

696
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,780
What's wrong with me in Dorm 3?

697
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:39,700
Dorm 3 and Dorm 2 are at odds. Don't you understand?

698
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,650
Childish.

699
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:44,450
What did Dorm 3 do to Dorm 2?

700
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:50,680
Last year, the senior proposed to get drunk without alcohol,

701
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,730
and the senior proposed the degree of drunkenness without alcohol,

702
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,630
I didn't mean to make trouble or cause trouble.

703
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,430
We can keep digging deeper.

704
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:01,050
Many, many years ago. You can also take photos

705
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:05,530
with the app. How can you take photos? How can you look good?

706
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,300
If you guys talk about the retouching effect,

707
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,100
isn't that too much of a jerk?

708
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:13,450
It's obvious that he's deliberately looking for someone else.

709
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,280
No matter how hard the argument is today, there's no way to end it.

710
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,880
Ai

711
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,850
Come and have a drink with me.

712
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,630
If you lose, stop making noise.

713
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,030
I've never made a noise.

714
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:27,530
What do you think

715
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,680
Right now,

716
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:32,730
if you lose to me, don't make trouble out of nothing,

717
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:33,630
I'm not being unreasonable.

718
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,680
You're being unreasonable.

719
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:35,550
Are you throwing a tantrum?

720
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:36,330
You're being unreasonable.

721
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,150
Are you throwing a tantrum?

722
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:37,830
You're being unreasonable.

723
00:36:37,830 --> 00:36:38,680
Are you throwing a tantrum?

724
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,330
You're being unreasonable.

725
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:40,050
Jerk!

726
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,380
Do you want to compete?

727
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:42,200
Yes

728
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,330
Ai, listen to me. You're drunk.

729
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,400
You can't do it.

730
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:50,380
I'm not drunk.

731
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,350
I want to compete with your friend.

732
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:53,980
Ai, calm down.

733
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,230
Songkhram is a good drinker.

734
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:58,580
I've been drinking with him for four years and you can't compete with him.

735
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,500
Leave me alone. I want to compete with your friend.

736
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:03,850
So that your friend can stop making trouble out of nothing?

737
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:04,880
I'm not being unreasonable.

738
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,530
You're the one who needs to stop spouting. Ai,

739
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,100
you know you can't drink it. What are you doing?

740
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:11,900
I suspect he doesn't even know what he said.

741
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,080
Look at him,

742
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,700
he's still stubborn.

743
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:16,330
No matter what, someone must teach him a lesson.

744
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,680
Are you ready?

745
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:22,780
I'm ready.

746
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,380
Senior Ai,

747
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:35,850
Senior Song,

748
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:38,880
Senior Ai... -Senior

749
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:42,180
Song... Go on. Cheers! Cheers!

750
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,900
Senior Ai in Dorm 3,

751
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,800
Senior Song in Dorm 2,

752
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:52,350
Dorm 3,

753
00:37:52,350 --> 00:37:54,930
Dorm 2,

754
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,330
Yeah,

755
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:01,300
Senior Ai, yeah,

756
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:05,780
yeah,

757
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:10,250
I told you not to compete. You knew you'd lose.

758
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,630
Listen carefully.

759
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,980
Go on, go on.

760
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,330
Spit it all out.

761
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,400
I threw up all of them.

762
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,530
My dorm manager.

763
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:24,330
Are you okay? The perpetrator

764
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,530
doesn't have to repeat it.

765
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,080
No, I just want to collect evidence.

766
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:33,880
I heard you, Songkhram.

767
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,750
Did you see what I was doing?

768
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:41,930
Darn it.

769
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,800
I told you not to tease him anymore.

770
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,700
Tell me.

771
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,180
Ai will never mess with Songkhram again.

772
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,350
What are you up to?

773
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:57,180
Ai will never mess with Songkhram again.

774
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,930
Hurry up and be a loser, okay?

775
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:06,850
Is Ai never going to mess with that jerk Songkhram again?

776
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,780
Jerk!

777
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,530
There are also words

778
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,400
to help your sister,

779
00:39:15,430 --> 00:39:16,550
All right,

780
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:19,530
are you satisfied with today's game?

781
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm very satisfied.

782
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:27,280
What did

783
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,030
Meen say?

784
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,700
I'm so glad you're back.

785
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,830
Yes.

786
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,100
Don't disappear for so long, okay?

787
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:37,900
I have to work too.

788
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,780
I.

789
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,830
What?

790
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,900
I miss you.

791
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,200
Hello.

792
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,180
Who's stopping here to block my way?

793
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,980
Don't you even look at the parking?

794
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:21,750
How can you drive when you're drunk?

795
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,930
Your car?

796
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,930
Who told you to park here?

797
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,400
I've been parked here for a long time.

798
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,030
How did you reverse the car?

799
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:35,300
Me?

800
00:40:35,730 --> 00:40:38,130
You're the one who didn't park properly.

801
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:43,630
You deserve to be hit by me if you park like this.

802
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,000
It's your fault, fool.

803
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,080
And my car is expensive.

804
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,900
You're drunk and you're still driving

805
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,850
and picking on me, right?

806
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:56,780
What do you want?

807
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,230
I'm warning you.

808
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,830
If you don't stop, it won't be over today.

809
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:02,250
It's not over yet, is it?

810
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,850
It's not over yet.

811
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:10,900
Jerk!

812
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,230
Stop...

813
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,900
Calm down!

814
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:18,850
Ai...

815
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:19,850
You see,

816
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,730
he's wrong. I'm not going to let it go.

817
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,580
Let him go, Songkhram. Are you on his side?

818
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:26,400
AiAi,

819
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,100
it's not me.

820
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:32,700
He did it.

821
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,250
I know you're angry.

822
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:38,030
You don't have to do this to him,

823
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,050
do I have to let him do this when he does this to me? Ai,

824
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,600
you have to win, right?

825
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,000
Really?

826
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,930
Then you can compete with me.

827
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:16,680
Ai will never mess with that darned Songkhram again.

828
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,080
When did you take a picture of me.

829
00:42:18,790 --> 00:42:22,960
[ You didn't reply to me after watching the

830
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:25,980
video. ] [ Don't get up and practice. Be careful. You can't beat

831
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,250
me that day. ] What nonsense are you talking about?

832
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,000
Practice what?

833
00:42:31,630 --> 00:42:32,980
What a jerk!

834
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,130
Is Ai awake?

835
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:39,680
Ai

836
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,550
Yes.

837
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,480
I'm coming in.

838
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:49,500
Are you okay?

839
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,950
Do you know what you did last night?

840
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,650
What did you do?

841
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,950
It's strange that you can remember it after drinking like that.

842
00:42:57,430 --> 00:42:58,250
What happened?

843
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,380
Did you challenge the dorm leader over there?

844
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,550
Oh my god.

845
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:08,400
You have to win, right?

846
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:10,880
Really?

847
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,000
Compare it with me,

848
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:18,850
Songkhram, the dorm leader of Dorm 2,

849
00:43:19,550 --> 00:43:22,250
I, the dorm leader of Dorm 3, challenged you, better than basketball

850
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,580
Ai

851
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:36,400
Are you done? Hurry up and leave.

852
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,200
Hold on.

853
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:52,880
What kind of person is called Ai?

854
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,250
You can't even take care of yourself.

855
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,550
Doesn't this bruise hurt?

856
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,750
Can you lend me 400 houses?

857
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:01,500
What is it?

858
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,640
Pay back your debts.

859
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,430
But if you don't need money to pay it back, you have to use something else.

860
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,630
Where can I find it and give it back to you?

861
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:10,880
You like Ai.

862
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,480
I like Ai.
