1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:01,690
Does it have to be so troublesome for us to date?

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:02,920
Don't think it's troublesome.

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:05,670
This is what it feels like before it's made public.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,170
People all over the university say that

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,520
Senior Songkhram and Senior Ai have been in love with Ai

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,420
since they were freshmen.

7
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,370
Don't you know?

8
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:11,840
Then.

9
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,040
Let's help them. Don't work so hard. How about acting?

10
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:26,840
Good morning. You're awake.

11
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,140
Good morning.

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,590
Am I dreaming?

13
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,920
If I can have such a beautiful dream,

14
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,370
I beg you not to wake up.

15
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:56,590
What a good talker.

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,770
Let's go brush our teeth.

17
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:05,690
Hurry up.

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,390
Still sleeping?

19
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:08,490
Let's go.

20
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,770
Come on

21
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,940
What are you doing?

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:20,620
I'll carry you.

23
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:22,590
If I had told you earlier,

24
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,320
would it have fallen?

25
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,920
I won't.

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,370
Hold it well

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:27,670
and carry it well.

28
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,990
I should have known I was so happy with you.

29
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,890
I've asked you to be my boyfriend.

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,670
From now on,

31
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,770
you have no right to break my heart.

32
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,640
You've run out of qualifications.

33
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,740
[ Love Diary January-June ] What are you

34
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,270
doing?

35
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,590
Nothing.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,520
I want to hold you like this every day.

37
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,270
What's wrong with you?

38
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,940
Don't move.

39
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,440
Just hug for 5 minutes.

40
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,840
You can't even do this at school.

41
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,870
Is five minutes enough?

42
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,940
I can hug you all day.

43
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:51,390
From hugging to kissing, it's not impossible.

44
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,690
I can't walk anymore.

45
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:56,040
When I saw Nucleus pinching your face the other day,

46
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,270
I wanted to pinch your face too,

47
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:02,940
The air conditioner in Amber's lecture hall is so cold,

48
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,290
I really want to go and hug you,

49
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,090
I want to kiss you and warm you up.

50
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,790
Do you dare?

51
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,740
Don't be shy.

52
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,140
I dare.

53
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,870
You're the one who dares not.

54
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,020
Okay,

55
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,240
let's make an official announcement.

56
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,090
Amber was shocked

57
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,540
by the public hug.

58
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,420
I really want to bite you.

59
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,320
That's enough. It itches.

60
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,790
Give it back to me.

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,620
Let me have a look.

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,620
Give it to me.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,670
Wait, let me have a look.

64
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,470
Don't... -Let me see what

65
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,820
it says. What's it?

66
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,990
I'll be shy.

67
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,070
Anyway, you've written that you want to do something together.

68
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,340
Right?

69
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,720
Let's start with this.

70
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,020
Watch the TV series together and fall asleep together-Honey 2.

71
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:10,970
Set a common password together.

72
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,170
Honey, stop reading.

73
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,340
Go deep diving together

74
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,520
and see corals together.

75
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:21,770
Drink water with the same straw-Dear

76
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,490
5 Eat the same ice cream together ~

77
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,570
Did you eat it in the car that day?

78
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,320
I see.

79
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,040
Stop studying

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:34,420
and be backpackers together,

81
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:35,820
Where do you want to go?

82
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:40,190
Lying at sea and watching the stars together,

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,440
where do you want to go?

84
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,540
I don't want to go anywhere.

85
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:47,620
Go to the park for a picnic together.

86
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,220
Stop reading. I'm shy. I'm hungry

87
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,790
when it comes to picnics.

88
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,370
Don't grab it. Wait a minute. The diary will be crumpled.

89
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:55,920
Be careful to tear it off.

90
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,220
We've been fighting for it all day.

91
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,440
Lying down and enjoying cherry blossoms together,

92
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,640
you want to do everything.

93
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,720
Wash your hair together and then wipe each other's bodies,

94
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,520
dear, that's enough. I'm shy.

95
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,140
Wash your hair together and wipe each other's bodies.

96
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,290
I won't wipe it.

97
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:12,520
Honey,

98
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,090
I'll add one more,

99
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,070
11-This is my diary. It's the first time we've

100
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:24,370
brewed sauce together.

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,320
You wrote this diary?

102
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,290
Isn't it just to do something together?

103
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,940
But this is my personal matter... -What is it?

104
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,570
They are all men.

105
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,170
There's nothing to be shy about.

106
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,290
I'm not shy.

107
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:56,290
I'm not shy.

108
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,140
When is the best time to do it?

109
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,220
When you become a pilot,

110
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,670
honey,

111
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,040
You're so cruel.

112
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,670
Those who are cruel

113
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,990
will be punished.

114
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:22,520
Okay, I'll send you a PowerPoint later.

115
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,490
Thank you for today's class.

116
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,070
Thank you, mentor.

117
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,870
Ai, we're going to play together with the people in dormitory

118
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,590
5 this Saturday. They're having a great time.

119
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,520
I'll practice with you in your dorm this morning.

120
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,440
I'm busy this Saturday.

121
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,690
How could you do this?

122
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,620
I've already made an appointment with my teammates.

123
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:44,220
You made an appointment. Go and play it yourself.

124
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,940
That's even worse.

125
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,040
Because I have to go to your dorm to practice in advance,

126
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,820
okay?

127
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,970
Just practice for three or four rounds, okay?

128
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,840
I don't have time.

129
00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,540
I'm not available in the morning. How about this afternoon?

130
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,570
I told them to postpone it.

131
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,740
No way.

132
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:01,670
Whether it's morning or afternoon or this Saturday,

133
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,470
you can invite someone else.

134
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:06,620
Please, my dear friend.

135
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,220
Just play with me.

136
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,490
One round is fine.

137
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:11,370
No.

138
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,840
Look at my mouth shape.

139
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't have time.

140
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,970
What do you mean?

141
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,720
Where are you going?

142
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,090
Are you going home?

143
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,190
Yes.

144
00:07:24,690 --> 00:07:25,990
I'm going shopping

145
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,340
with my mom. I've promised her.

146
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:29,520
Unfortunately,

147
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,290
you can't stand me up next time.

148
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,670
Got it.

149
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,370
Goodbye.

150
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:37,370
Okay. Be careful when you go home.

151
00:07:41,890 --> 00:07:43,770
Hey, Bright. Follow the plan.

152
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,040
Songkhram, don't forget to visit the kids this Saturday.

153
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,240
What's up this Saturday?

154
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,120
I forgot to update the news.

155
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,490
It's about selecting UIT players to participate in the inter-school sports competition,

156
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,840
which is handled by Dormitory 2.

157
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,370
Starting this Saturday,

158
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,020
I'll go! I can't.

159
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:04,890
I'm not free this Saturday.

160
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:06,090
I can't do that.

161
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,820
You're the dorm manager?

162
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,820
This is your duty.

163
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,540
Take a look at it for me.

164
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,770
I really don't have time to take a holiday

165
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:15,190
this Saturday. Where are you going?

166
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,970
Now you don't call me anywhere you go.

167
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,270
I'm in a hurry.

168
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,120
If it's Sunday, I'm free,

169
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,420
but I'm really not free on Saturday, Lao Tie,

170
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,970
What urgent matter?

171
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:30,490
It's important enough for you to give up such an important event

172
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,240
as selecting athletes, bro. I believe you.

173
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,190
Please.

174
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,540
I'm going to take a shower.

175
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,790
Hello, Meen.

176
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,870
Ai

177
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:51,620
Are you free this Saturday?

178
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,770
Go shopping with me.

179
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,520
Manow is busy.

180
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,070
Bright, what other athletes are you going to pick?

181
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,390
Go with me. Ai,

182
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,490
I'm not free this Saturday.

183
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,390
If you don't have time, I won't have anyone to go with you.

184
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,020
Why are there so many things this Saturday? -What did you say?

185
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,370
Nothing.

186
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:10,670
You look good no matter how you dress up.

187
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,940
Trust me,

188
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,790
you're handsome.

189
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,220
Okay,

190
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,870
I'm sorry,

191
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:18,690
I'll make it up to you another day.

192
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,890
I really have something urgent to do this Saturday.

193
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,690
Urgent matter,

194
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:22,240
Yes.

195
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,590
Oh, something urgent?

196
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,320
Yes, something important?

197
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,220
Okay, I'll go alone.

198
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,820
I'll get going then.

199
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:32,720
I'm going to take a shower. -Mm-hmm.

200
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,170
-Goodbye. -Goodbye.

201
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,190
Hello, Plug.

202
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:45,020
Senior Songkhram.

203
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,690
Are you free this Saturday?

204
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,020
Drink with me.

205
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,670
Is there something wrong with you guys on Saturday?

206
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:54,040
Bright just asked me to go to work.

207
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,920
I don't have time. Give it back to me.

208
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,320
Get out of the way!

209
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,590
Senior, what do you mean?

210
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,470
Drink with me.

211
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,270
I haven't had a drink with you for a long time.

212
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,520
What are you doing?

213
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:07,470
I'm not free this Saturday.

214
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,040
I'll drink it another day.

215
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,440
What are you doing?

216
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,270
Senior Songkhram is busy.

217
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,890
Then it's boring.

218
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,070
Looks like I'm going to find something more interesting to do than drinking.

219
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,970
No~。

220
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,990
Senior Ai,

221
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,540
No

222
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,540
Still up?

223
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,090
I have something to tell you.

224
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:42,120
Jerk, let go of your ass!

225
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,370
Ai,

226
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,790
what is Songkhram doing recently?

227
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:48,720
He's always busy.

228
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,820
I don't know.

229
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,270
Why are you asking me?

230
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,940
People are saying that

231
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:57,320
senior Songkhram has been acting weird lately,

232
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,190
He won't go anywhere he's invited.

233
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,840
Bright invited him to pick athletes on Saturday.

234
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,140
He's not free either.

235
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,470
Pluster invited him to drink and he didn't go.

236
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,820
Where is he going all day and night?

237
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,940
I don't know.

238
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,770
Where he's going is his business.

239
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,570
Why are you asking me?

240
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,970
You're too lenient.

241
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,540
I heard that you and Senior Songkhram have been on good terms recently,

242
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:22,890
often going in and out together,

243
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,690
I thought you knew it.

244
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,670
Could it be that

245
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,770
Senior Songkhram is seeing someone?

246
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,640
How could someone like Songkhram have a girlfriend?

247
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,670
Why is he interested in dating every day?

248
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,820
Anyone who is his partner will be in bad luck for eight lifetimes.

249
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,790
Maybe.

250
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,420
It's from around here.

251
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,470
What do you know?

252
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,370
No.

253
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:56,240
I was just guessing.

254
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm going to bed now. Good night.

255
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:15,320
Hello, darling.

256
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:18,770
You look shy in a couple's outfit.

257
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,770
You're shy.

258
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:21,970
Take it off if you're shy.

259
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,990
Being shy doesn't mean it's not good.

260
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:28,020
Where do you want to take photos today?

261
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,420
Every place

262
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:31,620
is so exaggerated.

263
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:34,720
Well, I want to have a lot of photos with you.

264
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,770
I didn't even take a group photo when I went to the amusement park last time.

265
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,320
Who fainted the entertainment facilities last time?

266
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,670
Who forced me?

267
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,670
I didn't force you.

268
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,220
Let's go and take pictures.

269
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,840
Come here and take pictures.

270
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:53,870
Come on.

271
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,170
One, two,

272
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,740
three-a little closer,

273
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,920
1 2 3，1

274
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:02,040
2 3，

275
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,290
No need to shrink.

276
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,440
1 2 3，1

277
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,390
2，

278
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,190
What's wrong?

279
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,590
Just take a picture.

280
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,640
Come on. -Do you want to play?

281
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,890
One, two, three,

282
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,490
lean over

283
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:20,190
at this angle.

284
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:22,290
12. That's

285
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:25,990
enough.

286
00:13:26,190 --> 00:13:27,740
Yes. -Yes.

287
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,590
Let's go play then.

288
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:29,770
I'm not playing anymore.

289
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,870
Ai

290
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,720
Smile.

291
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,040
Smile a little bigger,

292
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:39,490
honey. You look like a monkey.

293
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,740
This photo is cute.

294
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,120
Let me see.

295
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,040
I'll go to the toilet first. Wait here.

296
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,840
Do you want me to go in and help you?

297
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,890
Icy Fukui,

298
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,020
I'll wait for you here.

299
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,390
Shit,

300
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,020
Touch, why are you here?

301
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,570
Didn't you say you were going to buy something for your mom?

302
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,940
Are you here to buy something?

303
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,820
Where's your mom? Take me to say hi.

304
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,470
I went to buy it early in the morning.

305
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,570
Keep coming here.

306
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:21,740
What time is it in the morning?

307
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,290
It's only 10 o'clock.

308
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:25,590
Did you go shopping with your mom at three in the morning?

309
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,790
Who did you come with?

310
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:32,220
Are you here alone?

311
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,520
What do you mean by the pattern on your clothes?

312
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,170
He seems to have sold himself out.

313
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,920
I came here alone.

314
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,190
I'll get going.

315
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,370
It's urgent. I'll see

316
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:44,570
Ai at school.

317
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:48,370
I came here alone. Wait for me.

318
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,340
Ai

319
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,570
~ Where are you in a hurry? What's wrong?

320
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,840
I met Touch in the toilet.

321
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,240
Huh? -Let's go!

322
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,420
I haven't run 4X100 meters for a long time.

323
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,020
I'm exhausted.

324
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,770
Do you want to run again?

325
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:13,970
I, the head of Dorm 2, will take you away,

326
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,670
and I have a boyfriend who is the head of the sports dorm,

327
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,440
How shameful it is to be panting like this.

328
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:20,120
I can hardly breathe with such a bad breath.

329
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,320
Sit down.

330
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,720
I'll get you some water.

331
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,440
Come back soon.

332
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,890
Two bottles of water.

333
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,070
Okay,

334
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,070
Alipay

335
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,690
Oh, hi Lao Tie,

336
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:40,070
Didn't you say you weren't free?

337
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:41,220
What are you doing here,

338
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,120
Bright? You said you weren't free,

339
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,870
So I postponed the selection of athletes.

340
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,620
I want to play too.

341
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
Oh Who are you here with?

342
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,290
I came here alone.

343
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:51,940
You can come alone, right?

344
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:53,240
Yes, I came here alone.

345
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,290
You came here alone and I came here alone.

346
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,120
Do you want to ride a bike with me?

347
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,920
-Where are you going? -Hurry up. What do you mean by

348
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,390
the pattern on your clothes?

349
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,270
It's like you have a date.

350
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:05,840
Mind your own business.

351
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,590
I'm leaving.

352
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,020
Don't you want the water?

353
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:16,070
Where's the water?

354
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:17,170
I met Bright.

355
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,440
Bright is also here.

356
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,440
Yeah, I'm home by chance.

357
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,770
Touch and Bright,

358
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:24,640
why don't we go to the old cafe for coffee?

359
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:27,720
Well, I hope I won't meet anyone else.

360
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,790
Let's go.

361
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,590
Hello What can I get you?

362
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:34,420
Hi,

363
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,140
I'd like a iced Americano with less sugar.

364
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,940
Ice Americano with less sugar,

365
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:41,290
a cup of cold chocolate without heat,

366
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:43,740
A cup of cold chocolate,

367
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,420
please wait a moment.

368
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,740
An iced matcha latte without spice or syrup is ready.

369
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,620
Hi, Ai.

370
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,270
Hi,

371
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:54,620
Aren't you busy today?

372
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,120
You're here too?

373
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,940
Yes, Bright and I are here.

374
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,090
He's riding a bike over there,

375
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,820
so I came here to buy drinks and wait for him.

376
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,790
Who did you come with?

377
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,690
I came here alone.

378
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,240
I'll go back now.

379
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,320
There's something else to do next.

380
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:15,820
Ice Americano with less sugar and cold chocolate without heat.

381
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,390
I almost forgot

382
00:17:17,390 --> 00:17:19,770
to have two cups of coffee alone?

383
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,520
Yeah, I'm panicking.

384
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,540
Much better.

385
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,440
I'm leaving.

386
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,420
Goodbye.

387
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,870
Am I here to play or to avoid getting caught?

388
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm exhausted.

389
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:53,920
-Have a seat. -Yes. We're home by

390
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,320
chance.

391
00:17:57,570 --> 00:17:58,520
Give it to me.

392
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,040
Did you meet anyone?

393
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,020
I hope we won't meet again.

394
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,340
I hope so.

395
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,520
There's a clothing store over there.

396
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,190
What are you up to?

397
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,070
Let's go.

398
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,570
Wait for me.

399
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,790
Let's go.

400
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:29,570
I'm ready.

401
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,770
Come on,

402
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,020
Watch out!

403
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,720
Take a look at the photos first.

404
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,590
Let's take a picture.

405
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,220
Aren't you going to watch it?

406
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,220
I don't want to see it anymore.

407
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:55,020
-Pose for

408
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,540
a kiss. -Okay.

409
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:00,920
OK。

410
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,970
What about

411
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:08,970
Plug and Nano?

412
00:19:08,990 --> 00:19:10,770
Surprise or not surprise.

413
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,640
Couple outfit?

414
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
Young boy,

415
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,690
dear friend,

416
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,970
Do you have anything to argue about?

417
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:17,040
The two dorm leaders

418
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,440
came to play and didn't invite us.

419
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,720
It's not what you think.

420
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,140
You have the right to remain silent.

421
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:27,090
But everything you say will be used as evidence in court.

422
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,540
Let them talk.

423
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,970
I was caught red-handed.

424
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,770
You have to confess and be lenient.

425
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,120
I finally made it through.

426
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,420
I've been waiting for almost four years.

427
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:37,540
Congratulations.

428
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,190
Don't look overwhelmed.

429
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,620
We've known it for a long time.

430
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,170
It's so funny to play with you.

431
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,620
Is Songkhram seeing someone?

432
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,840
We've noticed it for a long time.

433
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,390
Senior Ai, you're quite in love.

434
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,720
When did you know that?

435
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,390
It's so obvious.

436
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,440
That's enough.

437
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,190
The head of our dorm can't even scold me anymore,

438
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:02,490
and I'm at a loss.

439
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,470
It's good for you two to be together.

440
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:06,770
You don't have to argue anymore.

441
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:09,740
I heard Ai complain so much that I can even recite your words now.

442
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,670
Touch, I'll hit you.

443
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,890
Now that you all know it,

444
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:16,140
I'll announce it here.

445
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:18,620
I, Songkhram, the head of dormitory 2,

446
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,190
and I, the head of dormitory 3, Ai,

447
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,870
We were together for 2 months and 8 days,

448
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,270
32 minutes and 48 seconds.

449
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,940
Yeah, we're a couple.

450
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,290
So sweet.

451
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,470
You're all in pairs,

452
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,570
and I'm the only single dog left?

453
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,090
The sour smell of love.

454
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,970
Hello, young people of the new generation,

455
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:03,440
you are the hope of the world.

456
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,020
You must have suffered a lot today.

457
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:08,920
Trust me,

458
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,870
every pain you've suffered is meaningful.

459
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,270
If you want to know how excited you are today,

460
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,890
I will answer you.

461
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,920
The judges who gave you financial support.

462
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,740
I'm also very excited.

463
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:25,920
From this moment on,

464
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:29,470
your inspiration is changing certain things

465
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,590
and your thoughts are changing certain people,

466
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:36,490
Your work is changing your life.

467
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,870
Let's get started.

468
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:42,170
Tomorrow's world begins today.

469
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,190
Hello, everyone. Do you know

470
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:51,690
how popular turtle-backed bamboo rings are?

471
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,840
The tortoise back bamboo trade is going on all over the world now,

472
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,090
with an annual increase of hundreds of millions of dollars.

473
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:04,420
The price of this tortoise-backed bamboo is 1. 5 million baht.

474
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:09,790
The price of this spotted tortoise back bamboo is 359 baht.

475
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,970
The size is the same except that the leaves are spotted,

476
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:17,240
but the price is 4179 times higher.

477
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,920
That's right.

478
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,040
So,

479
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,770
If we can come up with a way to change the genes of the tortoise back bamboo,

480
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:27,040
we'll have to create huge wealth.

481
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:32,640
Now there are plant lights in the market that imitate light,

482
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,790
but we've created Magic Light with pink light and orange light,

483
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,370
It's different from the plant lamps on the market.

484
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:40,020
If ordinary plant lights are "deceiving" plants,

485
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,840
then our Magic Light will "deceive" plants on a genetic level.

486
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,390
Magic Light's pink and orange light...

487
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,420
mimics radiation,

488
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:50,870
Let different frequencies of light enter the core of the plant.

489
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:53,620
It causes mutation in the core of the plant.

490
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,590
So we can use this method,

491
00:22:55,590 --> 00:22:58,920
to create different genes of tortoise back bamboo,

492
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,890
Including designing our favorite spots according to our preferences.

493
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,220
So we think,

494
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,540
if we can get the financial support for our work,

495
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,890
I'm sure this business will grow and develop.

496
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,540
So, how long is the circulation life of tortoise-backed bamboo?

497
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:18,390
Since it is difficult for plants to persuade them to get in and out,

498
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,790
as long as there is still ground left in the house,

499
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,890
As well as those who like plants,

500
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,720
turtle-backed bamboo rings will never decline.

501
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:26,870
Most importantly,

502
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:30,470
the price will also rise with the development.

503
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:33,040
Are you selling lamps or plants?

504
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,540
Selling lamps,

505
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,420
if you're selling lamps,

506
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,590
It means anyone can plant tortoise-back bamboo.

507
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,920
If everyone can plant tortoise back bamboo,

508
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,520
what will happen to the price?

509
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:46,020
You simply think about it,

510
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:48,770
the price of gold is going up all the time today,

511
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,220
If every family forges gold,

512
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,870
what will its price be?

513
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,820
If your lamps are really good,

514
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:56,920
they will only sell well for a while.

515
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,140
Everything will change after that.

516
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:01,390
The price of the genetically modified tortoise back bamboo you mentioned will also drop.

517
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,490
When it comes down to the price that people prefer to grow naturally,

518
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,570
the price of natural-growing bamboo will gradually increase.

519
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,690
Your business will decline

520
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,240
when it rises to a price that you can't imagine.

521
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,840
Until I can't run it anymore.

522
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,640
But if you sell plants,

523
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:16,990
if you plant less,

524
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:19,670
Your business of genetically modified tortoise back bamboo

525
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:21,520
won't go far.

526
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,990
Similarly,

527
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:24,570
if you plant more,

528
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:28,770
There will be an oversupply of your genetically modified tortoise-backed bamboo

529
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,240
and its circulation will be much higher. The price will naturally drop.

530
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,170
In the end, people will go back to the natural growth of tortoise back bamboo, and in the end, the price of your genetically modified tortoise back bamboo will be the same as that of plastic

531
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:38,640
plants.

532
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:43,370
But there are still people who buy plastic plants.

533
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,540
There are clients like that.

534
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,340
But the market is not big,

535
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,470
and it is not worth investing 10million at all.

536
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,490
But I believe this lantern will sell well.

537
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:54,970
It won't fall in price like gold.

538
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,020
In today's society, every household can make their own drinking water,

539
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,290
but some people still buy bottled drinking water.

540
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:02,120
The price of drinking water has not declined.

541
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,820
And the price is increasing day by day.

542
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:06,520
The two can't be compared at all.

543
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:09,470
Drinking water is a necessity,

544
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,940
but potted plants

545
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,390
are not your starting point. Wrong.

546
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,870
Business will go downhill.

547
00:25:13,870 --> 00:25:15,470
Technical project,

548
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,890
lamps or plants?

549
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,120
Even if it's 10 million yuan,

550
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,440
you still can't go far?

551
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,870
So cruel.

552
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:28,190
Let's welcome the next group.

553
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,740
Hello, everyone,

554
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:43,920
our planet and even human society,

555
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,690
Nature has given humans two genders,

556
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,120
male and female.

557
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:52,220
But there is no denying that

558
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,890
the flow of sex,

559
00:25:53,890 --> 00:25:57,070
So that human society is no longer limited to two genders,

560
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,420
usually the hemoglobin in our body

561
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:04,570
One hemoglobin molecule consists of four heme...

562
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,720
and four polypeptide chains.

563
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:09,320
According to the results of AHI research,

564
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:12,790
the Russian Anti-Homosexuality Institute.

565
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,690
A total of 969 cases were selected

566
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,390
and it was found that homosexual people

567
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:22,840
contained polypeptide chains called β.

568
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:25,470
It's abnormal or mutated.

569
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,190
I don't know... Does anyone

570
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,670
like the same sex in this classroom?

571
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,140
Someone will admit it.

572
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,640
How are we going to find out who's gay?

573
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,320
Then we'll need this machine.

574
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,020
The faggot detector,

575
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,590
this faggot detector,

576
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,340
As long as we dissolve the blood into the instruments

577
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,240
developed by our team through special technology,

578
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:50,990
It's used to detect hemoglobin,

579
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,520
and through the analysis of the instrument,

580
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,270
If an abnormal or mutated polypeptide chain is detected,

581
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,070
it means that the person is gay.

582
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:00,640
She definitely likes the same sex.

583
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:04,020
I can't see the benefits and advantages of this idea at all.

584
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,890
I think it's very beneficial.

585
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,220
Because in today's society,

586
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,520
there are a lot of LGBT groups

587
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,940
hidden in society.

588
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,720
I've met someone but I don't know him,

589
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,970
and I don't know his sexual orientation when I know him.

590
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,690
Probably no one wants their son or daughter

591
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,020
to marry a gay man who doesn't accept his sexual orientation.

592
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,270
Am I right?

593
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,770
I guess

594
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,540
there should be someone in this classroom,

595
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,490
It can make our team's work more convincing.

596
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,470
I want to invite a representative to do an experiment with me.

597
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,370
Did you?

598
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,340
Let's welcome,

599
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:42,890
Mr. Songkhram, the head of Dormitory 2,

600
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,840
Let's see how I'll deal with him.

601
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,490
Don't go up there.

602
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:52,240
It's also a trouble

603
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,440
going up there. Don't worry.

604
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:05,520
Ai, what do you think Ohm wants?

605
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,490
I don't know.

606
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:11,370
If Songkhram can't help but hit Ohm,

607
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,470
we're screwed today.

608
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,440
Songkhram

609
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,040
is so cool.

610
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:21,590
Let's wait and see if he'll be cool later.

611
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:46,240
This is the faggot detector produced by our team.

612
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,620
Change it.

613
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,290
What do you mean?

614
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,170
Is it true or not?

615
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,540
Give me the armbands.

616
00:29:16,570 --> 00:29:18,240
Do you want to test yourself?

617
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:25,420
Before testing other people's sexual characteristics,

618
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:28,220
do you want to test your own psychology as a human being?

619
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,170
Treat people equally first,

620
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:34,440
then you'll have the brains to come up with more ideas.

621
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,390
It's nothing.

622
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,770
You're so cool, Songkhram,

623
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,840
a biased idea,

624
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,740
There should be such a brainless ending.

625
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:59,040
Loser,

626
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:02,170
don't forget that this promotion meeting

627
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,890
corresponds to the project funding.

628
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:07,790
New inventions won't live long. Let's welcome

629
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,520
the next group.

630
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,520
123 Come on.

631
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,070
Hello, everyone.

632
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,870
Unbelievable.

633
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:36,670
Our world has developed into a virtual world,

634
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,590
and because of the growing global economy,

635
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,620
World trade also seems to be growing.

636
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:43,770
But it is undeniable that

637
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:45,620
we are still breathing on this earth,

638
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,390
If pure water was still free a hundred years ago,

639
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,940
probably no one would have thought,

640
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,020
One day,

641
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,170
pure water will no longer be free,

642
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,720
When the water resources in nature are not clean enough for people to drink,

643
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,590
cleaner bottled water came into being.

644
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:03,490
And the air is the same.

645
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:06,690
PM2. 5 global problems.

646
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,620
Lung problems occur every day.

647
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:14,440
In today's society, sanitary masks have become an important tool for survival.

648
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:20,270
It would be nice to have a smart mask that can breathe freely.

649
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,390
[ Pure

650
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:24,690
Air ] Pure air,

651
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:28,740
It can breathe fresh air.

652
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:33,420
Our team invented an air capsule using nanotechnology,

653
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,220
which is stylish,

654
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,990
Through the operation of the smart microchip,

655
00:31:37,990 --> 00:31:43,540
the air in the pure air capsule is transferred to the container of the pure air mask.

656
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:47,090
The smart microchip can also convert the carbon dioxide exhaled

657
00:31:47,090 --> 00:31:51,420
by the user... into pure air and circulate it into the container of the air mask.

658
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,620
From the oxygen content in the air capsule,

659
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,990
plus the oxygen content converted from carbon dioxide,

660
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:59,340
One capsule should be used for no less than 12 hours.

661
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,390
I'm sure,

662
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,670
our oxygen mask allows you

663
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:05,770
to breathe fresh air freely.

664
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,490
It also allows you to protect your nose.

665
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,670
And the lungs are protected from dust and all kinds of pollution.

666
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:13,320
Even PM2. 5.

667
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,890
Our material is nano-technology plastic,

668
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,970
so our air mask is only 180 grams.

669
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,940
It is light, not heavy,

670
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,040
easy to wear,

671
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:26,640
Plus only 40 grams of air capsules.

672
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,920
That's all I need.

673
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:31,420
You can breathe pure, fresh and safe air.

674
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,670
and live a better life.

675
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,870
Our selling points are more than that.

676
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,770
We have 4 models of pure air masks to choose from,

677
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,890
Air from Mae Mo,

678
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,270
The air from Khao Yai,

679
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,470
the air from Lipe,

680
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,790
The air from Mount Inthanon,

681
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,170
in the future planning,

682
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,190
We will also have air from Mount Fuji,

683
00:32:48,190 --> 00:32:49,540
air from the Maldives Islands,

684
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,790
and air from many other places.

685
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,870
How much is your budget for pure air masks and air capsules?

686
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,970
The budget for each air mask will not exceed 30 thousand baht.

687
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:03,920
The budget for each air storage tank will not exceed 200 baht.

688
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,370
The budget for the air capsule is 6thousand baht per month.

689
00:33:06,370 --> 00:33:08,170
Only for outdoor use,

690
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:11,420
if our products are developed and promoted,

691
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,840
If we get financial sponsorship,

692
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,220
Pure Air will become a cheap and promising business.

693
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:17,670
At the same time, it will become more perfect.

694
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:23,270
I think the Pure Air Mask is easy and portable,

695
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:28,140
and one day you can easily buy it at any convenience store.

696
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:32,970
I'm not sure if the pure air you're talking about can satisfy everyone.

697
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:36,970
So that everyone can breathe pure air.

698
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:39,190
We will do everything we can to make it happen.

699
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,890
So that everyone can breathe the fresh air from all over the world,

700
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:44,840
we will build air purification plants,

701
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,390
future

702
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:51,770
Pure air will become scarcer and scarcer.

703
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:55,970
But pure air is what every living thing deserves.

704
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,790
They are needed by humans, animals, or plants.

705
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:00,040
Now

706
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,690
it's time for us to breathe fresh air again.

707
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,670
Take a break. -Yes.

708
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,370
Two-hour break,

709
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,420
please.

710
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,170
Is this the end of our relationship?

711
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:43,370
That's right.

712
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,340
Why didn't you ask questions or summarize them?

713
00:34:46,990 --> 00:34:48,090
I don't know what's going on.

714
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:50,470
Maybe we can sum it up together at the end.

715
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,470
Hello, everyone. Nowadays,

716
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:55,890
the skin care market is booming,

717
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,520
Do you know why?

718
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,040
Because everyone wants to be beautiful and beautiful,

719
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,970
it's annoying.

720
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:07,620
You need to apply a lot of skin care products every morning and before going to bed,

721
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,890
but if you want to be beautiful,

722
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,290
you still need to apply something. The public said we all want to look for it and try it.

723
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,070
Sometimes I put so much on it.

724
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,690
I want to just bask in the sun.

725
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,240
I really like this team.

726
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,470
Today we're going to show you edible essence,

727
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:23,220
Eat to skin care essence,

728
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,790
Don't worry, you'll still be beautiful in the sun.

729
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:27,590
Very, very beautiful.

730
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,990
From the weather agency and smog pm2. 5,

731
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,620
just like the previous group did the report,

732
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,040
Our team also saw this problem.

733
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,970
That's why we came up with Fresh Air Fresh Mask

734
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,870
and introduced it to you.

735
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,670
Why is his report so similar to ours?

736
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,590
That's right.

737
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:46,620
There are a lot of filter masks on the market now,

738
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:51,270
but Fresh Air is as light and thin as if I wasn't wearing them,

739
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,720
The more important thing is that he comes with his own air filter,

740
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,520
no need for a gas tank,

741
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:58,990
This original intention is similar to Elon Musk's Tesla.

742
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,370
Several groups performed well today,

743
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,390
while others didn't perform well enough.

744
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,390
Anyway,

745
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,390
I have the conclusion now.

746
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,540
Three groups can get a bonus of 10 million baht.

747
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,540
You can use it to make your project a reality.

748
00:36:28,990 --> 00:36:31,070
The winner of the first group is.

749
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:45,540
The winner of the last group is.

750
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,020
The scores are the same,

751
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,970
then Pure Air Group and Fresh Air Group.

752
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,320
What if I go?

753
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:06,820
The results of the two groups were very similar.

754
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,040
The investor has decided to let you two go back.

755
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:17,740
And continue to improve your creativity.

756
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:20,840
Then I'll give it to you next week for the presentation.

757
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,690
One of them will receive a 10 million bonus.

758
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:28,040
To develop your own project and turn it into reality,

759
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:31,620
that's all for today.

760
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,740
Congratulations to the winner today.

761
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:36,240
Goodbye.

762
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,590
Are you tired, darling?

763
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,840
Let me press it for you.

764
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,840
Yeah, so cute.

765
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:57,090
How's my lover?

766
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:59,540
It's okay. Is there a reward

767
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,470
for massaging you so hard?

768
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:10,590
The reward is.

769
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,740
To help me with my work,

770
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:18,820
is there anything else besides work?

771
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,440
I'll tell you later.

772
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,740
Do you have spring?

773
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,040
I've never seen you like this before.

774
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:29,870
Where is the fierce Songkhram?

775
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:33,820
Who said I was fierce and gentle?

776
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:34,920
Right? Ai,

777
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:37,420
why are you asking me?

778
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:41,040
Don't be shy. We're all friends.

779
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:43,490
That's enough.

780
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,120
Do you still have to work today?

781
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:47,970
You haven't played coquetry with him for half a day.

782
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,540
Work,

783
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:55,340
Let's continue to look at these data.

784
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:03,240
I think they are so similar to ours.

785
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,040
Do you want to change it to something else?

786
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,520
Forget about the dust and start over.

787
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,640
No way.

788
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,070
Let's study pollution and dust.

789
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:13,490
We need to figure out what to do.

790
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:15,590
to jump out of the mask.

791
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,870
I think Bright is right.

792
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:22,640
Our problem now is that our report is similar to theirs,

793
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,620
so no matter what, it must be different from theirs.

794
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:29,820
You can throw away the old mask style.

795
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,740
But what can give us new inspiration?

796
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,290
What major do you study

797
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,920
in mechanics? Why did you ask?

798
00:39:47,990 --> 00:39:50,790
Yes, I see.

799
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:56,440
Let me think about the pollution in the car.

800
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,620
Now we all think that in the car,

801
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:04,640
we can isolate all kinds of pollution and dust,

802
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,870
Take off your mask when you get back to the car,

803
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:12,740
but in fact, the air in the car is outside air entering the car.

804
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,370
So,

805
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:18,620
all kinds of pollution and dust still exist in the cab.

806
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,070
But someone is selling it now.

807
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:25,940
For the air purifier in the car,

808
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:27,570
we don't need to be an air purifier.

809
00:40:27,570 --> 00:40:29,340
I think we can use the original idea.

810
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:33,990
We can make cans of fresh air, right?

811
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:39,440
The point that I take into account is that the car air circulates from the outside to the inside,

812
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,990
then from the inside to the outside,

813
00:40:40,990 --> 00:40:43,790
If we don't move the position,

814
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:46,040
the carbon dioxide in the car increases,

815
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:51,070
It makes us feel so tired that we die.

816
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:52,390
That is, if we put our creativity into practice in the car,

817
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,270
it would be so cool.

818
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:55,840
Yes.

819
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,440
Now our advantage is air capsule,

820
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,570
adding new technology can increase the air storage capacity.

821
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:10,340
Well, I thought of air recharging to reduce the waste discharge.

822
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,090
That's right.

823
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:14,540
Awesome social responsibility.

824
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,970
I think Amber will like this idea.

825
00:41:17,570 --> 00:41:22,020
Okay. Keep doing it.

826
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,670
Well, I'll add this in.

827
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,120
Everyone, it's 8 o'clock. Are you hungry?

828
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:58,570
Let's go find something to eat.

829
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,340
I'll go downstairs and ask if I have Hainan chicken rice for you.

830
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,570
I was already hungry in the evening.

831
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,240
I thought none of you were hungry.

832
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,570
Go find something to eat. -Let's go, Ai.

833
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:19,090
Don't forget to save your new ideas.

834
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,390
I've saved it.

835
00:42:28,590 --> 00:42:29,740
You should know.

836
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,840
Did mom leave food for me and my friends?

837
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:51,590
I'm sorry, kid. Business is so good today.

838
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:53,490
They're all sold out.

839
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,770
You know what? Let's eat out. Take the money.

840
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,220
It's okay. No need, Mom.

841
00:42:57,370 --> 00:42:59,370
We've disturbed mom a lot since we came here.

842
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:00,790
We'll deal with it ourselves later.

843
00:43:01,570 --> 00:43:02,320
Okay,

844
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,090
do you need anything, mom?

845
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:04,890
I'll bring it to you later.

846
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:06,740
It's okay, kid. Help yourself.

847
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:07,940
I'm leaving, Mom.

848
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,490
I'm leaving, Mom. -Okay.

849
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:20,220
Pull it over.

850
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,240
What should we eat?

851
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,120
Did you forget something? Hello, son.

852
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:36,940
What about Aunt

853
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,540
On? I want to win.

854
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,870
The last group to get 10 million is,

855
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,840
Mom,

856
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,140
Mom.

857
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,390
Thank you for cheering me on.

858
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,090
It gives me motivation to do everything.

859
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,040
Thanks for everything Songkhram,
