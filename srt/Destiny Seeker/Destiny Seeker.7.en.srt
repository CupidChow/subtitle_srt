1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,300
Get up and take care of the most naughty child.

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:06,550
Don't you want to start your own business like everyone else?

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,150
At least you can have the idea of a successful person like him.

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,850
What is your motivation?

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:15,700
I can't die yet.

6
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,770
If I haven't expressed my love to you.

7
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:33,750
I can't believe

8
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,200
she would do that to me.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,350
I'll give her whatever she wants.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,850
As long as she calls me,

11
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:44,950
no matter how late it is,

12
00:00:45,350 --> 00:00:47,420
I will go to find her without stopping.

13
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,720
I've never complained about anything.

14
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,500
She said she wanted to date secretly so that no one would know about it.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,220
I agree too.

16
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,470
I love her so much,

17
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,100
and I've done so much for her.

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,050
Why?

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,800
Why? Meen,

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,970
Bright, you did your best.

21
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:15,520
Since she doesn't see your value,

22
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,150
you don't have to care about her anymore.

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,200
Bright, you still have me.

24
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,750
You still have me.

25
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,520
Why?

26
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:29,700
Why?

27
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,350
Bright,

28
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,820
where are you going? Keep drinking.

29
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:48,800
Get up first.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,100
Get up

31
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,820
Slow down. Slow down.

32
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,020
Lie down.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,000
Come on.

34
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:22,700
I don't want to see you cry for that girl.

35
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,220
That would make me sad.

36
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,800
You are so punctual every day.

37
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,800
What are you doing in front of my dorm building?

38
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,970
Come and water the trees.

39
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,570
The trees born in Dormitory 3 are so pitiful.

40
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,700
Look at them.

41
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,950
Nobody cares.

42
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,450
The leaves are getting worms.

43
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:10,150
The leaves are withered.

44
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,220
Look,

45
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,770
the soil is so dry that the trees are dying.

46
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,870
Got it.

47
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,350
Thank you.

48
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,270
But if you don't have to,

49
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,420
go back to your dorm.

50
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,750
Be careful to be seen by the kids in my dorm.

51
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,400
Wait a minute. I haven't finished pouring it yet.

52
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,570
I told you not to.

53
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:26,470
I'll take care of the rest.

54
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:29,870
Let's go.

55
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,120
The tree has worms and can't wait.

56
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,520
Think of the quickest and easiest way,

57
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,520
spray it with vinegar,

58
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,820
Let me help you.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,920
You can leave.

60
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Don't you have classes in the morning?

61
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,450
Be careful not to be late.

62
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,050
I said no.

63
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,300
I'll take care of it.

64
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,950
You went back to the dorm?

65
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:47,850
-Let's go. -Bye.

66
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:48,850
Get out of here!

67
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:49,520
Let's go.

68
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,170
Wait a minute.

69
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,020
What are you doing now?

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,050
My watering can,

71
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,820
Take it

72
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,100
You're sweating after standing there for a while.

73
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:04,750
You need to exercise properly. Ai.

74
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,420
Don't touch me!

75
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,620
Your hands are dirty.

76
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,420
I don't want to get my face dirty.

77
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,570
It's not dirty yet.

78
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,570
You're still as cute as before.

79
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,100
Let's go back to your dorm.

80
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,250
Get out of here!

81
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,000
What do you think?

82
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,250
We're not even halfway through the first video yet,

83
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,570
are there

84
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,700
two more videos left?

85
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,070
It's killing me.

86
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,470
Who asked you to choose such a difficult topic?

87
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,400
For the future car,

88
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,650
God,

89
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,370
it's so hard to refer to the video.

90
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,900
It's all German,

91
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:29,920
so,

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,350
Did you knock on my dorm door to throw stones at me?

93
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:33,900
No,

94
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,050
someone asked me to give this to you.

95
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,950
Who gave it to you?

96
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,320
I don't know either.

97
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,650
I saw a kid from Dormitory 2,

98
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,050
sneaking around in front of our dorm,

99
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,620
So I went out to have a look,

100
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,120
and he gave this to me.

101
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,800
He said he would give it to Senior Ai.

102
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,050
Maybe Bright gave it to me.

103
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,920
-Thank you. -Have you finished

104
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,720
your homework?

105
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,100
Don't worry. I'll worry.

106
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,270
Just worry about yourself.

107
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,270
Let's go.

108
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,200
Yeah, thanks.

109
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,770
Songkhram?

110
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:40,320
I asked a professional translator to do subtitles

111
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,500
for you. Try it.

112
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:43,170
It might help.

113
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:43,920
Come on!

114
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,420
Songkhram。

115
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,400
You eat first.

116
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,020
Take a look at my things.

117
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,120
My stomach hurts.

118
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,100
Yes, go ahead.

119
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,470
Between Senior Songkhram and the food,

120
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,570
who will cook it first?

121
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,270
Try it.

122
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,070
It looks easy,

123
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,600
but it's hard to do.

124
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,850
When can I eat it? Songkhram,

125
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,970
how can your cooking be so easy to eat?

126
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,770
Even if I have diarrhea,

127
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,250
I'm willing to do it.

128
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,250
Plug,

129
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,520
this isn't yours.

130
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,970
Go to the canteen if you're hungry.

131
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,320
How could Songkhram do this to your junior?

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,420
He's kind enough to wait for a taste.

133
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,170
I thought you cooked it for us.

134
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,120
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

135
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,020
Yes.

136
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,120
Open it and have a look.

137
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,450
It doesn't look good,

138
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:23,200
but it tastes good.

139
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,550
What do you think?

140
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:46,700
-Be careful. -Yes, I

141
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,800
see there are a lot of trees in your dorm,

142
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,370
But pots are all of the same style,

143
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,900
with one pattern and one color,

144
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,850
Don't you feel tired of reading it?

145
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,320
Change the color once in a while.

146
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,650
That's what makes you look good.

147
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,070
I like everything in the same style,

148
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,300
the same style,

149
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,100
It looks nice and neat.

150
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:08,850
Take it.

151
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:11,550
Each tree is suitable to be planted in a different pot.

152
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,820
Some things are attractive because they are different,

153
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,250
and sometimes imperfection is the beauty of them.

154
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,800
The same goes for happiness.

155
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,170
Speaking of which,

156
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,070
are you practicing to be a live lecturer?

157
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,700
Give it a try.

158
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,000
Maybe you'll like it.

159
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,200
Do you like pots?

160
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,150
You like me?

161
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:34,400
Give me the paper.

162
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,320
Let go.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,570
Don't go too far.

164
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:40,770
Hurry up.

165
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,920
Let me help you.

166
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,450
Hello,

167
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,570
everyone. Nice to meet you, seniors.

168
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:01,070
I believe it's not easy to be

169
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,900
an engineering student at UIT University.

170
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:06,650
I'm glad you're still here today.

171
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,600
I won't say anything else.

172
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,570
Let's get to the point.

173
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:20,970
Senior students will have the opportunity to recommend interesting projects.

174
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,100
So that we can get the funds to develop our own projects.

175
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,570
In view of the mistakes made by the seniors in the past,

176
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:33,550
I will develop my project to the best.

177
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:37,770
Because sand table recommendations only need attractive projects,

178
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,850
projects with practical value,

179
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,770
And projects that can make a profit.

180
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,250
As for the winning group,

181
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:55,820
only three groups can get funding.

182
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,550
Each group is 10 million.

183
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,150
Not bad.

184
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,670
Try to think about what you are good at?

185
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,800
And what problems exist around you?

186
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:12,320
You can find a way to solve it.

187
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,770
Or you can take a step forward.

188
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,150
You saw Amber's eyes just now, didn't you?

189
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:33,350
Yes.

190
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,170
What do you think?

191
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,350
That's the only way.

192
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,520
Go with me then.

193
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,550
How can I do that? Ai,

194
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,020
this is a senior project.

195
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,700
You must have made it yourself.

196
00:12:46,150 --> 00:12:46,770
That's right,

197
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:50,570
I can understand team assignments in disciplines and cross-dormitory collaboration,

198
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:53,050
but this is the final sand table project.

199
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:54,720
That's right, Songkhram. Don't you remember

200
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,000
who won this competition?

201
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,270
That's the glory of their dorm.

202
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:01,500
I've never done such a cross-dormitory collaboration before.

203
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,850
So what?

204
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,900
No one has ever done it before.

205
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,650
Let's start from this year,

206
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:08,570
Bright. What do you think?

207
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,620
I don't think it's a big deal.

208
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,370
If there are Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3 in the group,

209
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:17,500
if you win, it will be regarded as the honor of the two Dormitory Buildings.

210
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,520
So what if we share it together?

211
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,070
Yes.

212
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,700
Ai, what about you?

213
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,100
What do you think?

214
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,520
I think this is also a good choice.

215
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,700
Does anyone have any questions?

216
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:37,470
If there is, say it now.

217
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,070
I'm only saying this once,

218
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,070
that will be

219
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,070
the final sand table event.

220
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:45,950
I'm in the group. Ai, you.

221
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,950
And you.

222
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,550
I want to join too.

223
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:09,120
If you want to collaborate across the dorm,

224
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:10,970
I want to join Ai too.

225
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,000
What does it matter? Ai,

226
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,970
you're on my team.

227
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,870
I fully support the funding issue.

228
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,550
I don't think I'm short of money.

229
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,300
Calm down,

230
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,470
bro. Will you contribute to the project?

231
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,400
Dormitory 4 doesn't want you anymore?

232
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,150
Or do they all know?

233
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,370
You have no sense of responsibility.

234
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,470
Let's vote for the sake of fairness.

235
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:50,770
There should be four people in our group, I … Am I enough for Ai Touch

236
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:55,170
Bright?

237
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,720
Raise your hand if you agree.

238
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,970
OK

239
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:05,250
As a result of more than half of the votes,

240
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,470
they don't approve of you joining the group.

241
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,050
It's a pity.

242
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,320
I want to do something related to cars,

243
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,550
because I studied cars,

244
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,050
We should be able to do a good job in this.

245
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:29,500
Do you have any ideas about cars?

246
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,670
There are also new energy vehicles.

247
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,900
And self-driving cars has it.

248
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,550
I still can't figure it out.

249
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,650
What about you,

250
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,970
Bright? I haven't.

251
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,870
Do you mind?

252
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:50,650
If Songkhram and I want to do something about the environment,

253
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,600
when did you talk about it secretly?

254
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,750
Instead of chatting secretly and normally,

255
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,450
Ai and I want to solve the painful environmental problems nowadays,

256
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,750
So... What are we going to do?

257
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:10,520
My idea is about semi-finished air products,

258
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,900
the first target group is my mom,

259
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,500
People who are sensitive to air,

260
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,700
if you need to wear a mask,

261
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,250
If we have smart masks

262
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,620
that can provide us with pure air to breathe,

263
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:25,950
There must be two parts.

264
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,570
The first part is air

265
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,250
and the second part is a mask,

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,500
As for the air part,

267
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,870
I think we can look for

268
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,650
selling points from places with good air that everyone likes to go to,

269
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,270
Not bad. I like it.

270
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:43,620
But the hard part should be the mask.

271
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,150
The design is advanced,

272
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,000
the weight is light,

273
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
And you can really use it.

274
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,450
MeenMeen,

275
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:55,900
what's wrong?

276
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:58,470
Corrupt actor,

277
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,120
short for M,

278
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,220
Her face is simple but her heart is not honest.

279
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,370
You shocked the whole circle by stealing your friend's partner.

280
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,300
There are a lot of stars abbreviated as M,

281
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,400
anyone can do it.

282
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,220
I didn't think so at first,

283
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:14,550
but after reading the comments inside,

284
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,000
Everyone said it was him.

285
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,970
Look at the back,

286
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:20,820
anyone can tell that it's Meen.

287
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:25,500
Ai, why don't you call him

288
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,100
and see if he knows the news?

289
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,470
Turn on the loudspeaker so that we can all listen together.

290
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,050
Hello. How's it going?

291
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,320
Bro, I've turned on the public address now.

292
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,650
Did you see the news?

293
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,800
What news?

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
The news is about

295
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,870
a bad actor with M abbreviation,

296
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,950
Stealing someone else's girlfriend,

297
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,250
is that me?

298
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:01,470
No.

299
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,270
But he made your back,

300
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,220
and what he wrote,

301
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,770
A lot of people are saying it's you.

302
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,620
Did you really do that?

303
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,800
Are you two together?

304
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,050
Not only the two of them, Bright and I were there too.

305
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,900
So what happened between you and the hero who started with B?

306
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,750
It doesn't matter if you don't want to answer.

307
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,250
But you're OK, aren't you?

308
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,000
I'm OK Ai,

309
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,150
thank you for worrying about me.

310
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,300
Are you really OK?

311
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,720
There are a lot of people

312
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,470
who criticize you. Forget it. I don't care what they think.

313
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,500
But that's your job. Your fans.

314
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,900
It looks like you're more worried about this than I am,

315
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:51,720
Ai. But trust me. I won't be sad because of what others say.

316
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,800
If I feel sad, it can only be said by someone I care about.

317
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,650
Uh-huh. Update if you need anything.

318
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,400
If there's anything we can do for you,

319
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,650
just say OK. Thank you, guys.

320
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,700
I need to go to the toilet first.

321
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:12,920
Stomach pain,

322
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,500
Yes.

323
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,320
Can you call me now?

324
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,000
It's because of the news.

325
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,850
Have you ever cared about it?

326
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,550
When did you start to rush to steal someone else's girlfriend?

327
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:35,970
For someone like you,

328
00:19:35,970 --> 00:19:37,770
you can find a better single person.

329
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,450
Are you asking or want to hear something?

330
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,700
Or are you just calling to scold me?

331
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:46,220
You have to consider the dignity of your parents when you want to do anything.

332
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,450
Where should they put their faces?

333
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:53,100
Be reasonable if you want to be sarcastic or get attention from others.

334
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,000
Meen,

335
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:03,800
that's my business.

336
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,520
Stay out of it.

337
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,120
Just keep your distance as before.

338
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,100
Do you really need that?

339
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,070
It's not me who needs that kind of person.

340
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:20,470
What do you think? Are you hungry?

341
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:22,300
I made porridge,

342
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,820
and coconut Americano, which you like.

343
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,400
Take off your hangover.

344
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,950
Where are you going in a hurry?

345
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,220
Eat first.

346
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:36,770
Or are you going to find that girl?

347
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,900
That's my business.

348
00:20:41,470 --> 00:20:43,420
Even if she did this to you?

349
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,770
Since when have you been so stupid?

350
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,300
Yes, I'm stupid,

351
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,220
and I've been stupid for a long time.

352
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
Let's keep our distance from now on.

353
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,550
What are you talking about?

354
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:58,020
What's wrong with you?

355
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,470
Tell me,

356
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,250
please.

357
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,370
If you can't talk to me properly,

358
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,020
then ignore me.

359
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,750
Just pretend you can't see me.

360
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,120
Just like what you've been doing.

361
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:35,620
Hello, Bright.

362
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,100
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

363
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,950
When I found out that you were studying here,

364
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,620
I was very happy.

365
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:46,670
I saw you when you were on the stage.

366
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,270
When Senior announced that you were in Dormitory 2,

367
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,300
congratulations.

368
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,520
You like sports,

369
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,350
so you must have a lot of friends to play with in that dorm.

370
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,070
I'm in Dormitory 3.

371
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,050
It's close to you,

372
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:07,200
and if you don't have anyone to eat with,

373
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:08,820
Can you talk to me?

374
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,550
Are you done?

375
00:22:12,770 --> 00:22:13,970
Excuse me.

376
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,000
What's wrong

377
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:22,470
with Meen?

378
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,150
-Help me

379
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,670
out. -Sure.

380
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,120
Tell me what you want me to do for you.

381
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,450
I think I've already said it,

382
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,470
but I don't want to repeat it.

383
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,300
From now on, you don't have to tell me anything about yourself.

384
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,170
You don't have to meddle in my business anymore.

385
00:22:41,570 --> 00:22:43,000
Keep some distance from me.

386
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:12,920
Good morning.

387
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,770
= Wake

388
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,520
up = = Have you eaten yet.

389
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:42,070
[ What are you doing? ].

390
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:51,700
Hello.

391
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,820
[ Are you busy? ] [ Aren't

392
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,600
you upset today? ] [ Pick up

393
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:53,150
the phone. I'm worried

394
00:24:57,350 --> 00:25:02,220
sick. = = Are you angry? = Answer the phone.

395
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:14,800
Touch

396
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,050
is like this again,

397
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,420
Where did they go?

398
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,400
What should I do with you?

399
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,020
Senior Songkhram,

400
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:34,150
you're so lonely now that you want to talk to porridge.

401
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,920
It's my business. Then

402
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,650
what are you doing in Building 3?

403
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,800
You even brought porridge?

404
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,020
It's for someone in Building 3, right?

405
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,070
I can send it in for you if you want.

406
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,300
You can ask me if you want to know any gossip.

407
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,120
I know more than Nano.

408
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Is your manager Ai here?

409
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,600
I don't know.

410
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,500
You...

411
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,800
Calm down.

412
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:01,900
I just came back.

413
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,550
How can I know who's in the dorm or not?

414
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:05,620
I'll go in and check it for you. Wait a minute.

415
00:26:05,950 --> 00:26:07,120
No, no,

416
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,020
forget it. I'm going back.

417
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,850
What about porridge?

418
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:14,770
Please give it to him.

419
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,470
If you get sick,

420
00:26:16,770 --> 00:26:18,070
or sleep too hard and don't eat,

421
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,120
I don't have anything to put on my stomach,

422
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,770
He,

423
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,150
-Your building

424
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,200
manager. -Okay.

425
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:30,170
Why are you anxious?

426
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,100
Because of Building 5,

427
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,120
we haven't chosen sand table for years,

428
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,520
It's really sad.

429
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,520
Do you have to win over the other dorm buildings?

430
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,170
You have to save our face.

431
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,570
Especially Ai and Songkhram.

432
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,800
I'll help both of them.

433
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,270
Can you help me defeat them?

434
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,920
Are you really not going to answer his call?

435
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,750
How many calls

436
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,820
have you made? That's right.

437
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,420
Take a look.

438
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,670
In case something urgent happens.

439
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,800
You brats didn't come home all night?

440
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,400
I'll be worried if I disappear all night.

441
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,400
What you've done,

442
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,720
are you aware of the problem?

443
00:27:28,850 --> 00:27:30,600
I won't tell you if I've got a demerit.

444
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,920
If something really happens,

445
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,720
what will happen to your parents?

446
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,920
Touch said that you are concerned about

447
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,370
what you will do in the future. Please be rational.

448
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:45,650
We don't want anything to happen to you.

449
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,920
Call your parents if something goes wrong. I haven't finished

450
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,500
scolding you yet.

451
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,670
All right, Touch. Tomorrow at 10:

452
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:54,500
00,

453
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,600
Ask your parents to meet the teacher.

454
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,550
Yes, senior,

455
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,320
Senior Ai.

456
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,320
What are you talking about?

457
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,100
Someone asked me to look for... No,

458
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,970
I'm asking you.

459
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,820
Where is he?

460
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,300
At the door of the dorm.

461
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:21,750
Ai

462
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,070
What's wrong with you?

463
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,350
She didn't reply to messages or answer calls.

464
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,370
Are you not feeling well?

465
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,050
What the hell are you talking about? Songkhram,

466
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,600
you keep arguing.

467
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:35,620
Why do you look so haggard?

468
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,900
Did you not get enough sleep?

469
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,770
It's my business.

470
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,070
Calm down. Ai,

471
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
He doesn't know either.

472
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,820
What's the matter with you?

473
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,150
You didn't text me back or answer my phone.

474
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:49,870
It's my friend.

475
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:51,120
That's enough.

476
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,050
I didn't reply or answer the phone.

477
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,500
Doesn't that mean I'm busy?

478
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,650
Do you really have to ask the people in my dorm to come to me?

479
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,020
I didn't use the people in your dorm,

480
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,050
I just want to ask you if you're sick?

481
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:04,400
Okay, Ai, calm down.

482
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,720
Songkhram, go back first.

483
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:06,520
Ai... Leave

484
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,850
Touch alone,

485
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:09,900
This is between us.

486
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,220
You go back first.

487
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,250
I want us to deal with it alone.

488
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,150
Yes.

489
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,250
I'm tired.

490
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,920
You can rest first.

491
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,570
I'm not in a hurry.

492
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,500
No,

493
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:35,300
I mean I've had enough of you.

494
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,020
Can you stop doing this?

495
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,600
What do you mean?

496
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,570
Can we just chat in the working group,

497
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:50,870
and be the heads of two buildings with different relationships?

498
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,450
You don't need to text me to wake me up.

499
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:55,720
You don't need to buy me porridge.

500
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,770
You don't have to cook for me.

501
00:29:56,850 --> 00:29:58,250
You don't need to buy me flowerpots.

502
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,320
You don't have to water the trees in our dorm.

503
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:01,850
I'm tired.

504
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,270
The expectation from the dorm makes me tired.

505
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,700
Taking care of your emotions makes me tired.

506
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,250
Don't you like what I made for you?

507
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,270
I don't know.

508
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,020
I don't know.

509
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,450
Why did I let you get close to me?

510
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,020
Maybe it's just gratitude,

511
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,700
your help to me.

512
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,070
Then answer me,

513
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,650
when you were with me,

514
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,420
Do you feel happy?

515
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,920
I understand.

516
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:57,070
I'm sorry for making things difficult for you.

517
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,620
This is

518
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,900
Meen's famous corrupt actor,

519
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:29,450
I really want your fans to see you like this.

520
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,750
Why don't I sell your photos?

521
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,770
It should sell for a good price.

522
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,050
Did you bring me back to sleep?

523
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,750
Who else could it be if it wasn't me?

524
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,620
Why are you doing this?

525
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,750
What are you doing?

526
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,450
Help me.

527
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,350
Because of humanity.

528
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:58,900
That's right.

529
00:32:00,550 --> 00:32:02,700
You should want to be a good person,

530
00:32:04,350 --> 00:32:05,650
have a conscience,

531
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,770
Only in this way can I be worthy of Ai.

532
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,650
But I'm telling you,

533
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,400
she doesn't want you.

534
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,350
It's none of your business.

535
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,550
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,720
You've told me so many times.

537
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,220
But I still forget,

538
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:28,220
don't talk about your own business,

539
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,050
Leave you alone.

540
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,350
I'll keep my distance from you.

541
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,520
Why Ai?

542
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,250
Why Ai?

543
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,720
Can't the one you love

544
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,170
be me?

545
00:33:01,870 --> 00:33:02,800
Meen,

546
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
I... I... -Don't

547
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:12,950
comfort me,

548
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,150
You don't have to help me.

549
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,850
Don't be nice to me.

550
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,320
If you really hate me that much,

551
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:24,700
don't give me hope.

552
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,850
Meen,

553
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,370
you may not believe this,

554
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,770
But I don't hate you.

555
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,350
If I really hate you, I won't... Let's

556
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,370
go. Eat. I'm hungry.

557
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
Bright

558
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,720
Yes.

559
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:03,400
Where's Ai?

560
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,800
I thought I saw him just now.

561
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,450
Oh, he just walked out.

562
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:07,800
He might be hungry.

563
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,020
He left in a hurry.

564
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,400
I'm on my way to find him.

565
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:12,070
Could you please tell him

566
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:14,320
to bring Meen to me

567
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,220
to meet the star in their dorm, Meen?

568
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,670
Yes.

569
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,650
You don't have to look for Ai.

570
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,170
You can tell me.

571
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:25,070
Meen and I have known each other since middle school.

572
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,520
Really?

573
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:29,420
I can't tell you're good friends

574
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:33,300
Meen often misses classes?

575
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:36,670
Did he fail?

576
00:34:39,950 --> 00:34:41,470
There's nothing to be surprised about, sir,

577
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,750
because he didn't come to class much,

578
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,570
He didn't pass the exam last semester,

579
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:50,870
is there any way for him not to fail the exam or something?

580
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:55,270
If he continues like this, when will he graduate?

581
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,320
You look so worried about him.

582
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:58,620
Right?

583
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,250
Oh, I forgot that you're good friends, right?

584
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:03,070
Yes.

585
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,370
Is it okay for the teacher to ask him to hand in his homework?

586
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,000
Or a more complicated assignment.

587
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,300
He can review what he has learned this semester.

588
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,270
How can you do that?

589
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,770
He's only been here for two classes.

590
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,050
How can I use what I've learned?

591
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,200
He can do it.

592
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,470
Otherwise, I'm sure it won't be anything.

593
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,250
Otherwise, I wouldn't have... Or

594
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,770
I wouldn't have missed you.

595
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:46,120
OK

596
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:48,420
Market planning and objectives have been gradually formed.

597
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:49,850
To sum up,

598
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,820
the project planning theme of our group is called Pure Oxygen,

599
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,400
The name of the innovative product is called oxygen mask,

600
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:58,070
which is assisted by semi-finished air products.

601
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,150
Which is the air storage tank.

602
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:00,120
Mm-hmm,

603
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:03,770
Next, we need to make an innovation in oxygen masks.

604
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:05,370
So that this product can be made of capsules,

605
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,050
which are basically divided into two parts: patterns and materials.

606
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:11,450
I'm in charge of designing the drawings and electronic layout,

607
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,000
Songkhram is in charge of designing the appearance of the product,

608
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,200
And find the right materials to produce oxygen masks.

609
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:18,820
Okay,

610
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,320
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

611
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,550
I don't want to see it anymore.

612
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,820
Haven't you talked yet?

613
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,800
[ Are you awake? Let's have dinner together. ]

614
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,400
You're crazy.

615
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,250
You're annoyed when you're stuck.

616
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,150
You're upset when you're gone, too,

617
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,350
What should we do?

618
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:34,170
It's been six days.

619
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,850
Change the color once in a while.

620
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:13,450
That's what makes you look good.

621
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,570
I like everything in the same style,

622
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,120
the same style,

623
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,500
It looks nice and neat.

624
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,150
Take it.

625
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:24,750
Each tree is suitable to be planted in a different pot.

626
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,570
Some things are attractive because they are different.

627
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,500
By the way, it seems pretty good.

628
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,050
You've already blossomed such beautiful flowers.

629
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,020
I didn't even notice.

630
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,200
Answer the phone.

631
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:01,250
Why are you here?

632
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,170
Why can't you come to my house

633
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,900
even if I can't?

634
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:07,250
How do you know that you're not the only one in my family

635
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,220
who has a good relationship with Nucleus.

636
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,770
I'm surprised how you got in.

637
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,770
What are you doing with the wall? Come in over the wall.

638
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:19,870
The gate isn't locked. It's dangerous.

639
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,520
The flowerpots are pretty and varied,

640
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,600
but they're pretty when you're tired of them.

641
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:31,900
It looks very vibrant on the whole.

642
00:40:33,450 --> 00:40:34,320
Oh.

643
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,770
Why don't you go running every morning?

644
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,200
I'll wait for you at the playground every day.

645
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,470
I also went to the porridge shop.

646
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,670
But the food you bought is not as good as the food you bought.

647
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,220
Then why didn't you read the message?

648
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,120
And he didn't reply to me.

649
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:04,770
I just ignored you for a few hours.

650
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:07,000
You ignored me for six or seven days.

651
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:09,170
You said you didn't like me.

652
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:10,670
I apologize.

653
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:14,720
I apologize for talking to you like that.

654
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,450
It's not that I don't like it,

655
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,070
it's actually that I like it,

656
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,550
And I like it very much.

657
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,620
I like everything you've done for me.

658
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,470
You're by my side,

659
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,620
Ai

660
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm sorry,

661
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:29,100
I know I didn't accept you by my side

662
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,270
because of gratitude or anything else,

663
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,650
No. You wake me up every day. I don't feel good at all.

664
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:41,900
It's me... I miss

665
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,250
the messages you sent me,

666
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,850
Do you sound like a beating?

667
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,170
I miss the porridge you bought for me,

668
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,250
the chicken oil rice with strange taste,

669
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,500
I can't even keep a record in my diary.

670
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,300
Your face is everywhere I see.

671
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:02,750
Your colorful flowerpots,

672
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,220
the flowers you watered in my dorm,

673
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,620
I miss you,

674
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,300
Songkhram. Can you give me one more chance?

675
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,900
Get along with me. -That's enough, Ai.

676
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,200
You made me fall in love with you.

677
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,450
I've been courting you and courting you all these years,

678
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:21,570
that's why I asked you to be my partner.

679
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,400
Who asked you to do that?

680
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:27,650
If you don't like me and ignore me for the whole week,

681
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,550
stay with me, Ai.

682
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,420
Yeah, let's be together.

683
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:39,270
What difference does it make?

684
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:43,320
The final result is not always the same.

685
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:46,420
Well, then we're together.

686
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:50,300
Yes.

687
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,550
Well.

688
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,270
I can... I don't think

689
00:43:01,270 --> 00:43:03,250
this is the right place.

690
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,570
My dad's not here. My dad's gone to Japan. He won't be back

691
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,570
until next week. You're cheating again.

692
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:17,000
Yes, I won't cheat anymore.

693
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,470
What do you think?

694
00:44:11,570 --> 00:44:13,350
I feel good.

695
00:44:14,870 --> 00:44:16,720
It feels really good, right?

696
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,300
How do you feel?

697
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,250
I feel good, too.

698
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:28,770
Don't tell anyone that we're together.

699
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:29,750
What are you doing?

700
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,870
Can't you see you're busy?

701
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,920
I saw them behaving intimately at the amusement park on Saturday.

702
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,420
Love you, love you, love you.

703
00:44:39,870 --> 00:44:42,750
I won't let you be someone else's anymore.
