1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
As a result of more than half of the votes,

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,200
they don't approve of you joining the group.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,900
When did you start to rush to steal someone else's girlfriend?

4
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:07,930
That's my business.

5
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:08,930
Stay out of it.

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,430
Stay with me, Ai.

7
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,730
Songkhram

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:21,130
Yes.

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:25,500
Can I ask you for a favor?

10
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:27,050
Good for you.

11
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,080
Several will do.

12
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,280
Don't tell anyone that we're together.

13
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,830
Why do you think

14
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
it's embarrassing to be with a man?

15
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:38,880
No,

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,600
I'm just shy,

17
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:43,650
My mother is single and just got out of the company.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,330
No.

19
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,680
I don't want to be your first date.

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,400
I want to be your girlfriend for the rest of my life.

21
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,230
Good for you.

22
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:00,230
I'm just thinking,

23
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,400
I've been single for 20 years.

24
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:06,150
Now all of a sudden, I want you to announce

25
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:07,950
that you're with your enemy.

26
00:01:08,630 --> 00:01:10,230
I'm really shy.

27
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,650
I'm not used to having a boyfriend.

28
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,680
I feel like my life has changed a lot.

29
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,880
Aren't you shy?

30
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,080
Shy.

31
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:28,250
But I was so happy that I forgot to be shy.

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,500
Let's slowly merge with each other.

33
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,650
I just... -Okay.

34
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,080
I've been waiting for someone for the rest of my life.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,380
I finally met you.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,930
We fell in love and killed each other for 4 years,

37
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:44,930
then we got together.

38
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,600
What's the big deal?

39
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:48,600
But

40
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:50,730
don't keep me waiting too long.

41
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,800
Because if it takes too long,

42
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,830
I'm afraid I'll get pregnant before I get married.

43
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,030
Are you out of your mind?

44
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,130
I won't get pregnant.

45
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,630
We are all men.

46
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,950
OK. Does that mean you won't get pregnant?

47
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,780
Not bad.

48
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,230
= Wake up, slacker = = Take a shower and

49
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:03,550
go to school.

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,830
[ Good morning, Mr.

51
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,430
Boyfriend. ] I miss you so much. I want to

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,480
see you.

53
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:23,030
I miss you too. I want to see you.

54
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,530
[ I can't learn by sitting

55
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:05,080
there. ] = Why is it so hard?

56
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,730
= = It's so hard. =,

57
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,200
[ I'm always thinking about my

58
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,500
boyfriend. ] Go for it.

59
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,330
= = What's wrong? =.

60
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,500
=

61
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,850
Songkhram = Yes ~.

62
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,930
What are you doing?

63
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,550
Be careful not to be seen by others.

64
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,000
There's no one outside.

65
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,550
I miss my boyfriend so much.

66
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,350
I miss my boyfriend,

67
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,030
miss you, miss you, miss you,

68
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,480
miss you, miss you,

69
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,080
miss you, miss you, miss you,

70
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,700
miss you, miss you, miss you, okay.

71
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,400
Don't let the kids from your dorm water the trees in my dorm.

72
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,080
Jerk!

73
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,850
Are you okay, Songkhram? It's your first time dating a boyfriend

74
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:32,100
in 20 years.

75
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,700
I'm not used to it.

76
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
My heart keeps beating

77
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,000
like it's about to jump out of my body.

78
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,480
And happy.

79
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,900
Shy

80
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,100
and missing,

81
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:45,650
I want to see him.

82
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,880
If you want to hear his voice,

83
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,400
you can do it anytime, anywhere.

84
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,500
Hey,

85
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,050
Have you finished your basketball practice?

86
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,500
Yes. Back to the dorm.

87
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,700
I took a shower too.

88
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,250
I'm sorry

89
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:09,350
for today. It's okay,

90
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,450
But you can make it up to me.

91
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:14,830
Compensate for what?

92
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,030
You'll know when the time comes.

93
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,200
You... It was fun

94
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,480
today,

95
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,330
If I were Nano,

96
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,050
I would look dazed.

97
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,380
I don't know what they're arguing about.

98
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,200
Water the trees,

99
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,600
I didn't have time to think about it,

100
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,930
I don't blame you for not being able to miss me,

101
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,700
but you can't help but miss me.

102
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,880
I miss it.

103
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,080
We can spend the whole day together tomorrow.

104
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,080
Yes,

105
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,580
I really want to hurry up until tomorrow.

106
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,900
Brother, isn't Songkhram coming to the meeting?

107
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,050
He's late today.

108
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:04,650
Because the aviation class was delayed.

109
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,730
Why are you so clear about the curriculum of aviation students?

110
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,830
He texted me.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,730
Maybe he's afraid of being scolded.

112
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,130
Okay, let's have a chat first.

113
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,450
Oxygen mask and air storage tank

114
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,600
Sorry for dragging us down.

115
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Where are we now?

116
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,280
At the beginning,

117
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,400
OK, my part,

118
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,280
I'm designing a chip now.

119
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,680
And the intelligent model,

120
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,850
in order to isolate the oxygen mask from external pollution,

121
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:37,830
At the same time, the air storage tank can output oxygen

122
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:39,150
so that the user can breathe,

123
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,800
I tried modern design concepts,

124
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,650
simplicity,

125
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,480
Lightweight,

126
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:45,830
easy to wear,

127
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,080
I designed three models.

128
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:49,980
The first one,

129
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,080
The second paragraph,

130
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,980
and the third paragraph,

131
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:57,300
I think we should use lightweight graphene nanomaterials.

132
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,450
Which one do you prefer?

133
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,750
I like the second one.

134
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:11,300
I like the second one, too,

135
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,950
The second one.

136
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,030
I like the second one,

137
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,000
too. Stay in formation.

138
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:20,300
As for pure oxygen,

139
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,250
I think we should

140
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,500
produce pure oxygen from the concentration of pure air,

141
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,280
For example, Mae Mo County,

142
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,530
which can have many markets,

143
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:32,450
But we need to make a good plan.

144
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,000
Don't let the product damage the environment.

145
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,230
I think we need to make a long-term plan for this.

146
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:38,750
As for the short-term plan,

147
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,950
I think as long as I can breathe PM2. 5 air in my daily life,

148
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:44,450
it will be very good.

149
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,000
Therefore,

150
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,880
we must have an oxygen producer

151
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,450
that can convert ordinary air... into pure and fresh air.

152
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,180
I don't think it's difficult.

153
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,750
The hard part is,

154
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:57,250
how do we store oxygen in the capsule?

155
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,950
It can't be stored in an oxygen tank,

156
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,980
so you think a capsule,

157
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,380
It should be used for a few days.

158
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,930
How many hours?

159
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:08,250
I think the life of a capsule

160
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,630
should be no less than 10 hours.

161
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I agree.

162
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,880
If it's okay at home,

163
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,180
because there's an air purifier.

164
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,930
If it's outside,

165
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,450
it shouldn't be a good idea to use capsules often.

166
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,200
To be honest,

167
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:24,280
I don't think our house is very clean.

168
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,550
You see, mothers like Ai

169
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,350
always stay at home,

170
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,530
It can get in like dust.

171
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:31,030
You'll be allergic if you have asthma.

172
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:38,030
So it's also important to make a price and market plan.

173
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:40,680
We need to let the boss see the opportunity,

174
00:11:41,430 --> 00:11:43,750
how many days do we have left this time?

175
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,700
14 days.

176
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,580
What else do we need?

177
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,200
All we have left is to expand our ideas.

178
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,980
And the idea that the product can really be used.

179
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,530
And attractive marketing plans.

180
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:54,630
The rest,

181
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:56,780
the narrative speech,

182
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:59,300
I think the background story is

183
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,700
very important. -Yes. -Yes,

184
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,000
We can do it.

185
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:06,330
What we have now is very close to reality,

186
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:08,800
and I believe we can do it.

187
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,100
Then who's in charge of publishing?

188
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,680
I think it must be Ai.

189
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:16,930
Ai is the most devoted,

190
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:19,680
and his main ideas and inspiration come from him.

191
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,300
After that, we will support you in the information and published materials.

192
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,450
Yes, that's great.

193
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:28,880
Then, I'll publish it with Ai.

194
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:32,150
OK

195
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:35,300
Send it to me if anyone finishes their part.

196
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:37,350
And then I put it together into a PowerPoint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

197
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,480
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

198
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,550
1. Watch TV shows together and then sleep together.

199
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,850
Set a common password together.

200
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,900
Go deep diving together,

201
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,650
and drink water through the same straw together.

202
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:01,250
Eat the same ice cream together.

203
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,680
Be backpackers together.

204
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,400
Lie down at sea and watch the stars together.

205
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,280
Go to the park for a picnic together.

206
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,780
Lie down together and enjoy cherry blossoms,

207
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:37,930
wash your hair together and then wipe each other's bodies.

208
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,500
Why did you ask me to eat in the car?

209
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:05,130
Because I want to try it for the first time.

210
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:08,950
Yes.

211
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:12,730
It's not like that.

212
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,380
-Do you have water? -Yes.

213
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,130
Do you want ice cream?

214
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,950
Only one?

215
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,300
Let's eat together.

216
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,780
If we go to the dining hall for dinner,

217
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,500
we won't be able to do something like this, right?

218
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,650
Yes. That's why I asked you to eat in the car.

219
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,750
Does it have to be so troublesome for us to date?

220
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,280
Don't think it's troublesome.

221
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:34,000
This is what it feels like before it's made public.

222
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,430
Your hair is messy.

223
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:46,930
Do you still want to eat it?

224
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:49,080
Finish the last bite.

225
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,850
Somgkhram

226
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,900
is so cute.

227
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,400
Ai,

228
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,730
what are you doing on the basketball court?

229
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,980
I told you I don't want to eat.

230
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:22,350
If you want to eat it so badly, you can buy it yourself after you play the ball.

231
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:26,980
Senior Songkhram,

232
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,930
are you OK?

233
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,150
Yes.

234
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,450
= Dear Diary 1 = = January-June 2016 =.

235
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,250
Honey,

236
00:16:44,130 --> 00:16:45,300
what was your name just now?

237
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,400
Honey,

238
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:49,530
Honey,

239
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,100
What's wrong?

240
00:16:51,230 --> 00:16:54,730
When we're together, I just want to use some cute names,

241
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,980
even if we're used to using the words

242
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:59,450
"you old man" when we're friends,

243
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,580
Okay, honey.

244
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,130
Love you.

245
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:11,730
Honey, why are you shy?

246
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,250
Honey, are you shy?

247
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,300
Why are you shy?

248
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,930
Shyness means shyness. I

249
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,700
love you.

250
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,080
So I was shy because I said I love you.

251
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:28,580
Songkhram loves

252
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,350
Ai. Ai loves Songkhram, too.

253
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,080
That's enough. Am I shy?

254
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:50,600
Are you shy?

255
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:50,980
Yes.

256
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:55,780
Love you, love you, love you,

257
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,880
why are you blocking it?

258
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:02,000
Love you, love you, love you, hello,

259
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,830
everyone in dormitory building 3,

260
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,550
Hello, everyone in Dormitory 2,

261
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,800
you should all know, right?

262
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:11,480
What activities do we have during this month of the year?

263
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:16,130
Since we live on campus all year round,

264
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,680
it's time for us to work together.

265
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,550
Clean-up? Why do we often have activities

266
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,500
with the people in dormitory building 3 now? Senior,

267
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:27,080
that's right.

268
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,250
Then there might be a cross-dormitory couple.

269
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,750
You can laugh or think whatever you want.

270
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,230
But I hope everyone can maintain hygiene together.

271
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:41,180
You don't have to tell who belongs to which dorm.

272
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,550
Are you crazy?

273
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,730
Why are you following me?

274
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,330
I just want to be closer to you, okay?

275
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,380
People will see you later.

276
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,700
I told you,

277
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,280
go away first. People will see you later.

278
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,230
Let go of me!

279
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,350
I want to help you, okay?

280
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,530
Ai

281
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
I told you

282
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,500
not to stand in my way.

283
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,300
See? I'm in a hurry.

284
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,800
You can't even look down the road when you walk.

285
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Calm down, Ai.

286
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,280
Songkhram, don't bother him.

287
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,450
Go and check on your dorm members.

288
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,150
What is he up to?

289
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,430
Are you done?

290
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,730
Honey,

291
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,130
I'm sorry about today,

292
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,100
I didn't do it on purpose.

293
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,600
I told my dear not to do that

294
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,780
if there are a lot of people,

295
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,980
It hurt so much just now.

296
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,950
He got hit in the face.

297
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,600
Honey, you don't want a handsome guy, do you?

298
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,400
I made a mistake and didn't realize it.

299
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,050
If my dear is not my girlfriend,

300
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,680
you will feel better now.

301
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:44,700
Toei No, go ahead. You.

302
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,900
This staircase was brought by my dormitory building,

303
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,680
how can you use it?

304
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:55,800
The dirtier it is.

305
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,450
Hurry up and deal with

306
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,100
Songkhram. I brought the stairs.

307
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:05,680
What's wrong with him?

308
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,150
How's it going, darling?

309
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,780
I'm sorry. I didn't expect

310
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,650
Bright to come.

311
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,780
Of course it hurts. Are you asking if there's any pain?

312
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,930
Let me see.

313
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,600
Where does it hurt?

314
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,780
It hurts here,

315
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:24,930
here, here, here.

316
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,450
Why are you laughing?

317
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:31,100
You're still

318
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:35,650
smiling. Come here.

319
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,980
-Senior Ai. -What a

320
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,880
big mosquito.

321
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,280
It's right on your face.

322
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,200
You're lucky that I helped you fight mosquitoes.

323
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:44,800
Mozzie,

324
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,980
which one do you think died first, Mozzie or Songkhram?

325
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,580
The two of them fight each other every day.

326
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,380
Then what are you doing here?

327
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,930
Because I've already put away the tools.

328
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:57,330
-I'm here for you now. -You guys go first.

329
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:57,950
Go and wait.

330
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,800
Let's follow them

331
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,580
later. Let's go.

332
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,280
Let's go!

333
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,850
It hurts so much today.

334
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,430
My boyfriend is too heavy-handed.

335
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,880
I need to call the police.

336
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:14,530
How can I make it up to you?

337
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,380
What do you think?

338
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:20,600
Are you free tomorrow?

339
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:21,950
Go on a date?

340
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,450
Where are you going?

341
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,650
It's up to you.

342
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,500
[ Where is it? ] [ Why didn't you

343
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,200
reply to me? ],

344
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,100
[ Are you

345
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,550
busy? ] [ Call me back. ]

346
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,800
[ Who are you with?

347
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,200
[ Are you

348
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:51,130
working? ] You really don't care about me anymore, Meen. Why didn't you reply to the messages I

349
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,900
sent you?

350
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,380
I'm scared.

351
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,750
I'm afraid I'll get stuck in it again.

352
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,250
And you hate me.

353
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,580
I'm going crazy.

354
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:16,730
I'm going crazy too.

355
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:18,780
Then what do you want me to do?

356
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:21,430
If I like you, Meen,

357
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,680
don't like me.

358
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,780
Just because Ai likes Songkhram,

359
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,200
I don't want to be someone's substitute.

360
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,030
If you like me,

361
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,480
you should already like me.

362
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,350
I'm tired Bright,

363
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,630
let me go.

364
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,500
No, Meen.

365
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:43,780
I'm sorry.

366
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:45,750
It's my fault.

367
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,230
I'm not determined about my feelings.

368
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,680
That's why I did that to you.

369
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,380
I'm not doing well.

370
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:56,550
I didn't want to admit that I liked men.

371
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,500
But you admit that

372
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,950
you like Ai,

373
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,750
I like him just to forget you

374
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:08,780
Why did you forget me?

375
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,830
Do you hate me that much?

376
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:14,480
It's not that I don't hate you.

377
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,330
I hate myself.

378
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:20,900
Meen,

379
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,400
I'm sorry,

380
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,280
But if I want to like guys and date guys,

381
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,080
I hope that person is you.

382
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:33,680
If you're going out with someone, what's going on?

383
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,430
I hope that person is me.

384
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,930
I don't want you to do that.

385
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,400
What do you think I am?

386
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:54,180
It's to let me know that running away from my heart will hurt both of us.

387
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:56,600
Won't you be sad?

388
00:24:56,630 --> 00:25:00,100
I'll be even sadder if I don't do it today.

389
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,650
Do you know how much I love you?

390
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:35,380
Do you know how jealous I am?

391
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,250
From now on, I won't let you disappear again.

392
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:00,650
I hope what you said is true.

393
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,950
You can choose whatever you want to play.

394
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,050
I'll listen to you today.

395
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,600
I don't have much fun.

396
00:27:01,630 --> 00:27:03,730
They all look scary.

397
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:06,280
Choose. What do you want to play?

398
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:10,200
A merry-go-round.

399
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,400
A merry-go-round. -Yes,

400
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,950
Are you crazy?

401
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,280
You're an adult now. It's not easy for Ai

402
00:27:18,350 --> 00:27:19,700
to come to an amusement park.

403
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,250
It's okay to play something exciting.

404
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,850
I'm afraid of heights.

405
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,480
It's okay.

406
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,600
Everyone has their first time.

407
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,230
No

408
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,680
-Bye. -To be honest, I'm

409
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:38,750
scared.

410
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,180
But you owe me a compensation.

411
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,380
What compensation?

412
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,450
Make up for it.

413
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:46,730
How could I forget it?

414
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:47,500
Let's go.

415
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,180
Make it up to me.

416
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,600
No!

417
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,750
Can you play something else?

418
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,300
This one.

419
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,600
You're already here.

420
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,980
It should be fun.

421
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,880
I don't know. Kiss

422
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,550
is so strange.

423
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,900
Brother,

424
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,330
Everyone else is waiting in line.

425
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,730
How could you cut in line?

426
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:12,850
Why are you cutting in line?

427
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,250
I've always been here.

428
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:15,730
Don't talk nonsense about what happened later.

429
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,380
I'm the one who's been waiting in line here,

430
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,100
and you're the last one?

431
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:21,530
Calm down.

432
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:22,900
It's okay.

433
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,080
How can I bear it?

434
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,750
Everyone else is waiting in line.

435
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,350
You can't just let people cut in line, can you?

436
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,680
I'm defending justice.

437
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:32,930
Am I wrong? Ai,

438
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,150
you're right.

439
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,800
I told you to calm down.

440
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,630
I don't want you to make a big deal out of it, understand?

441
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:41,700
It's such a small matter,

442
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,650
and it's such a big deal,

443
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,180
I'm sure I won't accept what you did wrong.

444
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,430
How dare you say that

445
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,450
I cut in line? I saw it,

446
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:53,250
That's right.

447
00:28:54,350 --> 00:28:55,650
That's right.

448
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,150
You're so cheeky that you're pulling someone else's collar.

449
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:00,980
Get out of here,

450
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,650
you... Shameless one,

451
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:05,250
Get out!

452
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,650
Get out.

453
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,700
Let's go.

454
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:11,230
That's right. That's great.

455
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,350
That's what this kind of person should do. -Yes, yes.

456
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,550
Are you okay?

457
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,330
Are you still worried about me?

458
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,900
I'm not worried and I won't stop you.

459
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:26,380
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:27,730
I was a little impatient.

461
00:29:28,150 --> 00:29:29,780
I just don't like people taking advantage of us.

462
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:32,800
I just don't want others to ruin our atmosphere.

463
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,850
Or for someone you don't know.

464
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,250
I'll try to change it for you.

465
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:40,200
You don't have to change yourself for me.

466
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,180
I liked you from the beginning.

467
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,300
Because you are who you are,

468
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,830
we'll get to know each other slowly.

469
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:49,830
My girlfriend is so cute.

470
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:52,780
Can I kiss you now?

471
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,300
If there's anything that needs to be changed,

472
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,250
this is the first one.

473
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,300
Got it?

474
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,500
Can we play something else?

475
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,280
After this second,

476
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,400
I'm going to take Little Ai on a ride.

477
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:15,830
Songkhram Airlines,

478
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,580
come on.

479
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,580
Get ready.

480
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,200
Little Ai,

481
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,650
let's go.

482
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,650
Let's go.

483
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,400
Go for it

484
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:56,780
Play something exciting and then play something simple so that you can relax.

485
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,480
Lower your level.

486
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,830
Come down slowly.

487
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,130
I'm going to throw up.

488
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,980
It's the last one.

489
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:05,350
I'll take you to the merry-go-round.

490
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,400
Really?

491
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,050
That's right.

492
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:07,780
Yes,

493
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,330
you did.

494
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:08,930
You did. Yes,

495
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,900
I did,

496
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,800
The more you close your eyes, the more scared you'll be.

497
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,100
I'm not scared. I want to throw up.

498
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,330
Dizziness,

499
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,650
Why did it go up?

500
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,930
Why did it go up?

501
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,250
Are you okay?

502
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,550
It's okay.

503
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,450
I have something to do.

504
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,350
Look at my condition.

505
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:33,900
Why do you like to play with such exciting things?

506
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:37,300
I like something challenging.

507
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,980
Otherwise, I wouldn't have chased you.

508
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,400
It's great

509
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,330
that you're awake.

510
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:57,580
The amusement park has a place to sit down and eat,

511
00:31:57,850 --> 00:31:59,900
away from the excitement.

512
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,730
Compared to eating in a restaurant,

513
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,430
can you eat these snacks in a coffee shop?

514
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:10,380
The colors of these macarons are so beautiful together,

515
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:14,450
my eyes are bright.

516
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:23,350
I didn't know you liked this kind of coffee shop.

517
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,630
What's wrong?

518
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,750
Can you eat

519
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,230
and not play well?

520
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm just not used to it.

521
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,730
What do I want?

522
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,380
So I bought it for home.

523
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:39,080
Instead of sitting in the store for a long time,

524
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:40,800
it's good.

525
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,430
You need to spend more time enjoying life.

526
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,700
Only in this way can I be calm.

527
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,880
I'm taking pictures.

528
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,800
Then you can take photos.

529
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:57,550
There are so many more.

530
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,350
There's one missing.

531
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,450
The colors are not uniform.

532
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,300
I only ate one.

533
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,730
I'll buy you another one later.

534
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,030
They don't sell one separately,

535
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,300
so I'll buy it for you.

536
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,880
You don't have to buy it. Just sit here.

537
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,030
You have to understand,

538
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,700
not only one is missing,

539
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,380
But one is missing.

540
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,680
Is it that serious? Ai,

541
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm sorry.

542
00:33:28,530 --> 00:33:29,580
I was being melodramatic.

543
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,050
It's okay,

544
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,730
I made trouble out of nothing.

545
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,900
If I could understand you better,

546
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,250
we wouldn't have to argue here.

547
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,050
Forget it.

548
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,830
It's just the beginning.

549
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,800
We still have a lot to learn.

550
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,250
Although one macaroon is missing,

551
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,130
I have you to eat with me.

552
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,900
I'm already very happy.

553
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,430
You're happy, aren't you?

554
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,930
Come

555
00:34:01,650 --> 00:34:03,200
and eat.

556
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,480
Delicious.

557
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,280
You too.

558
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,530
What do you think?

559
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,880
Delicious.

560
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,830
Aon, please tell Ai

561
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:21,050
that I'm really sorry.

562
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:26,200
Ohm,

563
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:29,100
come and talk to me.

564
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,630
What's wrong, Dad?

565
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,080
Do you have something to say to me?

566
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,200
I had no choice.

567
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,200
You're not here and you don't care about me.

568
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,350
I have to solve the problem myself.

569
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,100
I don't want Ai to help me either.

570
00:34:51,950 --> 00:34:53,450
What did you say?

571
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,680
What do you mean?

572
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,950
Don't you mean that Ai helped me pay off 400 thousand's debt?

573
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:04,230
What did you do again?

574
00:35:04,230 --> 00:35:06,230
I can't believe I helped you with 400 houses.

575
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,680
You asked me to come and talk to you.

576
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,430
Did you ask me if I have anything to say?

577
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,680
Didn't you mean this?

578
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,280
I haven't seen you for a long time.

579
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,800
I just wanted to ask you to come over and talk to me.

580
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,780
Look,

581
00:35:20,130 --> 00:35:22,850
I suddenly know that you're causing trouble for me again.

582
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,680
What were you talking about with Aon just now?

583
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,880
Ai wants to do a project

584
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:32,780
and wants to do some research in our factory.

585
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,830
But our factory is not ready yet.

586
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:36,800
Don't change the subject.

587
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,000
Tell me what happened to you again?

588
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,000
I borrowed money to buy digital currency,

589
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,680
which started out very well,

590
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,380
But then it went down.

591
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,630
Senior asked me to borrow money,

592
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,250
thinking that I can increase my position?

593
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
In the end, I was chased for debt.

594
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,900
I'll ask Ai for help.

595
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,780
I didn't mean to do that, Dad.

596
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,580
Give the money back to Ai.

597
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,750
Don't cause me any more trouble.

598
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,650
Ohm,

599
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:42,430
have you ever done anything that makes me proud?

600
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,450
Day by day,

601
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,330
can't you learn from Ai?

602
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,550
Where are we going to eat?

603
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,930
It's up to you,

604
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Okay.

605
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:03,750
Brother,

606
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,630
about the head of your dorm,

607
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,430
What's going on?

608
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,380
What is it?

609
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:11,030
What do you think?

610
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,680
It can't be true, right?

611
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,780
Senior Ai and Senior Songkhram have always been at odds,

612
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,830
and suddenly there are rumors that they are secretly dating,

613
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,050
Who would believe it?

614
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,080
I think it's true.

615
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,680
The whole university is saying that

616
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,380
senior Songkhram and senior Ai are dating,

617
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:31,800
Yeah, they were seen kissing me at the amusement park

618
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:36,430
over the weekend. I fought and ended up together.

619
00:37:36,650 --> 00:37:38,580
Senior Songkhram is such a black-bellied attacker

620
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:40,230
that he only flirts with Senior Ai all day,

621
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,380
But if they're together, I'll support them.

622
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,350
It's cute.

623
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,730
Absolutely not.

624
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,150
Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3,

625
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:50,930
you can't fall in love across dormitory buildings,

626
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:52,500
No, wait.

627
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,900
You and Plug are also from Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3, right?

628
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,100
Do you think we don't know?

629
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,950
But someone is really saying that

630
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,050
after class this morning,

631
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:06,230
The people in Dormitory 1 came to ask me and No,

632
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,050
do you think it's true?

633
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,580
What do you think?

634
00:38:12,730 --> 00:38:14,730
I've thought it was strange for a while

635
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,700
that they always like to fight,

636
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,550
But sometimes I see them talking and laughing.

637
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:21,700
Songkhram has loved Ai since he was a freshman.

638
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,850
Don't you know?

639
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,700
Wait.

640
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,450
Why didn't I know?

641
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,180
At first,

642
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,200
he pretended to be interested in me,

643
00:38:32,350 --> 00:38:34,380
I want Ai to be jealous and pay attention to him.

644
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,650
In the end, Ai misunderstood.

645
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,050
In the end, Songkhram gave up this stupid plan.

646
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,480
I think,

647
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,350
if he had gone after her directly from the start,

648
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:45,230
We've been together for a long time.

649
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,180
It's so complicated.

650
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,050
Sometimes people are just confused.

651
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:53,500
Have you ever been confused?

652
00:38:56,750 --> 00:38:57,650
Of course,

653
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,380
but not now.

654
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,550
Let's pretend we don't know.

655
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,650
If they want to talk about this,

656
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:08,230
they will tell us.

657
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,800
But you've told her all the gossip.

658
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,030
Oh, really?

659
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,750
What's going on between you two?

660
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,330
Bright Meen

661
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:22,500
Yo

662
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,530
Gosh, what's wrong with you?

663
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:24,830
Do you want me to expose you? PlusterPlug,

664
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,650
you have a situation too?

665
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,350
Don't say you and

666
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,050
No... How many pairs are there? I can't even count them.

667
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,580
I called you here today,

668
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:46,280
because I have something important to tell you.

669
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:52,930
Whether you're a freshman, a sophomore, a junior, a senior,

670
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,950
or the head of a dorm building?

671
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,500
If you don't attend the summer camp,

672
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:01,700
you won't be able to graduate successfully.

673
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,230
Summer camp

674
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
is no joke, boys and girls,

675
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,950
Summer camp is very important.

676
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,850
I want to emphasize to every dorm manager,

677
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:21,430
to bring all the dorm members to attend.

678
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,250
You're going to be

679
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:36,700
inseparable from each other in the later period.

680
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,730
Because I have to be the head of the dorm.

681
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,130
I don't like him. You think

682
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:50,630
I really want to work with you?

683
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,780
How long will it take

684
00:40:51,850 --> 00:40:53,500
to finish the work?

685
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,630
What are you doing?

686
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,150
I don't want to argue with you anymore.

687
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,400
It's like communicating with a madman.

688
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,780
Run away if you can't fight.

689
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:08,100
Dormitory No. 3 is useless,

690
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,580
do you think it's a good performance?

691
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,800
Just like watching a monkey play,

692
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,650
how long are we going to see them play?

693
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,430
Until they're exposed.

694
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:21,900
Then.

695
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:25,080
Let's help them. Don't work so hard. How about acting?

696
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,200
One macaroon is missing. -Wait a minute, but

697
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,230
I have you to eat with me.

698
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,550
I'm already very happy.

699
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,780
You're happy, aren't you?

700
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:47,530
I have something fun to do.

701
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,800
Let's go.

702
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,930
Delicious.

703
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,250
You sound like you have a date.

704
00:41:59,250 --> 00:41:59,730
Mind your own business.

705
00:41:59,730 --> 00:42:00,450
I'm leaving.

706
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,180
Shit,

707
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:03,150
Touch, why are you here?

708
00:42:03,150 --> 00:42:07,150
For the first time,

709
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,300
the world of tomorrow starts from today,

710
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,900
{ \ pos (547, 352) } = gay detector = Does anyone like the same sex

711
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,750
in this classroom?

712
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,430
Let's welcome Songkhram, the head of dormitory

713
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,230
2. Don't go up there.

714
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:20,900
Going up there is also a disturbance [ the more restrained, the deeper the

715
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:25,780
love ],

716
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,280
[ The more I resist, the more I care. ] [ Because you're more than

717
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:31,230
I can take. ],

718
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:34,230
[ When I look into your eyes, I feel excited. ] [ Is it wrong to say that I

719
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:37,330
like you directly? ]

720
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:43,330
[ I've been thinking about it a lot. ] [ Don't let yourself be

721
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:46,880
infatuated with you. ],
