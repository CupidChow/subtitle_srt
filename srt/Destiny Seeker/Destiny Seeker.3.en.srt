1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,350
Can you lend me 400 houses?

2
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:03,120
What did you say?

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,600
You have to pay back your debts.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,020
If you don't pay back the money,

5
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,200
you have to pay it back with something else.

6
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:10,870
Lend me 400 thousand.

7
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:12,120
This is for you.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,000
It means you have to pay it back.

9
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,420
The people in dormitory building 2 and dormitory building 3,

10
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:16,650
it's impossible to be together.

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,070
Everyone will reject you.

12
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:19,900
I want to read your diary every day, okay?

13
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:20,720
Wait,

14
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,600
how do you know my diary?

15
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,070
[ 1 year

16
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,750
ago ] Why are you in such a hurry?

17
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,400
Who wants to eat slowly?

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,600
I just need to finish my meal and go upstairs in time for the teacher to call the roll.

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,850
That's right. The last class was delayed,

20
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,120
and you have to come into the classroom on time for the next class.

21
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,320
You left us less than 20 minutes to eat.

22
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,350
What are you talking about?

23
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,820
Eat it in case you can't make it to me to translate it for you.

24
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,770
Yes.

25
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,500
Don't take mine.

26
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,370
I can't help it. You eat slowly.

27
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,200
Are you still playing?

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,170
Didn't you say you were in a hurry?

29
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,300
It's just that you should stop playing.

30
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:11,550
Hurry up and eat.

31
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,420
Remember to clean up the dishes when I'm full.

32
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,500
He is so good at summoning people.

33
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,450
Are you sure you'll still be the dorm manager next year?

34
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,470
It's Mr. Ai.

35
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,870
I'm leaving.

36
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:32,650
Wait for us.

37
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,000
We really won't wait.

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,970
I'm helping my freshman with the project today.

39
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,400
My junior on the third floor brought me egg tarts today.

40
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:13,220
I got the first place in the exam today.

41
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,220
Call mom. She's so happy.

42
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:26,970
Ai。

43
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,000
So cute.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,120
Is it so meticulous?

45
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,500
It seems that our relationship is not close enough.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,170
12,

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,170
this is the 12th book,

48
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,800
That means,

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,220
there are 11 diaries in front of this one.

50
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,650
It must be around here.

51
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,020
This is the last place I put it.

52
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,320
Did someone pick it up?

53
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,120
I even wrote a name.

54
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,500
What a bad luck.

55
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,300
Auntie,

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,970
have you seen a brown notebook?

57
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,870
Someone must have picked it up.

58
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,920
Kid, is this the one?

59
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,120
Someone found it.

60
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:42,600
That's it Auntie,

61
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,170
this is the notebook I'm looking for.

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,070
Where did you find it?

63
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,000
I didn't find it.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,850
A younger brother found it and gave it to me.

65
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,300
In case its owner

66
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,070
is looking for someone?

67
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,270
She suddenly got up early and became a gardener.

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,550
You don't need to hire a gardener, do you?

69
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,200
It's none of your business.

70
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,070
Hurry up. There are still 14 laps left.

71
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:44,220
Hurry up.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,250
Speed up.

73
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,600
Who did you punish early in the morning?

74
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,400
He killed the people

75
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,250
in our dormitory building. He didn't come back until the door was closed.

76
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,470
And the people in your dorm didn't come back before the entrance guard?

77
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,770
I happened to see it so I asked them to come to me in the morning.

78
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,900
You're just in time.

79
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:14,820
Just punish them according to the rules of your dorm.

80
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:16,200
Sweeping leaves,

81
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:17,520
picking up trash,

82
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,700
All right,

83
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,220
you can wait at the entrance of the dorm.

84
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:24,150
I'll take care of the rest.

85
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,770
I wanted to thank you.

86
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,500
You don't have to thank me.

87
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,800
If you have feelings for me,

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:43,200
write my name in your diary.

89
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,100
Here we go again.

90
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:45,720
How do you know about this?

91
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,120
I sneaked into your room. But you don't know,

92
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,920
Talk nicely. Don't joke with me.

93
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,000
How did you know about my diary?

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,800
To be honest,

95
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,550
you know I'm good.

96
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,600
Your mouth is pretty good.

97
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,020
Other parts are also very good.

98
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:00,600
You have a strong tongue, too.

99
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:03,720
Jerk

100
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:06,100
look at the name of your diary,

101
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,350
Love diary,

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,550
old antique,

103
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:12,450
You're a busybody too.

104
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,070
You know everything about other people.

105
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,150
I'm not in charge of everyone's business.

106
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:19,350
I only care about you.

107
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:24,070
Because what happened to you is the most interesting.

108
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,150
Jerk

109
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,320
All right,

110
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,370
let's get down to business. I've already made an appointment for you.

111
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,670
Do you mean you want to go on a date with me?

112
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,350
You're crazy.

113
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,920
I mean I helped you chase Meen.

114
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,720
I've made an appointment with Meen for you.

115
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:48,120
I asked you two to go on a date,

116
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,600
but in order not to be so abrupt, I'll go too this time,

117
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,050
I'll find a way to leave.

118
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,270
So you two can be alone.

119
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,670
Ai

120
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:00,670
Alright, I'll help you if I say I'll help you.

121
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,350
See you then. Let's go.

122
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,450
Tell Meen later that you happened to be here to buy something,

123
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:17,050
and then you happened to meet me.

124
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,000
Then I invited you to have dinner with me.

125
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:22,500
Does it take so much trouble just to have a meal?

126
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:23,950
Of course,

127
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,400
otherwise it would be abrupt,

128
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,570
Otherwise, why would I invite you to dinner all of a sudden?

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:31,450
Just say you invited me. What's so hard about that?

130
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,070
That doesn't look like it.

131
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,170
Just do as I say.

132
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,390
Yes.

133
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:38,000
Meen,

134
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,370
sorry I'm late.

135
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,350
It's okay. We just got here,

136
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:43,000
too. It's just right to sit here.

137
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:50,800
I happened to meet Songkhram downstairs,

138
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,370
so I invited him to dinner.

139
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:54,320
Yes.

140
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
Oh, yes.

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,320
I happened to run out of things in my room,

142
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,200
and it suddenly occurred to me that I would come to buy something today,

143
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,700
I happened to meet Ai downstairs,

144
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:09,570
and I suddenly got hungry.

145
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,150
And I haven't eaten yet.

146
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,820
All right. It's good to have dinner together.

147
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:17,370
I haven't had dinner with you for a long time,

148
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,250
Songkhram. Order whatever you want.

149
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
It's my treat today.

150
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,500
Songkhram said he wanted to invite you,

151
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,720
didn't he? -Yes.

152
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:29,220
Yes. Order whatever you want. It's my treat.

153
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,020
In fact, Songkhram is quite cute,

154
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,220
although his mouth is a little cheap,

155
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,770
But he's also... He's got

156
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,820
a good personality,

157
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,000
Yes.

158
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,200
Don't you have work today?

159
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,300
I'm free today.

160
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,870
I want to visit my friends today,

161
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,620
and have dinner with my friends,

162
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
That's great.

163
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,720
You two don't see each other very much.

164
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,150
How could we meet?

165
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:55,200
He's been in the crew

166
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,820
all day. Yes. I've been busy lately.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,470
We're making a series,

168
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,700
because the epidemic schedule has been pushed back.

169
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,700
Oh, Oh, PongMeen,

170
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,150
everyone praises you for being cute,

171
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,450
It's a perfect match.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,300
That's just in the play.

173
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,320
Am I still single in reality?

174
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,170
Songkhram, you're single too.

175
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,720
Are you single too? Ai,

176
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,050
what does it have to do with me?

177
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,970
I need to go to the bathroom first.

178
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,600
What are you doing? You haven't drunk the water yet.

179
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,650
Drink it.

180
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,750
I'll go to the bathroom first.

181
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,720
I haven't drunk the water yet. I can't believe

182
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,420
I'm going to pee.

183
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:48,520
He probably wants us to be alone on purpose.

184
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,450
There's something wrong with it.

185
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
-Okay. -It's cute.

186
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,050
You don't need to praise me.

187
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,520
Praise Ai.

188
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,450
You have no right to praise him.

189
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,250
I'm the only one who praises him.

190
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,400
How dare you say that to him?

191
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:05,820
He said he was cute.

192
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,000
He's doing his best to help you.

193
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:14,300
Yeah, I'm still worrying.

194
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,600
I just wanted him to be jealous at first,

195
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,100
but now he wants to set me up with you.

196
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:20,650
You started it yourself.

197
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,250
You also know that Ai is sincere

198
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,100
and will do his best to help anyone.

199
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,120
What do you mean?

200
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:30,350
Will he know that I like him?

201
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:32,600
Why don't you ask him?

202
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:35,400
I've been flirting with him and he doesn't know it at all?

203
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,000
When he comes back,

204
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,570
do you want me to ask him for you?

205
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,920
You really owe me a beating.

206
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,150
Oh, I don't have the guts.

207
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,570
I'm hungry.

208
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,470
Do you want to eat this?

209
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,900
Why don't you fill it yourself? Don't you have hands?

210
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:01,970
Give me the plate.

211
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:12,450
I have to go now.

212
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,920
Where are you going?

213
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,970
-Eat with me first. -That's right. Where are you in

214
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,920
a hurry?

215
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,470
I'll go back later.

216
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:23,120
Something went wrong with our project team,

217
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,400
Bright called me,

218
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,520
Let me help him

219
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,870
for a while.

220
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,200
I'll go back later.

221
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,870
It's not easy for you to have dinner with me,

222
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,620
but you really can't.

223
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,850
I have to hand in my report for the first class tomorrow.

224
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,920
Let me give you a ride.

225
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,420
No, I'm an adult. I can go back by myself.

226
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,800
Enjoy yourselves.

227
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,750
Are you really leaving?

228
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,300
Yeah, you can go back after eating.

229
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,000
Enjoy your meals and desserts.

230
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,570
Meen managed to spare some time.

231
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,600
Take good care of him. Songkhram,

232
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:57,450
see you later. I'm leaving.

233
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,100
I told you,

234
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,650
it's useless to pretend to chase me.

235
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,450
All the plans have been disrupted. I'll go.

236
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,100
What do you think of my idea?

237
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,670
Is there any sound after scanning the book?

238
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,800
Not bad. The app to help you with reading

239
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,270
is also good. I think the teacher will like it.

240
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,150
I'll take this one then.

241
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,470
I think it's too vague.

242
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,000
It sounds like it's in Program Mall or Play Mall,

243
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,900
and the target group is too wide and not clear,

244
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,200
Do you have a better idea?

245
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,850
Have you ever been to any museums, palaces or churches abroad?

246
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,050
There are usually phonetic guide books,

247
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,720
but there are basically no Thai language.

248
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,970
I want to build an app,

249
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,670
so that tourists like us,

250
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,850
You don't have to rely on the phonetic guide book

251
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,000
of that place. Yeah, that sounds good.

252
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,220
I understand.

253
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:58,370
When we go abroad to play, we only have the main language,

254
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,170
but not Thai.

255
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:00,970
Think about it,

256
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,770
when we go somewhere, having Thai

257
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,150
will make people feel super happy.

258
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,700
It would be even better if everyone could download the app in advance.

259
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,750
So you don't have to share headphones with others.

260
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,450
You can use your own headphones,

261
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,770
if this app covers all languages and all tourist attractions,

262
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,920
This way, we can be global.

263
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,070
That's equivalent to a voice-guided version of Ankeda.

264
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,200
I think this one is good too.

265
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,420
I think we need to do a lot of data and communicate with tourist attractions,

266
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,870
and also translate the language,

267
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:32,550
I'm not sure. Will all visitors download it?

268
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:35,770
It will be enough if you can catch Chinese tourists.

269
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:39,700
As for tourist attractions, Thailand alone can't count them.

270
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,650
That's right. Ai is really convenient.

271
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,120
Some places have to be rented and some places have to be lined up.

272
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,770
There are places where we don't have enough equipment

273
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:48,870
and we can make a lot of money,

274
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:51,320
If we can collect tourist attractions from all over the world,

275
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,350
that's right Bright

276
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,450
It would be great if we had them in every language.

277
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,700
When tourists come to play, they can feel fun

278
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,450
and have a sense of substitution for local scenic spots.

279
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:01,570
That's right, Ai. This is clearly to promote tourism business.

280
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:04,270
Look, even Tongpha agreed to it.

281
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,920
Who wouldn't use it if it's so convenient?

282
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,120
That's right,

283
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,650
Bright. It's clean and safe.

284
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,620
This way, everyone can feel at ease.

285
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,150
That's right, Ai. That's right.

286
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,720
Bright is so nice. If we hit it off,

287
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,270
What do the others think?

288
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,500
Songkhram, what do you think?

289
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,320
Who is Songkhram's target group?

290
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,750
A blind person, an old person with poor eyesight,

291
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,450
or anyone who doesn't want to read,

292
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,570
How many languages do you think there are?

293
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,250
It should start with Thai,

294
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:38,020
but I think it should start with English,

295
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,220
Because it can be used for all genders and ages,

296
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,270
but from a functional point of view,

297
00:14:42,270 --> 00:14:45,550
It sounds like Google Maps, right?

298
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,070
That's right. Trackreader App.

299
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,000
As long as we have smart Microsoft like Google Maps,

300
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:53,670
But Bright's language is translated,

301
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:56,420
so that native speakers can record

302
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,850
according to local tourist attractions or museums.

303
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,470
And then it becomes a phonetic guide book.

304
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,850
That's right.

305
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,520
I voted for the Trackreader,

306
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,770
I voted for the voice guide book,

307
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,170
Trackreader

308
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,500
voice guide book,

309
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:17,520
A phonetic guide book.

310
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,150
A phonetic guide book.

311
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,100
Ai chose me.

312
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:38,400
A lot of people in the second grade failed Dr. Phalot's quiz,

313
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,950
and a lot of people came to ask me

314
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,870
how did we pass at that time?

315
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,770
Now they all like to play.

316
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:48,500
I think I need to find time to talk to them seriously.

317
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,800
Senior Ai, Senior Touch,

318
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,370
bad news. Senior, come down with me.

319
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,070
Calm down.

320
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,070
Tell me more clearly.

321
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:54,320
What's wrong with who?

322
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,350
Senior Meen was called away.

323
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:57,870
Meen, what's wrong?

324
00:15:59,250 --> 00:15:59,920
Here's the thing. Senior,

325
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,450
tell me the main content. Get to the point. Don't talk nonsense.

326
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,550
Yes No

327
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,700
But you have to be serious when it comes to something important.

328
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:10,570
Senior Meen's Power Engineering 3 may not pass.

329
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,800
I'll go.

330
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,470
If you can't do it again, you really can't make it.

331
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:14,800
Besides, he has just been suspended for one year,

332
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:18,070
so he has too much work to attend school.

333
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,100
How did you know? No,

334
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,270
I'm Meen's roommate.

335
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,920
Recently, Senior Meen doesn't come back to the dorm much,

336
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,000
but he doesn't come back often.

337
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:27,970
You're beside the point again.

338
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,220
No When I finished this morning,

339
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:32,200
Senior Meen went out early in the morning,

340
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,850
He moved a bunch of books,

341
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,150
and I asked him where he was going?

342
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,970
He didn't want to tell me.

343
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,070
You don't want me to go with you.

344
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,120
I kept pestering him until he told me,

345
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,070
all you have to do is tell you what Meen told you.

346
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,650
Don't you know how to sum it up?

347
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:46,750
Be careful that you'll get swollen in the end.

348
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:51,850
Meen,

349
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,920
why didn't you tell us something?

350
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,170
Yeah, that's right. We can help you.

351
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:00,800
Gosh.

352
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,270
How are you doing, guys?

353
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,120
The reason why I don't want to tell you

354
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:10,670
is because of this. Does the whole university know?

355
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:15,520
Meen, stop and talk to me.

356
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,200
Uh-huh. I'll call back later.

357
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,600
Why are you laughing?

358
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:27,000
I know you have a lot of work to do,

359
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,170
but you have to allocate your time.

360
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,720
Yes, sir,

361
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,870
I really don't come to class very often,

362
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,670
Do you know that if you fail this course,

363
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,150
you won't be able to register for many courses next semester.

364
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,200
I've really helped you to the fullest.

365
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,200
-Write the report and give it to me. -Okay.

366
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,350
In the next week,

367
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,470
we'll find ideas.

368
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,900
If you can do it, I'll pass.

369
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,000
Okay,

370
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,800
thank you. I'll try to do it.

371
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
Yes.

372
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,920
I said it because I was worried about you.

373
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,600
You've been anxious for days.

374
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,970
Thank you, but I can do it.

375
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,050
Just think about it.

376
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:12,600
Well, you don't have to worry.

377
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,020
We'll help you later.

378
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,750
Well, we all passed this subject. I want to

379
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,850
thank you guys for a while.

380
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,050
I want to help you too.

381
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:23,870
But I don't know anything.

382
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,450
You can help.

383
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,670
Go ahead.

384
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,570
Let's go back to the dorm.

385
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,620
Or don't talk too much when you're with us.

386
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,150
If that's the case,

387
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:35,950
I'm glad you're here.

388
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,520
Take a look at my things.

389
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,970
I need to go to the toilet.

390
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,320
Yes.

391
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,170
Be careful, bro.

392
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,250
Let's take a photo together

393
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:54,120
later, Senior.

394
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,850
I'm here to help the seniors with their homework.

395
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,750
Bright, what's wrong?

396
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:28,750
What are you doing?

397
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,050
I'm helping Meen with her homework.

398
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:33,270
I remember Bright is a top student.

399
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,470
Is there anything I can do for you? Ai,

400
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,570
help Meen Senior Bright,

401
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,070
Yes.

402
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,770
Come on,

403
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:52,300
[ Bright and Ai are getting along at the coffee shop, bro. ] Senior Songkhram, aren't you an expert

404
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,370
in engineering?

405
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,270
He's so handsome. Senior Songkhram,

406
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,850
is there anything I can do for you?

407
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:14,650
You look very busy and anxious, don't you?

408
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,000
You ran in such a hurry.

409
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,720
That's how I exercise every day,

410
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,520
Bright. You have to be as strong as me.

411
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:25,570
Our Room 2 has always been so strong,

412
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,350
I didn't see you practicing today.

413
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,170
Then why are you here?

414
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:33,920
Bright came to help Meen with the report,

415
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,770
but I don't go to class very often.

416
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,900
If your score is very low, you might fail.

417
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,670
So I asked the teacher to give me more homework.

418
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:43,570
Songkhram can learn to be a bully. It would be great

419
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,870
if he could help you.

420
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,820
Sure. I wanted to help.

421
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:50,550
Go and sit next to Meen.

422
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,650
Sit closer to him. Come on.

423
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,450
This one.

424
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,970
Did you see that?

425
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,550
It'll be over as soon as Song comes.

426
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:27,420
We've come up with the main idea.

427
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,870
No. There's also Ai's idea.

428
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,150
I have to go. I have an appointment.

429
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,820
Wait. There's nothing I can do here.

430
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,520
-I'll go back to the dorm and sleep. -Okay. Bye, guys.

431
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,870
It's

432
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:54,270
too late now. Are you hungry?

433
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,100
I'll buy food for you later.

434
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,770
Do you want me to help?

435
00:21:58,270 --> 00:21:59,470
I'll go help.

436
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,050
Meen, do your homework first.

437
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,350
How can I do that? Everyone, help me.

438
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,670
Of course I have to buy it.

439
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,870
My treat.

440
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,000
No need.

441
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,620
It's enough for you to bring the money.

442
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,070
I'll buy it later.

443
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,720
Ai, don't you want to help me?

444
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,520
Okay, let's go.

445
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:27,170
Thank you, Songkhram Ai

446
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,220
Yes.

447
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,320
What the heck are you playing?

448
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,920
No.

449
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,270
You can be with Meen.

450
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,750
Meen doesn't like me.

451
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,500
He likes Bright,

452
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,370
How do you know?

453
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,000
He told me.

454
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,970
Are you okay?

455
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,120
I'm fine.

456
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:18,650
Because actually, I... -Senior Song, Senior Ai, you

457
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,620
have a good eye.

458
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,470
Does my name have two student numbers?

459
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,850
Don't call me

460
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:33,950
Song. My name is Songkhram.

461
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,600
Your name is Song.

462
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,800
It sounds like he's calling Turalisong,

463
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,020
TualisongkhramAi,

464
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,270
you brat.

465
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,900
Where are you going?

466
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:47,120
If you really want to know, come with us.

467
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,200
Are you really not going to talk to me?

468
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,100
I don't know what to say?

469
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,570
Didn't someone already chat with you?

470
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,850
What do you mean?

471
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,050
Just like everyone said.

472
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,020
You like Ai?

473
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,620
Why do you ask?

474
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,020
Do you like Ai too?

475
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,820
Senior Plug-Meen Senior Bright

476
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,750
Hello, what are you doing here?

477
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,750
What's wrong? Why do you look so serious?

478
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,170
Don't bother

479
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,650
about your homework.

480
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,400
I bought you snacks.

481
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,850
Look at the auspicious pastry.

482
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:45,650
It's delicious.

483
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,150
Let your brain rest when you're tired of studying.

484
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,220
What kind of card is this, Senior Ai?

485
00:24:58,170 --> 00:25:01,020
Every filling pastry has its own meaning.

486
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,720
So I wrote it on the card.

487
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:12,270
What's the meaning of the food you're eating?

488
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:13,950
Red bean stuffing,

489
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,120
meaning love,

490
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:22,450
Oh, are you in a relationship?

491
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,870
Shut up!

492
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:25,700
Eat your food.

493
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,750
That's a lot of nonsense.

494
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,000
Why are you laughing?

495
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:34,970
Isn't this Nano's?

496
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,250
Really?

497
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,700
Give it to me. I'll give it back to him.

498
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,920
It's okay. I'm going back to the dorm.

499
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,470
I'll give it to him by the way.

500
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:44,970
I'm leaving.

501
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,650
Goodbye, seniors.

502
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,770
Eat, eat, eat.

503
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
Thank you.

504
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:19,500
You're welcome.

505
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,420
Let's go.

506
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,100
Would you like to have dinner with me?

507
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,020
Would you like to have dinner with me?

508
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,220
Do you want me to invite you

509
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,670
to have a drink later?

510
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,420
I don't want it.

511
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,250
Oh, so you can play basketball.

512
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:47,470
Then you can play with me.

513
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,420
Isn't it fun to play with me?

514
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,350
Headache?

515
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,120
Headache for what? -Yes,

516
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:58,750
Thank you for what happened today.

517
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:00,670
It's no big deal. Make sure

518
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,050
to go through the arrangement.

519
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,100
Got it.

520
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,400
Let's go. See you later.

521
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:11,150
Yeah, see you later.

522
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:22,220
Touch, what can you eat to get a dirty place?

523
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,770
You are not allowed to go to my bed.

524
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:24,550
Get down here!

525
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:25,870
You're so.

526
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,520
You ate dirty.

527
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:31,170
No, why are you using so many tissues?

528
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,000
Just throw it away. What do you mean

529
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,020
by throwing it away? What a waste! -Just

530
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,000
throw it away. It's a lot less.

531
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,750
Not much.

532
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,250
Look, there are many more.

533
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,650
Remember to buy it and give it back to me.

534
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:40,950
Okay, I'll buy it for you. -Touch, I'm

535
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,750
going to kick you out.

536
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,320
The bread is really delicious.

537
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,200
I'm going to celebrate

538
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,120
tonight. I've booked a table.

539
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,420
My treat.

540
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,250
I'll go take a shower and dress up first.

541
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,120
Hurry up.

542
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,820
I'll go upstairs and pack up the food.

543
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,700
I guess it's rotten by now.

544
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,350
Meet at the gate of the dormitory building at 8 p. m.,

545
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,850
and obey the leader of the building,

546
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,170
You left your shoes behind.

547
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,970
Hello, Song

548
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,250
Passed.

549
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,920
[ Did you know that Meen passed this assignment? ] [

550
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,450
I'm so happy. ],

551
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,170
[ Are you going tonight? ].

552
00:28:47,170 --> 00:28:49,250
[ Little brat, you've read it and never replied. ] [ Are

553
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:51,250
you watching porn? ] [ Pinch!

554
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,600
Or what are you doing? ],

555
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,550
= Don't overdo it = = Are you

556
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,620
going or not =,

557
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,650
[ Answer

558
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,220
me. ] Are you done?

559
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,470
Do you have anything else to do?

560
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,020
You just keep bothering me

561
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,750
to come out on the balcony,

562
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:15,870
If you don't come out,

563
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:18,050
I'll go to your dorm and look for you.

564
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,570
Are you done annoying?

565
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,450
Do you know Meen passed the exam?

566
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:24,520
It won't stick to you anymore.

567
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,250
How could I not know?

568
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,750
Does Meen live in the same dormitory building as me?

569
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,220
I thought you didn't know.

570
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,920
That's why I came to tell you,

571
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,650
you lunatic!

572
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,320
Meen asked us to have a drink. Are you coming?

573
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:40,070
I want to... I want to stop drinking for a while.

574
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,750
Go ahead,

575
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,450
Ai. I don't have much time.

576
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,700
But if you beg me,

577
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,120
I can think about it a little bit.

578
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:50,920
You really know how to put on airs.

579
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,650
Tell your roommates to have a good time.

580
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,670
Ai, go ahead.

581
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,000
Okay...

582
00:29:58,870 --> 00:30:00,300
I want you to go.

583
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,370
What are you doing, Songkhram?

584
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:05,000
I want to see you.

585
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,650
Are you going or not?

586
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,220
All right.

587
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,100
Go ahead then.

588
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:17,150
That's cute.

589
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,400
You're so cute.

590
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:20,200
I'm from Dormitory No. 3. It's a handsome dorm, not a cute

591
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,620
dorm.

592
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,320
You brat.

593
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,570
Get down and follow my car when you're done.

594
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:28,900
I'm in a hurry.

595
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,320
Just wait and see.

596
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,020
Our dorm made an appointment at 8 pm.

597
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:34,070
Oh.

598
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,650
Shit, it's only 7: 15. You're really good at putting on

599
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,750
airs.

600
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,820
Enjoy yourselves today.

601
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,620
But if someone drinks and quarrels,

602
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:00,670
that person will pay the bill.

603
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:02,300
Tell it to your friend.

604
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,470
Oh, really?

605
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,320
That's Bae.

606
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,020
He's a playboy.

607
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,700
I've seen his videos,

608
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,120
I don't like him very much.

609
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:12,520
He always likes to drink.

610
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,320
I've been ridiculed by many people recently.

611
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:20,300
Hello, Meen. -Hello.

612
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,350
Have you been here long?

613
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:22,370
I've been here for a while.

614
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,670
It's a big show today.

615
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,150
Everyone, this is Bae.

616
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,470
-Hello. -Hello. Cheers. Come

617
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:34,850
on,

618
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,100
Cheers,

619
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,950
Cheers!

620
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,200
I'm awake now.

621
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,820
Go on. Come on,

622
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,400
Cheers,

623
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,320
Everyone is done. Hurry up.

624
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,270
No, what's wrong with you?

625
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,220
Why aren't you talking?

626
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:15,570
I've said everything before you came.

627
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:16,750
Mind your own business. Yes,

628
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,700
I can rest assured that I can swear.

629
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,570
Thank you for the other day.

630
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:26,520
Come to dinner with me.

631
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:28,670
I just want a free meal.

632
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,070
We can also have free drinks today.

633
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,450
Senior Meen's treat.

634
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:36,420
The kids in dormitory building 2 don't give orders.

635
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,550
Whether I drink or not is my business.

636
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,700
Come on.

637
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,800
-Cheers. -Cheers. Everyone, cheers.

638
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,670
Cheers!

639
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,200
Cheers.

640
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:05,620
Senior.

641
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,320
Let's walk back.

642
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:31,970
Let's go one by one.

643
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:32,950
Cheer up.

644
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:34,070
You love dancing.

645
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:47,170
I'll be right back.

646
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,400
Go on, go on.

647
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,270
Keep dancing. -Don't stop.

648
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,870
Can you do it?

649
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:55,620
Okay,

650
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,650
We'll go back first.

651
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:00,850
Where are you going?

652
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:02,120
Meen, I can't do it. Okay,

653
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,820
go ahead.

654
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,900
Be careful.

655
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,870
Be careful.

656
00:34:08,970 --> 00:34:10,250
I've finished drinking too.

657
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,350
What's wrong?

658
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,070
My mom is in the hospital.

659
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,870
We're leaving, too.

660
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:21,650
Okay, okay.

661
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,550
How is mom?

662
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,820
I'm going to hug the baby

663
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,950
when I get here. Mom is fine.

664
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,550
I'm really worried about you going to the hospital.

665
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:52,450
What did the doctor say?

666
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,670
It's still an old asthma problem.

667
00:34:58,250 --> 00:35:00,020
Mom, take good care of yourself.

668
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,000
Wear a mask There's a lot of dust lately,

669
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:07,100
so it's hard to breathe because of wearing a mask,

670
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:11,600
There should be a mask with fresh air.

671
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,220
Is this your friend?

672
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,450
Hello,

673
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,450
mom, my friend from college,

674
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:23,870
He sent me here.

675
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,570
Thank you so much, son.

676
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:27,820
What's your name?

677
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,670
His name is Songkhram.

678
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,600
It's late and I'm sorry to bother you.

679
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,520
It's okay. I'd love to.

680
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:36,320
Ai's mother is just like my mother. Thank you

681
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,920
very much, son.

682
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,000
Have you eaten?

683
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:43,370
Mom, what about you?

684
00:35:43,370 --> 00:35:44,700
Have you eaten?

685
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,970
You know,

686
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,450
it might be the last meal.

687
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:57,970
Yes.

688
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,750
What's wrong with you?

689
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,250
Ai, that's how he is.

690
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:31,300
Every time he can't control it, he's like this.

691
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, perfectionism,

692
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,050
You don't like uncontrollable things, do you?

693
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:41,270
You know so much.

694
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:43,100
Are you talking about mom?

695
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,750
No.

696
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,120
I'm talking about Songkhram.

697
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:50,550
Ai, why would you say "Mom" if you're worried about me?

698
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,650
Did you guys come here after dinner?

699
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,920
Yes. -Yes.

700
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,500
Do you want to stop first?

701
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,150
It's dangerous to eat while driving.

702
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,600
It's late. The dorm door is closed.

703
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,400
I'm in a hurry and I'm still hungry.

704
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,000
You lied to me that you had dinner,

705
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,300
but you lied to me too.

706
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,450
To reassure you,

707
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:30,950
I didn't lie.

708
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:32,900
I ate a little at the tavern.

709
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,920
Okay,

710
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,470
I don't want to eat first.

711
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:39,350
I promise I'll send you to your dorm safely.

712
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,670
Thank you so much for helping me today.

713
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,600
It's okay.

714
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,520
You're always there when I'm in trouble.

715
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:13,950
Oh no.

716
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,470
What happened to the car?

717
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,850
I don't know either.

718
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,570
There's nothing damaged.

719
00:38:26,770 --> 00:38:28,720
I thought you knew how to fix it.

720
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:31,900
Ai, I studied aviation. If this is an airplane,

721
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,870
I'll fix it for you.

722
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:35,900
You're a mechanic, aren't you? You do it.

723
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,120
No wonder.

724
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,120
Don't tell me we're out of gas.

725
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,950
You idiot Songkhram.

726
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,550
Don't you even look at the screen?

727
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,870
What if the plane runs out of gas on the lane one?

728
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:28,970
I don't know what to do.

729
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:39,750
When will the oil be delivered?

730
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,300
I want to say sorry.

731
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,820
You're in a hurry today

732
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,620
because I'm fine. Don't think too much.

733
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,420
Your hands are too dirty.

734
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,220
It's okay.

735
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:06,950
I'm willing to be a dirty person today.

736
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:13,070
Is this dirty?

737
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,900
What time is it now?

738
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,700
It will be 11 o'clock in one minute.

739
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,950
Do you think it's too late?

740
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:03,170
Why didn't anyone answer the phone?

741
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,070
Meen Touch Nano Alasa

742
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,770
Is everyone asleep at this hour?

743
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,920
What should I do now?

744
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,970
Hello,

745
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:26,520
Ubon. Open the dorm door for me.

746
00:41:26,950 --> 00:41:28,570
I didn't respond when I scanned the key card outside,

747
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,250
so you can leave after you open it.

748
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,520
Thank you so much.

749
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,750
That's it.

750
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:38,700
That's very kind of you. What am I going to do?

751
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:39,970
Find a place to sleep.

752
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,450
Where does his mother want me to sleep now?

753
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:43,620
Sleep with me.

754
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:44,720
Nervous,

755
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:46,120
I'm the head of Dormitory 3,

756
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,920
Go to sleep with the head of dormitory building No. 2.

757
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:49,300
It's impossible.

758
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,620
Hurry up.

759
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,570
Why didn't you turn on the light?

760
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:03,670
Do you want others to see you or do you want the camera to capture you?

761
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:05,070
Yes.

762
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:16,200
There's an elevator. Why don't you take the safe passage?

763
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,670
The camera on our floor is broken.

764
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:20,000
We can turn on the light now.

765
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,200
Lend me your phone. My phone is out of battery.

766
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,520
Here,

767
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:29,250
Why didn't you turn on the corridor lights?

768
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:33,200
You're so talkative. -What?

769
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,420
Come in. What are you waiting for?

770
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,500
Whose voice is that?

771
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:07,000
Who turned off the light in the tunnel?

772
00:43:43,650 --> 00:43:44,750
Songkhram

773
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:48,500
Yes.

774
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:55,420
You like Ai, don't you?

775
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,600
It's not from Dorm 3. It's from Dorm

776
00:44:01,750 --> 00:44:03,500
2. I've been helping you with your revision.

777
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:05,850
You have to know how to do it, Ai.

778
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:08,900
Do you think I'll let you get close to Ai so easily?

779
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,350
Meen, make up your mind.

780
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:12,000
Let go of what Bright said.

781
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,200
It's a waste of four years.
