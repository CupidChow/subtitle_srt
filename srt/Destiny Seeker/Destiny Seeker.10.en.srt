1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:01,770
Surprise or not surprise.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,670
Couple outfit?

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:05,550
I, Songkhram, the head of dormitory 2,

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,220
and I, the head of dormitory 3, Ai,

5
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,900
We've been together for 2 months and 8 days,

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,700
and the investor has decided to let you two go back.

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,150
And continue to improve your creativity.

8
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,850
Then I'll give it to you next week for the presentation.

9
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,870
What should we do if this happens

10
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,420
for the first time? Senior, I want to beat them.

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,770
Don't worry.

12
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,220
It's been years since I graduated,

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,300
but if any of my dorm members need help,

14
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,870
I'll do my best to help.

15
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,250
Especially to lead you to defeat Ai and Songkhram.

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,750
You're such a two-faced person.

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,250
Ai tried every means to find money to help you.

18
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,220
You can do it.

19
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,870
You don't have to say so much nonsense.

20
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:55,820
How much will you pay me?

21
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,900
It depends on what you can give me.

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,450
I can give you everything.

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:42,900
Senior, why do you think Senior Ai asked us to come to the meeting?

24
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,620
Maybe it's the announcement of the new dorm manager.

25
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,300
What?

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,220
Who is it?

27
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:48,850
I don't know either.

28
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,950
Over there.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,600
Look at Senior Songkhram,

30
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,550
going in and out of our dorm is like going in and out of your own dorm.

31
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,750
So unburdened?

32
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,100
So what?

33
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,000
You frequently go in and out of Dormitory 2 now,

34
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,770
and you haven't asked the chief for advice, have you?

35
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,650
Did Senior Bright tell you that?

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,650
How did Bright know that?

37
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:11,950
No, I didn't.

38
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,700
It's all exposed.

39
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,170
-You'd better shut up. -No. You should know why

40
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,750
I called you here, right?

41
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:25,620
Are you going to announce your happy event with Songkhram?

42
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,950
Songkhram, why are you here for the meeting in Dormitory 3?

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,970
Getting in and out of here these days is like going in and out of your own dorm.

44
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,270
You guys are so nosy.

45
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:45,550
Don't mind my business.

46
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:47,070
After listening to your dorm manager's speech,

47
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:50,950
I asked you to come to the meeting today.

48
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,000
It's to announce the next dorm manager.

49
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,670
-Who is it? -Ai didn't

50
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,070
know I

51
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,400
would change the rules for running for dorm manager this year.

52
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:03,100
It's no longer chosen by the previous building manager.

53
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,270
But you need to choose for yourselves.

54
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,150
I will adopt an electoral system,

55
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:07,600
an election,

56
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,800
Election for what?

57
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:14,370
Your future is up to you.

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,970
Who has a junior in mind?

59
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:18,300
And think that person has a sense of responsibility,

60
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,920
and can be your support.

61
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
Then tell Senior Touch,

62
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,620
when the list is ready.

63
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:25,820
We'll put voting links in the group tonight at 8: 00. Come on,

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,150
guys.

65
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,450
Gather together.

66
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:35,900
You're trying to break the dormitory system we've had for decades.

67
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,970
If we change the rules for running for the head of the dorm,

68
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:40,670
should we change the rules for dormitory building 2, Senior Songkhram?

69
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,270
How did you elect the head of the dorm?

70
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,870
You want to know?

71
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:45,920
Ask your girlfriend yourself.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,600
What about you? Does Meen

73
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:51,920
also want to know?

74
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,700
Leave me out of this.

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,020
Get lost

76
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,570
Ai, let's go.

77
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:01,120
If there's anything that can't be solved,

78
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,270
don't call Ai and me.

79
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,720
Ask Bright directly,

80
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,670
Yes.

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm leaving.

82
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,220
Bye. -Bye.

83
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,750
It's our first time in the rain together.

84
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,820
Here you are.

85
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,870
I came to your house today.

86
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,150
Do you want it?

87
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,870
Yes.

88
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:07,200
I love you.

89
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,720
I love you too.

90
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:20,750
Come on!

91
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,850
You can do it.

92
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,620
Yes.

93
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,670
Come on!

94
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,300
Bright, what's wrong with you?

95
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,170
I think we've met someone who always looks at us

96
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,600
differently. What's wrong with that?

97
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:41,120
You look like you're beating me up, you smile like a witch,

98
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,850
and you look arrogant, which makes me annoyed.

99
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:45,070
I don't know what to say.

100
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,650
They might be targeting Songkhram,

101
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,270
as if they were trying to scare him.

102
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,250
-You too. -Ai, relax.

103
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,750
Relax.

104
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,550
Your recommendation is impeccable.

105
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,820
No problem.

106
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:58,920
I'm trying not to be nervous.

107
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,770
Don't put pressure on Ai.

108
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,750
My partner is anxious.

109
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,620
Let's welcome Pure Air.

110
00:10:22,450 --> 00:10:23,850
We can do it.

111
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,120
One, two,

112
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,100
three, go!

113
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,770
Are you really doing this? Touch

114
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,070
Pure Air Car.

115
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,820
It's OK.

116
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,220
It feels good.

117
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,550
Look, they've been looking at our work.

118
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,700
Don't worry too much.

119
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,350
You don't have to think too much.

120
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,520
You've done a good job.

121
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,420
I did my best.

122
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,870
Let's welcome Fresh Air.

123
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,120
What are you looking at?

124
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,300
Forget it.

125
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,900
I don't like them.

126
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,470
About our decision,

127
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,970
for this year's sand table promotion meeting... the last group

128
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:19,800
to receive 10 million yuan of funding is.

129
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,670
No.

130
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,520
My girlfriend has done her best.

131
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,200
We did our best, bro.

132
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,450
The presentations of both groups are excellent.

133
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,800
But two groups of ideas that were interesting.

134
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,350
I don't know why it's gone.

135
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,920
Compared to today's recommendation,

136
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,750
I prefer the previous recommendation,

137
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,820
It's a grand idea,

138
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,150
but it's hard to control.

139
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,070
Everything is terrible.

140
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,050
10million is not enough anyway.

141
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,000
Most importantly,

142
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:14,350
the ideas of the two teams are very similar to what they published.

143
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,950
I don't know who plagiarized who.

144
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:25,550
What's wrong with you, Songkhram?

145
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,820
I can't stand to see you sad.

146
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,520
When you did this,

147
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,550
I thought I wouldn't cry at first.

148
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,400
When I saw the tears in your eyes,

149
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,650
I was soft-hearted,

150
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,100
I'm OK.

151
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,250
I know you're sad.

152
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:49,070
I'm sad,

153
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,400
but I'm not hurt.

154
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm a little numb.

155
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,720
Just pretend that this is not the real me.

156
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,970
I've published all my ideas for today.

157
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,700
But I didn't put myself into it.

158
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,350
Yeah, me too.

159
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:06,320
I don't know why I didn't devote myself

160
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,400
to it. Thank you all.

161
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:10,570
You are the best team.

162
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,820
Is there anything worse than today?

163
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,870
It's already bad enough today.

164
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,850
I really can't stand anything worse than this.

165
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,850
It's okay, man.

166
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:29,670
That's right. Everything can be solved.

167
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,420
[ I heard the news about your project. I'm sorry, too. ] You're

168
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:50,170
so mean.

169
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,750
Ai tried every means to find money to help you.

170
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,500
How much will you pay me?

171
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,920
It depends on what you can give me.

172
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,820
I can really buy everything

173
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,850
with all the money I can give you.

174
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,220
Whether it's a cat, a dog or the cheapest thing on the 100 thousand.

175
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,320
Jerk Ohm,

176
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,620
I'll go.

177
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,670
I'm sorry. It's all because of me.

178
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,000
It's okay,

179
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,150
Ai. It's not your fault.

180
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,650
It's all because of me.

181
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,800
Because I have a brother like him,

182
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,750
Ohm is the one who keeps everyone from getting the money on the sand table

183
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,000
Calm down

184
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,450
Ai jerk.

185
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,450
From now on, you should break up with him.

186
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,400
Why is Ai here?

187
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,400
Have a seat. Do you want some coffee?

188
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,300
No, I don't want to drink anything.

189
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,620
I just want to talk to you.

190
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,850
About what?

191
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,050
It's so important that you have to come to me at home.

192
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,320
Did I do anything that made you unhappy?

193
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,500
What are you talking about?

194
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,320
Will I be dissatisfied with you?

195
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:12,120
Right?

196
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,650
Whether you're in dire straits or upset,

197
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,850
I'll always be there for you when there's a problem.

198
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:21,470
I've never rejected you.

199
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,600
Then why did you do this to me?

200
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,550
What are you trying to say?

201
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:29,670
Tell me, Ohm,

202
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,550
why did you sell my stuff to those people?

203
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,600
For what?

204
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,070
What are you doing,

205
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,320
Ai? I know that ever since you started dating that jerk Songkhram,

206
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,250
But you don't have to slander me like this.

207
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,970
I'm your relative.

208
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:50,950
Just because you're my relative,

209
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,650
that's why I'm so sad.

210
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,250
That's enough.

211
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,200
I don't want to listen to these jerks anymore.

212
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,850
If you still can't figure it out,

213
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,420
get out of my house.

214
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,270
How much will you pay me?

215
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,870
It depends on what you can give me.

216
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:19,250
It's all because of you.

217
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,900
You think those people in Dormitory 2 are better than me,

218
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,850
and you left me?

219
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:28,450
You betrayed me in front of the whole grade.

220
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,570
Is that it?

221
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,720
Yeah, that's it?

222
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:37,120
But what you call this is a big deal for me.

223
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,970
You probably don't know what I've been through.

224
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,620
After your girlfriend and your friend rejected me,

225
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,370
I had to team up with those poor students.

226
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:49,900
They just came up with some stupid ideas.

227
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,300
The judges of Ai looked down on me

228
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,670
and looked down on other groups. They looked at me like stupid.

229
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,820
Have you ever thought about it?

230
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:59,750
How do I feel?

231
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,470
You betrayed me,

232
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,420
because I didn't take care of you for the only time.

233
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,000
Just once?

234
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,670
Have you ever thought of me as your brother?

235
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,370
We grew up playing together,

236
00:17:19,570 --> 00:17:22,050
how much have I helped you?

237
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,850
How much do I care?

238
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,120
But you hurt me.

239
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,770
You have to bear your sins.

240
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,700
I'll help you ten times.

241
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,770
You chose not to remember.

242
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:44,870
But you chose to remember my unintentional eleventh time.

243
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:49,370
But you betrayed me

244
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,100
on purpose,

245
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,850
You deliberately ruined the concentration and efforts of my friends and me.

246
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,270
How much is it?

247
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:09,570
How much did he give you

248
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,400
for the things you sold?

249
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,920
Since you sold it.

250
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,770
You and I are no longer brothers.

251
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,970
From now on, don't tell anyone that

252
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:43,650
you know me and you are my relative.

253
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,750
Don't say hello

254
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:49,150
when you pass by. We're strangers.

255
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:54,400
Well, that's your business.

256
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,820
Do you think I care? Ai,

257
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,100
let's go.

258
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:00,700
To be with your perfect partner.

259
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,350
Don't pester me.

260
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,650
If you don't want to know him,

261
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,370
don't know him. Are you OK? Boyfriend?

262
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,120
Yes.

263
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,320
Hold on.

264
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,800
What are the dirty pants?

265
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,850
What did Ohm do to you?

266
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,850
I'll take care of it for you later.

267
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,270
I poured coffee on him.

268
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,550
Is the coffee cold or hot?

269
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,170
It's cold.

270
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,500
Why don't you pour it hot?

271
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,470
Because I didn't expect that

272
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,850
Ohm didn't do anything to you, right?

273
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,500
OK

274
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,750
Come here.

275
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,050
Let this matter end.

276
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,450
Yes.

277
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:09,950
Can you promise me one thing?

278
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:12,970
Yes.

279
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,700
If you're mad at me,

280
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,550
you can't splash coffee on me.

281
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,300
OK, you smiled.

282
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,120
Let's go.

283
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,400
= Love Diary 1 = = January-June 2016 =

284
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,950
What's wrong with you?

285
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,670
Mom,

286
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,320
Mom,

287
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,420
Mom,

288
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,600
Mom,

289
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,650
Mom, are you okay?

290
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,800
Mom, wake up!

291
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,670
Mom,

292
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:37,950
Mom,

293
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:38,720
Ai, calm down.

294
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,000
What should we do?

295
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,150
Let's eat first Ai

296
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,570
You haven't eaten anything since last night.

297
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,120
It's noon now.

298
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,600
Eat it. I'm not hungry.

299
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,800
Ai。

300
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,770
Mom has never been this serious.

301
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,850
If you weren't here last night,

302
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,900
I don't even know what to do.

303
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,750
If something happens to me,

304
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,220
what should I do?

305
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,170
Ai

306
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,870
Now you have me.

307
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,370
You don't have to fight alone anymore.

308
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:43,920
No matter what it is,

309
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,920
we will get through it together.

310
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,020
It's the same with Auntie,

311
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,020
so,

312
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:52,000
Now you eat with me first,

313
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:53,550
Come on,

314
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:59,920
Even if I'm strong enough to take care of two patients at the same time.

315
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,900
But it's more cost-effective for two healthy people to take care of a patient.

316
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,470
Let's eat.

317
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,120
Hello,

318
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:46,550
Hello,

319
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,120
Sorry to interrupt.

320
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,070
But I have something important to tell you.

321
00:23:51,850 --> 00:23:53,170
Especially you.

322
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:00,850
Sorry,

323
00:24:00,850 --> 00:24:02,800
I can't find a better environment.

324
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,000
And I don't want to be too far away from my mom.

325
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,300
It's okay. I understand.

326
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:12,150
So why are you here?

327
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:13,770
Let's get straight to the point.

328
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,650
We are very interested in your project.

329
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:19,300
I'd like to invite you to work with me.

330
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,750
Yes,

331
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,020
That's it.

332
00:24:24,570 --> 00:24:26,770
You're graduating soon, aren't you?

333
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,920
Stark Enterprise needs people like you,

334
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:31,620
as well as your works.

335
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,720
It's not just for research and development of

336
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,570
air capsules, air masks and other grants.

337
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,220
In the end, it can be used.

338
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,200
As for sales, salary, benefits and benefits,

339
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,600
Stark Enterprise will take care of them for you.

340
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:51,070
I don't understand why you're interested in our work?

341
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,000
At that time, you clearly rejected us,

342
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:57,970
and the judges of the whole sand table recommendation made the decision together.

343
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,550
But from the point of view of the president of Stark Enterprise,

344
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:05,000
I would choose your

345
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,100
air capsule and air mask from the beginning,

346
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,920
But Pure air car.

347
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,600
I'm interested in you.

348
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,370
It's because the air capsule,

349
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:21,170
once you start using it, you can keep using it.

350
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,670
That is to update the version or change the machine.

351
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,300
Unlike oxygen inhalers,

352
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,950
they are unattractive.

353
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,020
What do you want from us?

354
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,250
Sell it to me.

355
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,950
Use my money and resources,

356
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,720
to make your project come true,

357
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,420
And use it.

358
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,850
I understand that you need time to think.

359
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,220
When someone invites you to live in Germany,

360
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,320
you can't just think about it and make a decision.

361
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,800
I'll give you time to think about it.

362
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:02,500
I welcome you.

363
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,120
Whether it's the four of you,

364
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,370
or one of you.

365
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,370
I welcome all of them.

366
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,850
How is Mom?

367
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,400
Have you been awake for a long time?

368
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:28,350
I'll call a doctor for you.

369
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,170
Hospital reception. The patient

370
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:36,820
is awake.

371
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,520
Wait a minute,

372
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,400
Mom. Are you thirsty?

373
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,570
Let me get you some water.

374
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,720
[ Please pick up the medicine on the 20th.

375
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,800
[ They invited us to work. ] [ The work place

376
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:40,750
is in Germany.

377
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,850
All right,

378
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,900
See you later

379
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,270
Touch

380
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,050
called to ask about the business card,

381
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,120
The one you sent to the group,

382
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,670
what did he say?

383
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,820
He said he couldn't go,

384
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,750
so he got a scholarship to go to Japan for further study.

385
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:21,420
Yeah, Bright can't do that either.

386
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:25,320
He's going to work in his father's company right after graduation.

387
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:28,550
What about you?

388
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:34,770
I don't want to be an engineer for Stark Enterprise.

389
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,500
I know.

390
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,470
You want to be a pilot?

391
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:46,470
I'm not going because... -Ai, you

392
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,820
can go.

393
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,150
Where are you going

394
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,820
if you don't want to

395
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,270
go without me?

396
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:02,450
It's nothing. It's nothing

397
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,900
that mom talked about.

398
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:09,570
Actually, it's kind of a big deal.

399
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,570
What's the matter, kid?

400
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:13,920
There's really nothing, mom.

401
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,950
I was invited to work in Germany,

402
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:22,350
which is a top engineering company in the world.

403
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:25,450
Songkhram。

404
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,170
He likes the project we showed on the sand table presentation.

405
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,550
People who like projects and who like to do them,

406
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:42,320
they invest in development projects,

407
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,470
You will also give sales share, salary,

408
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,370
and various benefits,

409
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,000
Ai

410
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:53,770
I'm not going, Mom.

411
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:57,000
I don't like this job at all.

412
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:59,700
Listen to me. -No.

413
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:01,950
I'm not going.

414
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:06,070
And I don't speak German, do I?

415
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:09,120
Life there must be hard.

416
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,670
Come here.

417
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,750
I'm not going.

418
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,850
How are you going to live without me?

419
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,520
And how am I going to live without you?

420
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,020
I can. You don't have to worry.

421
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,700
No, you can't live.

422
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,870
I can't live either.

423
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,950
Songkhram is the same, right?

424
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,550
Songkhram,

425
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,470
I can live.

426
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,050
I can wait too.

427
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,220
I'll wait for you.

428
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,650
Songkhram。

429
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,850
Don't worry.

430
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,650
I'll take care of your mother.

431
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:38,300
Go ahead.

432
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,500
You don't have to worry about me.

433
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:48,670
I can wait.

434
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,050
I'll wait for you.

435
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:57,200
I can live too.

436
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,650
I'll wait for my best son.

437
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,150
Bring your work back and give it to me.

438
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,270
I don't want to go.

439
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,720
You're acting coquettishly

440
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,500
again. You don't want me to go either.

441
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:50,120
You know everything.

442
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,050
Is it amazing?

443
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:55,300
My Ai has always been so good.

444
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,750
I don't want to be awesome either.

445
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,100
I want to be with you.

446
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,600
I want to fly back with my mom

447
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,700
when I'm free,

448
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,250
It's very convenient.

449
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,500
The salary is not low.

450
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:13,770
I can fly there to find you.

451
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:17,720
Traveling together,

452
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,320
taking mom with you,

453
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:24,250
How long can I stand not seeing you?

454
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,570
Coquetry again?

455
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:31,370
Who am I going to play coquetry with over there?

456
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,070
You're right.

457
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,970
I might be lonely.

458
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:39,120
No one is playing coquetry with me anymore.

459
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,750
But if you do a good job in Pure Air,

460
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,950
your mom will be able to wear a mask and look beautiful.

461
00:33:47,050 --> 00:33:50,720
Breathing fresh air is spotless.

462
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:56,850
You can also help millions of people who are deeply affected by dust.

463
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,900
But this is capitalism.

464
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,100
But if you don't do it, someone else will do it one day.

465
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,700
You're so lucky.

466
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,750
You can use your dreams and abilities to help others.

467
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:16,970
Including those you love and those who love you,

468
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,820
as well as those you know and don't know,

469
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,670
One day,

470
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,670
your dreams and abilities

471
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,250
can make everyone travel happily and safely Songkhram.

472
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,320
[ Three years

473
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,970
later ] I'll pick you up later.

Excuse me, sir. please fasten your seat belt. -okay.

475

00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,750
The weather outside the plane is a bit foggy.

484
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:13,970
Please fasten your seat belt to be on the safe side.

485
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:17,670

and the destination is Suvarnabhumi Airport in Thailand.

495
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,050
Hello.

496
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,720
Welcome home.

497
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,070
Did you miss me?

498
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,300
Yes.

499
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,070
There's not a day when I miss you.

500
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,470
Me too.

501
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:26,370
Why didn't you read or reply to my messages?

502
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,750
I told you I'd pick you up later.

503
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,100
There will be a few people in this world

504
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,870
who are boyfriends and will fly a plane to take them home.

505
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,020
Isn't this my bracelet?

506
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:46,350
You dropped it when you were a freshman. I'll put it away for you.

507
00:37:48,250 --> 00:37:49,670
I thought it was gone.

508
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,050
Then why didn't you give it back to me?

509
00:37:56,070 --> 00:37:57,220
Wait a little longer.

510
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:59,100
He will come to our house in a few days.

511
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:01,750
Yes.

512
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:21,600
Congratulations.

513
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,270
Junior,

514
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,070
Congratulations.

515
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,000
I thought the seniors wouldn't come.

516
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,720
Why didn't you come to such a ceremony?

517
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,820
I thought I didn't want to come because I saw so many people.

518
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:35,070
When I saw someone take a photo and upload it as if he was very angry,

519
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,670
I was angry because of the messy comments,

520
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,370
She said Meen and I are not suitable for each other,

521
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:41,670
and then she teased me.

522
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,900
I really have too much free time.

523
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,700
Haven't you gotten used to it? We've been together for three years.

524
00:38:46,970 --> 00:38:48,320
You're still angry about what happened.

525
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:50,300
This one is the number one. Of course,

526
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:54,020
you love her deeply and worry more.

527
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,370
There you are. -Yes, MeenSongkhram. I

528
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,570
missed you so much.

529
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,900
I've been waiting for you since early in the morning.

530
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,570
Have you been busy with work lately?

531
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,370
You didn't even come to visit your schoolmates.

532
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:08,920
I have to work and take care of my partner.

533
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,150
How much time do I have to care about you?

534
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,700
You can let go of me now.

535
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,220
I miss you so much. Ai,

536
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,070
how have you been?

537
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,170
It's good.

538
00:39:17,150 --> 00:39:20,200
Come on, let's take a photo together.

539
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,470
This is Nano for you. Thank you,

540
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:23,600
Senior Ai.

541
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:25,270
Come on,

542
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,420
1 2 3。

543
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,970
Let me introduce to you.

544
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,070
This is Dom,

545
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,670
my girlfriend. When did you pursue her?

546
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,700
We're finally off the deal.

547
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,400
Someone told me that I'm a perfectionist,

548
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,050
yes,

549
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,370
I like to see the whole thing.

550
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:05,220
My perfectionism makes me complete in everything I do

551
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,900
and have a plan for everything I do and I always think carefully.

552
00:40:10,270 --> 00:40:11,450
Until one day,

553
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:15,250
I realized that imperfection itself

554
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,800
already has this perfect factor in it.

555
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:25,750
So whether it's a dream or a dream or not,

556
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:31,070
our potential is much greater than we know.

557
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:38,500
What I've learned through Stark Enterprise is that

558
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,820
it's us who give ourselves as much chance as possible.

559
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,900
He might have made many mistakes.

560
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,570
Maybe we will also fail many times,

561
00:40:48,950 --> 00:40:55,920
until that day we will know that every effort is meaningful.

562
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,500
I wasn't born to succeed.

563
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,320
Even if I'm very focused, patient and hardworking,

564
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,100
I might not be able to go far without the chance.

565
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:14,500
I'm lucky to have met a nice person.

566
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,870
The one who understands me, supports me,

567
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,650
and is always by my side,

568
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,350
Luckily,

569
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,300
I received great love and encouragement

570
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,820
from the other party.

571
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,800
That person is Songkhram.

572
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,170
If it weren't for him, I wouldn't be who I am today.

573
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,600
I have to thank him for every motivation I have.

574
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,420
Thank you so much for pursuing me.

575
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:53,250
Thank you for taking care of me and caring for me,

576
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,070
for trusting me. This person

577
00:41:56,950 --> 00:42:00,400
has always been my motivation and encouragement.

578
00:42:01,370 --> 00:42:04,520
Thank you for taking care of my mother when I'm not around.

579
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:08,770
Thank you. Wait for me.

580
00:42:11,770 --> 00:42:14,050
Thank this boy for his strength.

581
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,000
It gives me more motivation to do things.

582
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,300
Thank you so much,

583
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:20,070
Songkhram. That was close.

584
00:43:20,650 --> 00:43:21,650
That's right.

585
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,870
Here to drink milk.

586
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,700
Why are you crying?

587
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:36,000
Don't cry.

588
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,300
Stop crying.

589
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,450
It's dirty.

590
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,370
Let me wipe it.

591
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,400
Okay,

592
00:43:51,650 --> 00:43:53,050
I can't stop crying.

593
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,120
I can't stop crying.

594
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,000
I can't stop crying.

595
00:43:57,150 --> 00:43:58,370
Do you hear me?

596
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,570
Do you hear me?

597
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,570
I smiled.

598
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:06,050
Here you go... You look the prettiest

599
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,570
when you smile.

600
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:13,370
[ Perfect ending ]
