1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
You're the one who thinks

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,050
highly of you. Don't seduce me.

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:06,780
Nervous,

4
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,500
no matter how hard the argument is today, there's no way to end it.

5
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:09,980
Come and have a drink with me.

6
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,330
What did

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,600
Meen say?

8
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,800
I...

9
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,050
I miss you,

10
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,980
It's not over yet.

11
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,780
Jerk!

12
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:21,250
Stop it. Songkhram,

13
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,400
the head of Dormitory 2,

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,580
I'm going to challenge you more than basketball.

15
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:31,030
Senior Tum, your TUM coins have gone up a lot recently,

16
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,450
making a profit of more than 100, 000 yuan last month.

17
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,800
Hundreds of thousands?

18
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,080
That's too much.

19
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,530
I started from scratch with 400 thousand.

20
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:41,800
Now I have my own digital currency.

21
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:42,930
What do you think?

22
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:46,130
You're awesome.

23
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,250
I want to buy your TUM coins, too. What about you?

24
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,430
But it keeps rising recently.

25
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:53,930
I don't even know when it's better to buy it.

26
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:55,830
Next week,

27
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,950
what do you mean by that?

28
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,650
I'll push down the price.

29
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,230
Then the tray.

30
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:04,050
We plan to raise 10 million yuan.

31
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:06,700
Gosh,

32
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,100
what a pity.

33
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:10,950
I'm still trapped.

34
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,650
Do you want to borrow my money?

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,330
Is that okay, Senior?

36
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:19,530
This little money is nothing,

37
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:21,900
we are seniors and younger brothers who have known each other for so long,

38
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,430
How much do you want to borrow?

39
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:26,100
Well,

40
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,900
if you throw a 400 thousand,

41
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,000
How much profit can I make?

42
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:11,900
How is your injury?

43
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,900
See for yourself.

44
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,550
Bad luck.

45
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:18,600
I was hit by a car and hit.

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,200
You deserve it.

47
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,600
Are you out of your mind?

48
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,780
Who are you messing with?

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,400
That's Songkhram.

50
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,550
Ai, I'm drunk.

51
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,530
This is another problem.

52
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:28,800
You even drove when you were drunk.

53
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,600
Are you tired of living?

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,730
Maybe it's better if I die.

55
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:37,930
What are you talking about?

56
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,650
It's nothing. I'm just kidding.

57
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:41,580
Are you kidding me?

58
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,850
It's better if you die.

59
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,430
Don't take it seriously.

60
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,950
Is there something bothering you?

61
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,430
You can tell me,

62
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,050
no matter what, we are all seniors and younger brothers.

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
Is it a family matter again?

64
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,250
It doesn't matter if you don't want to tell me.

65
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,000
Ai

66
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:13,950
You.

67
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,880
Can you lend me 400 houses?

68
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,000
What did you say?

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,200
I'm really in trouble this time.

70
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,830
What did you do to use 400 thousand?

71
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,150
Did you do something bad?

72
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,100
No

73
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,830
You have to tell Uncle Eak about such a big thing.

74
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,350
I'm sure your dad will help you.

75
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,630
You know I can't tell my dad.

76
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,280
If you don't tell me,

77
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:44,630
I don't know how to help you.

78
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,980
I... I

79
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,200
used the money to buy bitcoin.

80
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:54,980
If you borrow 400 houses to buy bitcoin,

81
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,280
that's 400 houses.

82
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,480
Are you out of your mind?

83
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,550
How much interest do you want?

84
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,380
Why don't you think about the consequences when you're doing things?

85
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,200
Do you want to borrow it or not?

86
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,830
I don't have that much money.

87
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,680
I do have a little savings,

88
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,280
tens of thousands,

89
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,150
Or you can find a way to sell something.

90
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:15,550
Watches, bags, clothes,

91
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,230
or cars,

92
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,900
The car won't work. I bought it under my dad's name.

93
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,700
Ai

94
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,780
Please save me.

95
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,280
If you don't help me, I'm dead,

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,980
okay?

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,980
Let me take a shot.

98
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,750
I can't do it.

99
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,230
I'll throw it in again.

100
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:17,280
Again,

101
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,100
again. Hold the ball like this. Your feet are flush with your shoulders.

102
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,500
Relax.

103
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,050
How about this?

104
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,380
Yeah, and throw it.

105
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,880
Wait here. I'll pick it up for you.

106
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
That's all for today.

107
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,830
Get some rest and eat something.

108
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:44,230
Yes. -Let's go.

109
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,730
What do you think?

110
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,550
I can't believe he wants to compete with Songkhram in basketball.

111
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,930
Asking for trouble.

112
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,380
[ I just recovered. Don't fight too hard. None of us will say anything about you. ]

113
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,380
What's wrong?

114
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,830
There's nothing of mine.

115
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:11,500
Let's go eat.

116
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,850
I'm starving.

117
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:13,930
It's your treat.

118
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,100
Okay.

119
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:41,480
A bunch of brats want to help with the basketball game.

120
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:43,250
I love them so much.

121
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:47,500
The smoothies in Sister Er Yo's shop are delicious.

122
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:55,250
Three Bright came to teach me how to play basketball and he rubbed his head,

123
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,950
and four Songkhram secretly stuffed mineral water into my bag.

124
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,580
A narcissist,

125
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,600
a pain in the ass.

126
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Hey.

127
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,630
What's wrong?

128
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,550
About the other day,

129
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,930
I... I'm going to take a shower. See you later.

130
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,300
Thank you for helping me today.

131
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,850
You're welcome, Senior Ai.

132
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,100
Just give us some water,

133
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:10,330
Just open the back door of the dorm after 11 PM.

134
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,730
You brat.

135
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,880
We love you.

136
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,430
Okay, I love you, too.

137
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:18,600
Come on,

138
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,680
Do you want to fight for Dorm 3?

139
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,530
Fight

140
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:23,530
Shall we fight it or not,

141
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:23,950
Fight,

142
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:26,800
-Do you want to fight? -Fight.

143
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,280
Come here, everyone.

144
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:41,930
This game is a friendly match.

145
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,030
Just have fun.

146
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,150
Make yourself at home. Don't take it too seriously.

147
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,850
But we've never had a casual competition with anyone.

148
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,600
Yes,

149
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,730
you said you must be serious and win the competition.

150
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,130
I didn't say you don't have to win,

151
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:58,450
I said be casual,

152
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,080
Make yourself at home.

153
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,780
Just have fun.

154
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:04,600
The most important thing is that you don't get hurt.

155
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,700
You have an important competition?

156
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,300
For the sake of your future,

157
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,830
it's not worth it to get hurt like this.

158
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:14,430
And be careful not to let them get hurt.

159
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:16,480
Come on, everyone.

160
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:18,980
Come on, Dorm 2.

161
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,900
Okay.

162
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,200
Tell your team to be careful.

163
00:09:32,230 --> 00:09:33,380
Don't get too close.

164
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,530
They're a fierce fighter,

165
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,600
Thank you.

166
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,880
Tell your men to stay away from us. Pass the ball.

167
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,850
Don't get too close to us. Or you'll get hurt.

168
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,080
Are you threatening me?

169
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,200
I'm not threatening you.

170
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
Senior Ai, go for it.

171
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,900
Cheer up and cheer for senior.

172
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,680
Dorm 3, come on, Ai,

173
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,300
get better soon, bro.

174
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,330
I'm sorry. Um,

175
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:32,350
have a safe trip, bro.

176
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,650
How did you get in?

177
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,200
She walked in.

178
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,700
Let's change the question.

179
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,430
What are you doing here?

180
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:55,900
Here you are.

181
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,180
Why did you give it to me?

182
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,450
You really don't know how to take care of yourself.

183
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,150
Don't you feel pain with such a big bruise?

184
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,650
No need.

185
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,600
I applied it myself.

186
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,100
You can go now.

187
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,580
I'm afraid the seniors will see it.

188
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,350
You can leave now.

189
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,880
Hurry up.

190
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,750
Why are you still here?

191
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,180
What's wrong? Can't I be here?

192
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,600
Aren't you going back to take care of the people in your dorm?

193
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,380
No one is here. Everyone in

194
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:14,780
Dorm 2 and Dorm 3 has gone back to the dorm.

195
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:17,830
You're the only one in the room. What took you so long?

196
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:23,050
Are you waiting for me?

197
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,480
I just.

198
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,200
=

199
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,030
Ohm = Hello.

200
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,730
What?

201
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,700
You trust others so easily.

202
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,530
I don't think it's a big deal.

203
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,230
He just asked me to have a talk.

204
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,600
Let me be honest with you,

205
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,750
if I happen to be away,

206
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,100
Are you going alone like this?

207
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,900
Promise me,

208
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:12,680
if something like this happens again,

209
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,930
You have to tell me,

210
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,480
every time,

211
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,630
Promise me.

212
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,500
If you don't promise me, I won't let you off the bus.

213
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:24,880
Yes, I promise you!

214
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:30,830
Let go of me!

215
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,950
Let go of me!

216
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:37,650
Ai Ai

217
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,550
Ohm

218
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:39,880
Senior Tum,

219
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,800
What's going on?

220
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:46,400
Are Dorm 2 and Dorm 3 related now?

221
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,900
Let go of me now!

222
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,550
What do you need?

223
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,930
That's the point.

224
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,880
You should know.

225
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,530
Ohm lent me money but didn't want to pay it back.

226
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,980
So I took some interest from him.

227
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:00,700
Then why did you call Ai here?

228
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:03,130
He's just an ordinary student.

229
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,030
He's not the kind of person who can help his friend pay his debts.

230
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,130
I don't want money.

231
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,180
If I want money,

232
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,550
I can ask his dad for it.

233
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,500
You can tell me if you need anything.

234
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,330
That's why I can take Ohm to the hospital.

235
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,880
Ai, do you have a date?

236
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:23,800
No.

237
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,350
As long as you're my boyfriend,

238
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:30,730
I don't need him to pay off 400 houses of debt.

239
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,580
Jerk!

240
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,050
-Calm down, bro. -Let go. -Calm

241
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,850
down.

242
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,130
-Calm down. -Ai, he's

243
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,830
looking down on you.

244
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,330
I'm just making a suggestion,

245
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,380
so that Ai can save Ohm's life.

246
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,280
Help!

247
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,400
Ohm owes me a debt,

248
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,930
so you have to pay it back.

249
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,530
If you don't pay back the money, you have to pay it back with something else.

250
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:02,130
Like I said, I'm not short of money,

251
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:05,100
but it's illegal.

252
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,400
It's just a dog's life.

253
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:10,650
I can keep it from breaking the law.

254
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,900
-If I decide... -No, Ai. You

255
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,980
can't let someone do this because of him.

256
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,600
Oh my god.

257
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,100
I'll pay him back.

258
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,200
If you think you can do it, just come.

259
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:30,400
400 thousand pay it off before 10 o'clock this evening.

260
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,780
You don't have money to pay me back.

261
00:17:35,430 --> 00:17:36,300
Wait and see.

262
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,430
What should I do?

263
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,450
Ai, help me.

264
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,280
-I'll come back to save you later. -Ai, don't

265
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,600
hurt Ohm.

266
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:51,430
Ai, Ai, Ai, don't go yet. Ai,

267
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,580
do you think your friends can help you?

268
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:57,400
Let go of me!

269
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,530
You're such a jerk!

270
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,450
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

271
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,880
Let go of me!

272
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,750
Where should we find the money?

273
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,630
400 thousand

274
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,930
is 400 thousand, not 4 baht.

275
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,950
You shouldn't have said yes to him.

276
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,050
This is not a joke.

277
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,500
I've never taken your matter as a child's play.

278
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,650
Do you have 400 thousand?

279
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:19,750
No.

280
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,200
Well,

281
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,050
if I'm willing to...

282
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,200
Shut up, Ai,

283
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,050
How can you be the object of that kind of person so easily?

284
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,200
He's looking down on your dignity.

285
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,250
I do have dignity,

286
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,300
but it can be Ohm's life.

287
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,880
Even if he has a bad personality,

288
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,950
he's still my friend no matter what.

289
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,880
Look at me and answer me.

290
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,080
Who are you?

291
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,180
I'm Ai.

292
00:18:58,730 --> 00:18:59,700
Yes,

293
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,800
you are the head of the dormitory building of Ai 3,

294
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,700
He's kind and considerate.

295
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,530
And she's good at studying,

296
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:07,800
and she's the baby of my mom and the members of Dorm 3?

297
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,330
Yes.

298
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:11,550
Answer me now.

299
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:13,480
Who am I?

300
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,200
Song, the jerk from Dorm 2.

301
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,480
Jerk!

302
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,650
Yeah, okay.

303
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,980
I'm a jerk in Dorm 2.

304
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,430
A hillbilly is impatient and aggressive.

305
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,830
He only gets emotional.

306
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,850
You said it yourself this time,

307
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:29,580
so,

308
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,250
You have to trust me.

309
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,230
Sure,

310
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,830
but why did you grab my hand?

311
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,680
Where are we going?

312
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,000
Go find 400 thousand.

313
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,550
I can't change it myself.

314
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,150
Are you taking me to rob a bank?

315
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,480
You really are,

316
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,700
Ai

317
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:54,980
Let's go.

318
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,150
This should be the only way to pay interest.

319
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:02,680
But later, I will increase the hospitalization benefits.

320
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:06,230
So we should be able to adjust it a little bit.

321
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:09,280
Do you think it's okay if that's the case?

322
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,200
-I'll update it for you anyway... -You can't go in there.

323
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,100
OK OK It's okay It's okay,

324
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:20,250
I'll get back to you later Oh It's urgent.

325
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,650
I'm really sorry.

326
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,200
Thank you.

327
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,580
I'm sorry to bother you.

328
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,030
Is it really urgent today?

329
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,630
Friends?

330
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,300
Yes, this is AiAi

331
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,250
and this is my dad,

332
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:34,250
-Hello. -Hello.

333
00:20:36,850 --> 00:20:38,230
Tell me what urgent matter you have.

334
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:40,650
Lend me 400 thousand.

335
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:47,050
Borrowing 400 houses and taking 400 houses for what?

336
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,400
The people in the dorm caused some trouble,

337
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,580
and many of them got hurt.

338
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,680
So I have to pay the hospitalization fee.

339
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,380
There are a lot of injured people, so I have to charge a fee for the letter.

340
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,630
It's not real at all.

341
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,430
Say it again.

342
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,580
You know I don't want to talk about it.

343
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:04,380
Otherwise, I wouldn't have to make up a story.

344
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,080
But I promise it's not illegal. It has nothing to do with pornography.

345
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,480
And I won't let anyone get into trouble.

346
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,550
Okay? 400thousand

347
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,200
is in a hurry until today,

348
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,250
If you're really in such a hurry, why didn't you come since last month?

349
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,350
Dad,

350
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:22,600
400 thousand won't let anyone get into trouble.

351
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,600
Here it is. Those who get into trouble are here.

352
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,100
400 thousand.

353
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:26,800
Dad.

354
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,150
400 thousand OK,

355
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,730
today is your lucky day.

356
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,930
400 thousand.

357
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,430
Dad, this is,

358
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:45,650
yeah, if you want 400 thousand,

359
00:21:46,230 --> 00:21:48,200
Help me deal with these.

360
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,750
I made three packages,

361
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,700
200thousand 400thousand 600thous. if you can get rid of any of them,

362
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,830
you can take the money.

363
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,900
What if I deal with less than 400 houses?

364
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,650
Then it's not my problem.

365
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,700
Can I go to them now?

366
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
That's your business. You can go tomorrow.

367
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,880
You're in a hurry, aren't you?

368
00:22:17,830 --> 00:22:18,480
Let's go.

369
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,400
Goodbye, uncle.

370
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:30,750
Do you know

371
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,780
Amberly?

372
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,330
Is there anyone in UIT who doesn't know her?

373
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,400
Not to mention Amber, who set up the sand table recommendation,

374
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,050
there should be only one Amberly.

375
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,180
Businessman, Singapore, Thailand, mixed race,

376
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,780
has been successful since junior year and has his own company,

377
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,850
That's why UIT's sand table promotion was launched.

378
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,150
In Singapore, Taiwan, Korea and Thailand,

379
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,030
but the point is,

380
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:05,050
How can we win this person's heart?

381
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,700
Who are you calling?

382
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,450
Hello, Nucleus.

383
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,530
I have something to trouble you.

384
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:23,500
I promise I won't tell anyone.

385
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,930
I promise.

386
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,650
Thank you very much, Nucleus.

387
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,950
There's someone who can help us.

388
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:44,230
Songkhram Ai,

389
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:47,250
what can I do for you?

390
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,230
We need your help.

391
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,950
Even when you need my help,

392
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,980
I get goose bumps.

393
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,130
I don't know if it's a fear or an honor.

394
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,680
I'm serious.

395
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,650
Sakaojai Barkornyoskul

396
00:24:04,930 --> 00:24:07,030
or the name in the passport is.

397
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,930
Scarlett Bottonli,

398
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,430
how do you know this?

399
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,080
So will you help us or not?

400
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:19,300
That depends on what you want me to do.

401
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,800
Help us win your mother's heart.

402
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,380
You like... -I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm

403
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,380
not done yet.

404
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,580
Ai, give me the folder.

405
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,380
My dad asked us to talk about

406
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,130
insurance with your mom as representatives.

407
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,080
My dad has made a good offer.

408
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,180
We're just here to collect the bill.

409
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,630
Here you are

410
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,330
Just ask your dad to ask my mom out.

411
00:24:49,430 --> 00:24:50,650
We're in a hurry.

412
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,680
We have to accept the bill tonight.

413
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,300
Tonight,

414
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,180
it's really urgent.

415
00:24:57,650 --> 00:25:00,850
What if I don't help?

416
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:03,330
You probably don't want anyone to know.

417
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:05,530
You're Amberly's only daughter, right?

418
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,330
Because it will bring a lot of inconvenience to you and your mother.

419
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,050
Regarding the sand table recommendation,

420
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,200
Songkhram,

421
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,080
I'm begging you.

422
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,000
We really had no choice.

423
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,750
He...

424
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,600
This is really important to us.

425
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,700
If I help you,

426
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,380
what can I get?

427
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,050
I'll owe you one.

428
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,580
It's quite attractive.

429
00:25:32,650 --> 00:25:34,250
OK, I promise you.

430
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,100
I happen to be having dinner with my mom at 7 p. m.,

431
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,630
so you should come with me.

432
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,880
I'll help you.

433
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:46,900
But... I can't guarantee the result.

434
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,850
It all depends on my mother's decision.

435
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,280
Hello,

436
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,850
please have a seat.

437
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:10,430
I can't believe Mr. Jim has such a handsome son.

438
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,680
How do you know?

439
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,480
Your dad called me and told me.

440
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,630
Mom, this is the head of Ai 3 Dormitory Building.

441
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,680
Hello,

442
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,100
Eat it.

443
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:20,600
All the dishes in this restaurant

444
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,730
are delicious. You're welcome,

445
00:26:22,850 --> 00:26:23,630
Let's eat.

446
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,150
Are you busy lately?

447
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,800
Whether you are busy or not depends on who is asking this question.

448
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,000
A little bit busy,

449
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,880
but more bored.

450
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:49,380
Since there hasn't been a promising project for sand table promotion for a long time,

451
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,830
there's no need to be silent.

452
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,650
I'm used to it.

453
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,880
If I were to say it casually,

454
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:01,850
it should be air pollution.

455
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,130
PM2. 5

456
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:08,450
I remember the air quality used to be much better than this.

457
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,050
But now,

458
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,350
every time I go out,

459
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,150
I don't even feel like I'm getting enough oxygen.

460
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,330
I understand.

461
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:18,730
My mom complains a lot,

462
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:21,080
too. My mom is allergic.

463
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,530
Just like the bottle of water just now,

464
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,130
if more than 100 years ago,

465
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,700
no one would have thought that drinking water would cost money to buy.

466
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,180
Because the water in nature is clean,

467
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,950
and it's free.

468
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,550
Go on.

469
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,430
Okay,

470
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,000
If the air is still like this,

471
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,480
one day we may need to spend money to buy air for breathing.

472
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:49,230
Maybe there's bottled air and solid air

473
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,100
in the convenience store.

474
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,780
It's no different from bottled water now.

475
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,600
If that's the case,

476
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,900
where can we find fresh air for sale?

477
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,430
Maybe it's from nature that's still pure.

478
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,750
Mom, what do you think?

479
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,830
That's just a prospect.

480
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:10,730
Let's talk about your future plans.

481
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:14,780
That's the health insurance my dad proposed to you.

482
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,000
The cost of hospitalization is increasing,

483
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,450
although the hospital reimburses us for the medicine,

484
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,500
But there are expenses everywhere,

485
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:26,200
just like before my dad died,

486
00:28:26,450 --> 00:28:27,550
My dad was sick,

487
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,750
and I still remember that the total cost was more than 300, 000 yuan.

488
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,030
My mom had to sell the store and the building.

489
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:37,450
Money at our disposal can make us happy.

490
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,330
Warm heart and peace of mind,

491
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,880
will not become a burden to our loved ones.

492
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,130
Don't be nervous.

493
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,930
I just appreciate your intention.

494
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,580
I don't know if you memorized it or if Mr. Jim taught you.

495
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:04,080
But I saw how hard you two worked.

496
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:07,780
But I invited my daughter to dinner today,

497
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,650
because I want to buy an insurance policy for her.

498
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,750
You understand it after hearing it, right?

499
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,200
How important is this?

500
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,080
[ Scarlett Bottonli = = 20-year insurance premium (no dividend) = How important is this?

501
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,980
[ Scarlett Bottonli = = 20-year insurance premium (no dividend) =

502
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:17,680
Hmm = Scarlett Bottonli = = 20-year insurance premium (no dividend) =.

503
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:18,950
= Scarlett Bottonli = = 20-year insurance premium (no dividend) =.

504
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,000
I plan to buy this insurance.

505
00:29:25,150 --> 00:29:26,780
400 thousand.

506
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,000
But on one condition,

507
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:33,400
the two of you must be in the end of this year,

508
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,030
Give it to Sand Table to recommend an excellent development plan.

509
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Okay. -Okay.

510
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:47,200
Songkhram Ai,

511
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,830
what's your dream?

512
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,900
My dream is to become a pilot.

513
00:29:57,930 --> 00:30:02,480
I want to be an engineer that is beneficial to humanity and the environment.

514
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,280
What do you think?

515
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,150
Done.

516
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,000
Deal completed.

517
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,100
Really?

518
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,030
Awesome.

519
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,330
Do you want to come to work?

520
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,150
Let me find you a suitable position.

521
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,700
Congratulations.

522
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,850
How about this,

523
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:20,330
Take the money Ms. Aumber transferred in to do your business first.

524
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,500
But tomorrow, you have to bring me the documents

525
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,730
signed by Ms. Aumber and her daughter,

526
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,480
okay? I'll pay the money first.

527
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:33,750
Just give it back to me at any time.

528
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,780
OK

529
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,000
Thank you, Dad.

530
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,830
This is for you.

531
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:41,000
It means you have to pay it back.

532
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
Is it OK?

533
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:44,880
OK, I promise you.

534
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,780
As always,

535
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,150
you have to stand by my side,

536
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,200
Got it.

537
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:59,780
I'm a man. You don't have to protect me like that.

538
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,950
If something really happens to you,

539
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,100
will you be able to handle it?

540
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,530
Probably.

541
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:09,700
I might as well send you back to the dorm first.

542
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:11,350
I'll take care of the rest.

543
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,800
Of course not.

544
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,180
This is my family matter.

545
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,180
How can you handle it for me?

546
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:19,830
I can't thank you enough for helping me so much.

547
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,180
You've done so much for me,

548
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:26,430
no matter what happens to you in the future, I'll fight for you.

549
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,480
Let's fight together.

550
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,230
It sounds like we're getting married.

551
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:35,750
You're crazy.

552
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,080
What are you talking about?

553
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,030
Let's go.

554
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,950
Let go of me.

555
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,730
Ai

556
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:06,230
Ohm,

557
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,300
to be honest, I don't want you to pay me back.

558
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,200
Why are you paying me back?

559
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,450
I'm depressed, you know?

560
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
But forget it,

561
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:17,630
as much as I want Ai,

562
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,830
But what I said is hard to go back on my words.

563
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,700
Please don't break your promise, Senior Tum.

564
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,450
Don't waste your time.

565
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:26,650
It's 10 o'clock now.

566
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,080
Maybe Senior Tum wants to rest.

567
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:34,850
Oh dear, Ai, Bitcoin

568
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,330
is in the ascendancy these days,

569
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,300
If you want to start,

570
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,450
you can tell me,

571
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,700
I'll tutor you myself.

572
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:44,380
Ai, don't trust him.

573
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:47,450
Enough, Senior Tum.

574
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:49,030
Enough, Senior.

575
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,050
I'm begging you.

576
00:32:58,800 --> 00:32:59,630
400 thousand.

577
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,700
Now that we're even, we'll leave first.

578
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,180
Ai, you can take Ohm away.

579
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,830
Songkhram, stay here and let's talk.

580
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:27,750
Can you do it?

581
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,450
Let's go.

582
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,630
If you like Ai,

583
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,730
who do you think Ai will date?

584
00:33:56,650 --> 00:33:58,880
Do you think you two can be together?

585
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,280
Do you think you two can last long?

586
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:05,250
The people in dormitory building 2 and dormitory building 3,

587
00:34:05,250 --> 00:34:06,700
it's impossible to be together.

588
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,230
Everyone will reject you.

589
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,280
It's really annoying.

590
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:18,830
When will I stop making trouble for you?

591
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,730
That's enough.

592
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:37,180
What did you talk to Senior Tum at the end of the day?

593
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:39,630
Who do you like?

594
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,180
What's your answer?

595
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,180
I said I don't know.

596
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:46,380
Tell him who you like

597
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,850
and who I like.

598
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,000
It's better if you have time to study hard, right?

599
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,350
I have to take care of my mom.

600
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,700
My mom worked so hard.

601
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:00,100
Now I'm focusing on learning and focusing on sand table recommendation,

602
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,000
Yes.

603
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:05,130
Go get some rest. It's been a long day.

604
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:10,330
Thank you so much for today.

605
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,800
From today on, I'll pay you back slowly.

606
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,900
If there's anything you need my help with,

607
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,800
just let me know as long as it's not beyond my ability.

608
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm happy to help.

609
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,050
You have to be careful. Ai,

610
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,900
can you stop making promises to others?

611
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,450
But what I said is not beyond my ability,

612
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,250
I have already said my limitations.

613
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,100
In the meantime, I want to read your diary every day, okay?

614
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,230
What?

615
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,830
I want to read your diary.

616
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:42,400
Wait,

617
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,150
how do you know my diary?

618
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:46,980
Who am I? Songkhram?

619
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,580
So Songkhram is a gossip person?

620
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,380
Jerk!

621
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,700
Didn't you say there's anything you can do for me?

622
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,930
What can I do for you?

623
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,980
Just... to help me get to know you better.

624
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:01,030
Why do you want to read my diary?

625
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,080
That's my personal belongings.

626
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:07,650
I think we should keep a record of personal matters.

627
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,400
I read all these messy things by myself.

628
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:12,080
It's personal to be alone,

629
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,150
do you understand?

630
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:15,680
Yes, I see.

631
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,080
It's fine if it's okay.

632
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:18,730
Go to bed then.

633
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,550
The dorm door is closing?

634
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:21,780
Wait,

635
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,550
I'll help you with something else.

636
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,800
I know you have a crush on the people in our dorm.

637
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,680
I'll help you chase the man in dormitory building 3

638
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,400
to show my gratitude to you.

639
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,550
What do you mean?

640
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:35,450
I know you like Meen,

641
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,700
I was drunk that day and I vaguely heard you miss each other,

642
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,730
Do you think I like Meen?

643
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,350
Well, don't worry.

644
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:44,700
I won't tell anyone about this.

645
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,050
No one else will know about this.

646
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:47,950
Meen already knows.

647
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,100
Ah,

648
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,780
I like the person in Dormitory 3 Meen knew it,

649
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,700
and what did he say?

650
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,050
He didn't say anything.

651
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,180
Ai,

652
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,130
what are you doing there?

653
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,150
Go back to the dorm. It's late. It's closed at 11: 00. You're not allowed to come

654
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:03,300
in.

655
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,780
If the head of the dorm sleeps outside the dorm,

656
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,280
others will laugh their heads off.

657
00:37:06,950 --> 00:37:08,630
Yes. Go to bed.

658
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,750
Wait, everyone is woken up.

659
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,480
Let me apologize to you for him.

660
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,850
Anyway, thank you again.

661
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:17,080
Yes.

662
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:17,730
Let's go.

663
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:26,900
Nano

664
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,350
Hey,

665
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:30,150
Ai told me he wanted to help me chase you.

666
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,680
What is it?

667
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,230
That day at the bar door, he wasn't jealous at all,

668
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,430
but he even chased you for me.

669
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:39,950
I've already told you.

670
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,280
Don't make it complicated.

671
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,450
I.

672
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:46,800
What?

673
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,500
Miss you

674
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,200
= Spoken English: What did you say =,

675
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,930
[ Oral:

676
00:37:53,030 --> 00:37:57,180
No ] [ Oral: Let's see how he reacts when

677
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,150
he hears it

678
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,550
= = Oral: No = Are you done laughing?

679
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:07,000
So what? It's as you wish, isn't it?

680
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:10,130
It's been four years.

681
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:12,580
You don't have to remind me again, okay?

682
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,300
I'm sorry...

683
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,600
I didn't repeat the reminder.

684
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,150
What I'm saying is that you wouldn't listen to me.

685
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,930
I've been telling you a good way for years.

686
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,000
What if you don't care?

687
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,750
You just want to use this to make him jealous.

688
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:29,350
What should I do?

689
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,950
Stop using me as a shield.

690
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,250
Then just tell Ai,

691
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,950
you don't like me.

692
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,300
What if he gets angry and doesn't want to talk to me?

693
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,880
Just go and find him like everyone else.

694
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:47,480
What do you mean?

695
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:50,130
All right,

696
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:51,980
for this semester's mid-term assignment,

697
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:54,030
I want you to form a group

698
00:38:54,330 --> 00:38:58,580
to help and illustrate how to improve the standard of living of human beings.

699
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,850
How many people are there in a group?

700
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:03,280
Why should I ask?

701
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,450
Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3 will work together and form a team together.

702
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:08,000
Speaking of which, it's good.

703
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:10,100
It's the fourth grade.

704
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:14,230
Aren't you tired of the rules your senior set before?

705
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,780
Team up together in the same dorm for the rest of your life?

706
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,400
Do you want to change it?

707
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,200
Tell me,

708
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:28,330
Do you want us to form a team in the dorm this time?

709
00:39:35,930 --> 00:39:36,750
Very good.

710
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,950
That's it. What world

711
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,980
is it now? What era is it?

712
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,630
Give me the list in the evening.

713
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,980
Let's be in the same team.

714
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,500
Jerk!

715
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,280
You asked in front of everyone.

716
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:09,480
If Ai doesn't agree, won't he become a petty person who bears grudges?

717
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,880
Yeah, okay,

718
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:21,980
Bright. You're with us. Two against two.

719
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:23,880
Just fine.

720
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,480
Then both of us will join in.

721
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,600
What did

722
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,080
Bright say?

723
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:08,950
Why are you chatting with Ai today?

724
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,030
How did you see it?

725
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:19,830
I like Ai.

726
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,880
I really like Ai.

727
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:28,500
Please help me.

728
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,880
No.

729
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:33,350
Why?

730
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,380
I like Ai, too.

731
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,000
I thought you liked Meen,

732
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,330
All I know is that Meen likes you.

733
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,000
Meen doesn't like me.

734
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,950
I wouldn't do that if I liked her.

735
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:49,700
Don't you ever think that he did that because of you?

736
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,350
Don't blame me.

737
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,080
I don't know, Bright.

738
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,600
No matter what, I won't give way to you.

739
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,980
Because I like Ai,

740
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,400
I don't care about any random rules. Next,

741
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,950
let's welcome Ai.

742
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,850
75，

743
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,050
54，

744
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,580
98，

745
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,750
40，

746
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,930
98，

747
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,700
30，

748
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:31,650
All right,

749
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,550
this is another person who finished this year, Ai,

750
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:36,750
Since Dormitory 3 and Dormitory 5 have the same result,

751
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,080
now let Ai choose which dorm to stay in?

752
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:48,430
Dormitory 5,

753
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:52,430
I'd like to ask the heads of three dormitory buildings and five dormitory buildings.

754
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:55,080
Why should I be in your dorm?

755
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:57,850
I've been watching Ai's campaign,

756
00:42:58,430 --> 00:42:59,980
and I can see your vision.

757
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,350
You're handsome and pretty. You're good at playing games.

758
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:05,500
If I come to Senior's dorm,

759
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,830
I will be the brightest star.

760
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,380
If Ai comes to Senior's dorm,

761
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:12,050
Senior will give you everything you want,

762
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,330
Although our three dormitory buildings

763
00:43:15,450 --> 00:43:18,330
say that we are the school grass dormitory building,

764
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:20,580
We don't just have looks.

765
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,430
If Ai comes to our dorm,

766
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:24,400
You won't get everything one day.

767
00:43:24,630 --> 00:43:26,580
During your four years in UIT,

768
00:43:27,250 --> 00:43:28,980
you have to work hard on your own,

769
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:30,830
To get what you want.

770
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:34,830
We will support you and be your strong backing.

771
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:38,530
Okay, it's time for Ai to make a choice.

772
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:39,980
Which dorm do you want to stay in?

773
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:44,050
I'll choose three dormitory buildings.

774
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,280
I said I would help you chase Meen.

775
00:43:58,650 --> 00:43:59,800
I've asked Meen out for you.

776
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:01,100
Ai chose me.

777
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:03,830
You don't have anything to tell me, do you?

778
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,400
Don't you have a lot of people talking to you?

779
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,100
Would you like to have dinner with me?

780
00:44:07,850 --> 00:44:09,980
Where do you want me to sleep at this time?

781
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,050
Go sleep with me.
