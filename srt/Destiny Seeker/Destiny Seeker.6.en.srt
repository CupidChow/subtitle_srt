1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
We should be more united and friendly,

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,860
you're confessing your love to me in disguise,

3
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:04,740
I'm worried about you,

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,740
but now I seem to be

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:08,220
trying to get to know him again.

6
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,540
I'll take off your clothes.

7
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,860
What's wrong? I'm an athlete too.

8
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,980
You can sleep with me too.

9
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,060
Are you okay,

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,260
Pluster? The sea is in your eyes.

11
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:34,060
Gosh, I didn't mean to.

12
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:36,420
I'll get you some water, okay?

13
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,220
Qing Shui is here. How about

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,540
you wash it?

15
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:56,540
Are you feeling better?

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,380
And sand.

17
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,580
Let me see.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,820
I'm sorry. Come and wash it.

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,940
I might have dropped my contact lens.

20
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:12,820
Gosh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

21
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:18,660
It's okay.

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,460
I understand.

23
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:22,460
I still have a pair of contact lenses.

24
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,620
I'll get a new one later.

25
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,180
Hey,

26
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:09,140
Tell me,

27
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,140
Sorry about that night.

28
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
what are you doing in here?

29
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,020
Do you have a problem with me?

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,980
Do you have to come to the toilet to find fault with me?

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:28,060
I'm not here to pick a fight.

32
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,420
I'm here to make it clear to you.

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,020
It seems the rumor is true.

34
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,060
The people in Dormitory 2

35
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,540
only use violence.

36
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,820
But you don't have a brain.

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,180
You really owe me a big mouth.

38
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,260
What do you mean?

39
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,180
If a boy suddenly has a crush on another boy,

40
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,820
is that wrong?

41
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,860
I don't know

42
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:29,820
if I have feelings for someone.

43
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,340
Is there any right or wrong?

44
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,260
It's not easy to have a crush on someone.

45
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:38,340
What if I say I have feelings for you?

46
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,700
Are you sure?

47
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,220
You want to be with a boy?

48
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,660
I've never had one.

49
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,540
Ai, what are you looking at?

50
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,220
I.

51
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,660
I'm watering the tree.

52
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,020
Why did you pour the water, Senior?

53
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,180
The water is pouring out of the basin.

54
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,660
That's right.

55
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,420
Are you thinking about something?

56
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,540
Who are you thinking about?

57
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,820
-Yo. -Yo, go

58
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,300
take a shower,

59
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,620
I don't want to be late for class.

60
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,660
-Hurry up. -I know. I know. Ai, didn't

61
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,300
you say you were hungry?

62
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,940
Why do you keep smelling it there?

63
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,820
I was just eating,

64
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,500
eating so slowly as if I was waiting for someone.

65
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,260
Who are you waiting for?

66
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,940
Are you waiting for me?

67
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,340
May I sit here?

68
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,340
Yes. Have a seat.

69
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,900
I'll go buy some water.

70
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,820
But I guess it will take a long time.

71
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,620
Because I want to drink the restaurant without sugar,

72
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,100
Touch

73
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:55,420
feels a little greasy-Touch

74
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,140
You.

75
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,820
Your friend is quite self-conscious.

76
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,820
Conscious? What the heck?

77
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:09,660
Here,

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,900
No.

79
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,220
Go ahead.

80
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:15,220
In case I don't have enough to eat.

81
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:16,620
I'm fine.

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,020
As long as you're full, I'll be satisfied.

83
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,980
You smiled.

84
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,860
I saw it.

85
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,700
What a nerve laugh.

86
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,700
Hurry up and eat.

87
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,340
I don't want to be late for the class this afternoon.

88
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,660
I can stay with you for another 10 minutes.

89
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,540
Or... Do you want me to skip this afternoon's class?

90
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,220
Why?

91
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,620
Ai

92
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,660
What are you doing here?

93
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,860
Are you here to play basketball?

94
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,660
No,

95
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm here for a walk.

96
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,300
Exercise? What? You know

97
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,140
how to exercise?

98
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,220
How about playing basketball with me?

99
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,700
No.

100
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,740
What's wrong with you?

101
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,820
Ai

102
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,220
What are you doing here?

103
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,220
I've asked him.

104
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,300
Ai is just here for a walk.

105
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,700
When I'm exercising,

106
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,980
I'm just walking around.

107
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,140
I'll be back to the dorm soon.

108
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:46,860
Oh,

109
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,860
Do you want me to give you a ride?

110
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,940
No need.

111
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,860
I can walk back by myself.

112
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,540
You guys go ahead.

113
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,660
Really?

114
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,220
Okay, bye.

115
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,380
OKOK。

116
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,700
Ai

117
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,340
Ohm,

118
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,420
my dad asked me to bring you some pastries.

119
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,900
Hold on.

120
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,660
This is auspicious pastry.

121
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,180
This is my mom's favorite.

122
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,460
Of course.

123
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,980
But my dad

124
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:37,460
will definitely buy high-quality things for your mom.

125
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,620
I don't even know how to choose.

126
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,620
There are several kinds of stuffing in a box,

127
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,740
but they are all delicious.

128
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,940
Ai

129
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,820
This is a gift from my father to your mother.

130
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,620
You're such a foodie.

131
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,140
Giving it to my mother is equivalent to giving it to her child.

132
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,900
Uncle Eak's pastry for my mom is equivalent to giving it to me.

133
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,460
It's delicious.

134
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,460
You have thin skin and thick stuffing,

135
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,740
but you still have a flowing heart.

136
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,420
I can get addicted to it

137
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,340
every time I eat it. Thank Uncle Eak for me.

138
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,220
Yes.

139
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,660
Ai

140
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:16,940
Yes.

141
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,620
Thank you so much.

142
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,340
You came to save me that day,

143
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,260
Yes.

144
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,820
I would be miserable without you.

145
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,420
As long as you're okay.

146
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:31,340
Anyway, you should pay back the money as soon as possible.

147
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,940
I can give it back to Songkhram.

148
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,340
Senior Tum is such a scum.

149
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:40,100
Pretend someone lent me money,

150
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,940
and tricked me into buying his digital currency.

151
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:44,860
You even want to drag my brothers and sisters into this.

152
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,260
Senior Tum,

153
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,020
you don't look like a good person.

154
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,620
Yes.

155
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,940
But at least.

156
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,180
Being Songkhram's baby

157
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,620
is better than being Tum's baby.

158
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,060
What do you mean?

159
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,620
Did I misunderstand?

160
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:12,940
Ai

161
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,900
You should know.

162
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,620
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

163
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,540
Although Songkhram is not as bad as Tum,

164
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:21,340
it is also a real 400 thousand.

165
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Ohm,

166
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,220
listen to me,

167
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,860
I'm nobody's baby.

168
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:35,300
Yeah,

169
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,940
I get it. No, no.

170
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,740
Alright, I don't want to argue with you anymore.

171
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,460
I don't want to quarrel with you.

172
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,420
I'm leaving.

173
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:50,100
Here you are

174
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,780
-Thank you. -Thank you.

175
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,660
Ai.

176
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,620
Why are you here?

177
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,460
Are you serious?

178
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,020
Yeah, that's right.

179
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,100
You guys go back first. I can do it.

180
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,860
Think about it carefully

181
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,260
Ai has a heavy learning task,

182
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,460
You have to set aside time to work.

183
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,980
That's right, Senior Ai. Let's go.

184
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,220
Let's go back together.

185
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:18,740
It's just a coffee shop. It's not hard.

186
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,820
You can go back.

187
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,420
What do you want to make money for?

188
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,180
Can't you tell us?

189
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,620
I have to get back to work.

190
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,460
See you in the dorm.

191
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,340
Do you need us to pick you up? Ai,

192
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,660
no need.

193
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,060
Hello. What can I get you?

194
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,180
-Ice Cocoa. -Okay. The

195
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,860
food is here.

196
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,060
I'll scan the code to pay for it.

197
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,060
Okay,

198
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,740
thank you.

199
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,940
Click to place

200
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,340
an order. Just a moment.

201
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,540
Excuse me. What can I get you?

202
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,060
Banana chocolate and cranberry yogurt.

203
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,380
200% sweetness.

204
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,260
Okay.

205
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,820
Hold on a second.

206
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,420
Order the order. Hello,

207
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,620
dear customer,

208
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,220
Main point... Meen,

209
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,060
didn't you shoot today?

210
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,140
Ai, what are you doing here?

211
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,340
Look at my clothes.

212
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,660
I'm on

213
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,460
a part-time job.

214
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:15,140
What do you need? Customers

215
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:18,300
want a large matcha latte. No whole milk. No syrup.

216
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,780
Do you need dessert?

217
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:26,940
It's 155 baht in total.

218
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,140
Ai, tell me everything.

219
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,660
Tell what?

220
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,660
I just want extra income.

221
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,180
Do you have financial problems?

222
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,700
Tell me how much?

223
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,820
I really don't have anything.

224
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,860
Really?

225
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,340
Really?

226
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,220
But can I ask you one thing?

227
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,140
Don't tell anyone that I work here,

228
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,060
especially Songkhram,

229
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,540
Are you here to work part-time?

230
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,740
Yes.

231
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,060
Okay. -I'm

232
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,340
begging you. -Mm-hmm.

233
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:22,340
A large matcha latte without whole milk or syrup is ready.

234
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,820
Okay, I'll leave you alone.

235
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,620
I'll call you later.

236
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,500
Throw it for me,

237
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:28,620
Yes.

238
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
-Welcome next time. -Customer.

239
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,020
Okay.

240
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,820
Ai

241
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,380
Songkhram,

242
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:41,500
what are you doing here?

243
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,100
Ai, you need to talk to me.

244
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,540
It's still working time.

245
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,780
Can't we talk later when we get back to the dorm?

246
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,460
No, I want to talk now.

247
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,660
Songkhram, go back first.

248
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,940
I'm still working.

249
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,460
Why are you here?

250
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,140
I just want to work and save money.

251
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,980
So that I can give it back to you soon, okay?

252
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,540
Who says I want you to pay me back?

253
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,540
You want to use this debt to hold me in your hands, right?

254
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,740
Quit your job.

255
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
No.

256
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,340
Ai, don't play with your temper.

257
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,860
Don't be stubborn.

258
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,460
I'm just worried about you.

259
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:19,100
What if you get sick?

260
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,220
Where do you have time to rest?

261
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,180
Songkhram,

262
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,220
I can take care of myself when I grow up.

263
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,660
And I have to be responsible for it.

264
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,620
What the heck are you responsible for?

265
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,100
Don't even think about paying me back.

266
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,700
I'm not in a hurry.

267
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,060
That's 400 thousand baht.

268
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,940
You have to work part-time for many years and lifetimes to save enough.

269
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,980
It's because the amount is quite large.

270
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,420
That's why I need to give it back to you.

271
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,940
Songkhram, go back first.

272
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,820
Take it as respecting my decision.

273
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,660
Show me some dignity.

274
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,860
It's still working time.

275
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,540
Ai

276
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,660
Ai

277
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,820
Ai, are you okay?

278
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,260
I'm going in.

279
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:22,980
Ai, what's wrong with you?

280
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,820
Forget it. I'm not dead yet.

281
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,260
I think it's going to be soon.

282
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:28,420
Nothing. I just have a headache. Ai,

283
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,460
you're so hot. Go to the doctor.

284
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,340
Senior Ai, what happened?

285
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,420
It's not bedtime. Why are you still lying like this?

286
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,820
-He's sick. -Get down.

287
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,540
What?

288
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,260
Is Ai sick? Touch,

289
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
what should we do?

290
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,860
Do you need me to see a doctor?

291
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,660
No need. Don't exaggerate. Nano,

292
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,980
you go down first.

293
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,820
Then I'll go buy some medicine.

294
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,940
Senior Ai is sick

295
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,420
What is it?

296
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,300
Where is Ai's room?

297
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,060
604。

298
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,420
What?

299
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,940
Ai, I told you not to go to work.

300
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,460
Stay back.

301
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,220
Is it worth it?

302
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,340
What are you doing? I'm fine.

303
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,380
It's strange if there's nothing else.

304
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,940
Look at yourself.

305
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,460
Your face is paler than boiled chicken.

306
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:38,860
-I'm fine. -Touch, why

307
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,940
don't you check on your friend?

308
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,740
Let's go.

309
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,540
Where are you going?

310
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm not

311
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,540
going to the hospital.

312
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,020
-Let's go. -No.

313
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:48,940
If I don't stand there,

314
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,020
you can't help me.

315
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,060
Yes.

316
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,740
-Ai, go to the hospital. -Go to the hospital. I'm

317
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,540
not going.

318
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,540
-Ai. -Ai, don't

319
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,940
pull me. I'm not going. -Ai, go

320
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,540
to the hospital. -I'm not going.

321
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,260
What the heck are you doing?

322
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,940
Are you really sick? You're so strong.

323
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:03,860
-Go to the hospital! -I'm not

324
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:06,140
going! Let go of me!

325
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,220
Don't underestimate me. I'll hug you.

326
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,180
Your body is hot Ai,

327
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,780
it hurts,

328
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,140
-Let go of me. -Why don't you go

329
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,340
to the doctor? I don't understand.

330
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,060
Be gentle.

331
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,060
I'd rather sleep at home than go to the doctor.

332
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,100
Touch asked for leave for you, the teacher and the store.

333
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,740
I'll clean Ai's body later. Auntie,

334
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,140
I'll leave it to you, son.

335
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,500
So I can prepare porridge and medicine.

336
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,580
Okay, Auntie.

337
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,980
Ai, what are you doing

338
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,140
wiping your body?

339
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,620
Take off your clothes first.

340
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,860
Take off your clothes and wipe your body.

341
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:33,980
This one.

342
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,860
Are you done?

343
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:09,740
Almost there.

344
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:21,940
Give me

345
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,340
the medicine. I can take it myself.

346
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,620
Is it hidden under your tongue?

347
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,260
Ai

348
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,460
Wake up!

349
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,460
Get up and take your medicine.

350
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
There's one more piece.

351
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,700
You're awake.

352
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:00,260
Get up and take care of the most naughty child.

353
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,860
I asked you to see a doctor but you didn't want to go.

354
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:11,780
I don't want to burn it.

355
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,020
I told you it's okay,

356
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,820
but you're being petty again,

357
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,900
Needless to say,

358
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,340
are you trying to call me stupid?

359
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,620
As long as you have strength.

360
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,260
I'll go downstairs and see what your mom will cook for you.

361
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:41,140
Then you can eat and take medicine.

362
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,540
Songkhram,

363
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,260
can I ask you a favor?

364
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,940
Yes.

365
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,660
No Hainan chicken rice,

366
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
Yes.

367
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:58,580
Have you eaten?

368
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,140
Take two then.

369
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,660
Eat with me.

370
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,620
Give it to me.

371
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,620
He really likes to play petty.

372
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,300
I'm feeling better, Auntie.

373
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,180
-Thank you, kid. -Roar

374
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,300
looks appetizing.

375
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:37,340
If it looks good, eat more. Both of you.

376
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:41,500
I heard from Ai that you're also the head of the building,

377
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,020
Yes.

378
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,660
I'm the head of Building No. 2. What's your

379
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,540
major?

380
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,500
A flight student. Do you want to be

381
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,580
a flight attendant?

382
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,220
No,

383
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:56,660
I majored in tower and aircraft repair,

384
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,780
Then what do you want to be?

385
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,780
I wanted to be a pilot,

386
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:04,940
so I finally got into this school,

387
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,980
Don't you want to start your own business

388
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,940
like Ai Bright Touch or others?

389
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:18,260
Please take this up for me first.

390
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
I'll take it up again.

391
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,340
It's okay.

392
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,100
I'll just come down one more time.

393
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,060
Thank you.

394
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,300
Help yourself.

395
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,740
I'm going to take a shower first.

396
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:42,420
Go wash it.

397
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:47,420
You can use the computer if you want. -Yes.

398
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,420
Let's listen to music.

399
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,140
It's too quiet.

400
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,260
Oh my god.

401
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,820
You have so many porn collections.

402
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:25,860
What's wrong?

403
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,460
You look like you've seen a ghost.

404
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,820
Go get dressed first.

405
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,620
What's wrong? Don't you like it?

406
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,260
Sorry No,

407
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,460
I don't know how to continue.

408
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,620
I've never had sex with a boy.

409
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,620
Hello,

410
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,820
I'm Captain Nipop,

411
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,580
As a pilot,

412
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,420
it may be the dream of many people.

413
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:01,060
My childhood dream was also to be a pilot,

414
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,340
which was not only stable but also had a high income.

415
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,020
You can also take us to different places and see different scenery.

416
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,300
I have a strong ability in English listening, speaking and reading.

417
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,860
Play in different places,

418
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,940
if there is no Thai voice guide in the local area,

419
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,220
I can also use English voice guides,

420
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,060
I take my own daughter,

421
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,940
I went to Germany,

422
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,940
I went to Munich Palace,

423
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:34,620
There is no Thai phonetic guide there,

424
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,540
and the reason may be that very few people use Thai there,

425
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:42,340
We understand that, too.

426
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:44,900
In addition to the epidemic over the years,

427
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,500
they have provided headphones for voice guidance.

428
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:48,340
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

429
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,700
As a result,

430
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,340
I was inspired to create a new voice guide software.

431
00:28:53,500 --> 00:29:03,780
Bring together all the languages in the world,

432
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,260
including Thai, of course.

433
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,420
This idea is the same as yours.

434
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:10,020
This should be good, right?

435
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:17,340
If everyone has their own voice navigation software,

436
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,220
finally,

437
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,940
In the last three months,

438
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,540
I've completed this task.

439
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,420
I made a Muse Book software,

440
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:34,220
which contains voice guidance in more than 50 languages.

441
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,060
Covering more than 3, 000 tourist attractions,

442
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:43,580
it is now downloaded by more than 86million people,

443
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,380
You know what?

444
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:49,260
Just in the first season of this year,

445
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:55,140
we earned 9million.

446
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,420
That's great.

447
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,820
Don't think too much about him. Think of him

448
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:05,020
first. He earns first. Because of his husband's,

449
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,580
At least you can have the idea of a successful person like him.

450
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:14,700
I'm sure you'll have more good ideas.

451
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,860
What I want to tell you is,

452
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:21,100
each of us has inspiration,

453
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,860
Whether it's people, things or events,

454
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:32,180
because inspiration can create value,

455
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:34,380
Thank you.

456
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:54,060
Still up?

457
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,900
Uh-huh.

458
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:01,220
I'll sit with you.

459
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,780
What are you thinking?

460
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,460
What's wrong? Did you drink alone

461
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,060
in the middle of the night?

462
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:17,620
If your mom had just asked you,

463
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,020
you wouldn't have answered like that, would you?

464
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,020
Dad,

465
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,540
Okay, okay,

466
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,860
it's not emotional. Seriously,

467
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,860
What's going on?

468
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,100
Today, the school hired the owner of Muse Book,

469
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,660
the one that many people downloaded, right?

470
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,100
So successful.

471
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,660
Boss is amazing.

472
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,220
It was released during the bleak period of travel,

473
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:49,940
and so many people downloaded it and used it,

474
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,340
You sound like my friend,

475
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,780
but I'm just wondering why I'm different from him.

476
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,100
Just like those successful people can think,

477
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,260
seriously Songkhram,

478
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,100
How can you be afraid of such a thing?

479
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,060
I don't know if this is called fear?

480
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,460
But I have such a successful father.

481
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,540
I also want to have my own success.

482
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,220
This is different.

483
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,940
Different people have different paths to go.

484
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:29,660
Instead of thinking about which way to succeed,

485
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,980
it's better to think about which way to bring you joy.

486
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,460
I dream of becoming a pilot.

487
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:41,580
If I can be a pilot, I will be very happy.

488
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,180
Aren't you working hard?

489
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,620
Do you know what he used to do?

490
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,940
Pilot,

491
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,260
how do you know that?

492
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,300
It's so obvious.

493
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,140
Yeah.

494
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:02,260
He found the opportunity while he was playing,

495
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,460
although he also encountered the epidemic problem like us,

496
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,420
But he still found an opportunity.

497
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:15,020
I think the point is not only that he found the opportunity,

498
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,740
but also that he did it,

499
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,020
How can I be as good as him.

500
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,820
I dream of becoming a pilot.

501
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:29,660
I majored in construction machinery,

502
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:34,020
and I felt a lot of pressure when I saw him say that.

503
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,460
Got it?

504
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,740
When did I have the motivation to fight

505
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,820
when I was young?

506
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,540
It's your mother.

507
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,740
Really?

508
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,700
What is your motivation?

509
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:02,540
What makes you want to get up early every day?

510
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,140
What do you mean you miss motivation

511
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,540
every night before going to bed? It's very important.

512
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:13,860
It can encourage us to do things well.

513
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,460
If we have good motivation,

514
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:20,060
it can encourage us to do a lot of good things.

515
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,460
Look.

516
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:29,460
Even if you don't know how to sell insurance, you can get a high insurance policy.

517
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,340
Think about it,

518
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,700
where did your motivation come from that day?

519
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,460
Cheers!

520
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,460
It's my treat and my brother's pleasure today.

521
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,860
What are you going to do at this hour?

522
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,100
Ai, I have something to tell you.

523
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,100
Did you drive here after drinking?

524
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
What are you doing?

525
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,260
Are you still driving after drinking?

526
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,380
Why are you doing this?

527
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,300
What if something happens?

528
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,340
I can't die yet.

529
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,060
If I haven't expressed my love to you.

530
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,020
What the heck are you talking about?

531
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:36,300
Ai, I love you,

532
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,100
and I've loved you for a long time.

533
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,020
Why are you confessing your love to me like this?

534
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,700
What do you want?

535
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,740
Are you going to kneel down in your gown and beg you?

536
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:56,140
You fool,

537
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:59,540
don't drink too much and joke around and confess your love.

538
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,540
I'm not confessing my love.

539
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:04,020
I didn't confess because I was drunk.

540
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,340
I'm telling you, I'm not drunk.

541
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,260
Why are you avoiding my eyes?

542
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,460
Ai

543
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,980
You love me too, don't you?

544
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,860
Did you start to be intoxicated after drinking too much?

545
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,020
If you're still like this, I'll be angry.

546
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,100
What are you doing?

547
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,540
What is it?

548
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:42,780
My key.

549
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:43,860
Leave it with me.

550
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:50,780
I won't let you get drunk and drive home.

551
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,140
Take a taxi home.

552
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,220
Come and get the car when you're sober.

553
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,740
Okay, it's okay.

554
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,220
I can sleep in the car.

555
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:06,340
I can go to school with you tomorrow.

556
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,140
But what I want to tell you is,

557
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,580
I'm not drunk.

558
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,340
And I love you so much.

559
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,020
That's it.

560
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,460
Come and have breakfast,

561
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,340
and then go to school together.

562
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,060
Here's the chicken oil rice for you.

563
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,340
Thank you, Mom.

564
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,860
-You're welcome, kid. -Okay.

565
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,020
Mom, I'm leaving.

566
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,220
Good luck,

567
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,220
kid. Do you need soya-bean milk fritters?

568
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,580
I've had sex with a girl, Nano.

569
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,020
I've never had sex with a boy.

570
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,260
At that time, I wasn't sure what to do.

571
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,820
It's okay. I know. I understand.

572
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,900
I've never had sex with anyone.

573
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,740
But I'm going to learn

574
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,380
what I should do. What should I do?

575
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,620
What should we do then?

576
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,860
I want to do it every night before I go to bed,

577
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,860
just like couples do together,

578
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:29,260
Yeah, me too.

579
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,700
Shall we try again?

580
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:35,460
Well, let's try it.

581
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,700
Slowly,

582
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,540
tell me whether you like it or not.

583
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:40,020
Just tell me what you want.

584
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,500
This way, both sides don't have to be nervous.

585
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,780
-I'm leaving. -Oh, mom.

586
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,540
What?

587
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:03,460
Hello,

588
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,140
this is Captain Songkhram Veewatyanoon,

589
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,180
This is Songkhram Airlines.

590
00:42:08,180 --> 00:42:10,220
We welcome every passenger,

591
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,020
The aircraft carrying the flight is Boeing 747,

592
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:18,660
and now we will fly to UIT International Airport.

593
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,700
The estimated arrival time is 8: 50 local time.

594
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Now the plane is flying at an altitude of 30, 000 feet.

595
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,940
It's flying in the middle of the sea level.

596
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,580
With a speed of 1000Km / hour and an outdoor temperature of

597
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:35,180
31 degrees,

598
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,940
But the temperature in my heart is extremely warm.

599
00:42:43,620 --> 00:42:44,620
Can we go now?

600
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,940
I'm going to be late.

601
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,620
Captain Songkhram,

602
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,020
slow down.

603
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:54,940
Lie down.

604
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:57,940
Come on.

605
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:11,780
I don't want to see you cry for that girl.

606
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:16,820
That would make me sad.

607
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,860
And he did that to you.

608
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:58,380
Keep your distance next time.

609
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:01,580
If you hate me like that, don't give me hope.

610
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:04,460
Try it. Maybe you like it.

611
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,580
Do you like trees?

612
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:07,580
You like me?
