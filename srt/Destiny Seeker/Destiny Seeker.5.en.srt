1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:02,780
I wasted four years.

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:07,780
We'll hold an event in the outer mansion and stay for one night.

3
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:12,260
If I could give up so easily, I would have given up long ago.

4
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,100
I'll send him back later.

5
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,260
None of your business.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,660
I can do it.

7
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,300
Where's my phone?

8
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,660
Here it is.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,780
I'll put it here.

10
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,860
I'm leaving.

11
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,180
Hurry up.

12
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,300
We made an appointment to get on the bus at 8 o'clock.

13
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,900
You didn't get up to take a shower until 8 o'clock.

14
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,340
Why are you mumbling

15
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,420
when you're running?

16
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,580
I thought I was at home.

17
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:17,380
Hi, Songkhram.

18
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,140
Didn't you come with the head of Dorm 3?

19
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:22,780
Have you seen Plug?

20
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,460
No.

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,500
Hurry up.

22
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:35,780
Plug, come here.

23
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,540
Plug,

24
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,900
tell me everything you know.

25
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,220
-Know... -Know what? Senior Songkhram.

26
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,500
You

27
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,780
want to know who's in our dorm, right?

28
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,340
I found a piece of evidence to guarantee that the other party can't get away.

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,940
What evidence is it?

30
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,980
I can't tell you yet.

31
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,900
Nano is taking evidence for me.

32
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,940
obtain evidence

33
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,060
Yes, Senior.

34
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,780
There is only one truth,

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,980
to obtain evidence and reveal the truth to everyone by the sea.

36
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,900
What are you two doing?

37
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,100
-Give me the evidence. -No. Ai and I are

38
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,100
the heads of Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3,

39
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,980
Deal with it for us.

40
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,300
Where is the evidence?

41
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,700
Where is it?

42
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,780
Are you two

43
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,380
leaving or not?

44
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,100
Everyone else is waiting in the car.

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,820
All I can tell you is,

46
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:28,100
I found the badge of the member of dormitory building 3 in our dormitory building,

47
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,660
What?

48
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,060
You brat.

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,900
I've never heard Ai complain about

50
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,380
losing the badge of the members of Dorm 3.

51
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,380
I'll sit here.

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,900
This is Touch's seat.

53
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,660
Aren't you afraid that people over there will talk about it?

54
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:02,820
No,

55
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,660
I'm even more afraid I can't sit next to you By the way

56
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,060
Is your badge on you?

57
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,660
Yes. Why

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,540
are you asking me about the badge?

59
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,460
Plug said he found out that

60
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,660
the members of Dorm 3 had left their badges in our dorm building that night,

61
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,740
I'll go.

62
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,980
I was like, why can't I find it?

63
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,300
I'm about to make a new one,

64
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,860
Ai

65
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,460
You …

66
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,500
You … I guess it must have been dropped when I took out my phone to illuminate you.

67
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,900
Hurry up, everyone.

68
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,780
Gather, gather, gather,

69
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,700
the younger ones at the back, lean up a little.

70
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:05,260
All right, everyone,

71
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:08,180
I'll let everyone take care of their own private affairs.

72
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:11,100
I'll give you 10 minutes to go to the toilet.

73
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,220
Then let's draw lots.

74
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,020
Let's see who lives with whom.

75
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:20,660
Dormitory Building 2 and Dormitory Building 3 must be mixed,

76
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,460
with two people in each room.

77
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:27,700
Think of this as the beginning of our friendship, okay?

78
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,980
Even if it's not good, it has to be good.

79
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:33,860
Go ahead! Dismiss!

80
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,260
Hurry up.

81
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,460
10 minutes to deal with your private affairs.

82
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,180
Let's draw lots later. Ten minutes,

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,460
everyone.

84
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,100
-Go ahead. -Meen, you

85
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,380
have to help me.

86
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,780
What can I do to live with Ai?

87
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,220
I thought it was something.

88
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,060
I think

89
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,100
you should go to him and beg him to live with him.

90
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,460
He should have agreed to it.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,620
No way.

92
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,140
Everything must be based on fairness.

93
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,020
I can't break the rules.

94
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,660
What should I do if others use this

95
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,860
as an excuse?

96
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:06,180
So what?

97
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,100
Do you want to draw lots by fate? Yes,

98
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,340
I want to draw.

99
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:15,940
How can you be confident that you can draw him?

100
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,380
Of course I'm confident.

101
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:19,980
Because I need your help.

102
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,180
Next.

103
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:34,340
Nano from Dormitory 3, come on up.

104
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,700
I hope my baby elephant can meet the one.

105
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,820
I'm ready.

106
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,820
Go ahead.

107
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:50,980
Here you are

108
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,180
No The person you live with is

109
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:58,820
Bright from Dormitory 2,

110
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,420
Senior Bright is the best person in Dormitory

111
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,220
2. Are you that happy?

112
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,500
But Bright didn't come until late in the evening.

113
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,060
He has something to do at home. Okay,

114
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,060
senior.

115
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,020
Okay, next.

116
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,340
Songkhram2

117
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,860
Dormitory Chief,

118
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,900
please pick one. The owner of the building

119
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,100
will give it to you.

120
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,300
The head of Dormitory 2

121
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,460
and.

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,020
Dormitory No. 3 has a long sleep.

123
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,340
How is that possible?

124
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,460
God, is the head of the dorm led by the red line of fate?

125
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,860
Hello, everyone. Today's live stream is

126
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,660
Plug. I'm at the beach now.

127
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,220
It's too sunny out there.

128
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,940
There's someone watching.

129
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,900
Oh, come on. This bro is awesome.

130
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,860
You are definitely not an ordinary person,

131
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,140
usually no one will come to watch my live broadcast.

132
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,740
It will take a long time for someone to come in and watch my live stream.

133
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,300
I thought

134
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:54,060
I would kill you if I found out.

135
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,460
Who would know?

136
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:56,940
God knows it, you know it, I know it.

137
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,660
My dear brother,

138
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,740
why did you invest so much money?

139
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,980
You know how Ai feels about you.

140
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,580
You also know that your friend's mouth is as hard as a rock.

141
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:09,540
So you have to keep teasing him like this.

142
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,580
Yes, Ai was so cute when I teased her.

143
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,740
I must pry open his mouth and hear what he thinks of me.

144
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:23,140
Okay, I'll wait and see if you'll miss this time.

145
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:27,060
Hey, you're not cursing me, are you?

146
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,580
What about you?

147
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,580
Don't you want Bright?

148
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,860
I don't want to.

149
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,140
Get back to work.

150
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,420
In case Touch finds clues when looking for the box.

151
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,820
By then, both of us will be doomed.

152
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,780
Got it.

153
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,620
I found it.

154
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,460
I'm going to put it at the bottom.

155
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,260
Hurry up.

156
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,180
Got it.

157
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,180
All right, all right.

158
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,780
Come on, pour it in.

159
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,980
Let's go.

160
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,580
My idol, Senior Songkram, really has two brushes.

161
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,580
What do you think?

162
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:39,820
The fate between you and me is meant to be.

163
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,540
You just hit me by mistake.

164
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,820
By the way, tonight, we're going to.

165
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,620
Tonight what?

166
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,940
What are you doing tonight?

167
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,260
What are you thinking, Tualisongkhram? No,

168
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,340
I'm not thinking about anything.

169
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,460
I just want to ask you,

170
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:01,980
what should we eat tonight?

171
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,500
Then.

172
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,780
Let's go to our room and pack up.

173
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
Jerk!

174
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,180
You really are.

175
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,260
Hello, Senior Bright.

176
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,460
I'm calling you to say,

177
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:31,580
you sleep with Senior Meen.

178
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,060
Senior Songkhram drew it for you.

179
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,380
I'll sleep with Nao.

180
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,180
Nano got my name,

181
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,780
I didn't even get your name.

182
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
Senior, that's all for now.

183
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,700
Senior Meen likes Senior Bright,

184
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,060
how do you know

185
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,980
I'm Senior Meen's roommate? I don't know yet.

186
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:50,540
When I hid the UIT badge scanning device,

187
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:53,580
I overheard Senior Songkhram chatting with Senior Meen,

188
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,500
Senior Meen seems to be angry with Senior Bright because of something,

189
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,140
Senior Meen should like Senior Bright,

190
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:03,580
But they may not be together for some reason.

191
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,380
If you love your senior Meen,

192
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,900
let them sleep together, bro.

193
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,300
So that they can make it clear.

194
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:12,380
Or is it because the two dormitory buildings don't get along?

195
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,940
It's possible.

196
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,780
I don't know what the hell the rules are,

197
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,860
but the people in Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3 haven't been able to get along for a long time,

198
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,660
Is that still possible?

199
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,700
The UIT badge probably belongs to...

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,100
It's possible.

201
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,220
No wonder Senior Songkhram forced me like that this morning.

202
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,540
It turned out that he wanted to help his friend,

203
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:34,380
or that Senior Meen felt that he was causing trouble for Senior Bright.

204
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,860
Yeah, that's right.

205
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,820
But speaking of which,

206
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:40,100
Senior Meen is also very bad.

207
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,900
As expected,

208
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,460
you came to provoke my roommate,

209
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,060
Screw you.

210
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,420
But wait a minute. I

211
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,420
sleep with Bright every night,

212
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,500
Why did Senior Meen come to Senior Bright's room?

213
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,500
Yeah, that's right.

214
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,460
That means it's someone else.

215
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,900
That's right,

216
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,500
but what's certain is,

217
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,660
I saw him in the middle of the night,

218
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,580
Yes.

219
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,220
But there must be something wrong with Bright and Meen.

220
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,260
Let them explain it clearly.

221
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,380
I'll go. But I want to sleep with

222
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,540
Senior Bright, too. What's wrong?

223
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,780
You like him. I don't like him.

224
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,780
I … I just admire him.

225
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,660
Senior is an athlete. Super cool.

226
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,300
What's wrong? I'm an athlete too.

227
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,060
You can sleep with me too.

228
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,140
I just want you to have a happy ending.

229
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,580
Let's go, bro.

230
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,180
We still have a lot of things to do.

231
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
[ Connection

232
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,580
failed ] Why can't I log in all the time?

233
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,380
What's wrong? Can't you use the password?

234
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,820
Yeah, I've tried many times,

235
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,220
but the manager hasn't answered the phone.

236
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
If I go, I won't be able to investigate it.

237
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,460
Yes, I know.

238
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,220
I also want to know who that is.

239
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:20,220
We have to know. Yes,

240
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,780
I have to know the truth.

241
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,860
answer my call, too. The manager

242
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,340
sent it to me.

243
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,500
Let's go.

244
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,980
Help me get my clothes.

245
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,980
I brought you something to eat.

246
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,820
Why did you give it to me?

247
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,020
I'll let you eat.

248
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,900
Do you think I'll give it to you to worship God?

249
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,100
Jerk!

250
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,860
After my mom gave you food when you went to my house last time,

251
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,100
did you get on top of it?

252
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,620
Yes.

253
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,580
Your Lao Chili sauce

254
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:16,980
is really delicious.

255
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,780
It's all because of you.

256
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:23,380
It's delicious to eat with fruits like this.

257
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,860
That's right. It's really delicious.

258
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,380
I often eat like this, too.

259
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,180
I'll eat it then.

260
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,380
So refreshing.

261
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,380
Aren't you going to eat it? Why are you holding it?

262
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:49,140
Uh-huh. Can you finish it?

263
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,540
Um, did you tell Plug

264
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,620
about my badge?

265
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,460
I still can't find the right time.

266
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,020
But you don't have to worry.

267
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,380
Let's talk about it tonight.

268
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,300
By the way, where did Plug and Nano go?

269
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,500
You played football with me just now.

270
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,780
I don't know either.

271
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,380
I haven't seen them for a while.

272
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,300
Well,

273
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,340
forget it. They must be gossiping around here.

274
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,620
Where are you going?

275
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:31,580
Of course you have to go to the beach to play.

276
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,700
Oh, wait a minute.

277
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,500
Wait for me.

278
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:40,900
This one

279
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,660
That's enough. I can apply it myself.

280
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,900
Shut up!

281
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,300
Are you going to paint it on my butt?

282
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Beasts.

283
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,100
Senior Ai,

284
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,300
welcome the head of Dormitory 3.

285
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,660
Help Mr. Lou take off his clothes.

286
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,220
Let's go.

287
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,740
Please welcome

288
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,500
the head of our dorm.

289
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,980
Come here.

290
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,260
Come here.

291
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,660
Hurry up, Mr. Lou.

292
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,100
They've welcomed him.

293
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,540
Welcome.

294
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:08,180
Let's welcome you first.

295
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:11,380
1 2 3。

296
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,220
1 2 3。

297
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:42,700
I got your clothes back.

298
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:44,620
Thank you.

299
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,460
Give me the clothes.

300
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,580
Do you want to smell it secretly?

301
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Are you crazy?

302
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,900
I'm not a pervert.

303
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,260
You must be mentally retarded.

304
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,060
I read a book that said

305
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:16,980
"Being in love is a condition that people admit to being sick".

306
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,500
What do you mean?

307
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:49,180
What's wrong with you today? Just

308
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:52,300
Plug.

309
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,780
You want to change rooms with No?

310
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,780
Who are you sleeping with?

311
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,260
Bright,

312
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
isn't that great?

313
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,740
You two are close.

314
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,380
Don't waste time getting to know him,

315
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:07,820
now I seem to be...

316
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,700
trying to get to know him again.

317
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,900
What are you talking about?

318
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,420
Haven't you known each other since high school?

319
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,100
Or the same school?

320
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,180
Yes.

321
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,100
Let's go back and take a shower.

322
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,020
Get ready for the party tonight.

323
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,460
Let's go. -Let's go.

324
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,700
Everyone who comes, please take your seats.

325
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,300
[ 8th UIT Dormitory Club ] Everyone who comes, please take your seats.

326
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,220
Dormitory No. 2 Dormitory Building No. 3 = 8th UIT Dormitory Building Association = No need

327
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,300
to sit.

328
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,540
Needless to say,

329
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:42,700
please applaud the leaders of Dormitory No. 2 and No.

330
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:46,500
3 for coming together.

331
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:51,620
If I come out with Double Happiness Yarn,

332
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,580
I'll think it's the wedding scene. No, what are you talking about? You're responsible for it.

333
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,500
Sit here.

334
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,940
You're finally willing to come down.

335
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:01,260
Who is so slow?

336
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,700
I told you to leave first. You had to wait for me.

337
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,820
Didn't I not want to answer other people's questions?

338
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,580
Who would ask you about me?

339
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,260
This … That … Everyone,

340
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:13,780
stop arguing.

341
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
This is our sorority.

342
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:18,780
What does the building manager look like when he's so noisy?

343
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,460
Isn't this a fight?

344
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,700
This is a joke,

345
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,100
right?

346
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,460
Yeah, there's no fight, but it's going to be soon.

347
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,780
Are you okay, Meen?

348
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,420
I'm fine. Why would I be okay?

349
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,380
Oh, by the way, do you know you're going to be on stage?

350
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,980
What? On the stage?

351
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:45,900
Why?

352
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,740
No one told me in advance, Plug

353
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,340
They just announced not long ago that you have something to say to everyone,

354
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,780
I haven't said anything yet.

355
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,820
But your little brother said it for you.

356
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,500
Yes.

357
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,660
You're not cowards, are you? Mr. Lou,

358
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,500
Mr. Lou,

359
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:06,180
The next part

360
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,260
is the highlight of Dormitory 2 and 3,

361
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,780
Everyone should be ready, right?

362
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,260
Let's welcome our Head Songkhram and Ai to the stage

363
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,940
and applaud.

364
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:29,060
It's not often that you get such a good chance.

365
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,700
It can be said that there is almost no such opportunity.

366
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:34,500
If people from Dormitory 2 and Dormitory 3 can get together,

367
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:37,060
let's listen to our chief's thoughts.

368
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,700
Let's start with my senior Ai.

369
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,860
Applause,

370
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,100
Louder.

371
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,500
As the chief of Dormitory No. 3 with the highest value.

372
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:10,900
We are often belittled as empty dormitory buildings.

373
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:13,860
Especially by the people in Dormitory 2,

374
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,900
but we can't deny it,

375
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:19,500
After all, this is also our characteristic.

376
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,020
But we were screened because of the same rule,

377
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:27,300
and what I want to say is,

378
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,140
Dormitory 3 has never treated you as enemies.

379
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:38,140
He even praised the ability of Dormitory 2.

380
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,380
I understand that our dormitory buildings don't fit in well

381
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:45,700
because of the tradition of the past.

382
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,940
But now it's our time.

383
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,460
I don't care about the so-called boring dignity.

384
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,300
There are more important things in this world.

385
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,940
What is it?

386
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,260
We should be more united and friendly.

387
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,980
You're confessing your love to me in disguise,

388
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,620
I didn't say I love you.

389
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,300
I'm asking everyone to love each other,

390
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,020
and swear that you didn't prepare the draft?

391
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,100
Uh,

392
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,860
I don't remember what I just said.

393
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,580
Next, it's our turn, Senior Songkhram, the head of Dormitory 2.

394
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,180
Rules are rules.

395
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,900
I'm afraid it's hard to cancel them.

396
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,220
But that doesn't mean it can't be changed.

397
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,500
Judging from today's sorority,

398
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,660
I can feel dormitory building 2 and dormitory building 3.

399
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,180
We can get along happily.

400
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,340
Then we'll have to have a drink to celebrate.

401
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,860
No.

402
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:02,900
Don't let me know that people from dormitory 2 are going to dormitory 3 again.

403
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,580
If I catch you, you're dead.

404
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,460
I'm worried about you.

405
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,980
What are you looking at? Eat.

406
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,900
Have a good time tonight.

407
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,260
Let's celebrate.

408
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,380
Cheers!

409
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,860
You drink it

410
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,100
This one is hungry.

411
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,660
I'm hungry.

412
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:37,060
-Fork. -Eat it.

413
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,980
Senior, have some.

414
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,980
Cheers!

415
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,220
What the heck?

416
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,540
Senior Songkhram is drunk.

417
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,700
I only drank a little.

418
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,100
I'm not drunk yet.

419
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:17,300
They're all drunk.

420
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:19,900
It's just the two of us, isn't it, Senior Touch?

421
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,300
Ouch.

422
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,700
I think you're quite good at drinking.

423
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,180
Are you okay?

424
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:16,980
Sure,

425
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:18,260
I'm not drunk.

426
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,380
Then you blushed because you were shy.

427
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,220
nerve

428
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,580
Is it time to play?

429
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,980
Someone is coming.

430
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,940
Keep drinking.

431
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,060
I'm leaving.

432
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,780
Why are you so drunk?

433
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:53,780
No one can drink better than you.

434
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,860
Do you want to compete again?

435
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,100
That's enough.

436
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:58,260
Go to Plug and Nano's room.

437
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,380
Let's go.

438
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,100
I'll go.

439
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,020
Go a little further and you'll find the toilet.

440
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,700
You little brats,

441
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,500
keep your voice down. They'll hear you

442
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:21,340
looking at him later.

443
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,260
Lower your voice.

444
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,900
-Let's go. -Leave him alone.

445
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:25,660
Hurry up.

446
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,060
Stop!

447
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:33,700
I said I won't let you go.

448
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,580
Why did you leave me?

449
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,980
Honey, don't leave me!

450
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,580
Okay?

451
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,820
Can you hear me? Don't leave me.

452
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,820
Can you hear me?

453
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,540
When I heard about your sister,

454
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:51,980
what did she go through?

455
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,460
You came at the right time.

456
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,940
-Let's go. -Don't mind. I can't believe they

457
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,140
brought the scanner from school.

458
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,460
Little brat.

459
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,460
What should we do?

460
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,460
What should we do next if we can't find him?

461
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,860
Isn't that Bright?

462
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,380
Yes.

463
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,300
I'm dead then.

464
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,380
I think we might have to hide here for a while.

465
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,900
Are you okay?

466
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,300
I'm fine.

467
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,300
What about you? Are you feeling bad?

468
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:53,900
That's good.

469
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,540
What did you say just now?

470
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,580
No, I didn't say anything.

471
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,700
Shut up. Bright will hear you.

472
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:27,620
Walk well, Meen.

473
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,860
Walk well.

474
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,380
Meen, are you going to take a shower?

475
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,580
Just sleep like this if you don't wash it.

476
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,100
Are you going to sleep like this?

477
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,700
Meen。

478
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,860
I'll take off your clothes.

479
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,260
And watches.

480
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,220
Ding Dong Ding Dong Ding Dong.

481
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,860
You can get up now.

482
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,780
Nano is asleep too.

483
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,140
You can get up now.

484
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
Why are you asleep?

485
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:47,980
SongkharmUIT,

486
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
you can't know the truth

487
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,100
if you don't get your badge up. Oh, guys,

488
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,980
Which dormitory building went to dormitory building 3?

489
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,060
You can get up now.

490
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,380
It's going to be noon soon. Everyone,

491
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:58,300
get up. You can get up now.

492
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,580
Will you study so hard?

493
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,740
-Come on. -Senior, wake up. Come on. Come on. Come here. Let's

494
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:11,940
reveal the answer. Come on.

495
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,780
Hurry up, hurry up. Got it, right?

496
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:18,100
Dormitory 3. Who's going to Dormitory 2?

497
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,700
All the secrets are in this UIT badge.

498
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,140
If no one comes out and confesses,

499
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,180
there's only one truth.

500
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,980
1，

501
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,380
2，

502
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:37,900
Plug Nano, stop. What took you

503
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,220
so long? They're about to find out.

504
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,660
I think it's better not to prove it.

505
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,420
We should protect other people's privacy.

506
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,660
Okay?

507
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,900
But it's against the rules. Someone went to Dormitory 2. Last night,

508
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,540
you said you wanted us to be united and friendly.

509
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:56,380
Uh, uh, uh,

510
00:38:56,380 --> 00:39:04,260
open it, open it, open it, open it, open it.

511
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,580
1，

512
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:07,060
2，

513
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,540
3，

514
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,300
= UIT student = =

515
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,740
Natchanon Nantasuwankol = = ID: 651830 =, I've never been to dormitory building 2 without me.

516
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780
No, no, no, no.

517
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,860
It's not mine. Mine is in my pocket.

518
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,500
Nano, are you hungry?

519
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,380
I'm not hungry.

520
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:29,380
Are you satisfied with your hunger

521
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,860
and thirst? The beast

522
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:36,180
is gone.

523
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,580
Go to bed. What's going on?

524
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:40,060
It's a waste of time.

525
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,980
I've been your roommate for more than a semester.

526
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:18,380
I know you so well.

527
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,980
I'll be sad that Plug has become like this.

528
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,100
Take off your clothes first.

529
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:46,660
At least it's better for you to be Songkhram's baby than Tum's baby.

530
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:50,940
If a boy suddenly has feelings for another boy, is that wrong?

531
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:54,180
What is your motivation?

532
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:55,300
I can't die yet.

533
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,660
I haven't confessed to you yet.
