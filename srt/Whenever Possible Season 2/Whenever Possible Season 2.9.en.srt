1
00:00:00,242 --> 00:00:01,741
Look at the Christmas tree.

2
00:00:01,742 --> 00:00:03,311
(A coffee shop with Christmas vibes)

3
00:00:03,312 --> 00:00:04,341
It's Christmas.

4
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:06,340
I put up my tree.

5
00:00:06,341 --> 00:00:08,111
- Really? At home? - Yes, two days ago.

6
00:00:08,281 --> 00:00:09,281
For real?

7
00:00:09,382 --> 00:00:10,951
I planted a real Christmas tree.

8
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:13,520
You are indeed extraordinary.

9
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:14,581
(The tree Yeon Seok planted himself)

10
00:00:14,582 --> 00:00:15,750
We're in...

11
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,821
- Myeong-dong. - We're in Myeong-dong.

12
00:00:17,822 --> 00:00:19,921
Myeong-dong was the place
when it came to Christmas.

13
00:00:19,922 --> 00:00:21,692
- Even to this day... - Yes.

14
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:22,930
Isn't it still true?

15
00:00:22,931 --> 00:00:24,630
- There's the Myeongdong Cathedral.
- Right.

16
00:00:24,631 --> 00:00:26,060
Have you walked the Myeong-dong street...

17
00:00:26,061 --> 00:00:27,902
while holding hands with your lover?

18
00:00:29,372 --> 00:00:31,201
Not while holding hands.

19
00:00:31,472 --> 00:00:32,472
Did you walk...

20
00:00:33,171 --> 00:00:35,042
- No, not while holding hands.
- Separately?

21
00:00:35,241 --> 00:00:38,012
I came to Myeong-dong
when we had a thing going on.

22
00:00:38,112 --> 00:00:40,412
But not holding hands,
especially at the year-end.

23
00:00:41,612 --> 00:00:43,172
I wonder what I'll be doing on the eve.

24
00:00:43,351 --> 00:00:44,482
You'll probably be at home.

25
00:00:46,052 --> 00:00:49,052
I want to spend a smoking hot eve.

26
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:51,490
- Sleep with your heater pad on. - Right.

27
00:00:51,491 --> 00:00:53,060
- All warm and cozy. - Exactly.

28
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:54,421
Turn your heater pad on at night.

29
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:56,391
This place is...

30
00:00:56,561 --> 00:00:58,061
- There they are. - Are they here?

31
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:01,001
(Spotting the Whenever Friends)

32
00:01:01,002 --> 00:01:02,261
Here they are.

33
00:01:02,332 --> 00:01:04,571
Starting from over there, they are...

34
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,101
- He came wearing white pants.
- I know, right?

35
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,812
Didn't we have that dish here in the past?

36
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:13,111
This place looks like where
C'est Si Bon performed.

37
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:14,240
(Today's Whenever Friends
are hanging around suspiciously.)

38
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,181
Here comes Lee Bong Won.

39
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,650
(Bong Won wearing white pants?)

40
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:19,722
It's Lee Bong Won.

41
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:22,120
- It never crossed my mind. - It didn't?

42
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:24,991
- But they look alike.
- He looks like Bong Won.

43
00:01:25,092 --> 00:01:26,161
- Oh, no. - The older he gets,

44
00:01:26,162 --> 00:01:27,391
the more he looks like Bong Won.

45
00:01:27,392 --> 00:01:29,430
- Is he Bong Won today? - Yes.

46
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,461
He's Bong Won.

47
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:32,031
Goodness, Lee Juck.

48
00:01:32,032 --> 00:01:33,601
- Hi. - Hi.

49
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,930
- Hi. Oh, my. - Hey, Lee Juck.

50
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:37,071
Hi.

51
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:39,002
Oh, Bong Won.

52
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,740
- Hi. - There are a lot of crew members.

53
00:01:41,741 --> 00:01:43,070
Hey, Bong Won.

54
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:44,071
(Today's Whenever Friends,
Lee Juck and Jung Jae Hyung)

55
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:45,741
Hi. Nice to meet you.

56
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:47,911
Bong Won. I have to
visit your jjamppong place.

57
00:01:47,912 --> 00:01:49,552
What jjamppong place?

58
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,180
Is that the reason we're at this place?

59
00:01:51,181 --> 00:01:53,180
- We have to go to Cheonan. - Definitely.

60
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,681
How can you talk about Bong Won...

61
00:01:54,851 --> 00:01:56,451
- when you invited me here? - I heard...

62
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:58,291
your place was a must-eat restaurant.

63
00:01:58,392 --> 00:01:59,692
Right?

64
00:01:59,791 --> 00:02:01,960
- How about jjamppong for lunch? - Why not?

65
00:02:01,961 --> 00:02:03,231
What's wrong with him?

66
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:06,600
- Yeon Seok is very energetic. - He is.

67
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:09,170
Yeon Seok is now reformed...

68
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:11,200
- as a variety show MC.
- How did this happen?

69
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:13,300
- Jae Suk ruined a person. - I know, right?

70
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:15,502
Yeon Seok can't act in a romance anymore.

71
00:02:15,601 --> 00:02:17,570
- He's in one.
- I'm currently in a romantic drama.

72
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:18,971
You are right now, because...

73
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,612
the contract was signed before this show.

74
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,580
- He's in one. - It'll be the last one.

75
00:02:22,581 --> 00:02:25,011
- Why are you cursing him?
- I'm in a drama.

76
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:27,221
- I'm saying, don't go too far.
- "When the..."

77
00:02:27,222 --> 00:02:28,521
Yeon Seok. I told you, right?

78
00:02:28,522 --> 00:02:30,591
- Lee Juck is... - Hey, let me talk!

79
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:31,722
Let me talk too!

80
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:33,420
- My ears are ringing.
- I want to talk too.

81
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,121
- You... - It's my turn now.

82
00:02:35,122 --> 00:02:37,561
Who was it that told me I was energetic?

83
00:02:37,562 --> 00:02:38,991
Why are they yelling?

84
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,630
- "When the Phone Rings?" - Yes.

85
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:42,031
That's the most-watched drama right now.

86
00:02:42,032 --> 00:02:43,032
- He's right. - I know.

87
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:44,630
I was abroad until now.

88
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:45,941
It's in first place even in Hong Kong.

89
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:47,040
- Exactly. - Yes.

90
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,141
- And even in Macau. - Yes.

91
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:51,772
Yeon Seok is also good at musicals.

92
00:02:51,912 --> 00:02:53,941
The path he's taking is great.

93
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:55,580
- I kept my eye on him. - Jae Hyung.

94
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:56,911
- What? - You searched in the car, right?

95
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:58,380
(Busted)

96
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:00,021
- Hey. Did you see it? - Jae Hyung.

97
00:03:00,022 --> 00:03:01,651
- Was there a camera in my car?
- I knew it.

98
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:03,021
There was no way you wouldn't have.

99
00:03:03,022 --> 00:03:04,751
- As he runs a YouTube channel, - And...

100
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,591
- he has all the information... - Exactly.

101
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:07,661
About the cast.

102
00:03:07,662 --> 00:03:09,991
Jae Hyung isn't all
that interested in others.

103
00:03:09,992 --> 00:03:11,290
He's not.

104
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:14,330
Jae Hyung would never
get the title of a drama right.

105
00:03:14,331 --> 00:03:16,508
- It never happens.
- Don't mess with "Fairy Jae Hyung."

106
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:17,901
(Don't mess with "Fairy Jae Hyung.")

107
00:03:17,902 --> 00:03:19,700
- Don't mess with what?
- Don't mess with "Fairy Jae Hyung."

108
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,971
- But "Fairy Jae Hyung..." - Nobody...

109
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:22,140
- copied "Pinggyego." - messed with it.

110
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:23,241
He's driving me crazy.

111
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:25,372
- My channel started it 1st!
- Started what 1st?

112
00:03:25,442 --> 00:03:27,511
- We started...
- You started off with vlogs.

113
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,580
You saw we were doing well...

114
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:31,087
- and copied us. - Let's switch seats.

115
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:32,151
They're so loud.

116
00:03:32,152 --> 00:03:33,221
- You... - All right, then.

117
00:03:33,222 --> 00:03:34,420
(Suddenly smiling)

118
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:35,951
Thank you for loving my channel.

119
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:39,760
- A hardcore iced Americano drinker? - Yes.

120
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:41,691
I used to be a hardcore
iced Americano drinker.

121
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:43,692
- What happened? - It's cold today.

122
00:03:45,261 --> 00:03:46,360
- What... - It's cold outside.

123
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,331
Hey. Do you not know what it means?

124
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:50,031
You're even highly educated.

125
00:03:50,032 --> 00:03:51,501
It's not cold to the point
of freezing to death.

126
00:03:51,502 --> 00:03:53,071
- But... - If the worst happens...

127
00:03:53,101 --> 00:03:55,471
He studied 30 years ago.

128
00:03:55,472 --> 00:03:57,311
- That's why, right?
- He's not like the old days.

129
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,711
- By the way, Yeon Seok. - Yes?

130
00:03:58,712 --> 00:04:00,580
Here's a heads up. Lee Juck uses...

131
00:04:00,581 --> 00:04:03,480
- sophisticated words quite often.
- He does.

132
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:07,051
So every word from him
pierces deep into your heart.

133
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:08,521
- It makes me extremely upset. - But...

134
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:11,351
Remembering his words at
home puts me in a foul mood.

135
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:13,852
Earlier about you not being
able to act in romantic dramas.

136
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:15,190
- Once you get home... - It'll upset you.

137
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:17,132
That's why I signed contracts in advance.

138
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:19,261
- Good job. - It hurt him.

139
00:04:19,262 --> 00:04:20,401
Prove it, Yeon Seok.

140
00:04:20,402 --> 00:04:21,961
That you can do both
variety shows and romance.

141
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,071
- Prove it. - Yes.

142
00:04:23,072 --> 00:04:25,170
I even promoted the drama on this show.

143
00:04:25,171 --> 00:04:26,341
- Exactly. - So...

144
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:29,972
I'm the one who brought
this man, Lee Bong Won,

145
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:32,011
- into the variety world. - He's right.

146
00:04:32,012 --> 00:04:33,012
- Really? - It was when...

147
00:04:33,013 --> 00:04:34,211
Jae Suk hosted "Come to Play."

148
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,151
- I remember. - I brought him as a friend.

149
00:04:36,152 --> 00:04:37,951
Juck was rarely on variety shows back then.

150
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,012
Right.

151
00:04:39,282 --> 00:04:41,581
- Back then...
- But I surpassed him quickly.

152
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,722
- That's not true. - Yes.

153
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,621
After Juck brought Jae
Hyung as a variety show baby,

154
00:04:45,722 --> 00:04:47,361
- I bathed him, - Exactly.

155
00:04:47,791 --> 00:04:48,990
- brushed his teeth, and... - Yes.

156
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:50,761
Hyung Don helped him blow his nose.

157
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:52,631
- We raised him. - Yes.

158
00:04:52,632 --> 00:04:54,461
I was also only doing dramas...

159
00:04:54,462 --> 00:04:56,370
when Yeong Seok brought me in...

160
00:04:56,371 --> 00:04:57,870
- with "Youth Over Flowers." - Right.

161
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,100
- Jae Suk... - And Tae Hyun introduced him.

162
00:05:00,101 --> 00:05:01,371
- That's right. - Yes.

163
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:03,211
- You bathed me, but what about him?
- You're one of Tae Hyun's people.

164
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:04,471
- Sorry? - What was Yeon Seok?

165
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:07,940
Yeon Seok had already
grown a bit to a grade-schooler.

166
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,451
There was no need to bathe him.

167
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,827
- Did you help him blow his nose? - Yes.

168
00:05:10,851 --> 00:05:12,180
While I bathed you, Jae Hyung.

169
00:05:12,181 --> 00:05:13,881
- You helped me enter school.
- And I washed your hair.

170
00:05:13,882 --> 00:05:16,120
Goodness, thank you so much.

171
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:17,621
(Purehearted macho)

172
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:23,091
Upon hearing we would have you two...

173
00:05:23,092 --> 00:05:24,690
on the Christmas Eve special,

174
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:26,500
I got excited.

175
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:28,000
It'll air on Christmas Eve.

176
00:05:28,001 --> 00:05:29,971
Today's episode will air on Christmas Eve.

177
00:05:29,972 --> 00:05:32,000
- That's right.
- I might have been too hyper.

178
00:05:32,001 --> 00:05:33,902
Please accept my apology.

179
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,001
- Where's my camera? - There isn't one.

180
00:05:36,241 --> 00:05:37,841
There are over 20 cameras here.

181
00:05:37,842 --> 00:05:40,411
- Why would you look for yours?
- There isn't one solely for you.

182
00:05:40,412 --> 00:05:42,142
The editor will find a solo clip of you.

183
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:44,311
- No camera is assigned to you.
- Right. Thank you.

184
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:46,522
The leftovers after us will be yours.

185
00:05:47,121 --> 00:05:48,151
Right, then.

186
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:49,152
(The leftover camera)

187
00:05:49,153 --> 00:05:50,721
We'll share the cameras first.

188
00:05:50,722 --> 00:05:52,882
- As long as a camera shoots me.
- Conserve and share.

189
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:54,560
- That's right. - Yes.

190
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,138
It's my first public TV show in a while.

191
00:05:56,162 --> 00:05:58,331
"Public TV show?" Has it been a while?

192
00:05:58,332 --> 00:06:00,500
Right. With the diverse media...

193
00:06:00,501 --> 00:06:02,801
By the way, why do you snort so much?

194
00:06:03,272 --> 00:06:04,631
Don't they both do it?

195
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:07,272
Jae Suk snorts whenever
he laughs, doesn't he?

196
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,212
- Hey, you know... - Doesn't he?

197
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:11,610
What would you like to say?

198
00:06:11,611 --> 00:06:13,341
Jae Suk is...

199
00:06:13,342 --> 00:06:15,740
(Laughing)

200
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:16,981
Oh, thank you.

201
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:18,581
(The variety show dad is playful.)

202
00:06:18,582 --> 00:06:21,282
- Sir. - Nice to see you.

203
00:06:22,551 --> 00:06:24,350
We have great teamwork.

204
00:06:24,351 --> 00:06:25,392
How annoying.

205
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,961
- That's funny.
- As expected from us old schoolers.

206
00:06:28,962 --> 00:06:30,790
- "Old schoolers." - We work well together.

207
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,161
- True. - Right?

208
00:06:32,162 --> 00:06:33,462
We get each other right away.

209
00:06:33,662 --> 00:06:34,662
Exactly.

210
00:06:34,663 --> 00:06:36,583
Why did you wear white
pants on such a cold day?

211
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,901
That doesn't matter these days.

212
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:39,131
- Do you know why? - Why?

213
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:41,540
There are two people I
know who wear white pants.

214
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,241
- Who? - Jae Hyung and Seok Jin.

215
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:45,440
- They're of one mind. - I hate it.

216
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:47,512
I don't know what it is,
but they're of one mind.

217
00:06:47,712 --> 00:06:49,212
The two chase after youth.

218
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,751
And crazily at that.

219
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:55,881
- Are they trying too hard?
- Yes, too hard.

220
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,322
(Playing tag with youth isn't easy.)

221
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,620
- Seok Jin's lifelong wish... - Yes?

222
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:03,490
- is to receive a song from Juck. - I know.

223
00:07:03,491 --> 00:07:05,092
Doesn't Seok Jin write songs himself?

224
00:07:05,162 --> 00:07:07,032
- Why would he write songs? - He doesn't.

225
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,531
Seok Jin has a debut song titled, "I Know."

226
00:07:09,532 --> 00:07:11,600
Since I'm close to Juck, I once told him,

227
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:14,641
"It's Seok Jin's dream
to get a song from you."

228
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:16,171
All he said was, "I see."

229
00:07:16,472 --> 00:07:18,241
I'm avoiding Seok Jin at all costs.

230
00:07:18,642 --> 00:07:20,781
There's another person who
asked me. Kim Kwang Kyu.

231
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:21,842
Kwang Kyu?

232
00:07:22,212 --> 00:07:24,850
Kwang Kyu wants me
to write him a trot song.

233
00:07:24,851 --> 00:07:26,651
It could even be a song I discarded.

234
00:07:26,652 --> 00:07:28,751
Kwang Kyu went that far for a song.

235
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,451
- Anyway... - We've been chatting away.

236
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:31,990
- It's already time. - Goodness.

237
00:07:31,991 --> 00:07:33,261
- We need to leave. - Yes.

238
00:07:33,262 --> 00:07:34,360
- Let's go. - We better go.

239
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:35,721
- Gosh. - Nice.

240
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:37,392
We have a collection now.

241
00:07:37,762 --> 00:07:38,831
Today...

242
00:07:38,832 --> 00:07:40,060
(Laughing)

243
00:07:40,061 --> 00:07:41,131
He's good.

244
00:07:41,132 --> 00:07:42,870
- Was that okay? - Isn't he?

245
00:07:42,871 --> 00:07:44,771
Those big reactions are a must.

246
00:07:44,772 --> 00:07:46,170
- He's a promising kid. - Yes.

247
00:07:46,171 --> 00:07:47,401
Yeon Seok is growing up well.

248
00:07:47,402 --> 00:07:49,642
Why don't you play this
later on like an accordion?

249
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:53,712
- You're really good.
- Isn't it "Purehearted Macho?"

250
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:56,781
"Purehearted Macho."

251
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:58,811
- And he's doing it. - I can hear the song.

252
00:07:59,051 --> 00:08:01,881
He did it because Yeon Seok asked.
If it were us, he would've been mad.

253
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,120
(A special performance for Yeon Seok)

254
00:08:03,121 --> 00:08:04,751
"Fairy Table" is waiting for you.

255
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:06,620
- He's here to cast you. - "Lee Gina."

256
00:08:06,621 --> 00:08:07,990
- Don't answer his calls. - "Lee Gina."

257
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:10,462
(Trying to cast him whenever possible)

258
00:08:10,892 --> 00:08:12,291
- "Lee Gina." - Gina.

259
00:08:12,902 --> 00:08:13,902
"Bonjour."

260
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:15,230
"Bonjour." What does it say?

261
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:18,332
"I'm a new instructor making
a three-hour round trip..."

262
00:08:18,572 --> 00:08:20,142
"to work at Myeong-dong."

263
00:08:20,472 --> 00:08:23,012
"My mind is full of French all day long."

264
00:08:23,142 --> 00:08:25,142
"When I hear French somewhere,"

265
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:28,912
"I stop and can't help but
strike up a conversation."

266
00:08:29,382 --> 00:08:31,412
"I'm full of stores."

267
00:08:31,512 --> 00:08:32,581
No, "Stories."

268
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:36,050
- Is it hard to read? - His age is showing.

269
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:37,521
- He's become farsighted. - My focus...

270
00:08:37,522 --> 00:08:39,791
- Do you have a farsighted issue?
- Read it from afar.

271
00:08:40,162 --> 00:08:41,537
- Put it afar. - I'm not farsighted yet.

272
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,907
- Farsighted... - Stretch your arms out.

273
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:44,231
- I... - And focus.

274
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,732
See these hyenas?

275
00:08:46,232 --> 00:08:47,661
- They are hyenas. - Trust us.

276
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:50,071
- Yeon Seok. These hyenas... - Here.

277
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:53,670
Keep looking, and your
eyes will eventually focus on it.

278
00:08:53,671 --> 00:08:56,070
- You have a farsighted issue.
- I don't even wear glasses.

279
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:57,272
Focus control.

280
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,142
- My focus control was... - Listen.

281
00:08:59,412 --> 00:09:01,642
If this is how your eyes
focused in the past,

282
00:09:01,811 --> 00:09:03,581
it focuses like this now.

283
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,612
Okay.

284
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:09,481
Please make the letters
larger from the next episode.

285
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:11,351
- Yeon Seok is... - They ripped me apart.

286
00:09:11,352 --> 00:09:12,550
Yeon Seok is fun to tease.

287
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:13,761
(Tattered)

288
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,262
Let's listen to the story now.

289
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:18,762
All right. "I'm full of stories."

290
00:09:19,032 --> 00:09:21,532
"Let me tell you what happened in Paris."

291
00:09:21,801 --> 00:09:23,231
I couldn't read...

292
00:09:23,232 --> 00:09:24,907
- that one line properly.
- When's the spare time?

293
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,101
- We should get going. - What time is it?

294
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:29,541
Alliance Francaise is nearby.

295
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:31,771
- Alliance Francaise... - A what?

296
00:09:31,772 --> 00:09:33,012
Is a language school.

297
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,111
- It's near Myeong-dong.
- A language school.

298
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:36,651
You're saying she's an instructor there?

299
00:09:36,652 --> 00:09:38,881
Alliance Francaise. It
said she was an instructor.

300
00:09:38,882 --> 00:09:41,281
Probably because Jae Hyung is with us.

301
00:09:41,282 --> 00:09:42,282
Goodness.

302
00:09:42,283 --> 00:09:43,491
We have to get there by 12:30pm.

303
00:09:43,492 --> 00:09:45,351
- We should start heading there. - Yes.

304
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:46,960
- Before we do, - Yes?

305
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,161
There are coupons.

306
00:09:48,162 --> 00:09:50,162
- Please roll this. - Roll it well.

307
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:53,060
- You can roll it, Fairy Jae Hyung.
- He's doing it.

308
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:54,560
- Over there. - If the number is high...

309
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:56,872
- He's funny.
- The godfather of variety shows.

310
00:09:57,201 --> 00:09:58,201
All right.

311
00:09:59,132 --> 00:10:00,800
(0 coupons?)

312
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,801
Seriously...

313
00:10:04,471 --> 00:10:07,381
Seriously... We've never
gotten a zero until today.

314
00:10:07,382 --> 00:10:08,680
No, not once.

315
00:10:08,681 --> 00:10:10,080
- Let's roll it again. - Jae Hyung.

316
00:10:10,081 --> 00:10:12,111
- There's no second chance.
- No. You can't redo it.

317
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,251
I got a runny nose.

318
00:10:14,252 --> 00:10:16,180
We need to give out lots of gifts today.

319
00:10:16,181 --> 00:10:17,391
- Unbelievable. - What does a zero mean?

320
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:18,852
- Are there no attempts? - No.

321
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,122
- How did you get a zero?
- It's hard to believe.

322
00:10:21,221 --> 00:10:22,291
Let's go.

323
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,961
Do we turn right or left?

324
00:10:24,662 --> 00:10:26,330
Give me a minute. Right now...

325
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:27,502
Let's leave the street first.

326
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:29,602
That's it.

327
00:10:30,502 --> 00:10:32,372
Let's cross to the left.

328
00:10:32,502 --> 00:10:34,142
- Left? - There's a crosswalk over there.

329
00:10:34,372 --> 00:10:35,742
It's Shinsegae.

330
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:36,971
This is...

331
00:10:37,642 --> 00:10:39,680
Cars don't move here...

332
00:10:39,681 --> 00:10:43,012
on Christmas night.

333
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:44,681
At the end of the year,

334
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,122
this place is on fire because of Christmas.

335
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:50,992
Everyone goes wild to watch the screen.

336
00:10:51,191 --> 00:10:53,420
Even during the day, people come...

337
00:10:53,421 --> 00:10:55,021
and take pictures of it.

338
00:10:55,022 --> 00:10:57,690
- Jae Hyung used to live up there... - Yes?

339
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,991
For years.

340
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,460
- I remember now.
- During "Infinite Challenge."

341
00:11:00,461 --> 00:11:02,531
- That was your old home, right?
- Do you mean at Mount Nam?

342
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:03,700
Did you live below Mount Nam?

343
00:11:03,701 --> 00:11:06,271
- It was like a long-term stay.
- About where was it?

344
00:11:06,272 --> 00:11:07,501
- Yes. - At a hotel?

345
00:11:07,502 --> 00:11:08,871
- A residence? - At a residence hotel.

346
00:11:08,872 --> 00:11:10,271
- Really? - I stayed there for a while.

347
00:11:10,272 --> 00:11:12,671
It was when he had no home and whatnot.

348
00:11:13,211 --> 00:11:15,381
Aren't I right, Jae Hyung?

349
00:11:15,382 --> 00:11:17,352
Why is his way of talking so annoying?

350
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,921
Juck has always been like that.

351
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,622
(Laughing)

352
00:11:24,821 --> 00:11:26,662
That chair looks unusual.

353
00:11:26,892 --> 00:11:28,361
Your bottom is going to turn ice cold.

354
00:11:28,362 --> 00:11:30,031
How about we try sitting on it?

355
00:11:30,032 --> 00:11:31,262
It looks well made.

356
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:33,162
- Isn't it nicely made? - Yes.

357
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:34,902
It's cold, right?

358
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:36,361
(Checking the temperature)

359
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,670
- It's... - Isn't your bottom freezing?

360
00:11:37,671 --> 00:11:39,070
No. It's electrically powered...

361
00:11:39,071 --> 00:11:40,101
- to make it warm. - Really?

362
00:11:40,102 --> 00:11:41,277
(It's electrically powered
to make it warm.)

363
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:42,970
- Really? Is it heated up? - Take a seat.

364
00:11:42,971 --> 00:11:44,341
- It's warm. - He's lying.

365
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:46,141
- It's cold. - Come on.

366
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:47,540
(Failing to fool them)

367
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:48,741
To think you'd touch it...

368
00:11:48,742 --> 00:11:50,381
- and not sit down. - Goodness.

369
00:11:50,382 --> 00:11:51,382
Really.

370
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,851
But there are seats
that heat up these days.

371
00:11:52,852 --> 00:11:54,621
- Yes. - Juck doubted.

372
00:11:54,622 --> 00:11:55,782
He did.

373
00:11:55,951 --> 00:11:57,790
- People would normally sit down.
- He's not naive now.

374
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,821
- Gosh. And Yeon Seok too. - Really.

375
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:02,291
- That was such an old prank.
- Those city boys.

376
00:12:02,921 --> 00:12:04,791
You saw those city boys, right?

377
00:12:05,331 --> 00:12:06,632
Should we go back?

378
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:08,431
- It's over. - "Oh, gosh!"

379
00:12:09,132 --> 00:12:10,200
It's over.

380
00:12:10,201 --> 00:12:13,142
In our day, there was a
DJ booth on the street.

381
00:12:13,402 --> 00:12:15,641
- They played music in the booth.
- That's right.

382
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:16,970
- There was a booth on the street? - Yes.

383
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,141
- Like this. - I didn't know about that.

384
00:12:18,142 --> 00:12:19,940
A long time ago, businesses
in commercial buildings...

385
00:12:19,941 --> 00:12:21,940
- used to played carols.
- They play carols back then.

386
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,950
- But now... Right.
- They can't due to copyright.

387
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,412
- And... What is it?
- My gosh, you're right.

388
00:12:26,652 --> 00:12:27,920
- Right. - You rarely hear carols...

389
00:12:27,921 --> 00:12:29,180
on the street these days.

390
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:31,190
- I see. You're right.
- They can't play due to copyright.

391
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,191
Yes.

392
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,491
Back then, people used
to sell bootleg tapes...

393
00:12:33,492 --> 00:12:34,790
- on carts. - Right.

394
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,461
- And they used to play songs too. - Right.

395
00:12:37,632 --> 00:12:40,060
That must be why the mood
feels not as festive as before...

396
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,960
- on the street. - Gosh, you're right.

397
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:43,430
Come to think of it, we're missing carols.

398
00:12:43,431 --> 00:12:46,571
You know what? Christmas...

399
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:49,141
during our parents' generation...

400
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:51,141
- Their generation had curfews. - Right.

401
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,441
The one day the government
lifted the curfew was...

402
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,310
- Christmas Eve. - It was Christmas Eve.

403
00:12:55,311 --> 00:12:57,811
- Hey, bringing up the curfew...
- Was that too long time ago?

404
00:12:57,982 --> 00:12:59,781
I'm sorry. I never had
to go through a curfew.

405
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:02,550
Same here. That's why I said
it was our parents' generation.

406
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:03,621
If you keep this up, you might mention...

407
00:13:03,622 --> 00:13:05,492
- how they had to flee. Goodness. - Hello.

408
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:08,561
We're here.

409
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:10,491
- It's the building on the left.
- Where is it?

410
00:13:10,492 --> 00:13:13,361
- It is Alliance Francaise.
- It's Alliance Francaise.

411
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:14,800
- I see. - Right.

412
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:17,301
So is this like a French cultural center?

413
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:20,001
- Is it a language school?
- It's a language school.

414
00:13:20,002 --> 00:13:21,470
Like Goethe House,

415
00:13:21,471 --> 00:13:22,771
- within the cultural center...
- It's a national establishment.

416
00:13:22,772 --> 00:13:25,741
It's a language school,
recognized by France.

417
00:13:25,742 --> 00:13:27,180
- Right. - You always try to sound smart...

418
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,642
whenever we talk about France.

419
00:13:28,982 --> 00:13:31,911
I'm not trying to sound smart.

420
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,651
- That's just my basic knowledge.
- I see. When it comes to that...

421
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:34,881
- You know? - I bet in his head,

422
00:13:34,882 --> 00:13:36,550
he's worried that they might
make him speak French later.

423
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:38,090
- Gosh, you... - Hey.

424
00:13:38,091 --> 00:13:39,427
I'm warming up my tongue right now.

425
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:42,362
I can hear his brain working, trying
to remember how to speak French.

426
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:44,731
- I didn't know it was here.
- It's on the third floor.

427
00:13:44,732 --> 00:13:46,131
This building is so old.

428
00:13:46,132 --> 00:13:47,330
Gosh. I think...

429
00:13:47,331 --> 00:13:48,901
- I came here once a long time ago.
- You know what?

430
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:51,231
I had no idea that there was
an establishment like this here.

431
00:13:51,232 --> 00:13:52,631
- Seriously. - The language school is here.

432
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,371
- Korean-French Cultural Foundation.
- "Alliance Francaise."

433
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:58,272
"Registration for December."

434
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:00,680
It means registration for December.

435
00:14:00,681 --> 00:14:02,040
- It says so right here.
- It says so over there.

436
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,551
- Right here. - It says so in Korean here.

437
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,351
I just read it for you.

438
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,720
- What's this? - "December."

439
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,521
- "December." - December.

440
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:11,892
- So that's how you pronounce it.
- I see "Noel."

441
00:14:12,022 --> 00:14:13,460
- So that means December. - You.

442
00:14:13,461 --> 00:14:15,460
- Noel. Isn't that French? - I know Noel.

443
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:16,690
"Merry Christmas."

444
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,161
- What was that? - Noel

445
00:14:19,162 --> 00:14:20,761
- Noel - Yes.

446
00:14:20,762 --> 00:14:23,131
(Once again, the street
is filled with a carol.)

447
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:25,132
But we're slaves of variety shows.

448
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:26,871
Let's go in.

449
00:14:26,872 --> 00:14:27,901
- We're slaves of variety shows.
- We go in right away?

450
00:14:27,902 --> 00:14:29,542
- Let's go in. To the third floor. - Hey.

451
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,040
- Slaves - We're slaves.

452
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,382
- Hello. - Hello.

453
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,541
- Hello. - Hello.

454
00:14:35,542 --> 00:14:37,882
I didn't know there was a
French language school here.

455
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,787
- Let's go up the stairs.
- That's a consultation room.

456
00:14:39,811 --> 00:14:41,220
Wait. This must be it.

457
00:14:41,221 --> 00:14:42,851
- I see. Here. - Is it Room 301?

458
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:44,290
- You guys go in. - No.

459
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,651
- You go in first. - No.

460
00:14:45,652 --> 00:14:47,761
- You have the letter, don't you?
- It doesn't matter.

461
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:48,762
(The France expert
hesitates now that he's here.)

462
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,563
Are you worried that
something might pop out?

463
00:14:50,992 --> 00:14:52,032
Here?

464
00:14:53,602 --> 00:14:54,602
Yes.

465
00:14:55,002 --> 00:14:56,901
- Her voice... - She sounds cheerful.

466
00:14:56,902 --> 00:14:58,478
(The Whenever Guest has a cheerful voice.)

467
00:14:58,502 --> 00:15:00,800
- Hello. - Hello.

468
00:15:00,801 --> 00:15:02,601
- Are you Gina? - Hello.

469
00:15:02,602 --> 00:15:04,670
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

470
00:15:04,671 --> 00:15:05,871
(Gina welcomes them with open arms.)

471
00:15:05,872 --> 00:15:08,481
- Hello. - Wait, you speak French.

472
00:15:08,482 --> 00:15:10,210
- He does. - Hello.

473
00:15:10,211 --> 00:15:13,251
(Lee Gina, the first Whenever Guest)

474
00:15:13,252 --> 00:15:14,920
- Jae Hyung. - I feel so awkward here.

475
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:17,021
- Why all of a sudden?
- He was fine before.

476
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:19,450
We all spoke in Korean just
now. This is so embarrassing.

477
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:20,690
Why won't you speak French?

478
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:22,537
- You're not on a blind date here.
- Come on. Speak French.

479
00:15:22,561 --> 00:15:24,090
This isn't a blind date.
What are you doing?

480
00:15:24,091 --> 00:15:25,590
- We were speaking in Korean. - Hold on.

481
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:26,631
You spoke French outside.

482
00:15:26,632 --> 00:15:28,338
- Why are you suddenly...
- What is he doing?

483
00:15:28,362 --> 00:15:31,001
- Jae Hyung. - I mean... Yes. Hello.

484
00:15:31,002 --> 00:15:32,171
How are you?

485
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,970
What was that? What's wrong with him?

486
00:15:34,971 --> 00:15:36,241
What's wrong with you?

487
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:38,147
- His fake French might be exposed.
- You won't do it?

488
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,340
- What is it? - My gosh.

489
00:15:39,341 --> 00:15:40,681
- I'm fine. - You're fine.

490
00:15:40,742 --> 00:15:43,651
I feel a bit awkward speaking
in French with Korean people.

491
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:44,882
- Really? - Yes.

492
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:48,121
So this is a French
language school, correct?

493
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:50,190
Yes, it's a French language school.

494
00:15:50,191 --> 00:15:53,661
- Yes. That's right.
- Are you usually this hyper?

495
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,021
I'm crazy hyper.

496
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,391
- Really? - I'm crazy hyper.

497
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:58,361
Then introverted students
like me might have a hard time.

498
00:15:58,362 --> 00:16:01,200
Yes, some people had a hard time
with that, so they stopped coming.

499
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,902
- But I can't satisfy everyone. - Really?

500
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,731
- That's true. - Isn't it true?

501
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,070
- That's true. - This might not be easy...

502
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:08,401
- for kids. - Right.

503
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,970
Are you an extrovert then?

504
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:12,372
I am the biggest extrovert.
That's why my name is Lee Gina.

505
00:16:13,782 --> 00:16:16,080
- She keeps looking at the camera.
- I won't look at it.

506
00:16:16,081 --> 00:16:17,781
- It's not "Show Me the Money."
- I won't look at the camera.

507
00:16:17,782 --> 00:16:18,782
- Gina. - Yes?

508
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:20,751
Gosh, this is so embarrassing.

509
00:16:20,752 --> 00:16:21,752
You're more interested...

510
00:16:21,753 --> 00:16:23,667
- in being on TV than meeting us.
- That's right.

511
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,291
(Mustering up his courage and clapping)

512
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:27,122
Sit here, Jae Hyung.

513
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:28,862
Sit here, Jae Hyung.

514
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,930
You know, I used to sit
like this when I went...

515
00:16:30,931 --> 00:16:32,231
- to a language school too. - Really?

516
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:33,601
- In Paris? - We were like kindergarteners.

517
00:16:33,602 --> 00:16:34,731
(Remembering the old days)

518
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:37,831
That's what I did in Paris. I
didn't learn French before I went.

519
00:16:38,201 --> 00:16:41,201
We used to sit at a round table like this.

520
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,970
Where did you learn French?

521
00:16:42,971 --> 00:16:44,540
I studied at the Institut Catholique.

522
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:45,771
Oh, Catholique.

523
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,381
- Gosh. Of course.
- Do you know the school?

524
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:49,111
- How do you know that?
- Isn't that in Paris?

525
00:16:49,112 --> 00:16:50,252
Yes, right.

526
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:52,050
So you didn't study in
France? Did you study in Korea?

527
00:16:52,051 --> 00:16:55,281
I went to Paris for a year to study French.

528
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,820
I was thinking about studying
there and other options.

529
00:16:57,821 --> 00:17:00,020
- Did you study at Sorbonne?
- Sourbonne... No. I mean...

530
00:17:00,021 --> 00:17:01,937
- I studied at a private school.
- Did you say sour buns?

531
00:17:01,961 --> 00:17:03,190
I studied at a private language school.

532
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,671
- From what I heard, both of you...
- I see. A private school.

533
00:17:05,892 --> 00:17:07,972
Didn't take the traditional
path of studying French.

534
00:17:08,431 --> 00:17:09,501
Me too?

535
00:17:09,832 --> 00:17:10,901
- But...
- I don't know much about it, but...

536
00:17:10,902 --> 00:17:13,200
- I guess I didn't. - You didn't, right?

537
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:16,142
I wasn't a serious student, I guess.
I had fun while studying French.

538
00:17:16,342 --> 00:17:18,511
But from what I heard,

539
00:17:18,572 --> 00:17:20,811
you weren't good at French
before you went abroad.

540
00:17:20,812 --> 00:17:22,611
But after studying abroad for a year...

541
00:17:22,612 --> 00:17:24,750
You're teaching at this
language school now.

542
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:25,751
That's right.

543
00:17:25,752 --> 00:17:26,920
Your French improved significantly...

544
00:17:26,921 --> 00:17:28,051
- Right. - in a year?

545
00:17:28,052 --> 00:17:31,051
I had this fantasy about French.

546
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,960
I wanted to learn it, so I boldly
picked French as my major.

547
00:17:33,961 --> 00:17:35,720
But these kids from foreign
language high schools...

548
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,760
already learned everything and were fluent.

549
00:17:36,761 --> 00:17:37,990
And I hated going to class.

550
00:17:37,991 --> 00:17:40,230
- So... Seriously. - You're hot-tempered.

551
00:17:40,231 --> 00:17:42,631
Seriously. Just thinking about
my school days makes me shake.

552
00:17:42,632 --> 00:17:44,470
- "From foreign language schools."
- "From foreign language schools."

553
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,831
- They're really good. - I mean...

554
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,571
- Seriously. - So did you major in French?

555
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,902
I did graduate with a French degree.

556
00:17:49,971 --> 00:17:51,440
- They were already so fluent.
- They were so fluent.

557
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:53,210
- I wasn't so motivated. - I bet.

558
00:17:53,211 --> 00:17:55,581
- So I gave up on learning French. - Yes.

559
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,311
I focused more on
extracurricular activities,

560
00:17:57,312 --> 00:17:59,081
like school clubs, such
as the broadcasting club.

561
00:17:59,082 --> 00:18:00,750
You wanted to focus more
on other areas than your major.

562
00:18:00,751 --> 00:18:01,980
- That's right. - I see.

563
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:04,351
Then I realized that I
was on the wrong path.

564
00:18:04,352 --> 00:18:05,920
- It was too difficult.
- Once you tried it.

565
00:18:05,921 --> 00:18:08,122
Right. That's why...

566
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,721
You're the best conversationalist
with non-celebrities.

567
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:12,491
I can talk to anyone.

568
00:18:12,562 --> 00:18:14,562
- I love it. - These guys are struggling.

569
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,631
- But I can handle anyone.
- You're so responsive.

570
00:18:16,632 --> 00:18:18,078
- Don't worry. - He can do it right away.

571
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:20,471
- I can organize it right away. - Right.

572
00:18:20,941 --> 00:18:22,872
- So... - My heart is pounding right now.

573
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:25,048
- This conversation...
- Jae Hyung, could you move out?

574
00:18:25,072 --> 00:18:26,240
So they get a better shot of her.

575
00:18:26,241 --> 00:18:28,281
- Please continue. - I will.

576
00:18:29,281 --> 00:18:32,710
I was majoring in French,
but I wasn't fluent...

577
00:18:32,711 --> 00:18:34,352
- when my third year began. - Yes.

578
00:18:34,622 --> 00:18:36,480
- I bet that was a big problem.
- I thought this wasn't right.

579
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:38,091
So after my 1st semester in my 3rd year,

580
00:18:38,092 --> 00:18:39,490
I took a year off from school.

581
00:18:39,491 --> 00:18:40,861
Then I went abroad to study.

582
00:18:40,862 --> 00:18:42,862
- To Paris. - I went to Paris.

583
00:18:43,092 --> 00:18:44,632
And when I got there,

584
00:18:44,892 --> 00:18:46,901
French was so fun.

585
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:48,801
- When you got to Paris?
- When I got there,

586
00:18:48,802 --> 00:18:50,500
- I started to study diligently. - I see.

587
00:18:50,501 --> 00:18:52,730
My proficiency improved endlessly.

588
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:54,872
People say the quickest
way to learn a language is...

589
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:58,471
to date someone who is a
native speaker of that language.

590
00:18:58,842 --> 00:19:00,641
- I see. - People often say that.

591
00:19:00,642 --> 00:19:02,241
- Right on. - Many people...

592
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:05,112
- Was that the case for you?
- Was that the trick?

593
00:19:05,552 --> 00:19:07,021
It's a sensitive topic.

594
00:19:07,152 --> 00:19:08,851
Why do you snort so much?

595
00:19:08,852 --> 00:19:10,151
- I... - My gosh.

596
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:11,450
- Hold on. - It's not that.

597
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:13,921
Our dress code today was...

598
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,661
- red. Why... - Right here.

599
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:17,531
- Put it around your neck. - Right here.

600
00:19:17,691 --> 00:19:18,930
This is red.

601
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:20,200
- Take a close-up shot of this.
- It won't be in the shot.

602
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,031
Use that to blow your nose.

603
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,231
You're snorting too much.

604
00:19:24,771 --> 00:19:26,171
- That's good. - It's runny.

605
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:27,571
- Go on. - Go on.

606
00:19:27,572 --> 00:19:29,101
When I came back after a year,

607
00:19:29,102 --> 00:19:30,641
I was starting my 2nd
semester in my 3rd year.

608
00:19:30,642 --> 00:19:33,510
It was really fun to tutor French.

609
00:19:33,511 --> 00:19:34,680
Teaching people was fun.

610
00:19:34,681 --> 00:19:36,510
It was especially fun to
teach a language I loved.

611
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:38,851
- And I got to make money too. - Right.

612
00:19:38,852 --> 00:19:40,321
I bet when she teaches,

613
00:19:40,322 --> 00:19:41,851
- she makes a lot of gestures. - Right.

614
00:19:41,852 --> 00:19:43,720
- Since she's cheerful, - Yes.

615
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:44,750
It's impossible to doze off...

616
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:46,697
- or fall asleep. Right.
- There won't be a dull moment.

617
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:49,561
When people get sleepy,
I bring up the energy level.

618
00:19:49,562 --> 00:19:50,990
- Seriously. - Is there a trick for that?

619
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:52,831
- I... - Let's say someone is dozing off.

620
00:19:52,832 --> 00:19:54,131
- When it gets too quiet... - Right here.

621
00:19:54,132 --> 00:19:55,700
(This student is dozing off.)

622
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:58,030
He started to doze off.
He's acting right away.

623
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:01,700
Are you okay?

624
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,872
- Isn't that the title of a song?
- Jae Hyung, are you okay?

625
00:20:04,941 --> 00:20:06,441
Are you tired?

626
00:20:06,542 --> 00:20:07,710
- Are you tired? - Gina.

627
00:20:07,711 --> 00:20:08,912
What did you say?

628
00:20:08,941 --> 00:20:10,951
- You said you had a trick. - What is it?

629
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:12,980
I mean, this is what everyone does.

630
00:20:12,981 --> 00:20:14,582
- "Hey!" - But...

631
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:17,121
- "Are you okay?" - "How..."

632
00:20:17,122 --> 00:20:18,392
"Are you tired?"

633
00:20:19,152 --> 00:20:21,020
- Right. - I see.

634
00:20:21,021 --> 00:20:22,720
- You know, you're so right. - Yes.

635
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,161
Most of my students
come to class after work.

636
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:26,162
- Right. - They must be tired.

637
00:20:26,163 --> 00:20:27,331
- They come after work. - Yes.

638
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:28,700
- Or they come early in the morning.
- They're tired.

639
00:20:28,701 --> 00:20:29,930
- You know? - Early in the morning?

640
00:20:29,931 --> 00:20:31,371
- Imagine how tired they must be.
- Of course.

641
00:20:31,372 --> 00:20:34,670
They must be tired, but
their passion is admirable.

642
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:36,041
- It's so admirable. - Right.

643
00:20:36,042 --> 00:20:38,811
That's why I want to give
them a lot of enthusiasm...

644
00:20:38,812 --> 00:20:42,280
to match their dedication
while teaching my classes.

645
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:44,780
I try my best so there isn't a
boring moment in my class.

646
00:20:44,781 --> 00:20:47,351
- That's my goal.
- You know what? Can't you feel...

647
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:48,581
- Right. - her passion and enthusiasm?

648
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:49,582
- Totally. - Yes.

649
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,321
We sometimes think
about what it would be like...

650
00:20:51,322 --> 00:20:53,490
to live abroad and chase our dreams.

651
00:20:53,491 --> 00:20:55,861
But it's difficult to muster
up our courage for that.

652
00:20:55,862 --> 00:20:58,530
Among my friends, the person
who mustered up their courage...

653
00:20:58,531 --> 00:20:59,562
was Jae Hyung.

654
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:01,311
How long did you stay there?

655
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:03,200
I stayed there for 7 to 8 years.

656
00:21:03,201 --> 00:21:05,701
But weren't you 30 years
old when you went to Paris?

657
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,142
- I was 30. - Yes.

658
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:10,510
- Did you plan to stay that long? - No.

659
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:13,240
I wanted to study film
music for two years initially.

660
00:21:13,241 --> 00:21:14,381
- So... - That's why you went.

661
00:21:14,382 --> 00:21:16,611
I could join the music
class since I passed.

662
00:21:16,612 --> 00:21:17,612
They could speak English,

663
00:21:17,613 --> 00:21:18,780
so they said they would teach in English.

664
00:21:18,781 --> 00:21:20,280
But it was a lie.

665
00:21:20,281 --> 00:21:22,622
They had to teach in French.

666
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,351
So I went to a language school separately.

667
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,551
Then I attended a music
school on top of that.

668
00:21:25,552 --> 00:21:26,591
As Juck said,

669
00:21:26,592 --> 00:21:28,220
- what he did was amazing. - It was.

670
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,661
I liked studying.

671
00:21:29,662 --> 00:21:31,791
I made money from writing film scores.

672
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,677
I used what I earned to
pay for the next semester.

673
00:21:33,701 --> 00:21:36,101
Back then, writing film scores...

674
00:21:36,102 --> 00:21:38,701
was a way for me to pay for my studies.

675
00:21:38,802 --> 00:21:40,670
But I feel a bit of pressure...

676
00:21:40,671 --> 00:21:43,000
because all the attention is on me now.

677
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,311
(A shy Parisian)

678
00:21:44,312 --> 00:21:46,541
But staying there for a year
must have been hard. How was it?

679
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:49,180
I stayed in District 13 in Paris.

680
00:21:49,181 --> 00:21:50,450
- There were... - I love that district.

681
00:21:50,451 --> 00:21:52,812
Place d'Italie.

682
00:21:54,552 --> 00:21:56,420
(Utterly annoyed)

683
00:21:56,421 --> 00:21:58,421
I love it. That's a
great facial expression.

684
00:21:58,592 --> 00:22:00,167
- Why... - That's how exactly I feel now.

685
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:01,861
- Jae Suk. - It's like he read my mind.

686
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:03,930
Soupe Tonkinoise is famous
there. I used to go there all the time.

687
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,231
- Soupe Tonkinoise? - Why...

688
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,638
won't you listen to her response
after asking her a question?

689
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:09,500
Why do you always talk
without listening to other people?

690
00:22:09,501 --> 00:22:12,270
Otherwise, you guys will
attack me like a swarm of bees.

691
00:22:12,271 --> 00:22:13,530
I was trying to tell my story and pull out.

692
00:22:13,531 --> 00:22:14,541
- Is that so? - Yes.

693
00:22:14,542 --> 00:22:16,071
- Tell us about the district.
- For District 13,

694
00:22:16,072 --> 00:22:19,240
there were realtors who spoke English.

695
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,911
So I got really lucky...

696
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:22,780
and got a great place. Seriously.

697
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:25,051
When I was in high school,
French was my second language.

698
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,210
- Really? - Yes.

699
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:27,821
- A long time ago, French was...
- Why don't you guys talk in French?

700
00:22:27,822 --> 00:22:28,822
A popular second language in school.

701
00:22:28,823 --> 00:22:30,743
- Yes, it was.
- It was either German or French.

702
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:33,551
I still remember this French
phrase. "Stir-fried anchovies."

703
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,092
"Stir-fried anchovies."

704
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:36,690
"Thank you."

705
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:38,967
- Your pronunciation is good.
- I have to scratch my throat.

706
00:22:38,991 --> 00:22:40,902
- Right. - "Thank you." "Hello."

707
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:45,331
- My gosh. - Like this. No?

708
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:47,501
- What's that look in your eyes?
- You said it right.

709
00:22:48,001 --> 00:22:50,611
- What? She said it was good.
- Why don't you...

710
00:22:50,612 --> 00:22:52,311
- He's good. - Could you demonstrate?

711
00:22:52,312 --> 00:22:54,582
Instead of saying it like, "Bonjour."

712
00:22:54,781 --> 00:22:57,981
- "Bonjour." - "Bonjour."

713
00:22:58,251 --> 00:23:00,582
- "Bonjour." - "Bonjour."

714
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:02,280
(Trying to add his two cents)

715
00:23:02,281 --> 00:23:04,250
Jae Hyung, we're learning from her.

716
00:23:04,251 --> 00:23:06,020
You need to stay out of this. Come on.

717
00:23:06,021 --> 00:23:08,362
- It's okay.
- You can just say, "Bong Won."

718
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:10,862
- Bong Won, stay out of this. - Bong Won.

719
00:23:13,031 --> 00:23:14,730
But people say it quickly.

720
00:23:14,731 --> 00:23:16,200
- Right. That's why...
- They say it really fast.

721
00:23:16,201 --> 00:23:17,801
- That's right. - Can he make that face?

722
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:18,971
Bonjour.

723
00:23:19,402 --> 00:23:21,841
- Why are you doing that?
- That's making me feel unpleasant.

724
00:23:21,842 --> 00:23:23,201
This is so unpleasant.

725
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,072
- No? - That was too much.

726
00:23:25,342 --> 00:23:26,710
- Was it too unctuous?
- You don't sound happy to see us.

727
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,211
- Bonjour. - That's just scary.

728
00:23:28,812 --> 00:23:29,882
Is that so?

729
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:32,450
You wrote in your letter that...

730
00:23:32,451 --> 00:23:34,551
it took three hours to come to work.

731
00:23:34,552 --> 00:23:35,821
- It takes three hours to commute?
- My gosh.

732
00:23:35,822 --> 00:23:37,520
- The round trip takes three hours.
- Where do you live?

733
00:23:37,521 --> 00:23:38,551
I live in Ilsan.

734
00:23:38,552 --> 00:23:40,561
- I see. Then it's far. - Yes.

735
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,321
- You have to make a transfer.
- You have to make a transfer?

736
00:23:42,322 --> 00:23:44,460
- Right. - The traffic is congested here.

737
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:46,062
- Right. - Yes.

738
00:23:46,332 --> 00:23:48,960
So she became a French teacher
after studying in Paris for a year.

739
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,301
The fact that she's working here...

740
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:51,878
- in Alliance Francaise is amazing.
- Right.

741
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:53,030
Not anyone can do this.

742
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:55,078
It's impressive that she
got this job at a young age.

743
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,942
- This...
- We were talking about her commute.

744
00:23:57,872 --> 00:23:59,741
- Right. - I'm sorry to say it.

745
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:01,241
But we were...

746
00:24:01,781 --> 00:24:04,010
Bong Won. We were
talking about her commute.

747
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:05,382
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

748
00:24:05,681 --> 00:24:07,220
- I was... - Our directions were different.

749
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,551
- Yes. - But I wanted to let you know...

750
00:24:09,552 --> 00:24:11,391
- how impressive she was.
- She is impressive.

751
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:12,621
I can sense her passion...

752
00:24:12,622 --> 00:24:14,062
- and enthusiasm. - Right.

753
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:15,621
- If I had to start early... - Right.

754
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,061
And work until late at night like her,

755
00:24:17,062 --> 00:24:18,131
by the time I got home,
my energy would've been...

756
00:24:18,132 --> 00:24:19,161
- completely drained. - Right.

757
00:24:19,162 --> 00:24:22,231
I would pass out like a
toy that ran out of battery.

758
00:24:22,302 --> 00:24:24,700
- My class lasts for three hours. - Yes.

759
00:24:24,701 --> 00:24:27,131
- It's like I'm putting on a show. - Right.

760
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,871
I have to walk around and
keep checking their work.

761
00:24:28,872 --> 00:24:30,871
I have to keep talking to them.

762
00:24:30,872 --> 00:24:32,541
So I use up a lot of my energy.

763
00:24:32,542 --> 00:24:33,980
- I bet you use it up.
- By the time I'm done,

764
00:24:33,981 --> 00:24:35,981
- I'm so exhausted. - Right.

765
00:24:36,281 --> 00:24:37,311
So what do you do...

766
00:24:37,312 --> 00:24:38,687
- in between classes? - In your spare time.

767
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:42,020
Our school is located near
Hoehyeon and Myeong-dong.

768
00:24:42,021 --> 00:24:43,891
There's Gyeongbokgung
Palace. It's so close.

769
00:24:43,892 --> 00:24:45,122
- Do you go there? - I do.

770
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:47,791
- So... - The palace is pretty far, though.

771
00:24:47,792 --> 00:24:48,861
- So... - I mean...

772
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,760
- She's an extrovert. - Right.

773
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:53,661
During her breaks, she
doesn't sleep or rest here.

774
00:24:53,662 --> 00:24:55,000
- She goes out right away. - Right.

775
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:57,631
To add to what she said,
they're all on Line Three.

776
00:24:57,632 --> 00:24:58,930
So it's the same subway line.

777
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:01,051
- So she can totally go there.
- Line Four runs here.

778
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:03,872
We already finished
talking about her commute.

779
00:25:04,372 --> 00:25:05,542
We're done with that.

780
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,671
- Is that so? - I mean...

781
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:08,280
- We're talking about... - I'm sorry.

782
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:09,311
- what she does in between classes. - Yes.

783
00:25:09,312 --> 00:25:12,552
I was trying to make him look bad.

784
00:25:12,612 --> 00:25:13,680
Jae Hyung had a direction in mind...

785
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:14,821
- with this conversation. - Yes.

786
00:25:14,822 --> 00:25:16,750
- Yes, I had. Did you know? Thanks. - Yes.

787
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:18,831
He became like this after
running "Fairy Jae Hyung."

788
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:20,520
- He changed. - He wasn't like this before.

789
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:21,561
He wasn't like this.

790
00:25:21,562 --> 00:25:23,561
Anyway, Gina decided...

791
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:25,460
- to spend her spare time... - Right.

792
00:25:25,461 --> 00:25:26,990
With us for our show.

793
00:25:26,991 --> 00:25:29,661
This episode will air on Christmas Eve.

794
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,000
We want to succeed in the missions...

795
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,831
- and give good presents... - Yes.

796
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:35,712
- To today's Whenever Guests.
- The presents...

797
00:25:35,771 --> 00:25:37,211
- Let's start with Round One. - Yes.

798
00:25:37,612 --> 00:25:38,812
Let's take a look.

799
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,341
"I became a fan of wine in France."

800
00:25:42,342 --> 00:25:43,581
"The dream champagne,"

801
00:25:43,582 --> 00:25:45,852
"Dom Perignon Vintage 2013."

802
00:25:46,981 --> 00:25:48,881
- Dom Perignon?
- Isn't that a high-end brand?

803
00:25:48,882 --> 00:25:50,220
- Dom Perignon? - Dom Perignon?

804
00:25:50,221 --> 00:25:52,250
- My gosh! No way! - Dom Perignon?

805
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:55,021
- Do you like champagne? - I love it!

806
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:57,020
(No one could be more satisfied than her.)

807
00:25:57,021 --> 00:25:58,530
- Her pitch went up so high. - My gosh.

808
00:25:58,531 --> 00:26:01,802
(The Dom Perignon champagne
is at stake. What is the mission?)

809
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:04,470
- I see. It's a quiz. - Shall we sit down?

810
00:26:04,471 --> 00:26:05,471
Okay.

811
00:26:05,701 --> 00:26:07,501
- You can sit there. - There.

812
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,811
- Do we have to guess in a relay?
- Quizzes like this are hard.

813
00:26:10,812 --> 00:26:12,841
- Giving answers consecutively...
- My gosh, this...

814
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:14,581
- Hold on. Let's arrange our seats.
- Then...

815
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:15,980
- Let's arrange our seats. - What?

816
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:16,981
Let's do that after we hear...

817
00:26:16,982 --> 00:26:18,858
- what the mission is.
- We must hear them out first.

818
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:20,381
- I'll explain the mission. - Okay.

819
00:26:20,382 --> 00:26:21,451
Hold on!

820
00:26:22,552 --> 00:26:23,920
Can we switch our seats?

821
00:26:23,921 --> 00:26:25,891
- No. We can do that later.
- Let's find out what this is first.

822
00:26:25,892 --> 00:26:27,612
Let's do that after we find out what it is.

823
00:26:27,761 --> 00:26:29,460
- Hold on. I'm so nervous.
- You're nervous, right?

824
00:26:29,461 --> 00:26:31,631
- My gosh, Jae Hyung.
- Do you have any relaxation pills?

825
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:32,632
- Okay. - What is it?

826
00:26:32,633 --> 00:26:35,331
(Global Quiz)

827
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:37,430
(Look at the pictures of landmarks.)

828
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:40,102
(Then guess the name of
the landmark and its country.)

829
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:41,641
(Round 1)

830
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,372
(The 4 of them must
get it right consecutively.)

831
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:46,371
(Guess the name of the
landmark and its country.)

832
00:26:46,372 --> 00:26:48,241
No. We can't do it.

833
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,581
- We must guess the country too? - My gosh.

834
00:26:50,582 --> 00:26:53,081
- Like the Eiffel Tower of France? - Yes.

835
00:26:53,082 --> 00:26:55,450
The four of us must get it right...

836
00:26:55,451 --> 00:26:56,757
- to pass Round One? - What's this?

837
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,651
- Should we go for it right away?
- How about a practice round?

838
00:26:58,652 --> 00:27:00,421
- Yes, let's practice. - Let's practice.

839
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:02,861
It's a practice round. We'll
present a picture. In 1, 2, 3...

840
00:27:02,862 --> 00:27:04,730
N Seoul Tower of Seoul. Seoul, Korea.

841
00:27:04,731 --> 00:27:05,891
- You must say Korea.
- I see. The name of the country.

842
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:08,430
- No. N Seoul Tower of Korea. - No.

843
00:27:08,431 --> 00:27:09,561
- Like that. - Yes.

844
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:10,770
- N Seoul Tower of Korea. - Okay.

845
00:27:10,771 --> 00:27:13,700
Actually, Jae Hyung is the
weakest at games like this.

846
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:15,141
- This is hard. - You know...

847
00:27:15,142 --> 00:27:16,341
- Do you get nervous? - Yes.

848
00:27:16,342 --> 00:27:17,940
It's hard to remember them on the spot.

849
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:19,440
- Right. It's hard.
- It's so hard to remember them.

850
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:20,470
Even the ones you know.

851
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,551
- Quizzes like this make me nervous.
- This is hard.

852
00:27:23,011 --> 00:27:24,111
- Yeon Seok is weak... - No.

853
00:27:24,112 --> 00:27:26,052
- at these games - So
we can do this ten times?

854
00:27:27,082 --> 00:27:29,551
(He's the weakest at thinking on his feet.)

855
00:27:29,552 --> 00:27:33,951
(And he gets nervous a lot.)

856
00:27:34,961 --> 00:27:37,431
(He started to get nervous already.)

857
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,892
- He got the xylophone out. - All right.

858
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:42,230
All right. Do you want
to try it right away?

859
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:44,270
- Please. You can do this.
- We just have to get it right once.

860
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:45,700
- Let's do a team cheer.
- And the seat arrangements?

861
00:27:45,701 --> 00:27:47,500
- In 1, 2, 3. - This is good, right?

862
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:48,501
- Let's go. - Let's go.

863
00:27:48,502 --> 00:27:49,571
This is Round One.

864
00:27:49,572 --> 00:27:51,092
- Goodness. - Yeon Seok will go first.

865
00:27:51,171 --> 00:27:52,210
I'll start from Yeon Seok.

866
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:53,241
- Yes. - Yes.

867
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:57,552
Here is the picture. Go.

868
00:27:58,181 --> 00:27:59,480
- In 1, 2... - All right.

869
00:27:59,481 --> 00:28:00,950
The Sphinx of Egypt.

870
00:28:00,951 --> 00:28:01,981
- Correct. - That's it.

871
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,920
- Two... - The Sphinx of Egypt.

872
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:05,421
(Yeon Seok passes.)

873
00:28:06,552 --> 00:28:07,622
Next.

874
00:28:08,261 --> 00:28:10,321
- In 1, 2, 3. - You must hurry.

875
00:28:10,322 --> 00:28:11,661
Eiffel Tower of France.

876
00:28:11,662 --> 00:28:13,061
- You must hurry. - You have to hurry.

877
00:28:13,062 --> 00:28:14,501
- Great. - I was so nervous.

878
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:17,260
- Here is the picture.
- My gosh. I was so nervous.

879
00:28:17,261 --> 00:28:19,500
(Name of the landmark, Country)

880
00:28:19,501 --> 00:28:21,000
- One... - Angkor Wat of Cambodia.

881
00:28:21,001 --> 00:28:22,470
- Correct. - That was a hard one.

882
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:25,670
- I did it. - You're the last one.

883
00:28:25,671 --> 00:28:28,112
- That was a hard one.
- You're the last one.

884
00:28:28,241 --> 00:28:30,911
(3 out of 4 guessed correctly.)

885
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:32,382
- I did it. - That was a hard one.

886
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,551
- Here is the picture. Go.
- They don't look happy now.

887
00:28:34,552 --> 00:28:36,351
(Name of the landmark, Country)

888
00:28:36,352 --> 00:28:37,592
- One... - Where is this place?

889
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,061
(Name of the landmark, Country)

890
00:28:42,062 --> 00:28:43,302
- One... - Where is this place?

891
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:46,490
- Two... - Switzerland? The Vatican?

892
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,561
Wrong.

893
00:28:47,562 --> 00:28:49,601
- Where is this place?
- Isn't it the Vatican?

894
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,170
- Isn't it the Vatican?
- Is it the Vatican?

895
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,670
- Is this... - It's in Italy.

896
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:54,301
- Duomo. - Duomo. The cathedral?

897
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:55,401
- Gosh. - That was a tough one.

898
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:57,372
(Name of the landmark:
Duomo, Country: Italy)

899
00:28:58,042 --> 00:28:59,871
- Hey, I've been there! - Listen.

900
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,081
- But... - That was too hard.

901
00:29:01,082 --> 00:29:02,082
How could we get it right...

902
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,111
- with the aerial picture? - You know what?

903
00:29:03,112 --> 00:29:05,051
- That was hard. - Gina.

904
00:29:05,052 --> 00:29:06,411
- Italy. - Where in Italy?

905
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:07,480
- Florence. - Florence.

906
00:29:07,481 --> 00:29:08,551
I've never been there.

907
00:29:08,552 --> 00:29:10,520
I've been to Florence. But still.

908
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:12,821
- I didn't know about Duomo.
- Nice try, though.

909
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:15,161
- Angkor Wat was hard too.
- It was difficult.

910
00:29:15,162 --> 00:29:16,991
- It was hard. - But I guessed it right.

911
00:29:17,731 --> 00:29:18,960
Where is Angkor Wat?

912
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:20,131
- Cambodia. - Cambodia. Okay.

913
00:29:20,132 --> 00:29:21,461
He got it right earlier.

914
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,030
- Did you not hear that? - Pay attention.

915
00:29:23,031 --> 00:29:24,470
- I... - Pay attention to other people.

916
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:26,430
I'm trying to learn something new.

917
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,500
I could tell it was in Italy...

918
00:29:27,501 --> 00:29:28,770
- or another European country. - Right.

919
00:29:28,771 --> 00:29:30,000
- I didn't know about Duomo. - My gosh.

920
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,041
Nice try, though.

921
00:29:31,042 --> 00:29:32,571
- This is our 2nd try. - Our 2nd try.

922
00:29:32,572 --> 00:29:34,241
- Let's go! - Let's go!

923
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,542
- Here we go. - Let's go!
Here is the picture.

924
00:29:41,021 --> 00:29:42,021
Go.

925
00:29:42,582 --> 00:29:45,392
- In 1, 2, 3.
- The Louvre Museum of France.

926
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:47,661
- Great. - My gosh!

927
00:29:47,662 --> 00:29:49,361
- Well done. - Great.

928
00:29:49,362 --> 00:29:51,538
- Jae Hyung should've gotten that.
- Here is the picture. Go.

929
00:29:51,562 --> 00:29:52,990
(It's the Parisian's turn.)

930
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:53,991
Here is the picture. Go.

931
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:55,231
In 1, 2...

932
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:58,371
(You recognize the landmark, right?)

933
00:29:58,372 --> 00:30:00,670
In 1, 2...

934
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,401
- Empire State Building of the USA.
- Three.

935
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,071
- Yes. - That's right.

936
00:30:04,072 --> 00:30:05,270
- That was amazing. - Great.

937
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,741
- Great. - That was great.

938
00:30:07,271 --> 00:30:08,811
(The nervous brothers pass.)

939
00:30:08,812 --> 00:30:10,141
- Great. - That was great.

940
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:11,502
- Juck. - Here is the picture. Go.

941
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:15,051
In 1, 2...

942
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:17,920
(Name of the landmark, Country)

943
00:30:17,921 --> 00:30:20,552
- In 1, 2, 3. - Machu Picchu of Peru.

944
00:30:20,961 --> 00:30:22,561
(He gets it right.)

945
00:30:22,562 --> 00:30:25,031
(Name of the landmark:
Machu Picchu, Country: Peru)

946
00:30:25,562 --> 00:30:27,661
- My gosh. That was hard. - Yes!

947
00:30:27,662 --> 00:30:28,960
- Did you see that? - That was a hard one.

948
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:30,331
- You've been there. - I've been there.

949
00:30:30,332 --> 00:30:31,530
- I've been there.
- Right? You've been there.

950
00:30:31,531 --> 00:30:33,372
- I've been there. - You've been there.

951
00:30:33,471 --> 00:30:34,841
- I saw the sunrise there.
- He's been there.

952
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:38,072
(He cried 10 years ago in that very spot.)

953
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,271
The Empire State Building was...

954
00:30:39,272 --> 00:30:40,341
- a hard one too. - Yes.

955
00:30:40,342 --> 00:30:41,480
(Feeling proud)

956
00:30:41,481 --> 00:30:43,441
- Here is the picture. Go.
- Only you remain now.

957
00:30:44,011 --> 00:30:46,451
- Only you remain now.
- Here is the picture. Go.

958
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:54,862
(They will pass Round
1 if Jae Suk gets it right.)

959
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,520
- In 1, 2... - Taj Mahal of India.

960
00:30:57,521 --> 00:30:59,190
(Taj Mahal of India)

961
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,538
- In 1, 2... - Taj Mahal of India.

962
00:31:00,562 --> 00:31:01,562
- Yes! - Okay!

963
00:31:01,563 --> 00:31:04,332
(Everyone gets it right.)

964
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:09,241
(They pass Round 1 only after 2 tries.)

965
00:31:09,441 --> 00:31:11,210
- Yes! - My gosh.

966
00:31:11,211 --> 00:31:12,241
My gosh.

967
00:31:12,572 --> 00:31:14,940
- It wasn't easy. - You're the best!

968
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:16,680
- We got the Dom Perignon. - All right.

969
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:18,351
- The Dom Perignon. - Yes!

970
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:20,051
(She wins the bottle of champagne.)

971
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,920
- All right. - We passed Round One...

972
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,851
- only after two tries. - My gosh.

973
00:31:23,852 --> 00:31:25,391
- Yes! - That was hard.

974
00:31:25,392 --> 00:31:26,990
- Taj Mahal. My gosh. - That was hard.

975
00:31:26,991 --> 00:31:28,420
- We passed Round One pretty fast.
- My gosh.

976
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:29,460
- Right. - Machu Picchu.

977
00:31:29,461 --> 00:31:31,292
You probably realized it while watching us.

978
00:31:31,562 --> 00:31:33,460
- It wasn't easy to pass Round One.
- Right.

979
00:31:33,461 --> 00:31:34,861
- I... - That's a great champagne...

980
00:31:34,862 --> 00:31:37,132
- I'll keep going! - Go.

981
00:31:38,102 --> 00:31:40,801
- My gosh. - You know, this isn't easy.

982
00:31:40,802 --> 00:31:42,971
- I'm sorry. I... - All right.

983
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,872
"I need to prepare for my
class while commuting."

984
00:31:47,241 --> 00:31:48,911
"A mini tablet PC from Apple."

985
00:31:48,912 --> 00:31:51,111
(iPad mini from Apple)

986
00:31:51,112 --> 00:31:53,480
- Gosh, a tablet PC? - Please!

987
00:31:53,481 --> 00:31:54,651
(It's a new tablet PC from Apple.)

988
00:31:54,652 --> 00:31:55,957
- This is the newest model. - Right.

989
00:31:55,981 --> 00:31:57,020
- No way. - This is the newest model.

990
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:59,250
- I really wanted it.
- Okay. We'll get it for you.

991
00:31:59,251 --> 00:32:01,260
- Please. - She can use this to work...

992
00:32:01,261 --> 00:32:03,490
My gosh. If she gets to take
the champagne and this...

993
00:32:03,491 --> 00:32:04,591
- Please. - Then we don't need...

994
00:32:04,592 --> 00:32:05,592
to go to Round Three.

995
00:32:05,593 --> 00:32:07,831
- This is more than enough. - Totally.

996
00:32:07,832 --> 00:32:09,662
- She can drink while using that. - But...

997
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:11,801
(Round 2)

998
00:32:11,802 --> 00:32:13,700
(The same as the previous round)

999
00:32:13,701 --> 00:32:16,372
(But going back and forth for a lap)

1000
00:32:17,642 --> 00:32:18,811
We're going this way again.

1001
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,042
Then 1 of us answer 1 question.

1002
00:32:21,281 --> 00:32:24,240
- Others answer two questions.
- Shall we put Jae Hyung at the end?

1003
00:32:24,241 --> 00:32:26,351
- This is tough.
- For the U-turn section...

1004
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:27,552
I think I'll definitely fail.

1005
00:32:28,152 --> 00:32:29,220
Let's change the arrangement.

1006
00:32:29,221 --> 00:32:30,521
How are we going to do it?

1007
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,920
- I'll go there. - Yes, you come here.

1008
00:32:32,921 --> 00:32:34,052
Then Jae Hyung...

1009
00:32:34,622 --> 00:32:36,122
You don't trust him, right?

1010
00:32:37,221 --> 00:32:38,391
- Shall I go there? - Yes.

1011
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:39,392
I'll sit here.

1012
00:32:39,393 --> 00:32:41,161
- I'm not good. - He made me upset.

1013
00:32:41,162 --> 00:32:42,862
I'm not good at quizzes.

1014
00:32:43,031 --> 00:32:44,770
- I... - Do you want to sit here?

1015
00:32:44,771 --> 00:32:46,301
- No. - Anyone can see...

1016
00:32:46,302 --> 00:32:48,641
- that he should be here.
- Let's put Jae Hyung here.

1017
00:32:48,642 --> 00:32:50,000
- Is he starting the game? - Yes.

1018
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:51,111
- All right. - Let's try that.

1019
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,210
- I can't get it wrong at the end. - No.

1020
00:32:53,211 --> 00:32:54,641
- No, you sit there. - Come here.

1021
00:32:54,642 --> 00:32:55,911
- No, I'll stay here. - Hurry.

1022
00:32:55,912 --> 00:32:57,180
- No. - Try it.

1023
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,280
- No. - Try.

1024
00:32:58,281 --> 00:33:00,112
We're going to try this.

1025
00:33:00,352 --> 00:33:02,180
(He's forced to start the game.)

1026
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,701
Let's do this to heighten the tension.

1027
00:33:04,251 --> 00:33:05,322
- All right. - Okay.

1028
00:33:05,622 --> 00:33:08,020
- Here we go. - This is tough, though.

1029
00:33:08,021 --> 00:33:10,092
- Okay. Let's begin. - This isn't easy.

1030
00:33:10,392 --> 00:33:11,961
- Okay. - Here is the picture.

1031
00:33:13,031 --> 00:33:14,031
Go.

1032
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:17,162
- In 1, 2...
- The Great Wall of China, China!

1033
00:33:17,332 --> 00:33:19,170
- Gosh! - All right.

1034
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:20,571
(Correct)

1035
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:21,871
- Gosh, it's confusing. - The second one.

1036
00:33:21,872 --> 00:33:23,302
Here is the picture. Go.

1037
00:33:23,741 --> 00:33:24,912
The Pyramids, Egypt.

1038
00:33:25,342 --> 00:33:26,471
There we go.

1039
00:33:26,912 --> 00:33:28,912
The third one. Here is the picture. Go.

1040
00:33:29,112 --> 00:33:30,672
- In 1, 2... - Seokguram Grotto, Korea.

1041
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:32,082
Great.

1042
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,151
- I'll just do as I've been doing.
- All right.

1043
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:35,581
- I won't get nervous.
- You won't get nervous.

1044
00:33:35,582 --> 00:33:36,651
Great.

1045
00:33:36,652 --> 00:33:39,420
(They're proceeding smoothly.)

1046
00:33:39,421 --> 00:33:40,997
Just look at the picture
and don't get nervous.

1047
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,302
- Don't get nervous.
- It's just what I always have done.

1048
00:33:43,592 --> 00:33:46,030
- In 1, 2, 3. Wrong! - What's that place?

1049
00:33:46,031 --> 00:33:48,261
(Time over)

1050
00:33:48,632 --> 00:33:51,270
- In 1, 2, 3. Wrong! - What's that place?

1051
00:33:51,271 --> 00:33:53,730
- It's Mont Saint-Michel.
- Mont Saint-Michel.

1052
00:33:53,731 --> 00:33:55,470
It's hard to recognize Mont Saint-Michel.

1053
00:33:55,471 --> 00:33:57,717
- You can tell after visiting it.
- You need to visit it.

1054
00:33:57,741 --> 00:33:59,371
I only know the snack with a similar name.

1055
00:33:59,372 --> 00:34:01,680
- That's too tough to answer. - Right.

1056
00:34:01,681 --> 00:34:03,510
- This is too difficult. - Yes.

1057
00:34:03,511 --> 00:34:06,180
I guess the question gets
tough for the U-turn section.

1058
00:34:06,181 --> 00:34:08,280
Right. They're poisoning the section.

1059
00:34:08,281 --> 00:34:10,320
We're going smoothly,
so they're stopping us.

1060
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:11,950
- They need a killer question.
- We need to get over this hump.

1061
00:34:11,951 --> 00:34:12,951
It's a killer question.

1062
00:34:12,952 --> 00:34:14,192
They gave us a killer question.

1063
00:34:14,422 --> 00:34:15,792
You're so brutal.

1064
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:17,392
This is our fifth try.

1065
00:34:17,622 --> 00:34:20,261
We still have a lot of chances, Gina.

1066
00:34:20,431 --> 00:34:22,561
Okay, the fifth try.

1067
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,901
- Let's begin. - Please.

1068
00:34:25,002 --> 00:34:26,030
Here we go.

1069
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,031
Here is the picture.

1070
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:29,442
Go.

1071
00:34:30,172 --> 00:34:32,571
- One... - Niagara Falls, Canada!

1072
00:34:33,542 --> 00:34:35,442
(Relieved)

1073
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:36,881
All right.

1074
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:39,482
- Can I... - Here is the picture. Go.

1075
00:34:40,352 --> 00:34:41,720
- One... - The White House, USA.

1076
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,622
- It's easy. - That was an easy one.

1077
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:45,922
Here is the picture. Go.

1078
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:49,062
- The Leaning Tower of Pisa, Italy.
- Right.

1079
00:34:50,162 --> 00:34:51,732
(Going smoothly)

1080
00:34:52,361 --> 00:34:54,430
(Now, the killer question section)

1081
00:34:54,431 --> 00:34:56,271
- All right. Next.
- I need to relax and look.

1082
00:34:56,832 --> 00:34:58,831
- Here is the picture. Go.
- I need to relax and look.

1083
00:34:58,832 --> 00:35:00,071
I shouldn't focus.

1084
00:35:00,201 --> 00:35:02,272
- One... - Here... It's...

1085
00:35:04,672 --> 00:35:08,911
(You know the place!)

1086
00:35:08,912 --> 00:35:11,150
Here... It's... Greece!

1087
00:35:11,151 --> 00:35:12,482
Greece.

1088
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:14,521
- Santorini. - Santorini?

1089
00:35:14,522 --> 00:35:16,852
You need to show a
lot of blue for Santorini.

1090
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:18,651
That's...

1091
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:20,251
- Santorini is... - This is...

1092
00:35:20,252 --> 00:35:22,590
- How come you know these things?
- You should show a lot of blue.

1093
00:35:22,591 --> 00:35:23,860
Come on, Yeon Seok.

1094
00:35:23,861 --> 00:35:25,130
- No, but this... - It's...

1095
00:35:25,131 --> 00:35:27,171
I thought it was an
advertisement for Pocari Sweat.

1096
00:35:27,361 --> 00:35:29,400
They need to show a lot of blue for this.

1097
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:31,200
- This is wrong. - Santorini...

1098
00:35:31,201 --> 00:35:33,331
Yeon Seok, this is Santorini.

1099
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:35,141
You should answer this one.

1100
00:35:35,142 --> 00:35:36,672
- You should. - Should I? Really?

1101
00:35:36,741 --> 00:35:38,211
You should answer this. Santorini.

1102
00:35:38,212 --> 00:35:41,111
This is so Santorini.

1103
00:35:41,312 --> 00:35:43,641
They need to show a lot of this part.

1104
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,682
You're right. I looked
at it for quite a while too.

1105
00:35:46,082 --> 00:35:47,082
(Their fifth try failed.)

1106
00:35:47,083 --> 00:35:48,380
This is so...

1107
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:50,320
- The viewers... - Juck, you sit there.

1108
00:35:50,321 --> 00:35:51,751
- Okay. - You come here.

1109
00:35:51,752 --> 00:35:52,922
- All right. - Really?

1110
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,490
- You need to answer once.
- In this position?

1111
00:35:54,491 --> 00:35:55,797
(Juck will take care
of the killer question.)

1112
00:35:55,821 --> 00:35:58,130
- Let's go all the way and back.
- For once.

1113
00:35:58,131 --> 00:36:00,062
I haven't been to Santorini.

1114
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:01,760
Would you like to have a Fairy Tour?

1115
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:02,961
- What? - A Fairy Tour.

1116
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:05,071
Please don't cast
someone here for your show.

1117
00:36:05,832 --> 00:36:07,631
He's trying to imitate "Poonghyanggo."

1118
00:36:09,071 --> 00:36:11,001
There was a show called "Fairy Tour!"

1119
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,211
- "Poongyego" imitated it. - Seriously.

1120
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,240
"Pinggyego" led to "Poongyego"
because of my show.

1121
00:36:15,241 --> 00:36:16,312
"Poongyego."

1122
00:36:16,741 --> 00:36:17,812
Isn't it "Poongyego?"

1123
00:36:18,312 --> 00:36:20,011
It's weathervane. Right.

1124
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:22,321
- "Weathervane." - What is it?

1125
00:36:22,852 --> 00:36:24,450
- It's "Poonghyanggo." - "Poonghyanggo."

1126
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:26,191
Still, Jae Hyung, I appreciate it.

1127
00:36:26,192 --> 00:36:27,527
It means you're watching my shows.

1128
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:29,621
- He pays quite a lot of attention.
- Right.

1129
00:36:29,622 --> 00:36:31,162
The show lasted for two hours.

1130
00:36:32,192 --> 00:36:34,760
But this is our sixth try already.

1131
00:36:34,761 --> 00:36:36,662
- Gosh. - We've used half of the tries.

1132
00:36:36,732 --> 00:36:38,630
- Please. - We can finish Round Two here...

1133
00:36:38,631 --> 00:36:39,700
and move on to Round Three.

1134
00:36:39,701 --> 00:36:40,772
I'm satisfied.

1135
00:36:41,031 --> 00:36:42,501
- For Round Two. - I'm satisfied now.

1136
00:36:42,502 --> 00:36:43,541
You can tell by watching how we're doing.

1137
00:36:43,542 --> 00:36:45,541
I'm satisfied with this tablet. Please.

1138
00:36:45,542 --> 00:36:46,542
She means it.

1139
00:36:46,772 --> 00:36:47,942
Are you sure, Gina?

1140
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:49,111
All right.

1141
00:36:49,112 --> 00:36:50,641
Let's cheer ourselves.

1142
00:36:50,642 --> 00:36:52,411
- Let's cheer ourselves, Gina.
- Come, Gina.

1143
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:54,380
- In 1, 2, 3. We can do it! - We can do it!

1144
00:36:54,381 --> 00:36:55,880
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on try number 6.)

1145
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:58,590
(It's their sixth try already.)

1146
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,521
(They need to succeed in Round 2.)

1147
00:37:01,522 --> 00:37:03,022
The first one. Here is the picture.

1148
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:04,892
Go.

1149
00:37:06,031 --> 00:37:07,731
In 1, 2, 3.

1150
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:09,530
(Name of the landmark, Country)

1151
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:10,562
The coin.

1152
00:37:11,801 --> 00:37:13,700
(It reminds you of people throwing coins.)

1153
00:37:13,701 --> 00:37:15,471
(A splendid fountain)

1154
00:37:15,841 --> 00:37:17,541
In 1, 2, 3.

1155
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:19,541
- Wrong! - Italy!

1156
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:21,642
- Is it Trevi Fountain? - Trevi Fountain?

1157
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:22,741
It's Trevi Fountain.

1158
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:24,382
It appeared in "Roman Holiday."

1159
00:37:24,542 --> 00:37:25,680
Now...

1160
00:37:25,681 --> 00:37:28,361
Why are you saying "Roman
Holiday?" You need to say Trevi Fountain.

1161
00:37:29,422 --> 00:37:31,621
- It's tough. - It was a tough one.

1162
00:37:31,622 --> 00:37:33,950
- It's so tough.
- You can't answer Trevi quickly.

1163
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:35,821
I haven't been there, you know.

1164
00:37:36,192 --> 00:37:38,607
It's not that we're answering
because we all have been there.

1165
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,431
I've never been to Italy.

1166
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:42,200
I haven't been there either.

1167
00:37:42,201 --> 00:37:44,002
So suddenly, this...

1168
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:47,131
What do you call that
thing with the Hand of Truth?

1169
00:37:47,471 --> 00:37:49,601
- What do you want to say?
- You mean, Mouth of Truth?

1170
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,641
- Is it the Mouth of Truth in Italy?
- It's the Mouth of Truth.

1171
00:37:51,642 --> 00:37:52,741
It's in Italy.

1172
00:37:53,011 --> 00:37:55,241
- It's confusing.
- I haven't been there either.

1173
00:37:55,511 --> 00:37:57,441
But why is there no desk for me?

1174
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,950
- There's none for me either.
- You can use this.

1175
00:37:58,951 --> 00:38:01,851
- It feels so... - I feel settled now.

1176
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:03,012
- It's good now. - All right.

1177
00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:05,892
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1178
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:08,162
But will Jae Hyung go first?

1179
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:10,562
- Shall we change the arrangement?
- Trevi...

1180
00:38:10,861 --> 00:38:11,961
Is it okay with you?

1181
00:38:11,962 --> 00:38:13,490
You and Jae Suk can change seats.

1182
00:38:13,491 --> 00:38:14,760
Yes, let's do that.

1183
00:38:14,761 --> 00:38:16,241
(Jae Suk is assigned as the starter.)

1184
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,272
You have no desk again.

1185
00:38:19,401 --> 00:38:21,741
- We can't help it. - It's your fate.

1186
00:38:22,542 --> 00:38:24,400
I'll share mine.

1187
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:25,570
We can't help it.

1188
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,542
I feel like I'm naked.

1189
00:38:27,741 --> 00:38:29,642
It's because you're in white today.

1190
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:31,311
Why do you have to wear white pants?

1191
00:38:31,312 --> 00:38:32,411
(White pants bother him.)

1192
00:38:32,412 --> 00:38:33,681
It's because you're in white.

1193
00:38:34,051 --> 00:38:36,951
Now, we can't be sure about the champagne.

1194
00:38:38,091 --> 00:38:39,950
- Please. - We have three chances left.

1195
00:38:39,951 --> 00:38:41,590
- Let's cheer ourselves. - We can do it.

1196
00:38:41,591 --> 00:38:43,138
- We can do it! - We shouldn't say that.

1197
00:38:43,162 --> 00:38:45,292
Do you say, "We can do it" in French too?

1198
00:38:45,462 --> 00:38:48,130
You say "Allez" for "We can do it."

1199
00:38:48,131 --> 00:38:49,561
- Allez! - Let's do it.

1200
00:38:49,562 --> 00:38:50,700
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1201
00:38:50,701 --> 00:38:51,772
- Allez! - Allez!

1202
00:38:51,971 --> 00:38:53,031
Here is the picture.

1203
00:38:54,602 --> 00:38:55,672
Go.

1204
00:38:56,401 --> 00:38:59,411
- The Statue of Liberty, USA.
- This is easy.

1205
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:01,541
All right. Thank you. This much is good.

1206
00:39:01,542 --> 00:39:02,711
- Here is the picture. Go.
- It's your turn.

1207
00:39:02,712 --> 00:39:04,752
(Next, the Fairy in white pants)

1208
00:39:06,511 --> 00:39:08,220
- In 1, 2... - The Garden of Versailles.

1209
00:39:08,221 --> 00:39:10,881
No, Versailles, France.

1210
00:39:11,551 --> 00:39:13,720
Versailles, France.

1211
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:14,860
(He succeeds in pronouncing it.)

1212
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:16,161
- The Palace of Versailles. - Yes.

1213
00:39:16,162 --> 00:39:17,490
It's the Palace of Versailles.

1214
00:39:17,491 --> 00:39:18,630
- Versailles is enough.
- The Palace of Versailles.

1215
00:39:18,631 --> 00:39:20,332
- The Palace of Versailles. - Right.

1216
00:39:21,031 --> 00:39:22,631
It was ambiguous, but we'll let it pass.

1217
00:39:23,002 --> 00:39:24,562
Here is the picture. Go.

1218
00:39:25,602 --> 00:39:26,831
- All right. - In 1, 2...

1219
00:39:26,832 --> 00:39:28,740
Opera House, Australia.

1220
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,070
- Yes, baby! - All right.

1221
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,102
Opera House.

1222
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,441
(Yeon Seok passes.)

1223
00:39:32,442 --> 00:39:34,340
- Great, baby. - All right.

1224
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:35,942
- Get your act together. - Let's go.

1225
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,252
(Next, a killer question)

1226
00:39:38,451 --> 00:39:39,780
- Focus. - Go.

1227
00:39:39,781 --> 00:39:41,351
(Name of the landmark, Country)

1228
00:39:41,352 --> 00:39:43,421
- In 1, 2... - Forbidden City, China.

1229
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,892
- There you go. - That's it.

1230
00:39:45,252 --> 00:39:46,391
(They are halfway done.)

1231
00:39:46,392 --> 00:39:50,021
- It's not easy. - Let's make it this time.

1232
00:39:50,022 --> 00:39:51,931
- This isn't easy. - Here is the picture.

1233
00:39:53,392 --> 00:39:54,431
Go.

1234
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:55,731
- Say it. - One...

1235
00:39:55,732 --> 00:39:56,732
France.

1236
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:59,070
(Country: France)

1237
00:39:59,071 --> 00:40:03,341
(What's the name of the landmark?)

1238
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:06,641
- Say it. - One...

1239
00:40:06,642 --> 00:40:07,642
France.

1240
00:40:07,912 --> 00:40:09,041
- The Arc de Triomphe. - Wrong.

1241
00:40:09,042 --> 00:40:10,211
The Arc de Triomphe.

1242
00:40:10,212 --> 00:40:11,511
- France. - The Arc de Triomphe.

1243
00:40:11,752 --> 00:40:12,992
- Wrong. - The Arc de Triomphe.

1244
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,551
No. Why?

1245
00:40:17,881 --> 00:40:18,922
Why?

1246
00:40:19,192 --> 00:40:20,221
Did I say it too late?

1247
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,421
- It's true you were
late, - Was it too late?

1248
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:24,891
But Bong Won who's next to you...

1249
00:40:24,892 --> 00:40:26,530
Why did you say it and foul?

1250
00:40:26,531 --> 00:40:28,601
- He was thinking of the answer.
- He fouled.

1251
00:40:28,602 --> 00:40:30,662
Even Gina approached and whispered.

1252
00:40:31,201 --> 00:40:32,231
She was talking to him here.

1253
00:40:32,232 --> 00:40:34,531
Gina, you were talking here.

1254
00:40:35,841 --> 00:40:37,200
- It's nonsense. - Goodness.

1255
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,412
(Invading the field)

1256
00:40:38,672 --> 00:40:40,541
We made it this far.

1257
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:42,812
- That's... - I was...

1258
00:40:43,082 --> 00:40:44,781
a bit confused,

1259
00:40:45,681 --> 00:40:47,180
but I was breathing.

1260
00:40:47,181 --> 00:40:48,622
What do you mean you were breathing?

1261
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:50,251
- I was adding emotions. - What emotions?

1262
00:40:50,252 --> 00:40:52,692
I was creating emotions here.

1263
00:40:52,922 --> 00:40:55,321
He says he was creating emotions.

1264
00:40:55,662 --> 00:40:57,792
I was creating emotions.

1265
00:40:58,062 --> 00:41:00,130
Gosh, that was so close.

1266
00:41:00,131 --> 00:41:01,502
It was close.

1267
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,331
- It's fun, though.
- We have two chances left.

1268
00:41:03,332 --> 00:41:05,431
- Let's change the seats.
- How shall we do it?

1269
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:07,300
- The arrangement?
- How should we change it?

1270
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,301
But Juck is in the right place.

1271
00:41:09,502 --> 00:41:11,840
They give a difficult
answer around his section.

1272
00:41:11,841 --> 00:41:13,610
The fourth question was hard.

1273
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:15,880
Honestly, you might not have noticed,

1274
00:41:15,881 --> 00:41:17,340
but I got all the answers right.

1275
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,510
I thought so.

1276
00:41:18,511 --> 00:41:20,010
All right.

1277
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,121
Shall Juck and I change
seats? Shall I sit there?

1278
00:41:22,122 --> 00:41:24,680
You get the difficult answers well.

1279
00:41:24,681 --> 00:41:26,220
- We should change it. - You come here.

1280
00:41:26,221 --> 00:41:27,751
- Do you want to finish it? - No.

1281
00:41:27,752 --> 00:41:29,220
- Here we go. - It's our ninth try.

1282
00:41:29,221 --> 00:41:30,521
- Gina. - Yes?

1283
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:31,791
- Let's cheer ourselves. - We can do it!

1284
00:41:31,792 --> 00:41:34,461
- I feel so pressured here.
- We need to make it this time.

1285
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:35,562
I'm pressured.

1286
00:41:36,502 --> 00:41:37,531
Here is the picture.

1287
00:41:38,431 --> 00:41:40,907
(The ace players are in charge of
the killer question and the finale.)

1288
00:41:40,931 --> 00:41:43,442
(The rest need to connect them.)

1289
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:44,671
Go.

1290
00:41:44,672 --> 00:41:46,211
(Name of the landmark, Country)

1291
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:48,241
- Say it. - Golden Gate Bridge, USA.

1292
00:41:48,412 --> 00:41:49,481
There you go.

1293
00:41:49,482 --> 00:41:50,642
Golden Gate Bridge, USA.

1294
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:52,481
- There you go. - It was a tough one.

1295
00:41:52,482 --> 00:41:54,851
- Golden Gate Bridge was tough.
- It wasn't an easy one.

1296
00:41:54,852 --> 00:41:55,950
(They passed the difficult question.)

1297
00:41:55,951 --> 00:41:58,151
Here is the picture. Go.

1298
00:41:59,752 --> 00:42:02,360
- In 1, 2... - Notre-Dame,

1299
00:42:02,361 --> 00:42:03,692
- France! - Yes!

1300
00:42:03,962 --> 00:42:05,292
- Wrong. - He got it. No?

1301
00:42:05,662 --> 00:42:07,562
- Is it the Big Ben?
- It's the Orsay Museum.

1302
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:08,962
It's Orsay.

1303
00:42:09,631 --> 00:42:10,930
This is unbelievable.

1304
00:42:10,931 --> 00:42:13,300
You can see the Orsay
Museum across from it.

1305
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:15,200
- I mean, Notre-Dame. - Is that Notre-Dame?

1306
00:42:15,201 --> 00:42:17,372
- This is... - No, wait.

1307
00:42:17,602 --> 00:42:20,211
- He named the building.
- That's right, I saw that.

1308
00:42:20,212 --> 00:42:21,510
- That's right. - Look at this.

1309
00:42:21,511 --> 00:42:23,240
- This is the Notre-Dame.
- It's right here.

1310
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,950
- You saw the cathedral. - That's right.

1311
00:42:24,951 --> 00:42:26,811
- This right here.
- This is the Notre-Dame.

1312
00:42:26,812 --> 00:42:28,581
- I was looking at that.
- This causes an issue.

1313
00:42:28,582 --> 00:42:30,251
- Wait a minute. - This is a problem.

1314
00:42:30,252 --> 00:42:31,650
- It causes an issue. - Yes, it does.

1315
00:42:31,651 --> 00:42:33,527
- This totally causes an issue.
- This is a problem.

1316
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,991
It would be a problem if
this were on the CSAT.

1317
00:42:36,221 --> 00:42:38,462
(Time to check the facts)

1318
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:41,900
(The clock that represents
the Orsay Museum)

1319
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:44,831
(A building is in the photo
on the other side of it.)

1320
00:42:44,832 --> 00:42:47,631
(What does the Notre-Dame look like?)

1321
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:50,871
(It looks totally different.)

1322
00:42:50,872 --> 00:42:52,241
(This is a university building.)

1323
00:42:53,111 --> 00:42:56,711
(He tried to use a trick,
but it ended in failure.)

1324
00:42:56,712 --> 00:42:58,450
- Wait. - We can...

1325
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,751
- This is a Christmas special.
- That's right.

1326
00:43:00,752 --> 00:43:03,921
- We should give her a present.
- This is too difficult.

1327
00:43:03,922 --> 00:43:05,820
- Let's just give her the present.
- You know what?

1328
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:07,022
We're facing a crisis.

1329
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:08,761
The Arc de Triomphe was an easy one.

1330
00:43:08,922 --> 00:43:11,562
- Why would you bring that up?
- We almost succeeded.

1331
00:43:11,662 --> 00:43:13,891
- That's cruel. - We almost succeeded.

1332
00:43:13,892 --> 00:43:15,501
The Arc de Triomphe was a freebie.

1333
00:43:15,502 --> 00:43:17,260
I know. But it isn't just Yeon Seok.

1334
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,970
- Jae Hyung missed an easy one too.
- It was an easy question.

1335
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:21,941
I couldn't see.

1336
00:43:21,942 --> 00:43:23,201
You couldn't see?

1337
00:43:23,341 --> 00:43:25,487
- Are your eyes out of focus?
- You can't see the photos?

1338
00:43:25,511 --> 00:43:27,641
- What's worse than hyperopia...
- You never know.

1339
00:43:27,642 --> 00:43:29,281
Is slow focusing.

1340
00:43:29,482 --> 00:43:31,280
- That sounds softer. - Slow focusing?

1341
00:43:31,281 --> 00:43:32,510
- That sounds good. - Yes, it does.

1342
00:43:32,511 --> 00:43:34,680
- Slow focusing. It's good.
- It sounds good.

1343
00:43:34,681 --> 00:43:35,780
My eyes eventually focus on the object.

1344
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,280
I'm sure people could feel uncomfortable...

1345
00:43:38,281 --> 00:43:40,650
with the word "hyperopia"
on a variety show.

1346
00:43:40,651 --> 00:43:42,590
- We'll say "Slow focusing" instead.
- That sounds better.

1347
00:43:42,591 --> 00:43:44,521
Your eyes eventually focus.

1348
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:47,761
It will eventually happen to all of us.

1349
00:43:48,091 --> 00:43:49,760
Let's go, guys.

1350
00:43:49,761 --> 00:43:53,102
But I think I already
named everything I know.

1351
00:43:53,232 --> 00:43:54,931
Is this our last chance? Wait a second.

1352
00:43:55,772 --> 00:43:57,978
- This is our last chance.
- We should give her the present.

1353
00:43:58,002 --> 00:43:59,111
Noel.

1354
00:43:59,241 --> 00:44:00,542
- Noel. - Please.

1355
00:44:00,942 --> 00:44:02,081
- This is our last try. - Noel

1356
00:44:02,082 --> 00:44:03,642
- Allez. - Let's create a miracle.

1357
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:04,941
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1358
00:44:04,942 --> 00:44:06,181
- Allez! - Allez!

1359
00:44:06,281 --> 00:44:08,351
- Let's create a miracle. - Wait a second.

1360
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:09,950
- Yes. - We need a miracle now.

1361
00:44:09,951 --> 00:44:11,181
Gosh. This is...

1362
00:44:11,422 --> 00:44:12,422
- All right. - We got this.

1363
00:44:12,423 --> 00:44:14,450
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on their last try.)

1364
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:15,491
The last try.

1365
00:44:16,091 --> 00:44:18,761
We have to give her a
present for Christmas.

1366
00:44:18,962 --> 00:44:20,260
Let's do well this time.

1367
00:44:20,261 --> 00:44:21,501
(We have to do well this time.)

1368
00:44:22,031 --> 00:44:23,031
Here is...

1369
00:44:24,131 --> 00:44:25,131
the picture. Go.

1370
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:26,501
(Name of the landmark, Country)

1371
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:28,002
Mouth of Truth, Italy.

1372
00:44:28,131 --> 00:44:30,701
- We brought this up earlier.
- Wait. I should've gotten this.

1373
00:44:30,841 --> 00:44:33,470
- We brought it up earlier. - I guessed it.

1374
00:44:33,471 --> 00:44:34,712
- You were right. - Right.

1375
00:44:34,942 --> 00:44:37,211
- You're amazing. How did you know?
- Should I...

1376
00:44:37,212 --> 00:44:38,652
- guess another one? - Yes, quickly.

1377
00:44:38,812 --> 00:44:40,212
Let's focus.

1378
00:44:40,611 --> 00:44:41,651
Here is...

1379
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:43,651
the picture. Go.

1380
00:44:44,022 --> 00:44:45,851
- You're up. - In 1, 2, 3.

1381
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:48,050
- Sungsimdang. No, wait. - No.

1382
00:44:48,051 --> 00:44:52,562
(Sungsimdang)

1383
00:44:57,401 --> 00:45:00,801
(What?)

1384
00:45:02,172 --> 00:45:03,740
- No, wait. - Why?

1385
00:45:03,741 --> 00:45:05,811
I'm right. It's Sacre-Coeur.

1386
00:45:05,812 --> 00:45:07,642
- Sacre-Coeur. - Sacre-Coeur.

1387
00:45:07,812 --> 00:45:09,311
- This is unbelievable. - Listen to me.

1388
00:45:09,312 --> 00:45:10,911
- Sacre-Coeur. - Sacre-Coeur.

1389
00:45:10,912 --> 00:45:13,081
- It's Sungsimdang. - It's Sungsimdang.

1390
00:45:13,082 --> 00:45:15,582
- It translates into "Sungsimdang."
- Sacre-Coeur.

1391
00:45:15,721 --> 00:45:17,481
- It's "Sungsimdang" in Korean.
- In which country?

1392
00:45:17,482 --> 00:45:18,720
- In Korean. - France.

1393
00:45:18,721 --> 00:45:20,351
- That's right. - It's Sacre-Coeur.

1394
00:45:20,352 --> 00:45:22,161
- I'm right in Korean. - Is he right?

1395
00:45:22,162 --> 00:45:24,392
- It's really "Sungsimdang." - Sungsimdang.

1396
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:26,892
(Time to check the facts again)

1397
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,130
(The answer was Montmartre...)

1398
00:45:29,131 --> 00:45:31,630
(or Sacre-Coeur.)

1399
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:33,130
(Sacre means "sacred.")

1400
00:45:33,131 --> 00:45:35,400
(Coeur means "heart.")

1401
00:45:35,401 --> 00:45:37,300
(Sungsimdang?)

1402
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:39,340
- That's right. - It's Sacre-Coeur.

1403
00:45:39,341 --> 00:45:40,371
It translates into "Sungsimdang."

1404
00:45:40,372 --> 00:45:41,511
- Yes. - You were right.

1405
00:45:42,511 --> 00:45:43,711
You were right.

1406
00:45:43,712 --> 00:45:44,872
- Is he right? - Sacre-Coeur.

1407
00:45:45,281 --> 00:45:46,312
- Is he right? - Yes.

1408
00:45:46,781 --> 00:45:47,881
You did it!

1409
00:45:48,151 --> 00:45:49,751
- Thank you. - This is unbelievable.

1410
00:45:49,752 --> 00:45:53,151
(His answer, "Sungsimdang,"
is considered the right answer.)

1411
00:45:54,922 --> 00:45:57,022
I was surprised when he
suddenly said "Sungsimdang."

1412
00:45:57,321 --> 00:45:58,931
I thought that was in Daejeon.

1413
00:45:59,732 --> 00:46:02,130
It's because he thought about it in French.

1414
00:46:02,131 --> 00:46:04,161
- He thought about it in French.
- Then he translated it.

1415
00:46:04,162 --> 00:46:05,232
Right.

1416
00:46:05,772 --> 00:46:06,801
Sacre-Coeur.

1417
00:46:07,002 --> 00:46:08,641
- The next question. - It's Yeon Seok.

1418
00:46:08,642 --> 00:46:10,300
You saved that one.

1419
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,271
- It's hard. - Sacre means "sacred."

1420
00:46:12,272 --> 00:46:14,011
That's enough.

1421
00:46:14,212 --> 00:46:15,811
I feel so... Okay. We
still have a long way to go.

1422
00:46:15,812 --> 00:46:17,452
- Let's focus. - Here is the picture. Go.

1423
00:46:17,582 --> 00:46:19,451
- Let's focus. - Here is the picture. Go.

1424
00:46:20,482 --> 00:46:23,221
- In 1, 2, 3. - Korea, 63 Building.

1425
00:46:25,352 --> 00:46:27,490
- There are ones about Korea too.
- I couldn't name it.

1426
00:46:27,491 --> 00:46:29,067
- I struggled. - It's difficult to name it.

1427
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:31,220
- Why is it so difficult to name? - It is.

1428
00:46:31,221 --> 00:46:33,661
- It's hard to name. - It's a struggle.

1429
00:46:33,662 --> 00:46:36,001
We're trying to calm
down. Don't go too fast.

1430
00:46:36,002 --> 00:46:37,562
- Why are you angry? - I'm not.

1431
00:46:38,571 --> 00:46:39,700
(Last try: Juck, Jae
Hyung, Yeon Seok, Jae Suk)

1432
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:41,700
- Why did you get so angry?
- We have to do well.

1433
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:42,872
Here is the picture.

1434
00:46:45,212 --> 00:46:46,272
Go.

1435
00:46:47,011 --> 00:46:48,412
In 1, 2...

1436
00:46:49,881 --> 00:46:55,281
(What is that?)

1437
00:46:56,221 --> 00:46:57,551
Switzerland, Matterhorn.

1438
00:46:57,821 --> 00:46:59,792
(He got it right!)

1439
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:01,221
Switzerland, Matterhorn.

1440
00:47:02,022 --> 00:47:03,461
(You got that right?)

1441
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:05,022
- We almost failed. - That was amazing!

1442
00:47:05,392 --> 00:47:08,161
- Yoo Jae Suk. - Yoo Jae Suk.

1443
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:10,431
(He gets the killer question right.)

1444
00:47:10,832 --> 00:47:12,430
- You got it right.
- Matterhorn was difficult.

1445
00:47:12,431 --> 00:47:13,731
It was a really difficult question.

1446
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:14,771
(Matterhorn is a pyramid-shaped
summit in the Swiss Alps.)

1447
00:47:14,772 --> 00:47:16,470
Why are you showing us a mountain?

1448
00:47:16,471 --> 00:47:17,871
What is wrong with you?

1449
00:47:17,872 --> 00:47:19,971
- That was so difficult. - Gosh.

1450
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:22,118
(He finds it surprising
that he got it right.)

1451
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,680
Matterhorn was a tough one.

1452
00:47:23,681 --> 00:47:25,161
- You're impressive, Jae Suk. - Gosh.

1453
00:47:25,712 --> 00:47:27,851
I don't think even Mountaineer
Um Hong Gil could've guessed that.

1454
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:29,252
- You're right. - Seriously.

1455
00:47:29,381 --> 00:47:31,221
We just have to get three more right.

1456
00:47:31,321 --> 00:47:32,650
- Please. - We have to give her a present.

1457
00:47:32,651 --> 00:47:35,292
It was such a struggle
for us to get this far.

1458
00:47:35,462 --> 00:47:36,921
We barely made it this far.

1459
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:38,391
I'm so nervous.

1460
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:39,708
(They take 1 step at a
time to clear Round 2.)

1461
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:41,892
- Here is the picture. Go.
- What if it's a tough one?

1462
00:47:42,611 --> 00:47:44,141
- In 1, 2... - The USA.

1463
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,281
- The Grand Canyon. - Yes!

1464
00:47:46,611 --> 00:47:48,411
You did it!

1465
00:47:48,511 --> 00:47:50,310
You did it, Yeon Seok.

1466
00:47:50,411 --> 00:47:52,180
I felt your breath.

1467
00:47:52,181 --> 00:47:54,920
I was focusing on my emotions.

1468
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:56,419
- Gina. - Yes?

1469
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:58,321
- Please sit down, Gina. - Okay.

1470
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:00,059
Wait.

1471
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,629
- Gina. - What should I do?

1472
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,261
- You can't speak. - Okay.

1473
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:04,570
You came all the way over here.

1474
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:06,599
(She invades the field again.)

1475
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,701
I'll stay right here.

1476
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:10,801
- That's how desperate you are. - Yes.

1477
00:48:11,170 --> 00:48:13,470
- Let's go. We have two left. - Let's go.

1478
00:48:13,471 --> 00:48:14,970
- I feel a lot of pressure. - Come on.

1479
00:48:14,971 --> 00:48:17,611
- Can I pull the medical card?
- That was a good seat.

1480
00:48:17,770 --> 00:48:20,380
- I believe in you.
- Can I get my heart rate checked?

1481
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,349
- Good luck. - Don't we get to...

1482
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:23,830
- call someone for help? - Good luck.

1483
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,479
- I'm in trouble. - Here we go.

1484
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,520
Wait a second.

1485
00:48:32,221 --> 00:48:33,790
(Bring it on.)

1486
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,391
Wait. Look at me.

1487
00:48:38,761 --> 00:48:40,100
I'll give you one last chance.

1488
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,130
Okay. Go easy on me.

1489
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:43,301
Here is the picture.

1490
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:45,000
Here is the picture.

1491
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,070
Go.

1492
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:55,051
(Name of the landmark, Country)

1493
00:48:57,451 --> 00:48:59,979
(It is a symbol of New York...)

1494
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,520
(and will soon be crowded for
the countdown to the New Year.)

1495
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:09,060
New York, USA.

1496
00:49:09,361 --> 00:49:10,460
- And? - Incorrect.

1497
00:49:11,531 --> 00:49:12,630
New York, USA.

1498
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,130
- And? - Incorrect.

1499
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:16,530
- Jae Hyung - It's Manhattan.

1500
00:49:16,531 --> 00:49:17,900
It's Times Square.

1501
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:20,071
Right, Times Square.

1502
00:49:29,850 --> 00:49:32,280
Wait. New York, USA isn't exactly wrong.

1503
00:49:32,281 --> 00:49:34,249
- Times Square...
- If you think about it...

1504
00:49:34,250 --> 00:49:36,689
You should've said, "New
York, USA, Times Square."

1505
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:37,750
I didn't know.

1506
00:49:37,991 --> 00:49:39,559
Is it called "Times Square?"

1507
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:41,860
(He couldn't name the landmark and fails.)

1508
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:43,761
We should've ended it with "Sungsimdang."

1509
00:49:45,301 --> 00:49:49,769
(They pathetically
dragged out their last try.)

1510
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:52,770
I think we should've ended
it with "Sungsimdang."

1511
00:49:53,201 --> 00:49:54,669
Gosh. You're right.

1512
00:49:54,670 --> 00:49:57,011
He was destined to go...

1513
00:49:57,871 --> 00:49:59,380
but dragged it out too long.

1514
00:50:00,111 --> 00:50:02,110
We should've known
when we saw his white outfit.

1515
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,149
(His effort burned as
brightly as his white pants.)

1516
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,020
- I feel horrible. - Gina. Gosh.

1517
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:08,890
We feel so sorry, Gina.

1518
00:50:08,891 --> 00:50:10,420
- It's okay. - I'm so sorry.

1519
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,860
(What has passed)

1520
00:50:13,861 --> 00:50:16,729
(Is in the past)

1521
00:50:16,730 --> 00:50:19,559
(But it still means something)

1522
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,229
Since you challenged yourself.

1523
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,230
- Thank you. - I'm so sad on Christmas Eve.

1524
00:50:23,531 --> 00:50:26,540
This will become a warm
memory like a Christmas present.

1525
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,470
Whenever possible, c'est la vie!

1526
00:50:29,471 --> 00:50:31,347
(Whenever possible,
c'est la vie! That is life!)

1527
00:50:31,371 --> 00:50:33,210
Times Square, Jae Hyung.

1528
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,780
I didn't know that.

1529
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:37,551
I didn't know that place
was called Times Square.

1530
00:50:37,911 --> 00:50:40,419
Now I remember that's what
we called it when we went.

1531
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:41,420
(Feeling regret)

1532
00:50:41,421 --> 00:50:43,150
- How disappointing. - Gosh.

1533
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,120
- It's Christmas. - That was horrible.

1534
00:50:45,121 --> 00:50:47,789
They should've given you Bulguksa.

1535
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:48,931
I know.

1536
00:50:51,261 --> 00:50:53,229
Jae Hyung is good with European countries.

1537
00:50:53,230 --> 00:50:54,930
- That's right. - But not with America.

1538
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:56,570
Jae Hyung rarely went...

1539
00:50:56,571 --> 00:50:59,340
- to the USA. Right? - I went maybe twice.

1540
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:00,641
You should visit it now.

1541
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,911
You don't have to go there
to know what it's called.

1542
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:06,240
You're right. We've never been to Egypt.

1543
00:51:06,241 --> 00:51:07,940
Do you think I've been to the Matterhorn?

1544
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:09,681
(Laughing)

1545
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:13,280
It's sad, but let's go meet
our next Whenever Guest.

1546
00:51:13,281 --> 00:51:15,121
- We should get going.
- I have no motivation.

1547
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,621
- When are we meeting? - At 3pm.

1548
00:51:18,121 --> 00:51:20,019
- We have 1.5 hours.
- Let's eat before we go.

1549
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,460
- Let's eat. - We can eat and go.

1550
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:22,661
What do you want for lunch?

1551
00:51:23,091 --> 00:51:25,399
The food Myeong-dong is known for...

1552
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:27,329
is kalguksu.

1553
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:29,170
- That sounds good. - Myeongdong Kyoja.

1554
00:51:29,230 --> 00:51:31,030
- Right. - If not that,

1555
00:51:31,031 --> 00:51:33,800
there are restaurants like
Haidilao and Din Tai Fung.

1556
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:34,910
- Din Tai Fung is nearby. - What's that?

1557
00:51:34,911 --> 00:51:37,439
- Din Tai Fung has xiaolongbaos.
- Xiaolongbao.

1558
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,379
And Haidilao is a
Chinese hot pot restaurant.

1559
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:41,709
Because the Chinese embassy is nearby,

1560
00:51:41,710 --> 00:51:42,710
I like dumplings.

1561
00:51:42,711 --> 00:51:44,209
- There are Chinese restaurants.
- That sounds good.

1562
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:45,979
- They also have a noodle dance.
- They do it here too?

1563
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,380
(He explains with his whole body.)

1564
00:51:47,681 --> 00:51:49,991
- You two choose, and I will follow.
- Choose.

1565
00:51:50,451 --> 00:51:52,760
- Or gomtang at Hadongkwan.
- I like Hadongkwan.

1566
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:54,930
- It's in Myeong-dong?
- Let's have gomtang.

1567
00:51:54,931 --> 00:51:55,931
- You don't know Hadongkwan, do you?
- This is the main location.

1568
00:51:55,932 --> 00:51:57,660
- I know it. - This is the main location?

1569
00:51:57,661 --> 00:51:59,599
- Let's go to Hadongkwan.
- We recently had gukbap.

1570
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,031
- We had too much gomtang.
- We had too much of it.

1571
00:52:02,130 --> 00:52:04,669
Why did you tell us to choose...

1572
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:06,039
if you're going to have what you want?

1573
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:07,300
- It's not like that. - No, it's not.

1574
00:52:07,301 --> 00:52:09,110
As long as it isn't
something we recently had.

1575
00:52:09,111 --> 00:52:11,809
We passed a few Chinese restaurants...

1576
00:52:11,810 --> 00:52:12,979
- on our way here. - The dumpling place?

1577
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:14,040
Let's go there.

1578
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,511
That's Sandong Gyoja.

1579
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,180
- This? - Their food is really tasty.

1580
00:52:17,181 --> 00:52:18,850
- It really is. - It looks good.

1581
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:21,680
- It's a popular restaurant.
- I can tell it's a good restaurant.

1582
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,420
- The chive dish looks tasty. - Yes.

1583
00:52:23,591 --> 00:52:25,189
Bong Won, should we
have jjamppong for lunch?

1584
00:52:25,190 --> 00:52:26,519
(They kept an eye out for Juck's
favorite Chinese restaurants.)

1585
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,290
I'm sick of it.

1586
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,229
- Let's go there. - Okay.

1587
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,099
I'm not sure if we'll
be able to film there.

1588
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,729
- Let's go and see.
- It's always very crowded.

1589
00:52:33,730 --> 00:52:35,370
- The chive dish looked tasty. - Right?

1590
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:36,500
- Yes. - It's tasty.

1591
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:39,201
- Wait. Where is Myeongdong...
- Over there.

1592
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,700
- That way. - Isn't it over there?

1593
00:52:40,701 --> 00:52:42,381
- It's diagonally across from us. - I see.

1594
00:52:42,471 --> 00:52:44,340
I know my way around here.

1595
00:52:44,341 --> 00:52:45,511
- Of course. - Yes.

1596
00:52:45,641 --> 00:52:47,479
Yeon Seok must be good at reading maps...

1597
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,186
- but not actually finding things.
- That isn't true.

1598
00:52:49,210 --> 00:52:51,850
I'm pretty good at finding
things, but I got confused.

1599
00:52:52,350 --> 00:52:54,051
Don't worry.

1600
00:52:54,281 --> 00:52:56,391
I'll lead the way.

1601
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:58,321
Trust me.

1602
00:52:58,591 --> 00:52:59,919
I know the old city center well.

1603
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,031
"The old city center?"

1604
00:53:02,431 --> 00:53:03,559
(I like the old city center.)

1605
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:06,201
(Myeong-dong, Jongno, Jeong-dong.)

1606
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:08,669
(Especially Myeong-dong.)

1607
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:11,371
(It feels like home.)

1608
00:53:11,841 --> 00:53:13,899
I'll lead the way.

1609
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:16,186
(The confident player who knows
his way around the old city center.)

1610
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:17,540
I think it's this way.

1611
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,840
(He has the perfect sense of direction.)

1612
00:53:19,841 --> 00:53:21,510
We have to go toward
Seoul Central Post Office.

1613
00:53:21,511 --> 00:53:22,686
- Toward Hoehyeon Station? - Yes.

1614
00:53:22,710 --> 00:53:24,611
Myeong-dong, Heohyeon Station... Hello.

1615
00:53:25,451 --> 00:53:27,579
(He also communicates whenever possible.)

1616
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,520
Jae Suk is the only one
communicating with people.

1617
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:33,059
The underground shopping
center is fun to look around.

1618
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,060
You're right.

1619
00:53:34,161 --> 00:53:36,189
There used to be a record shop in
the underground shopping center.

1620
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:37,390
- That's right. - It's right here.

1621
00:53:37,391 --> 00:53:38,729
It's still here.

1622
00:53:38,730 --> 00:53:41,229
I used to sell and buy records here.

1623
00:53:41,230 --> 00:53:42,510
There were also clothing stores.

1624
00:53:42,571 --> 00:53:43,700
It's right here.

1625
00:53:43,701 --> 00:53:45,039
It's Sang.

1626
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,399
- It's Yoon Sang. - Yes.

1627
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,411
- It's Yoon Sang.
- He's right in the front.

1628
00:53:49,341 --> 00:53:50,370
(A familiar face)

1629
00:53:50,371 --> 00:53:51,979
I bet they have Juck's album.

1630
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,979
- I wonder if they have mine.
- But my records...

1631
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:55,710
- There aren't many? - are rare.

1632
00:53:56,210 --> 00:53:58,579
I used to have this album.

1633
00:53:58,580 --> 00:54:00,450
- It's Min Hae Kyung. - Min Hae Kyung.

1634
00:54:00,451 --> 00:54:02,290
- Min Hae Kyung. - This is amazing.

1635
00:54:02,790 --> 00:54:03,790
Seriously.

1636
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:05,491
("Winter Sunflower" by Min Hae Kyung)

1637
00:54:05,690 --> 00:54:07,959
They even have "MBC
Riverside Song Festival."

1638
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,460
This is "Dam Da Di."

1639
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,829
- They have this.
- It's Lee Sang Eun's song.

1640
00:54:12,830 --> 00:54:14,459
They even have a record for this?

1641
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,629
- "MBC Riverside Song Festival?"
- They made it into a record.

1642
00:54:16,630 --> 00:54:17,700
It's their album.

1643
00:54:17,701 --> 00:54:20,571
Within a few days after the festival,

1644
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:23,340
the record was made along with the photo...

1645
00:54:23,341 --> 00:54:24,970
- since people wanted to buy it.
- That's right.

1646
00:54:24,971 --> 00:54:26,781
- This is Firetruck's record. - Firetruck.

1647
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,011
It's unopened.

1648
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,249
I had both of these.

1649
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:31,550
You did?

1650
00:54:31,551 --> 00:54:33,180
It's expensive when it hasn't been opened.

1651
00:54:33,181 --> 00:54:35,121
It's expensive. It's 60 dollars.

1652
00:54:35,491 --> 00:54:36,950
- They even have The Blue. - Gosh.

1653
00:54:36,951 --> 00:54:38,120
(The golden oldies records are endless.)

1654
00:54:38,121 --> 00:54:39,420
"Feeling Only You."

1655
00:54:39,721 --> 00:54:43,391
("Feeling Only You" by The Blue)

1656
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:44,829
You know this song?

1657
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:47,800
I sang it as part of the
soundtrack of "Reply 1994."

1658
00:54:47,801 --> 00:54:49,370
You also sang "Running on the Sky."

1659
00:54:49,371 --> 00:54:51,371
- That's right. Your song. - Right.

1660
00:54:51,971 --> 00:54:53,900
Let's go. We have to go.

1661
00:54:54,141 --> 00:54:55,141
Let's come back later.

1662
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:57,209
- Thank you for letting us browse.
- Thank you.

1663
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,710
(They head to the restaurant again.)

1664
00:54:58,940 --> 00:55:00,341
- Right turn. - It's tasty.

1665
00:55:01,241 --> 00:55:02,810
We came down this way earlier.

1666
00:55:03,911 --> 00:55:05,011
I'm accurate, aren't I?

1667
00:55:05,181 --> 00:55:06,649
- You don't disappoint. - No.

1668
00:55:06,650 --> 00:55:07,856
Seoul Institute of the
Arts doesn't disappoint.

1669
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,749
I definitely know the old city center well.

1670
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:10,820
(It's true that he knows
the old city center well.)

1671
00:55:10,821 --> 00:55:13,060
From Suyu-dong to Myeong-dong.

1672
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:14,220
You're accurate.

1673
00:55:14,221 --> 00:55:16,730
- You like it, don't you?
- Yes, I know it well.

1674
00:55:17,630 --> 00:55:20,031
- Gaehwa. That's over there.
- Sandong Gyoja.

1675
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,971
My mom goes to Gaehwa
to have jjajangmyeon.

1676
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,370
- Here? - Yes.

1677
00:55:24,371 --> 00:55:25,470
(His whole family loves good food.)

1678
00:55:25,471 --> 00:55:27,971
I prefer this restaurant because
they have a second floor.

1679
00:55:28,071 --> 00:55:30,240
I'm not sure if we'll
be able to shoot inside.

1680
00:55:30,241 --> 00:55:31,710
- Okay, let's see. - Should we...

1681
00:55:32,141 --> 00:55:33,809
They go on break at 3:30pm.

1682
00:55:33,810 --> 00:55:35,510
- They have empty tables. - Yes, they have.

1683
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:37,011
- Let's ask them. - Hello.

1684
00:55:37,181 --> 00:55:38,850
- Hello. - Would it be okay...

1685
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:41,019
- to film ourselves... - Hello.

1686
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:43,091
While we eat here?

1687
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:44,720
- Yes, of course. - Is it okay?

1688
00:55:44,721 --> 00:55:46,120
- Thank you. - Just us.

1689
00:55:46,121 --> 00:55:47,689
- She gave us her consent. - Nice.

1690
00:55:47,690 --> 00:55:48,789
- Thank you. - I came...

1691
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,289
- I know you. - I see.

1692
00:55:50,290 --> 00:55:51,410
- We've met. - That's right.

1693
00:55:51,591 --> 00:55:53,160
- Hello. - Go straight inside.

1694
00:55:53,161 --> 00:55:54,860
- If there are seats upstairs...
- There are.

1695
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:55,955
Then we'll go upstairs.

1696
00:55:56,371 --> 00:55:57,629
Take your shoes off.

1697
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,200
- Okay, we will.
- We have to take our shoes off?

1698
00:55:59,201 --> 00:56:00,539
I don't want to inconvenience you.

1699
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:01,769
- Let me take a look first.
- Watch your head.

1700
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,310
- That's right. - It's nice up here.

1701
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,511
It looks nice.

1702
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:05,940
- I love it. - Have a seat.

1703
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,080
I love it.

1704
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:09,550
- It's cozy. - Yes.

1705
00:56:09,551 --> 00:56:11,080
- I love it. - It's really nice.

1706
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:14,550
I often ate at restaurants like
this when I was in university.

1707
00:56:14,551 --> 00:56:16,690
What is this restaurant known for?

1708
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:18,491
- Dumplings. - Dumplings?

1709
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,390
Chive japchae.

1710
00:56:20,391 --> 00:56:21,930
Their five-spice pork is popular.

1711
00:56:21,931 --> 00:56:23,229
Let's have the five-spice pork.

1712
00:56:23,230 --> 00:56:24,959
But it says the chive
japchae is a winter special.

1713
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,600
Let's try it. I've never had it before.

1714
00:56:26,701 --> 00:56:29,499
- Can we have a five-spice pork, - Yes.

1715
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:31,470
- a chive japchae, - Yes.

1716
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:33,400
- and fried dumplings. - Yes.

1717
00:56:33,571 --> 00:56:35,709
- That's enough for now.
- We have different sizes.

1718
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,039
- What about fried rice? - The small one.

1719
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,241
I think the chives would
be tasty with fried rice.

1720
00:56:39,841 --> 00:56:42,010
You should try the
jjamppong since you love it.

1721
00:56:42,011 --> 00:56:43,080
- Right? - Yes.

1722
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,110
- Can we also have... - Diet coke.

1723
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:46,979
- a fried rice... - Okay.

1724
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:49,520
- and a jjamppong? - Okay.

1725
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,419
What does chive japchae look like?

1726
00:56:51,420 --> 00:56:52,789
Is it japchae...

1727
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:54,789
- It has chopped chives.
- With a lot of chives?

1728
00:56:54,790 --> 00:56:56,490
That's why I ordered the fried rice.

1729
00:56:56,491 --> 00:56:57,790
To have with the chive japchae.

1730
00:56:57,891 --> 00:56:59,899
(All he can think about
is the chive japchae.)

1731
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:02,430
There aren't many restaurants
where you can sit like this.

1732
00:57:02,431 --> 00:57:03,431
No, there aren't.

1733
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:06,371
"Slow focusing" is a good
phrase I came up with.

1734
00:57:09,511 --> 00:57:11,840
Everyone has an issue with focusing.

1735
00:57:11,841 --> 00:57:14,680
("Slow focusing" sounds
less harsh than hyperopia.)

1736
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:17,880
"Slow focusing" is acceptable, right?

1737
00:57:18,181 --> 00:57:19,321
I like it.

1738
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,821
- This is the five-spice pork?
- Yes, it is.

1739
00:57:22,951 --> 00:57:24,121
Thank you.

1740
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:26,419
This is tasty.

1741
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,661
- It is? - Yes.

1742
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,959
I rarely order five-spice pork.

1743
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,960
People rarely order it.

1744
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,899
But everyone orders it when they come here.

1745
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,059
- The five-spice pork? - Yes.

1746
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,970
- Is it the restaurant's...
- It's their signature dish.

1747
00:57:36,971 --> 00:57:38,701
- That's right. - These are century eggs.

1748
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,241
- I see. - It looks tasty.

1749
00:57:40,341 --> 00:57:43,309
It's similar to chilled jokbal.

1750
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:44,510
Yes, it is.

1751
00:57:44,511 --> 00:57:47,440
When the old lady in Jangchung-dong...

1752
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,010
first made jokbal,

1753
00:57:50,011 --> 00:57:52,691
- she thought of five-spice pork.
- She thought of five-spice pork?

1754
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,149
- She did? - The jokbal we eat...

1755
00:57:54,150 --> 00:57:56,190
- isn't an old dish. - Jokbal?

1756
00:57:56,920 --> 00:57:58,289
Are you on "The Dictionary
of Useless Knowledge?"

1757
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:00,861
No, it's because he brought it up.

1758
00:58:01,321 --> 00:58:03,007
- I'm sorry.
- I thought it was a different show.

1759
00:58:03,031 --> 00:58:05,430
(Whenever possible,
open Juck's dictionary.)

1760
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:06,559
I'm sorry.

1761
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,899
- But it's true.
- I should've tripped while coming.

1762
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,200
Jae Suk likes things like that.

1763
00:58:10,201 --> 00:58:12,399
Juck came on the show
because he wanted to talk.

1764
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,871
- We were talking about this.
- You know what?

1765
00:58:15,341 --> 00:58:17,910
Not many people in Korea
can speak to Juck like that.

1766
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:19,079
(These two can.)

1767
00:58:19,080 --> 00:58:20,210
- It's tasty. - Yes, it is.

1768
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:21,840
It's tasty.

1769
00:58:21,841 --> 00:58:23,401
(They finally try the five-spice pork.)

1770
00:58:24,411 --> 00:58:25,480
(Marveling)

1771
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:28,920
- Hey. It's tasty. - Right?

1772
00:58:29,051 --> 00:58:30,190
This...

1773
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,790
- It's tasty. - Yes, it is.

1774
00:58:34,661 --> 00:58:37,960
If you take a close look at Jae Suk,

1775
00:58:38,230 --> 00:58:40,700
you'll realize he rarely
eats different foods together.

1776
00:58:40,701 --> 00:58:43,099
No, he doesn't. He has the palate of a kid.

1777
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:44,599
- You're right. - I wondered why.

1778
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,080
It turns out his mother made
wraps for him when he was little.

1779
00:58:48,571 --> 00:58:49,710
Since he's an only child.

1780
00:58:50,210 --> 00:58:52,910
We went to have Vietnamese
spring rolls, but he didn't eat it.

1781
00:58:52,911 --> 00:58:55,071
He doesn't seem like someone
born and raised in Seoul.

1782
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:56,450
You rarely eat crab, right?

1783
00:58:56,451 --> 00:58:58,091
- No, I rarely eat it. - Do you know why?

1784
00:58:58,150 --> 00:58:59,990
Because his mother
used to deshell it for him.

1785
00:59:00,051 --> 00:59:01,479
I don't like food that
is inconvenient to eat.

1786
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,451
(He just doesn't like inconvenient things.)

1787
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,067
- Here is our food. - This is really tasty.

1788
00:59:06,091 --> 00:59:08,091
- Here are your dumplings. - Thank you.

1789
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:10,031
- They have good food. - Yes.

1790
00:59:10,431 --> 00:59:11,531
They're classic dumplings.

1791
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:13,330
It must be hot, right?

1792
00:59:15,701 --> 00:59:18,229
It isn't a special shape.

1793
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:19,440
It looks ordinary.

1794
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,141
The elders...

1795
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:23,911
used to have it with drinks.

1796
00:59:24,641 --> 00:59:26,379
- They did? - It's a unique taste.

1797
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:28,709
- It's so crispy. - Yes, it is.

1798
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:29,911
- The dumplings. - It's tasty.

1799
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:33,520
I think we should order another one.

1800
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:36,790
It's tasty because of the filling.

1801
00:59:37,420 --> 00:59:39,019
It's crisp on the outside
and soft on the inside.

1802
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,690
- Right. - You're absolutely right.

1803
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:44,060
- Gosh. This is perfect. - It's tasty.

1804
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:47,760
We weren't able to order dishes
like this when we were young.

1805
00:59:47,761 --> 00:59:49,770
I watched "Fairy Jae Hyung,"

1806
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:52,840
- and he cooked everything.
- He's a good cook.

1807
00:59:52,841 --> 00:59:54,841
- He's a good cook. - He's a good cook.

1808
00:59:55,071 --> 00:59:57,870
Did you study at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris?

1809
00:59:57,871 --> 00:59:59,180
- No, not at all. - No?

1810
00:59:59,181 --> 01:00:00,911
When I was young,

1811
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,349
blogging was popular.

1812
01:00:03,350 --> 01:00:07,080
And foreign students cooking was popular.

1813
01:00:07,121 --> 01:00:08,850
Let me tell you what happened.

1814
01:00:09,121 --> 01:00:12,390
- I had psoriasis at the time. - I see.

1815
01:00:12,391 --> 01:00:15,930
I went to see a dermatologist
when it first happened.

1816
01:00:15,931 --> 01:00:19,099
The dermatologist asked
me to tell them my diet.

1817
01:00:19,100 --> 01:00:20,700
You had to cut out certain foods?

1818
01:00:20,701 --> 01:00:24,769
I told the dermatologist
that I usually bought steak...

1819
01:00:24,770 --> 01:00:27,900
and had it with rice.

1820
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,140
The dermatologist asked how
my body would endure that...

1821
01:00:30,141 --> 01:00:33,241
when I used to have so
many vegetables in Korea.

1822
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:36,510
I was told to add salads to every meal.

1823
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:38,579
Since you needed to have vegetables.

1824
01:00:38,580 --> 01:00:41,221
That's the reason...

1825
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:43,491
- I started cooking. - So that's why.

1826
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:46,440
- It's your jjamppong. - For Bong Won.

1827
01:00:46,991 --> 01:00:48,391
Your jjamppong is here, Bong Won.

1828
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,030
This restaurant seems
to use classical recipes.

1829
01:00:51,031 --> 01:00:52,230
Yes.

1830
01:00:54,701 --> 01:00:56,901
Let's compare it with the
jjamppong of your restaurant.

1831
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:00,870
- Gosh. - People might really think...

1832
01:01:00,871 --> 01:01:02,741
Jae Hyung runs a jjamppong place.

1833
01:01:03,571 --> 01:01:04,971
You should actually run one.

1834
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,681
Call it Fairy Jjamppong.

1835
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:10,380
- Just avoid Cheonan. - That's a good idea.

1836
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:13,470
- Just avoid Cheonan. - That's a good idea.

1837
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,150
It's the white jjamppong from the past.

1838
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:20,789
It's mild, and it isn't strong.

1839
01:01:20,790 --> 01:01:22,430
- Old people can enjoy this too. - Right.

1840
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,830
- It's nice. - Gosh, this is good.

1841
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:33,500
It's mild.

1842
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:36,871
I love good fried rice.

1843
01:01:36,971 --> 01:01:38,410
Right. We have to have this.

1844
01:01:38,411 --> 01:01:39,840
(The fried rice and egg
soup are served next.)

1845
01:01:39,841 --> 01:01:42,040
- The egg soup. Yes! - It's on the house.

1846
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,580
What's amazing about this is that
it was made with just egg whites.

1847
01:01:45,681 --> 01:01:47,079
Right. It was made with just egg whites.

1848
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:48,520
- It's really clean. - Gosh.

1849
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,350
This is how Chinese food should be done.

1850
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:53,321
- This is just like ulmyeon. - Right!

1851
01:01:53,891 --> 01:01:55,459
- You're exactly right.
- What's the perfect song for that?

1852
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,931
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

1853
01:01:57,431 --> 01:01:59,801
(You better watch out, you better not cry)

1854
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:02,200
I didn't like that shout.

1855
01:02:02,201 --> 01:02:03,669
- Will you edit that out? - What?

1856
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:04,990
- Which one? - I just went, "Ha!"

1857
01:02:06,801 --> 01:02:08,399
No one really does that these days.

1858
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,040
(He's used to making middle-aged shouts.)

1859
01:02:10,141 --> 01:02:12,580
Thank you. It's served
with the flower buns.

1860
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,470
- Right.
- It's served with the flower buns.

1861
01:02:15,281 --> 01:02:16,379
This is a winter delicacy.

1862
01:02:16,380 --> 01:02:17,710
- Gosh. - Make a wrap with this.

1863
01:02:18,681 --> 01:02:19,780
Use the utensils.

1864
01:02:19,781 --> 01:02:20,951
- What? - This is amazing.

1865
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:23,491
This is a japchae made with just chives.

1866
01:02:24,051 --> 01:02:26,360
- There are no glass noodles.
- I was expecting them.

1867
01:02:26,361 --> 01:02:28,260
- Right. - It's made to have with rice.

1868
01:02:28,261 --> 01:02:31,091
Chili japchae and chive japchae
both don't have glass noodles.

1869
01:02:31,431 --> 01:02:34,400
- Only with japchae rice...
- I guess that's right.

1870
01:02:34,801 --> 01:02:36,400
Chive japchae only uses chives.

1871
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:38,669
You sound very disappointed.

1872
01:02:38,670 --> 01:02:40,840
- I'm really disappointed.
- Because there are no noodles?

1873
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:43,309
This isn't made to be
eaten with fried rice.

1874
01:02:43,310 --> 01:02:44,340
Can glass noodles be added?

1875
01:02:44,341 --> 01:02:45,611
(He still tries a bite.)

1876
01:02:46,580 --> 01:02:47,681
It's good though.

1877
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:49,450
It's delicious.

1878
01:02:49,451 --> 01:02:50,849
(His disappointment disappears right away.)

1879
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:51,951
It's amazing.

1880
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:57,520
(When it's eaten with the flower
bun instead of the fried rice...)

1881
01:02:58,321 --> 01:02:59,391
It's amazing.

1882
01:03:00,221 --> 01:03:02,301
This is a perfect dish to
have with Kaoliang liquor.

1883
01:03:03,491 --> 01:03:04,491
(Amazed)

1884
01:03:04,630 --> 01:03:07,801
This place...

1885
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:09,770
has a classical taste.

1886
01:03:10,130 --> 01:03:13,570
I think there will be a lot of
elders that will come from afar...

1887
01:03:13,571 --> 01:03:15,670
as they are reminded of this taste.

1888
01:03:18,040 --> 01:03:19,840
- Here you are. - Gosh.

1889
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:21,910
The owner said this was on the house.

1890
01:03:21,911 --> 01:03:23,349
- Really? - It's jjajangmyeon?

1891
01:03:23,350 --> 01:03:24,950
- Just for Jae Suk? - Gosh.

1892
01:03:24,951 --> 01:03:26,919
- Oh, right. - Should he eat it?

1893
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,856
How did the owner know that
I wanted some jjajangmyeon?

1894
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:30,450
He wanted some noodles...

1895
01:03:30,451 --> 01:03:32,097
- as there were no glass noodles.
- How did the owner know?

1896
01:03:32,121 --> 01:03:33,221
The owner must hear us.

1897
01:03:33,891 --> 01:03:35,591
- It has a lot of ingredients. - Gosh.

1898
01:03:36,591 --> 01:03:38,189
I must have this. Look at this.

1899
01:03:38,190 --> 01:03:39,830
(It's nice and glossy.)

1900
01:03:40,661 --> 01:03:42,500
(Gulping)

1901
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:45,500
Would you like some?

1902
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:47,341
- Yes. - Right.

1903
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,900
- Did you feel it? - Yes.

1904
01:03:49,011 --> 01:03:51,209
- You should all try some.
- You should eat first.

1905
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:52,911
- You should take some first. - Okay.

1906
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:54,660
- Go ahead. I'll have this first. - Right.

1907
01:03:55,341 --> 01:03:56,809
It already looks good.

1908
01:03:56,810 --> 01:03:59,180
(The gan jjajang gets shared reverently.)

1909
01:03:59,181 --> 01:04:00,250
Thank you.

1910
01:04:06,190 --> 01:04:08,221
Let's give this a try.

1911
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,559
- Isn't that right? - What?

1912
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,769
It's good.

1913
01:04:16,770 --> 01:04:18,500
- The jjajangmyeon is amazing. - Right.

1914
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:24,111
(Delighted)

1915
01:04:26,241 --> 01:04:31,011
(Entranced)

1916
01:04:31,551 --> 01:04:33,721
- I also thought the same thing. - Right.

1917
01:04:34,181 --> 01:04:35,181
(Satisfied)

1918
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:37,250
It's good.

1919
01:04:39,491 --> 01:04:40,861
It isn't too strong.

1920
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:44,789
I like that it doesn't taste strong.

1921
01:04:44,790 --> 01:04:46,430
It's good that it doesn't taste strong.

1922
01:04:46,431 --> 01:04:48,160
- These two jjajangs are different.
- It's nice and mild.

1923
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:49,700
- This one is gan jjajang. - Right.

1924
01:04:49,701 --> 01:04:50,947
- Right. - That one is regular jjajang.

1925
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,470
- The jjajang is great.
- Thank you, Yeon Seok.

1926
01:04:52,471 --> 01:04:53,770
- That one was boiled. - Right.

1927
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:56,310
Gosh.

1928
01:04:57,511 --> 01:04:58,770
It tastes amazing.

1929
01:05:00,781 --> 01:05:02,810
(Greatly satisfied)

1930
01:05:03,650 --> 01:05:06,280
The jjajang isn't just any kind of jjajang.

1931
01:05:06,281 --> 01:05:08,121
- I like that it isn't strong. - Right.

1932
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:10,290
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

1933
01:05:11,491 --> 01:05:12,790
What game should we play?

1934
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:14,491
What game should we play?

1935
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:16,129
The loser has to pay.

1936
01:05:16,130 --> 01:05:18,411
- It's to choose who pays?
- At the Chinese restaurant...

1937
01:05:18,761 --> 01:05:20,931
I'll pay for this. I'm the oldest here.

1938
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:22,769
- I can pay for it.
- No. That is no fun then.

1939
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,830
All of us can afford this.

1940
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:27,870
(Laughing)

1941
01:05:27,871 --> 01:05:29,511
- I think you're... - I'm sorry!

1942
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:31,910
I think you're 3rd or 4th here.

1943
01:05:31,911 --> 01:05:34,411
No.

1944
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,180
- I can't even be in third place. - Hey.

1945
01:05:36,181 --> 01:05:38,710
No. I can't even be in third place.

1946
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:40,221
I'll just get treated.

1947
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,349
- I'm sorry. - What are you talking about?

1948
01:05:42,350 --> 01:05:44,030
- Why are you bringing me down? - Come on!

1949
01:05:44,150 --> 01:05:46,110
You're 3rd or 4th when
it comes to looks as well.

1950
01:05:46,161 --> 01:05:47,189
(Feeling hurt)

1951
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,320
You're 3rd or 4th with everything.

1952
01:05:48,321 --> 01:05:50,559
You're unbelievable. I'm
second when it comes to looks.

1953
01:05:50,560 --> 01:05:51,967
- You're fourth.
- I'm right after Yeon Seok.

1954
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:53,229
Just stop, Jae Hyung.

1955
01:05:53,230 --> 01:05:54,660
Gosh.

1956
01:05:54,661 --> 01:05:55,829
(The fight for their
places was meaningless.)

1957
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:57,100
That was annoying.

1958
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,870
- A while ago, - Who wants the jjamppong?

1959
01:05:59,871 --> 01:06:01,900
Someone said I had good-looking features.

1960
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:04,471
Who am I talking to about
my good-looking features?

1961
01:06:04,571 --> 01:06:05,710
Gosh.

1962
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:07,611
It had been a while since I heard that.

1963
01:06:07,741 --> 01:06:09,781
It means you have
good-looking features separately.

1964
01:06:10,250 --> 01:06:11,450
What game should we play?

1965
01:06:11,451 --> 01:06:13,281
- How does this sound? - I'm so full.

1966
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:15,419
There are cups over there.

1967
01:06:15,420 --> 01:06:17,620
We'll fill a glass with water.

1968
01:06:17,621 --> 01:06:18,849
- Just one? - Right.

1969
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:20,570
Should the other cups have vinegar in them?

1970
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,661
We have to drink them?

1971
01:06:22,830 --> 01:06:24,160
They'll all look like glasses of water.

1972
01:06:24,161 --> 01:06:26,099
- Hey! - It has to be downed.

1973
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:28,100
Let's play the game of luck.

1974
01:06:28,261 --> 01:06:29,899
Let's add some vinegar
to one glass of water.

1975
01:06:29,900 --> 01:06:31,070
- Just a little bit? - Right.

1976
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:32,200
We shouldn't look.

1977
01:06:32,201 --> 01:06:33,841
Right. We shouldn't look.

1978
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:35,741
It'll be hard to tell anyway.

1979
01:06:36,170 --> 01:06:37,841
- So... - Do it from a distance.

1980
01:06:38,011 --> 01:06:39,540
How much vinegar did you add?

1981
01:06:39,781 --> 01:06:40,941
- It's half and half. - Gosh.

1982
01:06:41,111 --> 01:06:43,451
- Really? It's half and half?
- It's half and half?

1983
01:06:43,611 --> 01:06:44,879
If you spit it out, you
can just pay for the meal.

1984
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,019
- Right. - Right.

1985
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:47,550
If we all manage to drink
it, we'll do another round.

1986
01:06:47,551 --> 01:06:48,551
- Right. - Right.

1987
01:06:48,552 --> 01:06:50,090
- This is amazing. - If you frown,

1988
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:51,091
- you'll get caught. - Right.
All right.

1989
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:54,420
- Jae Hyung should go first.
- Elders first.

1990
01:06:54,421 --> 01:06:55,421
(It's time to decide.)

1991
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:56,990
- The 2nd cup. - The 2nd cup.

1992
01:06:56,991 --> 01:06:58,229
- The 2nd cup from the right.
- The 2nd cup from the right.

1993
01:06:58,230 --> 01:06:59,800
- Okay. - That one is the first cup.

1994
01:07:00,131 --> 01:07:01,131
This one?

1995
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,171
It's heavy.

1996
01:07:04,501 --> 01:07:05,571
It's you next, Jae Suk.

1997
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,000
Gosh. I'll go with the third cup.

1998
01:07:08,001 --> 01:07:09,411
- This one? - Yes.

1999
01:07:10,111 --> 01:07:11,570
Then it's me and Yeon Seok left.

2000
01:07:11,571 --> 01:07:12,810
All right.

2001
01:07:13,111 --> 01:07:15,139
- Should we switch them up?
- Switch them up?

2002
01:07:15,140 --> 01:07:16,910
Then I'll take that one.

2003
01:07:16,911 --> 01:07:18,151
- Okay. - You'll take that one.

2004
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,480
We'll switch them.

2005
01:07:20,751 --> 01:07:22,420
- Let's clink our cups.
- It's the poisoned cup.

2006
01:07:22,421 --> 01:07:23,650
Let's clink our cups.

2007
01:07:23,890 --> 01:07:25,219
Gosh, the cups have been switched.

2008
01:07:25,220 --> 01:07:26,660
You have to down it even if it's water.

2009
01:07:26,661 --> 01:07:27,719
- Right. - You have to down it.

2010
01:07:27,720 --> 01:07:30,131
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

2011
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:52,650
(Screaming)

2012
01:07:53,921 --> 01:07:55,049
(He is the one with the vinegar water.)

2013
01:07:55,050 --> 01:07:56,420
- Yeon Seok will pay for us again. - Hey!

2014
01:07:56,421 --> 01:07:57,981
You two switched cups right at the end!

2015
01:07:58,590 --> 01:07:59,860
That was the game changer.

2016
01:07:59,861 --> 01:08:01,719
Doesn't Yeon Seok always pay?

2017
01:08:01,720 --> 01:08:02,730
That was what I was told.

2018
01:08:02,930 --> 01:08:04,531
Oh, no.

2019
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,760
You have really come into
the world of variety shows.

2020
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,500
- He's the chosen one. - Gosh.

2021
01:08:09,501 --> 01:08:10,830
You're doing so well.

2022
01:08:10,831 --> 01:08:12,330
- That's my boy. - There you go.

2023
01:08:12,331 --> 01:08:15,370
- There you go. - There you go.

2024
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:17,509
(The sour taste of variety shows)

2025
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,081
Did you fill half of it with vinegar?

2026
01:08:21,281 --> 01:08:22,781
I was going to endure it.

2027
01:08:23,010 --> 01:08:24,510
Look at him tearing up.

2028
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:25,850
(Tearing up)

2029
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:28,531
Are you sure that was half of
it? It felt like it was just vinegar.

2030
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:30,120
It was just vinegar.

2031
01:08:30,121 --> 01:08:32,661
- Have some water.
- Well, vinegar is good for you.

2032
01:08:32,760 --> 01:08:34,390
Your body will become flexible.

2033
01:08:34,461 --> 01:08:35,559
That's why you're Flexible Seok.

2034
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:37,290
- I can't get any more flexible.
- Your body will become flexible.

2035
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:38,937
- That's why you're Flexible Seok. - Gosh.

2036
01:08:38,961 --> 01:08:41,201
- That's why you're Flexible Seok.
- That was hilarious.

2037
01:08:41,501 --> 01:08:43,501
Let's get going now.

2038
01:08:43,631 --> 01:08:44,730
- Right away? - Yes.

2039
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:46,470
You can be the last one out, Yeon Seok.

2040
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:49,309
Right. The youngest will be paying.

2041
01:08:49,310 --> 01:08:51,371
- Thank you, Yeon Seok.
- I love you, Yeon Seok.

2042
01:08:52,041 --> 01:08:53,281
Ahn Yeon Seok.

2043
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,810
- Gosh, Yeon Seok.
- Did you all enjoy the food?

2044
01:08:57,111 --> 01:08:58,411
I really did.

2045
01:09:00,121 --> 01:09:01,549
Being treated to jjajangmyeon
by someone else is amazing.

2046
01:09:01,550 --> 01:09:03,990
Why did I have to pay when
they're all older than me?

2047
01:09:03,991 --> 01:09:05,050
(Satisfied eyes)

2048
01:09:05,390 --> 01:09:06,689
Thank you.

2049
01:09:06,690 --> 01:09:07,821
- Goodbye. - Thank you.

2050
01:09:09,291 --> 01:09:10,390
It's Baek Ju Won.

2051
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,559
"When Christmas comes,
a lot of people come..."

2052
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,430
"to listen to our voices."

2053
01:09:16,331 --> 01:09:18,229
"After practicing hard with my friends,"

2054
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,600
"we play with paper planes,"

2055
01:09:20,741 --> 01:09:22,821
"read books, and talk about
games during our break."

2056
01:09:22,911 --> 01:09:25,871
"Please come and play
with us, Uncle Jae Suk."

2057
01:09:26,541 --> 01:09:27,679
- "Uncle Jae Suk?" - "Uncle Jae Suk?"

2058
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,200
- It must be a child. - Is it a child?

2059
01:09:29,411 --> 01:09:30,650
Is it a choir?

2060
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:32,150
A choir?

2061
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,880
- A children's choir? - That makes sense.

2062
01:09:34,881 --> 01:09:37,019
- That's what I think.
- Myeongdong Cathedral is here.

2063
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:38,520
- Right. - It could be a choir.

2064
01:09:38,720 --> 01:09:39,960
It actually is Myeongdong Cathedral.

2065
01:09:39,961 --> 01:09:41,690
- We can get there right away. - Really?

2066
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:44,460
You know the way to
Myeongdong Cathedral, right?

2067
01:09:44,461 --> 01:09:46,501
Of course. It's right
there after we take a right.

2068
01:09:47,031 --> 01:09:49,770
- Right.
- I thought it was an actual elder.

2069
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:52,091
- Hello.
- I thought it was an actual elder.

2070
01:09:52,201 --> 01:09:53,670
- Hello. - I was so surprised.

2071
01:09:53,671 --> 01:09:55,100
Isn't he suffering too much?

2072
01:09:56,171 --> 01:09:58,509
I was wondering why he was out in the cold.

2073
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:00,257
(Old Santa is passionate
even in the cold weather.)

2074
01:10:00,281 --> 01:10:01,639
I think it's the first time
I've seen Santa this year.

2075
01:10:01,640 --> 01:10:03,411
- Right. - Gosh.

2076
01:10:03,611 --> 01:10:05,910
It definitely feels like Christmas...

2077
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:07,820
- in Myeong-dong. - Right.

2078
01:10:07,821 --> 01:10:08,880
- Yeon Seok. - Yes?

2079
01:10:08,881 --> 01:10:10,089
This is why you have to
come to the old city center.

2080
01:10:10,090 --> 01:10:11,250
It feels like Christmas here.

2081
01:10:11,491 --> 01:10:12,990
- Why do I feel excited? - Look at that.

2082
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,389
I'm feeling excited as it's
the Christmas special...

2083
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:16,460
out in Myeong-dong.

2084
01:10:16,461 --> 01:10:18,190
Look at all the decorations.

2085
01:10:18,461 --> 01:10:19,977
- Everything is decorated. - The tree.

2086
01:10:20,001 --> 01:10:22,300
Christmas trees are
hard to find these days.

2087
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:24,001
- You're right. - Yes.

2088
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:25,700
People tend not to make Christmas trees.

2089
01:10:25,831 --> 01:10:27,740
It was my dream to come here...

2090
01:10:27,741 --> 01:10:30,309
for the year-end and Christmas.

2091
01:10:30,310 --> 01:10:32,741
- You can hear the music playing. - Right.

2092
01:10:32,980 --> 01:10:34,380
- Hello. - Hello.

2093
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:35,839
The Salvation Army is still around.

2094
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,880
- There are a lot of them. - Jae Suk.

2095
01:10:37,881 --> 01:10:40,150
When they are around...

2096
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:44,050
- Hold on. I don't have any cash.
- I don't have any cash.

2097
01:10:44,451 --> 01:10:45,791
If you do...

2098
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,961
This is for the four of us.

2099
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:51,259
- Thank you. - Bye.

2100
01:10:51,260 --> 01:10:53,200
- There you go. - Gosh.

2101
01:10:53,201 --> 01:10:56,071
- Well done. - Well done.

2102
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:58,370
- I paid for the four of us. - Well done.

2103
01:10:58,371 --> 01:11:00,001
- Thank you. - It's fine.

2104
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,171
Juck had some cash with him.

2105
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,910
All right. So this is Myeongdong Cathedral.

2106
01:11:05,911 --> 01:11:07,110
Right. It's here.

2107
01:11:07,111 --> 01:11:08,580
We have to get to the first
floor of the Beomugwan.

2108
01:11:08,581 --> 01:11:10,111
- Where? - The Beomugwan.

2109
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:11,710
Beomugwan.

2110
01:11:11,711 --> 01:11:13,080
(Second spare time spot,
Myeongdong Cathedral)

2111
01:11:13,081 --> 01:11:14,357
It's been a while since I came here.

2112
01:11:14,381 --> 01:11:16,020
The buildings look antique.

2113
01:11:17,150 --> 01:11:18,390
Gosh!

2114
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:22,689
Myeongdong Cathedral
has a great history as well.

2115
01:11:22,690 --> 01:11:23,759
Right.

2116
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:25,600
(What kind of spare
time will they find here?)

2117
01:11:26,661 --> 01:11:27,960
I found the Beomugwan.

2118
01:11:27,961 --> 01:11:29,770
- Did you find it? - It's right here.

2119
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,670
- It's that one. - It's that building.

2120
01:11:31,671 --> 01:11:32,730
The smaller building.

2121
01:11:34,270 --> 01:11:35,700
I see.

2122
01:11:35,701 --> 01:11:37,139
The Beomugwan and Training Center.

2123
01:11:37,140 --> 01:11:38,620
The practice room on the first floor?

2124
01:11:38,671 --> 01:11:41,351
- Practice room on the first floor.
- It must be a place for music.

2125
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:43,649
I think I hear sounds.

2126
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,581
- Really? I hear them too. - Really?

2127
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:47,519
I can hear sounds from downstairs.

2128
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,850
- Right. - Hold on.

2129
01:11:48,951 --> 01:11:50,689
They are the voices of children.

2130
01:11:50,690 --> 01:11:51,690
- Really? - Right.

2131
01:11:51,850 --> 01:11:55,260
But if we aren't able to get
presents for the children...

2132
01:11:55,621 --> 01:11:58,360
- That can't happen.
- That can't happen. What do we do?

2133
01:11:58,361 --> 01:11:59,460
(They are already feeling pressured.)

2134
01:11:59,461 --> 01:12:00,559
- This is it. - This must be it.

2135
01:12:00,560 --> 01:12:02,930
"Musica Sacra Boys Choir."

2136
01:12:03,171 --> 01:12:05,171
- This is it. - They are children.

2137
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:08,541
The boys choir of sacred music.

2138
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,170
- Let's go inside.
- We must take off our shoes.

2139
01:12:10,171 --> 01:12:11,610
It's Mr. Yoo Jae Suk!

2140
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:12,671
Hi!

2141
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:14,340
(Screaming)

2142
01:12:14,541 --> 01:12:16,021
- It's Mr. Yoo Jae Suk. - Hey, there.

2143
01:12:16,451 --> 01:12:17,679
- It's great to see you. - Hello!

2144
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:18,680
It's Mr. Yoo Jae Suk!

2145
01:12:18,681 --> 01:12:20,049
- Hello. - "It's Mr. Yoo Jae Suk!"

2146
01:12:20,050 --> 01:12:21,350
- Hello! - Gosh!

2147
01:12:21,581 --> 01:12:22,820
I'm actually seeing him in person!

2148
01:12:22,821 --> 01:12:24,250
Is Baek Ju Won here?

2149
01:12:24,251 --> 01:12:25,420
- It's me! - Ju Won!

2150
01:12:25,421 --> 01:12:26,490
- Ju Won is right here. - He's here.

2151
01:12:26,491 --> 01:12:27,520
Hi!

2152
01:12:27,991 --> 01:12:30,229
(Baek Ju Won, the second Whenever Guest)

2153
01:12:30,230 --> 01:12:32,130
- Hi, Ju Won. - Hello.

2154
01:12:32,131 --> 01:12:33,131
Hello.

2155
01:12:33,132 --> 01:12:34,700
So you're Ju Won. You sent in your letter?

2156
01:12:34,701 --> 01:12:36,671
- Yes. Hello. - Hello.

2157
01:12:36,730 --> 01:12:38,031
Welcome.

2158
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:41,541
What do you do here?

2159
01:12:41,741 --> 01:12:43,339
- It's a place to sing.
- A place to practice.

2160
01:12:43,340 --> 01:12:45,171
- A place to practice? - Yes.

2161
01:12:45,270 --> 01:12:47,639
This is the practice room of Musica Sacra,

2162
01:12:47,640 --> 01:12:51,110
the boys choir that belongs
to Myeongdong Cathedral.

2163
01:12:51,111 --> 01:12:53,421
- I see. - Gosh.

2164
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:55,019
Are you a choir?

2165
01:12:55,020 --> 01:12:56,121
- Yes. - Yes.

2166
01:12:56,720 --> 01:12:57,849
A boys choir.

2167
01:12:57,850 --> 01:12:59,389
- There's a picture right there. - Right.

2168
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:00,690
- Musica Sacra. - Musica Sacra.

2169
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:09,060
(The boys choir that belongs
to Myeongdong Cathedral)

2170
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:14,099
(A boys choir...)

2171
01:13:14,100 --> 01:13:18,711
(that has a long history
of around 40 years)

2172
01:13:20,810 --> 01:13:25,281
(Singing passionately
even in the cold winter)

2173
01:13:27,421 --> 01:13:30,491
(Ju Won, the Whenever Guest)

2174
01:13:32,251 --> 01:13:35,389
(What will the spare time
of the boys choir look like?)

2175
01:13:35,390 --> 01:13:36,890
Shall we talk while being seated?

2176
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:40,160
(Excited)

2177
01:13:40,161 --> 01:13:41,960
Did you guys wear those
since we were coming?

2178
01:13:41,961 --> 01:13:43,200
- No. - No.

2179
01:13:43,201 --> 01:13:45,299
- We wear this during practice.
- We have practice today.

2180
01:13:45,300 --> 01:13:47,339
- Right. - I see.

2181
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:49,099
You all must've gone to school today.

2182
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,410
- Yes. - Yes.

2183
01:13:50,411 --> 01:13:52,110
So you're here for practice after school.

2184
01:13:52,111 --> 01:13:54,680
Yes. We have practice in the evenings.

2185
01:13:54,911 --> 01:13:58,010
It would be great if you could
play with us before practice.

2186
01:13:58,251 --> 01:14:00,381
- I see. - He sent in the letter.

2187
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:02,420
- Right. Ju Won sent in the letter.
- That's impressive, Ju Won.

2188
01:14:02,421 --> 01:14:03,421
(Feeling proud)

2189
01:14:03,621 --> 01:14:05,589
You all must know Uncle Jae Suk.

2190
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:07,460
- Yes. - These two.

2191
01:14:07,461 --> 01:14:08,820
- Do you know these two?
- Do you know them?

2192
01:14:08,821 --> 01:14:10,560
Yes. They look really familiar.

2193
01:14:11,331 --> 01:14:12,730
What do you think he does?

2194
01:14:13,560 --> 01:14:15,030
- He plays the piano! - Piano!

2195
01:14:15,031 --> 01:14:16,100
- Piano? - You're right.

2196
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:18,700
(He looks like a pianist
even to the children.)

2197
01:14:18,701 --> 01:14:20,100
What about Uncle Lee Juck?

2198
01:14:20,371 --> 01:14:21,799
- You don't know me, right? - They don't.

2199
01:14:21,800 --> 01:14:24,139
I saw someone similar.

2200
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:25,140
Where?

2201
01:14:25,141 --> 01:14:27,280
The person who makes things with Lego.

2202
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:30,479
- Lego? - Right.

2203
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:32,549
- I love Lego. - He makes things with Lego?

2204
01:14:32,550 --> 01:14:34,519
He makes things with Lego?

2205
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,150
The scientist?

2206
01:14:36,590 --> 01:14:39,291
What grade are you all in?

2207
01:14:39,421 --> 01:14:41,889
- I'm in 4th grade. - You're in 4th grade?

2208
01:14:41,890 --> 01:14:43,429
- Me, him, - The members here...

2209
01:14:43,430 --> 01:14:44,689
- him, and him. - are in 1st to 4th grade.

2210
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:47,160
Ha Joon and Jae Joon are in fourth grade?

2211
01:14:47,161 --> 01:14:48,300
- Who's Jae Joon? - Se Joon.

2212
01:14:48,531 --> 01:14:51,031
Raise your hand if you are in fourth grade.

2213
01:14:51,531 --> 01:14:53,469
- Third grade. - Third grade.

2214
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:54,769
- Second grade. - Second grade.

2215
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:55,970
He's in second grade.

2216
01:14:56,201 --> 01:14:58,710
He's in second grade, but he's the tallest.

2217
01:14:58,711 --> 01:15:01,139
He's really tall. He's
a head taller than me.

2218
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:02,339
He's a head taller?

2219
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:04,310
- He's taller than me too. - Right.

2220
01:15:04,411 --> 01:15:06,281
But you're two years older, Ha Joon.

2221
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:07,880
You will all grow tall when it's time.

2222
01:15:07,881 --> 01:15:08,881
Right.

2223
01:15:08,951 --> 01:15:10,121
It's true.

2224
01:15:10,550 --> 01:15:14,259
What age must you be to be in this choir?

2225
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:17,290
We can be in 1st grade to 7th grade.

2226
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,090
- Right. - Until seventh grade?

2227
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,300
We have to leave if
our voices start to break.

2228
01:15:21,430 --> 01:15:22,860
Until your voices break?

2229
01:15:22,861 --> 01:15:25,000
- It's like that for choirs. - Right.

2230
01:15:25,001 --> 01:15:26,700
- Right. - Their voices start to break.

2231
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:28,269
- I see. - It starts fairly quickly.

2232
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,041
(Upset)

2233
01:15:30,071 --> 01:15:31,769
As Christmas is coming,

2234
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,509
did you sing carols as well?

2235
01:15:33,510 --> 01:15:36,710
We have a Christmas
performance, but we don't sing carols.

2236
01:15:36,711 --> 01:15:38,380
Didn't we sing carols?

2237
01:15:38,381 --> 01:15:39,610
"Happy Birthday Jesus..."

2238
01:15:39,611 --> 01:15:40,849
- is a carol too.
- We didn't sing that outside.

2239
01:15:40,850 --> 01:15:42,680
- We sang that last year. - We did.

2240
01:15:43,050 --> 01:15:44,866
That wasn't asked for all
of you to get into a fight.

2241
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:46,991
(Laughing)

2242
01:15:47,220 --> 01:15:49,020
I love this.

2243
01:15:49,491 --> 01:15:51,960
What's the best thing
about being in the choir?

2244
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:55,330
The best thing? I can
sing with my friends and...

2245
01:15:55,331 --> 01:15:56,630
- We can play games. - play games.

2246
01:15:56,631 --> 01:15:59,130
- Play games? - Right.

2247
01:15:59,131 --> 01:16:00,339
What about you, Ba Ul? Why
do you like being in the choir?

2248
01:16:00,340 --> 01:16:04,140
Well, if I am to live
until I am 100 years old...

2249
01:16:05,671 --> 01:16:07,080
If I am to live until I am 100 years old,

2250
01:16:07,081 --> 01:16:09,639
there isn't much time that I
get before my voice breaks.

2251
01:16:09,640 --> 01:16:10,649
- Right. - Right.

2252
01:16:10,650 --> 01:16:12,581
I like that I can use that time...

2253
01:16:12,810 --> 01:16:15,849
in a meaningful way.

2254
01:16:15,850 --> 01:16:18,550
- Gosh. - He's great with words.

2255
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,090
The biggest issue in this
choir is their voice breaking.

2256
01:16:22,661 --> 01:16:25,031
- Voice break means retirement. - Right.

2257
01:16:25,730 --> 01:16:26,860
- Right. - That's what it's like here.

2258
01:16:26,861 --> 01:16:28,201
It means retirement.

2259
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,599
But you can join a different choir later.

2260
01:16:30,600 --> 01:16:32,430
- Right. - Right.

2261
01:16:32,470 --> 01:16:33,639
What about you, Yeo Joon?

2262
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,671
The snacks.

2263
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:38,509
- The snacks?
- What kind of snacks are given?

2264
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,810
- It's random.
- It's random from our parents.

2265
01:16:41,411 --> 01:16:43,350
- They're always different.
- So the parents...

2266
01:16:43,680 --> 01:16:45,580
- prepare the snacks. - Right.

2267
01:16:45,581 --> 01:16:47,320
What is your favorite snack, Ba Ul?

2268
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:48,696
My favorite is the salted butter roll.

2269
01:16:48,720 --> 01:16:50,490
- The salted butter roll?
- That's a classy one.

2270
01:16:50,491 --> 01:16:52,420
- Salted butter roll?
- He has a trendy taste.

2271
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:53,889
- What about you, Se Joon?
- He won't have high blood pressure.

2272
01:16:53,890 --> 01:16:55,889
- Fried chicken. - Fried chicken?

2273
01:16:55,890 --> 01:16:56,961
What about you, Ha Joon?

2274
01:16:57,031 --> 01:16:58,759
- Dakgangjeong. - Dakgangjeong.

2275
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:00,429
- What about you, Ju Won? - I like ramyeon.

2276
01:17:00,430 --> 01:17:01,899
- Ramyeon. - Gosh.

2277
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,269
- What about you, Yeo Joon? - Tteokbokki.

2278
01:17:03,270 --> 01:17:04,770
Tteokbokki. What about you, Seo Bin?

2279
01:17:05,001 --> 01:17:08,269
Things like chicken and tteokbokki.

2280
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,870
- All of them? - I like all of them.

2281
01:17:09,871 --> 01:17:11,469
- What about you, Min Kyu? - Nothing.

2282
01:17:11,470 --> 01:17:12,830
- Why? - I don't like any of them.

2283
01:17:13,381 --> 01:17:14,381
Why is that?

2284
01:17:14,611 --> 01:17:16,380
He doesn't like snacks.

2285
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,381
- You don't like snacks?
- You only have meals?

2286
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:19,509
- Yes. - I see.

2287
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:22,820
You have to eat well to grow tall.

2288
01:17:22,821 --> 01:17:24,267
- I don't have to grow tall.
- What was that?

2289
01:17:24,291 --> 01:17:25,920
- I don't have to grow tall.
- You don't have to grow tall?

2290
01:17:25,921 --> 01:17:27,161
He doesn't have to grow tall.

2291
01:17:28,060 --> 01:17:30,161
He's a bit feisty.

2292
01:17:30,531 --> 01:17:32,559
Min Kyu is a bit feisty when he talks.

2293
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:35,259
- He seeks a healthy life. - Right.

2294
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,670
- He has his own style. - Right.

2295
01:17:37,671 --> 01:17:40,071
We all came to visit you guys.

2296
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:43,309
- Could you sing for us a bit? - Right.

2297
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,670
We prepared something for you.

2298
01:17:44,671 --> 01:17:46,480
Let's give them a round of applause.

2299
01:17:46,711 --> 01:17:48,280
We have to listen to them sing.

2300
01:17:48,281 --> 01:17:50,080
- Then... - We have a book of songs.

2301
01:17:50,081 --> 01:17:51,849
- I see. - But we need someone to play.

2302
01:17:51,850 --> 01:17:54,550
We have two great musicians here.

2303
01:17:55,251 --> 01:17:56,280
The piano?

2304
01:17:56,281 --> 01:17:58,750
- Jae Hyung can play.
- You should play, Jae Hyung.

2305
01:17:58,751 --> 01:17:59,889
Why make me play like this?

2306
01:17:59,890 --> 01:18:03,090
This man has studied music in France.

2307
01:18:03,560 --> 01:18:04,790
- He's a teacher.
- He was in France for eight years.

2308
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,089
I'm Gabriel, my friends.

2309
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:08,059
- Am I not their friends?
- How can you be their friend?

2310
01:18:08,060 --> 01:18:09,929
- I want to do a different book.
- Which song?

2311
01:18:09,930 --> 01:18:11,269
- A different book. - A different book.

2312
01:18:11,270 --> 01:18:12,570
- A different book. - The blue one.

2313
01:18:12,571 --> 01:18:14,399
- There's a blue one. - That one.

2314
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,400
- The sky blue one.
- Take turns when you talk!

2315
01:18:16,571 --> 01:18:18,040
The sky blue one.

2316
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:19,339
- This one is blue. - Gosh.

2317
01:18:19,340 --> 01:18:21,041
It's on the last page.

2318
01:18:21,111 --> 01:18:22,809
The last song must be a hard one.

2319
01:18:22,810 --> 01:18:24,410
- No. It's really easy.
- No. It's really easy.

2320
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:26,171
- It's easier toward the end.
- It's easier.

2321
01:18:27,281 --> 01:18:28,580
- All right. - Gosh.

2322
01:18:28,581 --> 01:18:30,821
- That one? - Jae Hyung will play for us.

2323
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:33,019
- We should move this way. - He's Gabriel.

2324
01:18:33,020 --> 01:18:34,490
That man is Gabriel too.

2325
01:18:34,491 --> 01:18:35,661
He's actually named Gabriel.

2326
01:18:35,961 --> 01:18:39,090
This man lives with music.

2327
01:18:39,230 --> 01:18:40,430
Does he play really well?

2328
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:42,800
- Gosh, he's amazing.
- I don't know this. What is this?

2329
01:18:42,930 --> 01:18:44,270
He makes jjamppong too.

2330
01:18:44,470 --> 01:18:46,790
- He plays really well.
- I don't know this. What is this?

2331
01:18:47,201 --> 01:18:49,571
(He plays right away.)

2332
01:18:51,711 --> 01:18:52,939
This is how it goes.

2333
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:54,780
(He is done scanning.)

2334
01:18:54,781 --> 01:18:56,850
Is it faster than this?

2335
01:18:56,980 --> 01:18:58,580
- It's faster. - It's a bit faster.

2336
01:18:58,581 --> 01:18:59,711
Give it a try.

2337
01:18:59,781 --> 01:19:01,251
Give us the count.

2338
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:03,451
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

2339
01:19:04,991 --> 01:19:08,161
(Oh, Lord, my heart)

2340
01:19:18,970 --> 01:19:20,170
("Psalms 57...")

2341
01:19:20,171 --> 01:19:23,201
(by Musica Sacra Boys
Choir and Jung Jae Hyung)

2342
01:19:24,041 --> 01:19:26,140
- Their voices are beautiful. - Right.

2343
01:19:42,390 --> 01:19:46,390
(Melody)

2344
01:19:50,631 --> 01:19:53,671
(The boys' voices are pure.)

2345
01:19:57,211 --> 01:19:59,241
(Feeling proud)

2346
01:20:20,861 --> 01:20:23,969
(Impressed)

2347
01:20:23,970 --> 01:20:27,339
(A wonderful harmony by
Jae Hyung and the boys choir)

2348
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,399
- He's an amazing pianist!
- He is, isn't he?

2349
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:31,309
- Yes. - What was that at the end?

2350
01:20:31,310 --> 01:20:35,040
- Their voices are so beautiful. - Right.

2351
01:20:35,041 --> 01:20:39,550
This can be heard only
before their voices break.

2352
01:20:40,121 --> 01:20:43,491
- What Ba Ul said was true. - Right.

2353
01:20:44,451 --> 01:20:46,861
- You were amazing. - Well done!

2354
01:20:46,961 --> 01:20:48,290
Take your seat.

2355
01:20:48,291 --> 01:20:49,621
Thank you!

2356
01:20:51,461 --> 01:20:53,929
You did such a great job.

2357
01:20:53,930 --> 01:20:56,460
- This voice is special because... - Right.

2358
01:20:56,461 --> 01:20:58,099
This is the only time it can be heard.

2359
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,600
And actually, as adults,

2360
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:03,240
because of various
reasons, like having a vibrato,

2361
01:21:03,241 --> 01:21:04,639
choirs are not perfectly in tune.

2362
01:21:04,640 --> 01:21:07,340
For example. Melody

2363
01:21:07,480 --> 01:21:08,810
Adults keep singing like this.

2364
01:21:10,381 --> 01:21:12,450
But they sounded so clean.

2365
01:21:12,451 --> 01:21:13,849
- That's right. - They sounded beautiful.

2366
01:21:13,850 --> 01:21:17,250
Thank you again for letting
us hear your precious voices...

2367
01:21:17,251 --> 01:21:18,450
at this time.

2368
01:21:18,451 --> 01:21:20,120
(Thank you, Musica Sacra.)

2369
01:21:20,121 --> 01:21:22,361
Now, we should begin.

2370
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:24,461
- Ju Won. - Gosh.

2371
01:21:24,760 --> 01:21:26,190
That box looks expensive.

2372
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:28,630
What is it?

2373
01:21:28,631 --> 01:21:30,670
If you break open this cookie,

2374
01:21:30,671 --> 01:21:32,299
- you'll see a present inside.
- Can I eat it?

2375
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,477
- Give me one too.
- He asked if he could eat it.

2376
01:21:33,501 --> 01:21:35,769
- The flavor is... Yes, break it.
- Do I just...

2377
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:38,041
- Yes, break it.
- Your back is turned to the camera.

2378
01:21:38,310 --> 01:21:40,040
- Hey. - It's okay.

2379
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,410
Take your seats.

2380
01:21:41,411 --> 01:21:42,581
You can't eat this one.

2381
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:45,479
"Choonsik desk clocks."

2382
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,380
(Round 1:12 Choonsik desk clocks)

2383
01:21:47,381 --> 01:21:48,951
- That's so big. - Really?

2384
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:50,649
- That's so big. - Goodness.

2385
01:21:50,650 --> 01:21:52,019
That's so big.

2386
01:21:52,020 --> 01:21:53,321
This one has ink on it.

2387
01:21:53,661 --> 01:21:55,361
They get to take one each?

2388
01:21:56,321 --> 01:21:58,559
(Choonsik is children's
favorite character.)

2389
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,400
Apparently, this is
their favorite character.

2390
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:01,861
Nice.

2391
01:22:02,131 --> 01:22:05,300
I already bought a
desk clock. I wish I didn't.

2392
01:22:05,371 --> 01:22:06,570
- You already bought one? - Yes.

2393
01:22:06,571 --> 01:22:08,671
You have to win these anyway.

2394
01:22:09,241 --> 01:22:11,240
- We... - The world...

2395
01:22:11,241 --> 01:22:13,479
The world isn't as easy as you think it is.

2396
01:22:13,480 --> 01:22:14,980
Please.

2397
01:22:15,711 --> 01:22:17,110
- All right, we... - Mr. Yoo.

2398
01:22:17,111 --> 01:22:19,610
- Yes? - If I don't pass Round One,

2399
01:22:19,611 --> 01:22:20,951
please sing "As I Say."

2400
01:22:21,350 --> 01:22:23,520
- If you don't pass? - You know "As I Say?"

2401
01:22:23,850 --> 01:22:25,420
- Yes. - As I say

2402
01:22:25,421 --> 01:22:26,820
I used to listen to it a lot with my dad.

2403
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:29,160
- Really? - We sang "As I Say" together.

2404
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:30,689
- Gosh. - Yes, I sang it with him.

2405
01:22:30,690 --> 01:22:32,790
- We're Sagging Snail.
- Gosh, Sagging Snail.

2406
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:35,031
- He's my partner. - He wrote it too.

2407
01:22:35,230 --> 01:22:37,030
(He's trying to promote his own song.)

2408
01:22:37,031 --> 01:22:38,730
I'm sorry. I only know "As I Say."

2409
01:22:39,571 --> 01:22:41,970
I still believe.

2410
01:22:42,270 --> 01:22:44,070
Gosh, what could it be?

2411
01:22:44,071 --> 01:22:46,170
I'd feel so sorry.

2412
01:22:46,171 --> 01:22:49,210
- We have to get them the gifts.
- We have to.

2413
01:22:49,211 --> 01:22:52,179
We have to put our lives
on the line to win this.

2414
01:22:52,180 --> 01:22:53,979
The older members just got here too.

2415
01:22:53,980 --> 01:22:55,780
- The older members.
- He's in middle school.

2416
01:22:56,281 --> 01:22:57,849
- He's the vice-captain.
- The vice-captain.

2417
01:22:57,850 --> 01:23:00,120
So will he be graduating?

2418
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,860
I graduate in February.

2419
01:23:01,861 --> 01:23:03,019
When you graduate...

2420
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:04,790
- Is your voice changing? - It is.

2421
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:06,059
(His voice is deep.)

2422
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:08,161
I can tell. It's changing.

2423
01:23:08,961 --> 01:23:11,899
Anyway, since the vice-captain is here,

2424
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:13,899
- we'll do our best. - Sounds good.

2425
01:23:13,900 --> 01:23:15,799
Round One. What is it?

2426
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,939
(Singing Along to Children's
Songs, Winter edition)

2427
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,380
(Round 1)

2428
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:22,110
(Listen to children's winter songs...)

2429
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:25,381
(and correctly sing the
next part to succeed.)

2430
01:23:25,711 --> 01:23:27,320
- Wait. It's too hard. - Why?

2431
01:23:27,345 --> 01:23:28,704
Why?

2432
01:23:28,951 --> 01:23:31,126
- All of a sudden, you...
- I'm as old as their grandfathers.

2433
01:23:31,150 --> 01:23:32,549
I don't know any of the lyrics.

2434
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:33,560
(Feeling pressured)

2435
01:23:34,690 --> 01:23:35,920
You only get three chances.

2436
01:23:35,921 --> 01:23:37,631
Why three? Why not ten?

2437
01:23:37,791 --> 01:23:39,590
- Chances. - Chances, I see.

2438
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:42,059
- The chances you can use.
- He's a bit sensitive. I'm sorry.

2439
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,331
I'm sensitive right now.

2440
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:45,300
Please give them an easy one.

2441
01:23:45,930 --> 01:23:47,269
Please give them an easy one.

2442
01:23:47,270 --> 01:23:48,969
We all have to be quiet.

2443
01:23:48,970 --> 01:23:50,171
Shush.

2444
01:23:50,470 --> 01:23:51,670
This is going to be hard.

2445
01:23:51,671 --> 01:23:53,111
(The children's song for Round 1)

2446
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:57,450
Raise the volume.

2447
01:23:57,451 --> 01:23:59,780
Wait! Stop.

2448
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:01,121
- No, just listen. - But...

2449
01:24:01,251 --> 01:24:04,890
(Yeon Seok)

2450
01:24:07,161 --> 01:24:09,791
(The children's song
for Round 1: "It's Okay")

2451
01:24:10,631 --> 01:24:12,589
(Yeon Seok)

2452
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:20,370
(Jae Suk)

2453
01:24:20,371 --> 01:24:28,280
(Jae Hyung)

2454
01:24:28,281 --> 01:24:36,281
(Juck)

2455
01:24:37,251 --> 01:24:39,620
All right. We'll start right away.

2456
01:24:39,621 --> 01:24:41,760
- Play the song. Go. - This is easy.

2457
01:24:42,291 --> 01:24:44,730
(You got this, uncles!)

2458
01:24:45,690 --> 01:24:47,161
- You got the difficult part. - Yes.

2459
01:24:48,230 --> 01:24:49,429
You're up.

2460
01:24:49,430 --> 01:24:51,299
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on try number 1.)

2461
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:54,940
(Did Yeon Seok hear the lyrics correctly?)

2462
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:59,469
(It's okay if there's wind)

2463
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:02,840
(It's okay, it's okay)

2464
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:07,380
(It's okay if the wind is strong)

2465
01:25:07,381 --> 01:25:10,650
(I'm okay)

2466
01:25:10,951 --> 01:25:14,791
(Half of them succeeded on the first try!)

2467
01:25:16,220 --> 01:25:17,630
(Jae Hyung)

2468
01:25:17,631 --> 01:25:19,730
(Wrong!)

2469
01:25:20,501 --> 01:25:21,759
(The purehearted macho
didn't even open his mouth.)

2470
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,330
He must be embarrassed.

2471
01:25:23,331 --> 01:25:25,031
- How could you... - It's okay.

2472
01:25:25,730 --> 01:25:28,871
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2473
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:30,840
- It's okay. - Jae Hyung.

2474
01:25:31,241 --> 01:25:33,210
We have to get the children their gifts.

2475
01:25:33,211 --> 01:25:34,780
- Wait. - Jae Hyung's part is...

2476
01:25:34,781 --> 01:25:36,380
- It's difficult.
- What were the lyrics at the start?

2477
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,381
- What was it?
- The lyrics of the earlier part.

2478
01:25:37,382 --> 01:25:38,610
- Can we talk about it now? - Yes.

2479
01:25:38,611 --> 01:25:41,280
- We can discuss it now.
- Later, it mentions woolen gloves.

2480
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:43,581
- I thought it was starry gloves.
- It's woolen gloves.

2481
01:25:43,791 --> 01:25:47,259
My part is, "It's okay
because I'm strong. I'm okay."

2482
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:48,920
- We all know our parts. - Yes.

2483
01:25:48,921 --> 01:25:50,120
What's his part?

2484
01:25:50,121 --> 01:25:52,689
It's woolen hat first,

2485
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,160
- and then it's woolen gloves.
- Woolen hat, woolen gloves.

2486
01:25:55,161 --> 01:25:56,929
I can't memorize the melody, though.

2487
01:25:56,930 --> 01:25:58,630
Can you play... No, can we use a chance?

2488
01:25:58,631 --> 01:26:01,599
- The 3 rounds...
- We can use 3 chances, right?

2489
01:26:01,600 --> 01:26:02,639
A total of three chances.

2490
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,339
- Three for all three rounds?
- Yes, a total of three.

2491
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,871
Let's not use one yet.

2492
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,080
What's he up to?

2493
01:26:10,081 --> 01:26:11,110
(Jae Hyung sat in front of
the piano all of a sudden.)

2494
01:26:11,111 --> 01:26:12,951
- That was abrupt. - He's using the piano.

2495
01:26:21,961 --> 01:26:23,860
(Watching carefully)

2496
01:26:23,861 --> 01:26:25,490
I don't know what comes next.

2497
01:26:25,491 --> 01:26:26,860
(Jae Hyung doesn't know
the melody to his part.)

2498
01:26:26,861 --> 01:26:28,059
What is it?

2499
01:26:28,060 --> 01:26:30,501
- Gosh, those musical geniuses.
- Is it this?

2500
01:26:30,701 --> 01:26:31,770
Gosh.

2501
01:26:33,131 --> 01:26:36,701
(Musical Genius 1 plays the
melody for him right away.)

2502
01:26:37,411 --> 01:26:39,210
(Amazed)

2503
01:26:39,211 --> 01:26:40,491
It's something like this, right?

2504
01:26:40,881 --> 01:26:42,240
That's right.

2505
01:26:42,241 --> 01:26:45,650
(Musical Genius 2 learned it right away.)

2506
01:26:45,850 --> 01:26:47,690
- It's okay - It's
something like this, right?

2507
01:26:47,951 --> 01:26:49,679
- But what is it, though? - The lyrics...

2508
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:52,219
- It's woolen something.
- I think woolen hat, woolen gloves.

2509
01:26:52,220 --> 01:26:55,621
Woolen hat... I didn't hear
this part. I just heard mine.

2510
01:26:55,991 --> 01:26:57,729
(It's okay)

2511
01:26:57,730 --> 01:26:59,389
Why is he okay about everything?

2512
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:00,899
This part is the only...

2513
01:27:00,900 --> 01:27:03,099
- We have to use a chance.
- We'll find out quickly with it.

2514
01:27:03,100 --> 01:27:04,200
Let's use one.

2515
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:05,501
You do it.

2516
01:27:05,671 --> 01:27:07,300
Will he pick a good one?

2517
01:27:07,541 --> 01:27:09,639
Will he pick a good one or a bad one?

2518
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:10,939
He's like the MC.

2519
01:27:10,940 --> 01:27:13,570
- He's good at this. - Yes, he is.

2520
01:27:13,571 --> 01:27:15,479
- Revealed on Whenever Possible.
- Let's see.

2521
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:17,049
- Jae Hyung. - In 1, 2...

2522
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:18,450
This keeps jingling.

2523
01:27:18,451 --> 01:27:19,649
(Jingling)

2524
01:27:19,650 --> 01:27:20,821
It keeps...

2525
01:27:21,781 --> 01:27:23,349
Goodness, Jae Hyung.

2526
01:27:23,350 --> 01:27:25,219
This is so outdated.

2527
01:27:25,220 --> 01:27:27,461
- They use these in jails.
- Are you a prisoner or what?

2528
01:27:27,720 --> 01:27:29,491
- Put it inside for me. - All right.

2529
01:27:30,291 --> 01:27:32,060
It will be revealed in 60 seconds.

2530
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:35,059
- Let's see. - Okay.

2531
01:27:35,060 --> 01:27:36,559
- It's good. - "Listen at twice the speed."

2532
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:38,229
- "Listen at twice the speed." - It's good.

2533
01:27:38,230 --> 01:27:40,000
- Remind me how the melody goes.
- The melody.

2534
01:27:40,001 --> 01:27:43,871
(Going over the melody again)

2535
01:27:44,211 --> 01:27:45,339
It's like that.

2536
01:27:45,340 --> 01:27:46,469
Okay, we'll listen to it now.

2537
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:48,139
- You have to go right away. - All right.

2538
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:49,479
- We don't get to discuss? - No.

2539
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:50,849
- Listen carefully, Jae Hyung.
- Listen carefully.

2540
01:27:50,850 --> 01:27:53,510
- Gosh. - Why did he sit here?

2541
01:27:54,150 --> 01:27:55,420
Juck should have sat here.

2542
01:27:55,421 --> 01:27:57,491
(Listen to the entire
song at twice the speed)

2543
01:27:59,751 --> 01:28:03,689
(Yeon Seok)

2544
01:28:03,690 --> 01:28:07,899
(Jae Suk)

2545
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:11,729
(Jae Hyung)

2546
01:28:11,730 --> 01:28:16,041
(Juck)

2547
01:28:16,741 --> 01:28:18,871
You have to go right
away. Play the music. Go.

2548
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,611
Gosh, okay.

2549
01:28:23,741 --> 01:28:25,911
(Nervous)

2550
01:28:27,381 --> 01:28:30,990
(It's okay if there's wind)

2551
01:28:30,991 --> 01:28:34,661
(It's okay, it's okay)

2552
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:38,930
(It's okay if the wind is strong)

2553
01:28:39,961 --> 01:28:42,531
(They're close to the problematic part.)

2554
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:44,230
(Even when I wear woolen gloves)

2555
01:28:44,231 --> 01:28:47,000
(Wrong!)

2556
01:28:47,001 --> 01:28:48,599
- Woolen hat. - Red...

2557
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:49,740
Woolen gloves.

2558
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:52,040
- Can we switch seats? - No. Yes, right.

2559
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:54,240
- We can change seats.
- I heard it earlier.

2560
01:28:54,241 --> 01:28:55,280
What is it?

2561
01:28:55,281 --> 01:28:58,849
(It's not because of my woolen hat)

2562
01:28:58,850 --> 01:29:01,980
(It's not because of my
woolen gloves either)

2563
01:29:02,251 --> 01:29:05,750
(It's okay because I'm strong)

2564
01:29:05,751 --> 01:29:08,759
(I'm okay)

2565
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,220
You try singing it by yourself.

2566
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,990
(It's not because)

2567
01:29:12,991 --> 01:29:15,259
- No, that's not it. - He can't sing.

2568
01:29:15,260 --> 01:29:17,700
He's only good at playing the piano.

2569
01:29:17,701 --> 01:29:20,770
He can't move the melody
from his hands to his vocal cords.

2570
01:29:22,100 --> 01:29:23,570
His hands...

2571
01:29:23,571 --> 01:29:24,969
That's so insulting.

2572
01:29:24,970 --> 01:29:26,110
He can play it with his hands, but...

2573
01:29:26,111 --> 01:29:28,679
- He can play it...
- I told you he's not a singer.

2574
01:29:28,680 --> 01:29:29,780
Jae Hyung is a pianist.

2575
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,211
(The purehearted macho is hurt.)

2576
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:36,149
(They're back in melodic nightmare.)

2577
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:39,251
- It's not because of my
woolen hat - My woolen hat

2578
01:29:39,720 --> 01:29:42,020
(Woolen gloves!)

2579
01:29:42,560 --> 01:29:46,460
- Hat comes first.
- It's not because of my woolen hat

2580
01:29:46,461 --> 01:29:48,861
(He's putting in the most effort.)

2581
01:29:50,001 --> 01:29:51,130
- All right. - It's not because of

2582
01:29:51,131 --> 01:29:53,600
(Jae Hyung keeps singing
his part over and over.)

2583
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:56,299
It's not because of my woolen gloves either

2584
01:29:56,300 --> 01:29:58,840
This song is too simple
for you to practice like that.

2585
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:01,309
The children seem...

2586
01:30:01,310 --> 01:30:03,380
- astonished by us. - Yes, we are.

2587
01:30:03,381 --> 01:30:05,211
We keep getting this simple song wrong.

2588
01:30:05,881 --> 01:30:08,020
- Please. - My woolen hat

2589
01:30:08,321 --> 01:30:11,189
It's not because of my woolen gloves either

2590
01:30:11,190 --> 01:30:13,090
- All right. Let's do it! - Let's do it.

2591
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:15,759
- Just you wait, kids.
- This is our third try.

2592
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:17,089
- Please! - Just you wait.

2593
01:30:17,090 --> 01:30:19,130
- Our third try.
- We're definitely going to succeed.

2594
01:30:19,131 --> 01:30:20,229
Here we go!

2595
01:30:20,230 --> 01:30:21,360
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on try number 3.)

2596
01:30:21,361 --> 01:30:24,470
(For the first time, they know
all the lyrics and the melody.)

2597
01:30:25,171 --> 01:30:28,640
(Will they succeed if Jae Hyung
can pass through his part?)

2598
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:33,010
(It's okay if the wind is strong)

2599
01:30:33,571 --> 01:30:36,840
(Here comes the difficult part.)

2600
01:30:37,310 --> 01:30:40,281
(Woolen hat, woolen gloves)

2601
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:41,950
(It's not because of my woolen hat)

2602
01:30:41,951 --> 01:30:45,020
(Wrong!)

2603
01:30:45,350 --> 01:30:47,461
- Did we get it wrong?
- It's not "woolen hat?"

2604
01:30:48,421 --> 01:30:49,491
It's not?

2605
01:30:50,590 --> 01:30:52,531
My feelings are so hurt right now.

2606
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:55,360
- Really?
- I don't think anyone has ever...

2607
01:30:55,361 --> 01:30:56,399
played the bell like that when I sang.

2608
01:30:56,400 --> 01:30:57,470
Well,

2609
01:30:57,571 --> 01:30:59,677
I did have trouble hearing
that part of the song clearly.

2610
01:30:59,701 --> 01:31:01,270
Wasn't it "starry gloves?"

2611
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:03,001
"Woolen" was correct.

2612
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:05,540
If not woolen hat,

2613
01:31:05,541 --> 01:31:07,381
- then there's woolen socks.
- Woolen socks.

2614
01:31:07,581 --> 01:31:09,240
- Gosh. - Woolen arm warmers?

2615
01:31:09,241 --> 01:31:11,080
- Woolen arm warmers? - I guess not.

2616
01:31:11,081 --> 01:31:13,380
Since it mentions gloves for hands,
the next item should be for feet.

2617
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:14,920
(Something woolen for feet
like woolen gloves for hands?)

2618
01:31:14,921 --> 01:31:16,979
It's because there's not
a lot of woolen things...

2619
01:31:16,980 --> 01:31:19,890
- that we can wear on our bodies.
- Woolen shoes.

2620
01:31:20,220 --> 01:31:21,890
- Woolen... - Woolen shoes.

2621
01:31:22,020 --> 01:31:23,089
Woolen shoes?

2622
01:31:23,090 --> 01:31:24,589
I don't think it was "woolen."

2623
01:31:24,590 --> 01:31:26,291
- He said we got "woolen" right. - I see.

2624
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:28,480
- At least he told us that. - Woolen socks.

2625
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:30,331
Woolen earmuffs?

2626
01:31:30,461 --> 01:31:32,969
- No, that's not it.
- "It's not because of..."

2627
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:36,570
- "my woolen earmuffs."
- No, that's too long.

2628
01:31:36,571 --> 01:31:39,339
But the lyrics to that
part went by very quickly.

2629
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:40,410
Hat, socks...

2630
01:31:40,411 --> 01:31:42,680
I couldn't hear the
lyrics to that part clearly.

2631
01:31:42,810 --> 01:31:45,380
The audio mixing wasn't done well.

2632
01:31:45,381 --> 01:31:46,580
(Standing up)

2633
01:31:46,581 --> 01:31:48,880
Sound Director, can you fix the music?

2634
01:31:48,881 --> 01:31:50,750
Make the high frequency higher...

2635
01:31:50,751 --> 01:31:52,420
and the low frequency lower.

2636
01:31:52,421 --> 01:31:53,690
So the sound looks like this.

2637
01:31:53,850 --> 01:31:56,120
Wait, do you have an EQ?

2638
01:31:56,121 --> 01:31:57,960
There should be an EQ here somewhere.

2639
01:31:57,961 --> 01:32:00,166
- Right, we can't hear the lyrics.
- They're acting like...

2640
01:32:00,190 --> 01:32:02,730
- this is "SBS Inkigayo".
- The lyrics are mushed together.

2641
01:32:04,831 --> 01:32:06,399
Maybe it's woolen shoes.

2642
01:32:06,400 --> 01:32:07,969
Let's try woolen shoes.

2643
01:32:07,970 --> 01:32:09,040
What about woolen arm warmers?

2644
01:32:09,041 --> 01:32:10,170
- When did this song come out?
- It's not because of my woolen...

2645
01:32:10,171 --> 01:32:11,270
About 20 years ago?

2646
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,711
- Woolen gloves...
- There weren't woolen shoes...

2647
01:32:14,911 --> 01:32:16,179
back then, 20 years ago.

2648
01:32:16,180 --> 01:32:18,649
Or we can use another chance.

2649
01:32:18,650 --> 01:32:20,950
- Right now? - And just succeed.

2650
01:32:20,951 --> 01:32:22,251
- Should we? - All right.

2651
01:32:22,480 --> 01:32:25,621
If not, we'll... Ju Won looks
so concerned right now.

2652
01:32:26,421 --> 01:32:27,660
We'll use a chance.

2653
01:32:27,661 --> 01:32:30,291
Should we go for another try...

2654
01:32:30,491 --> 01:32:32,089
with the lyrics, "woolen shoes," or...

2655
01:32:32,090 --> 01:32:34,360
- use a chance? - Use a chance.

2656
01:32:34,361 --> 01:32:36,000
- Use a chance.
- I don't think they should...

2657
01:32:36,001 --> 01:32:38,170
- because this is Round 1.
- They used 1 for Round 1.

2658
01:32:38,171 --> 01:32:40,631
They should use 1 for
Round 2 and 1 for Round 3.

2659
01:32:40,741 --> 01:32:42,599
- In Round One...
- Okay, you guys discuss it...

2660
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:43,800
- and let us know. - Right.

2661
01:32:44,211 --> 01:32:46,769
- No, wait. - We're...

2662
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:49,510
- Wait. - No, let me talk.

2663
01:32:50,711 --> 01:32:53,179
- No, listen to me. - They're just like us.

2664
01:32:53,180 --> 01:32:54,881
You guys talk it out.

2665
01:32:56,321 --> 01:32:57,519
Woolen shoes.

2666
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,750
- Listen to me. - Let's use a chance.

2667
01:32:59,751 --> 01:33:01,820
They're already having
trouble with Round One.

2668
01:33:01,821 --> 01:33:05,660
Rounds 2 and 3 will be
even more difficult for them.

2669
01:33:05,661 --> 01:33:06,661
Don't stand up.

2670
01:33:06,662 --> 01:33:08,399
There's another chance left, though.

2671
01:33:08,400 --> 01:33:09,460
Even if they use one now,

2672
01:33:09,461 --> 01:33:12,970
- they have one more left.
- Since Ju Won applied for this,

2673
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:14,799
he gets to decide...

2674
01:33:14,800 --> 01:33:17,969
whether we use a chance
or go with woolen shoes.

2675
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:20,810
You have to remember
that there will be better gifts.

2676
01:33:21,310 --> 01:33:22,740
- Let's go with woolen shoes. - Okay.

2677
01:33:22,741 --> 01:33:23,780
- Woolen shoes. - What did he say?

2678
01:33:23,781 --> 01:33:26,149
- We'll go with woolen shoes.
- We'll try one more time.

2679
01:33:26,150 --> 01:33:27,549
- I can't even pronounce it.
- All right. Woolen shoes.

2680
01:33:27,550 --> 01:33:29,920
- Woolen shoes. Let's go. - Okay.

2681
01:33:29,921 --> 01:33:31,189
Did we have woolen shoes back then?

2682
01:33:31,190 --> 01:33:33,250
Let's shout "Here we
go" together. In 1, 2, 3.

2683
01:33:33,251 --> 01:33:34,821
- Here we go! - You got this!

2684
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:36,420
We have to succeed.

2685
01:33:36,421 --> 01:33:38,890
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on try number 5.)

2686
01:33:39,361 --> 01:33:43,131
(Did they make the right
choice with "woolen shoes?")

2687
01:33:44,730 --> 01:33:48,670
(It's okay if the wind is strong)

2688
01:33:48,671 --> 01:33:52,241
(I'm okay)

2689
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:54,980
I'm okay

2690
01:33:55,140 --> 01:33:56,280
(It's not because of my woolen shoes)

2691
01:33:56,281 --> 01:33:58,850
(Wrong!)

2692
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,950
(It's not woolen shoes?)

2693
01:34:01,951 --> 01:34:03,757
- We have to use a chance.
- We have to use a chance.

2694
01:34:03,781 --> 01:34:05,089
- We have to. - We have to use a chance.

2695
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,820
- Right? We have to use it. - Okay.

2696
01:34:06,821 --> 01:34:08,381
- Juck, you go pick 1. - You go pick 1.

2697
01:34:08,421 --> 01:34:09,660
- Please. - Please.

2698
01:34:09,661 --> 01:34:11,791
- Please. - Pick a good one.

2699
01:34:12,060 --> 01:34:13,331
- Please. - Reveal what it is.

2700
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:14,961
"Consonants of a line."

2701
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,831
Then we can ask for the
consonants of that line.

2702
01:34:17,970 --> 01:34:19,599
- The consonants of that line. - Yes.

2703
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,700
- Yes, tell us that. - This is it.

2704
01:34:21,701 --> 01:34:23,140
- Tell us the consonants. - Please.

2705
01:34:24,211 --> 01:34:25,211
(I, N, B, O, M, W, O, I, N, B, O, M, W, G)

2706
01:34:25,212 --> 01:34:27,640
- What is this? - Like this.

2707
01:34:28,310 --> 01:34:29,740
"It's not because of my..."

2708
01:34:29,741 --> 01:34:31,179
"It's not because of my woolen gloves."

2709
01:34:31,180 --> 01:34:32,250
- Woolen... - Wait.

2710
01:34:32,251 --> 01:34:35,751
- It's not because of my
woolen O - "Woolen O?"

2711
01:34:35,921 --> 01:34:36,921
It's not because of my woolen overalls
Woolen overalls?

2712
01:34:39,350 --> 01:34:41,560
(Thinking)

2713
01:34:42,760 --> 01:34:45,730
It's either of these two. Back
when this song came out,

2714
01:34:46,190 --> 01:34:47,600
they used the term "overcoat."

2715
01:34:48,060 --> 01:34:50,871
- Overcoat? - What?

2716
01:34:51,270 --> 01:34:52,969
- Overcoat? - Overcoat.

2717
01:34:52,970 --> 01:34:54,769
- Overcoat. Woolen overcoat. - Overcoat.

2718
01:34:54,770 --> 01:34:55,899
- Over? - Over.

2719
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:56,969
- Over. - Over?

2720
01:34:56,970 --> 01:34:59,241
"Over" as in "overdoing" something.

2721
01:34:59,741 --> 01:35:01,180
Yes. Really.

2722
01:35:01,281 --> 01:35:03,711
- We wore jumpers or overcoats.
- When was this?

2723
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:07,111
- Gosh. - Right, Father? Over...

2724
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:09,720
- We did use the term. Yes.
- Overcoat, right?

2725
01:35:09,850 --> 01:35:11,689
In a children's song, though?

2726
01:35:11,690 --> 01:35:13,349
"Woolen overcoat" in a children's song?

2727
01:35:13,350 --> 01:35:14,889
- I don't think so. - Right.

2728
01:35:14,890 --> 01:35:17,219
Woolen overcoat. It's overcoat.

2729
01:35:17,220 --> 01:35:19,729
- Woolen overcoat?
- My gut says this is it.

2730
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:21,729
- Are you sure?
- Look at how they all froze.

2731
01:35:21,730 --> 01:35:22,799
(Juck is arguing for "woolen overcoat.")

2732
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:23,930
They all froze.

2733
01:35:24,531 --> 01:35:26,030
Let's go with woolen overcoat.

2734
01:35:26,031 --> 01:35:28,070
- I'm... - Which try is this?

2735
01:35:28,071 --> 01:35:30,540
- This will be the seventh.
- The way I see it,

2736
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:31,710
- we should give it another try.
- If not, we'll use a chance.

2737
01:35:31,711 --> 01:35:33,110
"Woolen overcoat" will be our last attempt.

2738
01:35:33,111 --> 01:35:34,339
- All right. Sounds good. - All right.

2739
01:35:34,340 --> 01:35:36,640
- Sing "woolen overcoat."
- Woolen overcoat. Let's go.

2740
01:35:36,810 --> 01:35:39,251
Okay. We'll see if Juck is right.

2741
01:35:39,350 --> 01:35:40,679
Cheer for us.

2742
01:35:40,680 --> 01:35:42,320
- You got this! - Let's go!

2743
01:35:42,321 --> 01:35:43,950
We have to focus. Don't get it wrong...

2744
01:35:43,951 --> 01:35:45,349
- before we get to Jae Hyung.
- We have to get it right.

2745
01:35:45,350 --> 01:35:46,420
- Yes. - Let's do this.

2746
01:35:46,421 --> 01:35:48,060
(They all go over their own parts.)

2747
01:35:48,760 --> 01:35:50,960
- We did say, "Woolen overcoat."
- That's right.

2748
01:35:50,961 --> 01:35:52,830
- Gosh. - All right.

2749
01:35:52,831 --> 01:35:54,331
Play the music. Go.

2750
01:35:55,053 --> 01:35:56,163
This is too hard.

2751
01:35:56,164 --> 01:35:58,463
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on try number 7.)

2752
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,932
If we get it wrong again,
we have to use a chance.

2753
01:36:00,933 --> 01:36:02,263
(Will they succeed this time?)

2754
01:36:02,733 --> 01:36:06,472
(It's okay if there's wind)

2755
01:36:06,473 --> 01:36:08,173
(It's okay, it's okay)

2756
01:36:08,174 --> 01:36:10,173
- What are you doing? - It's okay

2757
01:36:10,174 --> 01:36:14,273
(It's okay if the wind is strong, I'm okay)

2758
01:36:16,284 --> 01:36:18,953
(It's time for the part
with "woolen overcoat!")

2759
01:36:18,954 --> 01:36:21,154
(Please!)

2760
01:36:22,624 --> 01:36:26,254
(It's not because of my woolen overcoat)

2761
01:36:27,924 --> 01:36:30,163
(They got "woolen overcoat" right!)

2762
01:36:30,164 --> 01:36:33,864
It's not because of my woolen overcoat

2763
01:36:33,994 --> 01:36:36,033
(It's not because of my
woolen gloves either)

2764
01:36:36,034 --> 01:36:37,802
(Yes!)

2765
01:36:37,803 --> 01:36:41,903
(It's okay because I'm strong)

2766
01:36:41,904 --> 01:36:45,503
(I'm okay)

2767
01:36:45,504 --> 01:36:47,914
(Correct!)

2768
01:36:49,244 --> 01:36:52,813
(Round 1, success)

2769
01:36:53,483 --> 01:36:56,254
(Cheering)

2770
01:36:56,954 --> 01:36:59,623
- We did it! - Gosh.

2771
01:36:59,624 --> 01:37:02,193
Juck was right.

2772
01:37:02,393 --> 01:37:05,664
- I was right. - Juck was right.

2773
01:37:05,794 --> 01:37:07,663
I can't believe the song said, "Overcoat."

2774
01:37:07,664 --> 01:37:09,404
- It was overcoat. - Yes.

2775
01:37:09,733 --> 01:37:12,063
Gosh, they did say,
"Woolen overcoat" in a song.

2776
01:37:12,133 --> 01:37:15,004
We wouldn't have gotten it right
if it weren't for the consonants.

2777
01:37:15,174 --> 01:37:17,142
Why overcoat? Gosh.

2778
01:37:17,143 --> 01:37:18,272
(Juck Dictionary saved the day.)

2779
01:37:18,273 --> 01:37:20,972
- They used "overcoat" in a song.
- Goodness.

2780
01:37:20,973 --> 01:37:23,914
That's why the staff chose this song.

2781
01:37:24,214 --> 01:37:25,584
Should we move on to Round Two?

2782
01:37:26,183 --> 01:37:28,614
- No. - Gosh.

2783
01:37:28,883 --> 01:37:30,583
(The children crowd around
Ju Won who's conflicted.)

2784
01:37:30,584 --> 01:37:32,552
- Round 2. - There are 3 more tries left.

2785
01:37:32,553 --> 01:37:34,893
So anyway, Round One...

2786
01:37:35,023 --> 01:37:36,392
was a success.

2787
01:37:36,393 --> 01:37:38,723
(The children won 12 desk clocks!)

2788
01:37:38,924 --> 01:37:41,034
The thing is... Guys.

2789
01:37:41,794 --> 01:37:43,802
- Ju Won. - You have to explain this well.

2790
01:37:43,803 --> 01:37:45,303
I'll explain it to you.

2791
01:37:46,334 --> 01:37:47,432
Listen carefully.

2792
01:37:47,433 --> 01:37:48,873
(It's time to choose: Stop the
game or move on to Round 2)

2793
01:37:48,874 --> 01:37:52,174
As you know, life isn't easy.

2794
01:37:52,343 --> 01:37:53,913
It's not easy, guys.

2795
01:37:53,914 --> 01:37:57,182
We succeeded on the seventh try.

2796
01:37:57,183 --> 01:37:58,613
Eight, nine, ten.

2797
01:37:58,614 --> 01:38:00,182
- Three. - We only have three tries left.

2798
01:38:00,183 --> 01:38:01,953
- I think Round 2 is doable.
- This was only Round 1,

2799
01:38:01,954 --> 01:38:03,654
and it took us seven tries to succeed.

2800
01:38:03,954 --> 01:38:06,994
- Ju Won. We can go to Round Two.
- You have to decide.

2801
01:38:07,124 --> 01:38:08,823
But if we do, we only have three tries.

2802
01:38:08,824 --> 01:38:10,823
- So honestly, we... To be honest, - Two.

2803
01:38:10,824 --> 01:38:12,994
- We're not confident, at all.
- Not at all.

2804
01:38:13,334 --> 01:38:15,163
- Because... - Really?

2805
01:38:15,164 --> 01:38:17,263
Before we came here, something happened.

2806
01:38:17,563 --> 01:38:19,533
The moment you see
what the second present is,

2807
01:38:19,534 --> 01:38:22,132
you'll feel tempted. The
present will be amazing.

2808
01:38:22,133 --> 01:38:24,442
But before we came
here, we failed Round Two.

2809
01:38:24,443 --> 01:38:25,843
We came here after we failed.

2810
01:38:25,943 --> 01:38:27,942
So she cried.

2811
01:38:27,943 --> 01:38:29,342
She didn't get to keep
her present for Round One.

2812
01:38:29,343 --> 01:38:30,913
I'll summarize.

2813
01:38:30,914 --> 01:38:33,852
The present will be
bigger than in Round One.

2814
01:38:33,853 --> 01:38:36,754
But the quiz will be more difficult too.

2815
01:38:36,883 --> 01:38:39,623
The decision is up to Ju Won.

2816
01:38:39,624 --> 01:38:41,423
- Wait. - I have a question.

2817
01:38:41,424 --> 01:38:43,392
Can we decide after seeing the present?

2818
01:38:43,393 --> 01:38:44,663
- No. - No.

2819
01:38:44,664 --> 01:38:46,192
- Ju Won... What is it?
- I have a question.

2820
01:38:46,193 --> 01:38:49,333
Does the difficulty of the quiz...

2821
01:38:49,334 --> 01:38:51,232
depend on how good the present is?

2822
01:38:51,233 --> 01:38:52,903
The difficulty is already fixed...

2823
01:38:52,904 --> 01:38:54,333
as well as what the present is.

2824
01:38:54,334 --> 01:38:55,772
- But... - Ju Won, you decide.

2825
01:38:55,773 --> 01:38:58,272
- Is the next quiz about music, too?
- Stop.

2826
01:38:58,273 --> 01:38:59,972
- We don't know that either. - Then...

2827
01:38:59,973 --> 01:39:02,142
- you can discuss it for 30 seconds.
- Think about it.

2828
01:39:02,143 --> 01:39:04,113
- Discuss it.
- We'll go along with your decision.

2829
01:39:04,114 --> 01:39:06,352
- Let's stop here. - Wait.

2830
01:39:06,353 --> 01:39:07,852
It would be better to move on to Round Two.

2831
01:39:07,853 --> 01:39:09,653
- Please. - Sit down.

2832
01:39:09,654 --> 01:39:11,894
- Do you have a chance left?
- We do have a chance left.

2833
01:39:12,053 --> 01:39:14,392
If that chance is a good one,

2834
01:39:14,393 --> 01:39:15,692
- they might be able to succeed.
- They can do it!

2835
01:39:15,693 --> 01:39:17,262
Let's go to Round Two!

2836
01:39:17,263 --> 01:39:18,364
No!

2837
01:39:18,523 --> 01:39:20,693
Guys, I think I should go.

2838
01:39:21,393 --> 01:39:22,963
I'm so exhausted.

2839
01:39:22,964 --> 01:39:25,232
My heart is racing right now.

2840
01:39:25,233 --> 01:39:26,732
All right. Ju Won, you decide.

2841
01:39:26,733 --> 01:39:28,074
- Yes. - Ju Won.

2842
01:39:28,404 --> 01:39:30,442
Stop the game or move on to Round Two?

2843
01:39:30,443 --> 01:39:31,904
What do you choose, Ju Won?

2844
01:39:32,103 --> 01:39:33,244
I...

2845
01:39:33,643 --> 01:39:35,963
- Hey, you dropped that.
- Choose to move on to Round Two!

2846
01:39:38,214 --> 01:39:39,313
Really?

2847
01:39:39,683 --> 01:39:41,653
(Let's go to Round 2!)

2848
01:39:41,654 --> 01:39:42,954
Yes, go ahead!

2849
01:39:43,824 --> 01:39:45,283
(What shall we do?)

2850
01:39:45,284 --> 01:39:46,853
- Are you sure? - Yes!

2851
01:39:47,794 --> 01:39:49,722
- You have one chance left.
- Okay. Let's go.

2852
01:39:49,723 --> 01:39:51,192
You have one chance left.

2853
01:39:51,193 --> 01:39:53,533
If you get a good one, you can make it.

2854
01:39:53,534 --> 01:39:54,762
- Okay. Go. - Let's eat it.

2855
01:39:54,763 --> 01:39:55,833
It's Round Two.

2856
01:39:55,834 --> 01:39:58,063
- Break it. - You mustn't regret it.

2857
01:39:58,303 --> 01:39:59,772
Please read it aloud.

2858
01:39:59,773 --> 01:40:01,903
"I want to go there
with friends and Father."

2859
01:40:01,904 --> 01:40:04,302
"It's a dining certificate for
a buffet worth 500 dollars."

2860
01:40:04,303 --> 01:40:05,343
A buffet?

2861
01:40:06,244 --> 01:40:07,273
A buffet?

2862
01:40:09,044 --> 01:40:10,842
It's a buffet.

2863
01:40:10,843 --> 01:40:11,982
(Father gives a standing ovation.)

2864
01:40:11,983 --> 01:40:13,552
It's where we've been before.

2865
01:40:13,553 --> 01:40:14,713
(Noisy)

2866
01:40:14,714 --> 01:40:18,323
(A 500-dollar buffet gift
certificate to enjoy with friends)

2867
01:40:18,324 --> 01:40:20,853
Please make it.

2868
01:40:22,254 --> 01:40:23,393
Please make it.

2869
01:40:24,563 --> 01:40:26,932
You clearly promised not to do this.

2870
01:40:26,933 --> 01:40:28,432
We made it clear to you.

2871
01:40:28,433 --> 01:40:29,533
- We told you. - I need to breathe first.

2872
01:40:29,534 --> 01:40:31,854
- All right. We'll do our best.
- I need to breathe first.

2873
01:40:32,204 --> 01:40:33,472
(Round 2)

2874
01:40:33,473 --> 01:40:35,534
(Longer children's songs)

2875
01:40:35,733 --> 01:40:37,573
I'm out of my mind. This is so tough.

2876
01:40:37,574 --> 01:40:39,244
- Right. - It's too tough.

2877
01:40:39,473 --> 01:40:41,073
I wish it's a children's song I know.

2878
01:40:41,074 --> 01:40:42,472
Please.

2879
01:40:42,473 --> 01:40:44,083
Please give them an easy song.

2880
01:40:44,084 --> 01:40:47,353
(The children's song
for Round 2 is revealed.)

2881
01:40:48,254 --> 01:40:50,223
This is...

2882
01:40:50,784 --> 01:40:52,352
(The prelude sounds so familiar.)

2883
01:40:52,353 --> 01:40:54,154
(Very glad)

2884
01:40:54,393 --> 01:40:56,262
It's worth trying.

2885
01:40:56,263 --> 01:40:58,324
(It's worth trying.)

2886
01:40:58,523 --> 01:41:06,073
(Yeon Seok)

2887
01:41:06,074 --> 01:41:12,942
(Jae Suk)

2888
01:41:12,943 --> 01:41:20,153
(Jae Hyung)

2889
01:41:20,154 --> 01:41:34,062
(Juck)

2890
01:41:34,063 --> 01:41:41,333
(Jae Hyung)

2891
01:41:41,334 --> 01:41:48,312
(Jae Suk)

2892
01:41:48,313 --> 01:41:55,182
(Yeon Seok)

2893
01:41:55,183 --> 01:41:58,523
- They gave us an easy one.
- You'll go down in history

2894
01:41:58,824 --> 01:42:01,324
- No, wait a minute.
- We need to go right away.

2895
01:42:02,053 --> 01:42:05,124
I don't know that part.

2896
01:42:05,464 --> 01:42:08,963
(Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer)

2897
01:42:08,964 --> 01:42:12,433
(Had a very shiny nose)

2898
01:42:12,504 --> 01:42:16,073
(And if you ever saw it)

2899
01:42:16,074 --> 01:42:19,642
(You would even say it glows)

2900
01:42:19,643 --> 01:42:21,713
(All the other)

2901
01:42:21,714 --> 01:42:22,913
It goes, "All of the other people."

2902
01:42:22,914 --> 01:42:24,074
- All the other - "Reindeer."

2903
01:42:24,544 --> 01:42:29,853
(All of the other reindeer used
to laugh and call him names)

2904
01:42:29,883 --> 01:42:33,423
(They never let poor Rudolph)

2905
01:42:33,424 --> 01:42:36,493
(Join in any reindeer games)

2906
01:42:36,494 --> 01:42:40,192
(Then one foggy Christmas Eve)

2907
01:42:40,193 --> 01:42:43,464
(Santa came to say)

2908
01:42:43,504 --> 01:42:45,132
(Rudolph, with your nose so bright)

2909
01:42:45,133 --> 01:42:48,203
- Wait, it's just Rudolph?
- Isn't it Rudolph?

2910
01:42:48,204 --> 01:42:49,942
- Isn't it Rudolph with your nose?
- Rudolph with your nose

2911
01:42:49,943 --> 01:42:51,642
It's Rudolph.

2912
01:42:51,643 --> 01:42:52,873
- Is it? - Yes.

2913
01:42:52,874 --> 01:42:54,573
- That's what I heard.
- It's not "Rudolph with your nose?"

2914
01:42:54,574 --> 01:42:55,919
- It's not "Rudolph with your nose."
- That's not what I heard.

2915
01:42:55,943 --> 01:43:00,312
(Rudolph so bright won't you guide)

2916
01:43:00,313 --> 01:43:01,954
Wait, I...

2917
01:43:02,053 --> 01:43:03,923
The beginning goes...

2918
01:43:03,924 --> 01:43:05,382
(What was the 1st verse?)

2919
01:43:05,383 --> 01:43:07,092
- I feel anxious about him.
- All of the other reindeer

2920
01:43:07,093 --> 01:43:08,924
All of the other reindeer

2921
01:43:09,124 --> 01:43:10,923
(He manages to memorize the 1st verse.)

2922
01:43:10,924 --> 01:43:12,563
Next, Rudolph...

2923
01:43:12,693 --> 01:43:15,534
(Now he forgets the 2nd verse.)

2924
01:43:15,864 --> 01:43:17,904
- So bright - We're in big trouble.

2925
01:43:18,263 --> 01:43:20,873
(The kids sense they're in big trouble.)

2926
01:43:20,874 --> 01:43:23,303
How come only Jae
Hyung's part is difficult?

2927
01:43:23,603 --> 01:43:25,543
- His seat is... - Can we change seats?

2928
01:43:25,544 --> 01:43:27,442
- How come it happens with him?
- Can't we change seats?

2929
01:43:27,443 --> 01:43:28,673
- Can we? - No.

2930
01:43:28,674 --> 01:43:31,543
- How do we end up like this? - Rudolph

2931
01:43:31,544 --> 01:43:34,754
- So bright - The previous
one, the first verse.

2932
01:43:36,584 --> 01:43:39,454
(He memorizes the 1st and 2nd verses.)

2933
01:43:40,424 --> 01:43:43,222
(Repeating over and over)

2934
01:43:43,223 --> 01:43:45,092
- Used to laugh and call him names
- Used to laugh and call him names

2935
01:43:45,093 --> 01:43:47,593
It's names, not name.

2936
01:43:47,994 --> 01:43:50,534
(What was the 2nd verse?)

2937
01:43:51,563 --> 01:43:55,074
(The tough section already feels wobbly.)

2938
01:43:56,574 --> 01:43:59,303
(They move on to Jae Suk's part.)

2939
01:44:00,013 --> 01:44:01,914
- What? - Wait, "the reindeer."

2940
01:44:02,143 --> 01:44:03,313
Is it "other reindeer?"

2941
01:44:03,643 --> 01:44:04,882
The reindeer.

2942
01:44:04,883 --> 01:44:08,113
- Yes. - The reindeer

2943
01:44:08,114 --> 01:44:10,314
- Isn't it "the reindeer?"
- Isn't it "other reindeer?"

2944
01:44:10,584 --> 01:44:13,654
(Jae Suk's part is controversial.)

2945
01:44:13,853 --> 01:44:16,193
- As they shouted out with
glee - I memorized it earlier.

2946
01:44:16,824 --> 01:44:18,723
Jae Suk.

2947
01:44:18,824 --> 01:44:20,293
- Then how the reindeer
loved him - Is it the reindeer?

2948
01:44:20,294 --> 01:44:23,233
- All of the other reindeer...
- As they shouted out with glee

2949
01:44:23,603 --> 01:44:25,703
(Memorizing only his part)

2950
01:44:25,704 --> 01:44:26,704
It's "other reindeer."

2951
01:44:27,174 --> 01:44:28,272
Anyway.

2952
01:44:28,273 --> 01:44:29,802
(A total disaster)

2953
01:44:29,803 --> 01:44:31,103
Let's sort this out.

2954
01:44:31,443 --> 01:44:33,744
- Shall we sing it? - Jae Hyung, come here.

2955
01:44:34,414 --> 01:44:35,643
Gabriel.

2956
01:44:35,843 --> 01:44:37,613
- Gabriel. - Are you praying?

2957
01:44:37,614 --> 01:44:39,852
I'm feeling nervous to death.

2958
01:44:39,853 --> 01:44:41,813
- And how the reindeer - This is...

2959
01:44:41,954 --> 01:44:44,623
(Checking out the problematic part)

2960
01:44:44,624 --> 01:44:47,424
- What was it?
- It's not "and." It's "then."

2961
01:44:47,853 --> 01:44:49,392
It's not "and."

2962
01:44:49,393 --> 01:44:51,693
- And how the reindeer - It's "then."

2963
01:44:52,164 --> 01:44:53,262
"Then."

2964
01:44:53,263 --> 01:44:55,563
And how the reindeer

2965
01:44:55,664 --> 01:44:57,262
- This is...
- It's due to his oral structure.

2966
01:44:57,263 --> 01:44:59,432
For his oral structure...

2967
01:44:59,433 --> 01:45:01,504
- And how the reindeer - Then!

2968
01:45:01,834 --> 01:45:04,004
- What did I say? - You said, "And!"

2969
01:45:04,174 --> 01:45:05,874
You really can't pronounce "then."

2970
01:45:06,074 --> 01:45:08,272
Do you do that when you
blow out birthday candles?

2971
01:45:08,273 --> 01:45:09,513
That punk.

2972
01:45:10,013 --> 01:45:11,383
That punk.

2973
01:45:12,914 --> 01:45:15,852
- What's wrong with you?
- How come you can't say that?

2974
01:45:15,853 --> 01:45:17,754
"Then." I can pronounce it!

2975
01:45:18,954 --> 01:45:19,954
(Snorting)

2976
01:45:21,654 --> 01:45:23,924
- We need to go before we forget. - Right.

2977
01:45:23,994 --> 01:45:25,523
Let's make it this time.

2978
01:45:25,693 --> 01:45:27,334
- Don't get it wrong. - Okay.

2979
01:45:27,464 --> 01:45:29,833
I've never felt this nervous since
I took the college entrance exam.

2980
01:45:29,834 --> 01:45:31,463
We can do this.

2981
01:45:31,464 --> 01:45:33,003
- Let's cheer ourselves.
- Children, let's say it together.

2982
01:45:33,004 --> 01:45:34,904
Gather here.

2983
01:45:35,174 --> 01:45:36,174
Come here.

2984
01:45:36,175 --> 01:45:37,873
- Let's gather our energy. - In 1, 2, 3.

2985
01:45:37,874 --> 01:45:39,972
- We can do it! - We can do it!

2986
01:45:39,973 --> 01:45:41,943
- All right. - I hope they make it.

2987
01:45:42,214 --> 01:45:44,142
- Okay. - Please!

2988
01:45:44,143 --> 01:45:46,044
- Please. - We can do it!

2989
01:45:47,053 --> 01:45:49,012
It's our ninth try.

2990
01:45:49,013 --> 01:45:50,722
- Here we go! - Play the song. Go.

2991
01:45:50,723 --> 01:45:52,560
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on try number 9.)

2992
01:45:52,584 --> 01:45:53,954
This is so confusing.

2993
01:45:54,754 --> 01:45:56,393
I feel so nervous.

2994
01:45:57,763 --> 01:46:01,163
(Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer)

2995
01:46:01,164 --> 01:46:03,333
(Had a very shiny nose)

2996
01:46:03,334 --> 01:46:04,504
There you go.

2997
01:46:04,864 --> 01:46:08,034
(And if you ever saw it)

2998
01:46:09,704 --> 01:46:11,343
(Taking a deep breath)

2999
01:46:12,004 --> 01:46:15,573
(All of the other reindeer)

3000
01:46:15,574 --> 01:46:17,512
(Used to laugh and call him names)

3001
01:46:17,513 --> 01:46:18,744
(There you go!)

3002
01:46:19,813 --> 01:46:21,914
(They got over the big hump!)

3003
01:46:22,454 --> 01:46:25,852
(They never let poor Rudolph)

3004
01:46:25,853 --> 01:46:28,924
(Join in any reindeer games)

3005
01:46:30,124 --> 01:46:32,722
(Singing in a sweet voice)

3006
01:46:32,723 --> 01:46:36,303
(Then one foggy Christmas
Eve Santa came to say)

3007
01:46:36,864 --> 01:46:39,973
(Jae Hyung, I hope you didn't forget.)

3008
01:46:41,074 --> 01:46:44,772
(Rudolph, with your nose so bright)

3009
01:46:44,773 --> 01:46:47,773
(Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?)

3010
01:46:48,414 --> 01:46:51,084
(That's it!)

3011
01:46:51,343 --> 01:46:54,552
(Then how other reindeer loved him)

3012
01:46:54,553 --> 01:46:55,584
See?

3013
01:46:55,914 --> 01:46:57,784
Other reindeer

3014
01:46:57,883 --> 01:46:59,283
(Juck insisted on "other
reindeer," but it's wrong.)

3015
01:46:59,284 --> 01:47:01,423
- It's "the." - I'm sorry.

3016
01:47:01,424 --> 01:47:03,193
- It's "the reindeer." - It's "the."

3017
01:47:03,424 --> 01:47:04,722
Please.

3018
01:47:04,723 --> 01:47:06,124
(They were so close.)

3019
01:47:06,763 --> 01:47:09,562
(Now, it's their last try.)

3020
01:47:09,563 --> 01:47:11,963
Right. It's "the reindeer."

3021
01:47:11,964 --> 01:47:13,033
It's "the reindeer."

3022
01:47:13,034 --> 01:47:16,004
How come this makes me so nervous?

3023
01:47:16,103 --> 01:47:19,004
- Please. - Please.

3024
01:47:19,374 --> 01:47:21,414
- Okay. - This is our last try.

3025
01:47:21,674 --> 01:47:23,382
- Please. - We can do it!

3026
01:47:23,383 --> 01:47:24,483
This is the last try.

3027
01:47:24,914 --> 01:47:26,013
Here we go!

3028
01:47:26,525 --> 01:47:29,990
(Out of 10 total tries,
they're on the last try.)

3029
01:47:30,170 --> 01:47:32,941
(Getting his act together)

3030
01:47:33,848 --> 01:47:37,488
(Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer)

3031
01:47:37,489 --> 01:47:41,129
(Had a very shiny nose)

3032
01:47:41,159 --> 01:47:45,498
(And if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows)

3033
01:47:45,499 --> 01:47:47,897
(Sighing)

3034
01:47:47,898 --> 01:47:51,597
(All of the other reindeer)

3035
01:47:51,598 --> 01:47:54,909
(Used to laugh and call him names)

3036
01:47:55,508 --> 01:47:58,379
(Jae Hyung passes his first line!)

3037
01:47:58,579 --> 01:48:02,147
(They never let poor Rudolph)

3038
01:48:02,148 --> 01:48:05,418
(Join in any reindeer games)

3039
01:48:05,419 --> 01:48:07,347
(Then one foggy Christmas Eve)

3040
01:48:07,348 --> 01:48:09,118
(They passed halfway!)

3041
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:12,458
(Santa came to say)

3042
01:48:12,459 --> 01:48:16,227
(Rudolph, with your nose so bright)

3043
01:48:16,228 --> 01:48:19,598
(Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?)

3044
01:48:19,859 --> 01:48:22,728
(Now, they have only two measures left.)

3045
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:25,098
(The problematic part)

3046
01:48:25,298 --> 01:48:28,838
(Then how the reindeer loved him)

3047
01:48:29,209 --> 01:48:30,978
(They got the part right!)

3048
01:48:31,508 --> 01:48:34,308
(As they shouted out with glee)

3049
01:48:34,909 --> 01:48:38,517
(Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer)

3050
01:48:38,518 --> 01:48:42,088
(You'll go down in history)

3051
01:48:42,749 --> 01:48:45,088
You'll go down in history

3052
01:48:46,518 --> 01:48:47,988
You'll go down in history

3053
01:48:47,989 --> 01:48:52,159
(They succeed on the last try for Round 2.)

3054
01:48:52,829 --> 01:48:55,728
(We made it!)

3055
01:48:56,529 --> 01:49:00,138
(Everyone is jumping in joy.)

3056
01:49:01,739 --> 01:49:05,409
(Uncle Santas complete the mission!)

3057
01:49:07,379 --> 01:49:09,048
- So... - You made it.

3058
01:49:09,249 --> 01:49:10,949
Here's the clock.

3059
01:49:11,518 --> 01:49:13,278
Round Two is completed.

3060
01:49:13,279 --> 01:49:15,347
- Yes! - Yes!

3061
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:16,908
(They got all the gifts until Round 2.)

3062
01:49:18,659 --> 01:49:19,919
Take one each.

3063
01:49:20,459 --> 01:49:21,728
Thank you.

3064
01:49:21,789 --> 01:49:24,199
- Let's distribute these. - Okay.

3065
01:49:24,329 --> 01:49:27,128
Children, we have souvenirs for you.

3066
01:49:27,129 --> 01:49:29,297
- Here you go. - Thank you.

3067
01:49:29,298 --> 01:49:31,168
- Thank you. - Merry Christmas!

3068
01:49:31,169 --> 01:49:33,698
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

3069
01:49:33,699 --> 01:49:35,168
- Merry Christmas!
- Father, this is for you.

3070
01:49:35,169 --> 01:49:37,169
(Singing)

3071
01:49:37,978 --> 01:49:41,347
(As I say)

3072
01:49:41,348 --> 01:49:44,217
- I did not believe - Ba Ul...

3073
01:49:44,218 --> 01:49:46,949
- keeps singing "As I Say." - Yes.

3074
01:49:47,148 --> 01:49:48,717
Yes, let's wrap up with that song.

3075
01:49:48,718 --> 01:49:50,148
It's another gift for them.

3076
01:49:50,959 --> 01:49:52,618
It's a huge gift.

3077
01:49:52,619 --> 01:49:54,428
- Really? - Shall I do it here?

3078
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:57,028
Juck can sing that song.

3079
01:49:57,029 --> 01:49:58,829
(Juck sits in front of
the piano right away.)

3080
01:49:59,829 --> 01:50:04,239
(Jae Suk and Juck sang the
song together 13 years ago.)

3081
01:50:06,499 --> 01:50:09,369
- It's been a long while.
- I don't know why Ba Ul likes it.

3082
01:50:09,609 --> 01:50:11,007
Did your parents play it?

3083
01:50:11,008 --> 01:50:14,249
Yes. My dad likes it, and I like it too.

3084
01:50:14,949 --> 01:50:16,477
Let's sing the first verse.

3085
01:50:16,478 --> 01:50:18,477
- We'll say goodbye. - It's a goodbye song.

3086
01:50:18,478 --> 01:50:20,948
- Shall we begin?
- Let's sing the first verse.

3087
01:50:20,949 --> 01:50:23,147
(They sing "As I Say.")

3088
01:50:23,148 --> 01:50:24,789
In 1, 2, 3.

3089
01:50:57,119 --> 01:50:59,279
- Ba Ul, do you know this song?
- Let's sing together.

3090
01:51:00,388 --> 01:51:03,928
(As I say)

3091
01:51:04,629 --> 01:51:09,199
(Things worked out today as they said.)

3092
01:51:10,428 --> 01:51:15,938
(For everyone, today
felt like a Christmas gift.)

3093
01:51:32,159 --> 01:51:33,687
(How did you feel spending a
day with special Uncle Santas?)

3094
01:51:33,688 --> 01:51:35,927
It was fun to hang out with them...

3095
01:51:35,928 --> 01:51:38,999
whenever possible.

3096
01:51:39,098 --> 01:51:43,068
They did a good job until
the end, so I was happy.

3097
01:51:43,069 --> 01:51:44,668
I applied for this...

3098
01:51:44,669 --> 01:51:49,838
to have fun with all my friends here,

3099
01:51:49,968 --> 01:51:51,879
- It was nice. - so it felt like a miracle.

3100
01:51:55,508 --> 01:52:01,289
(We hope a miracle happens
to everyone as they say.)

3101
01:52:04,459 --> 01:52:06,859
- It was... - Sagging Snail.

3102
01:52:07,159 --> 01:52:09,159
It's been a long while
since we saw Sagging Snail.

3103
01:52:09,258 --> 01:52:11,298
- It was awesome. - Sagging Snail.

3104
01:52:11,428 --> 01:52:13,528
- Thank you. - Thank you for your work.

3105
01:52:13,529 --> 01:52:14,897
- Thank you! - Thank you!

3106
01:52:14,898 --> 01:52:15,998
(We hope everyone's wish
comes true at this year-end.)

3107
01:52:15,999 --> 01:52:18,637
- Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas!

3108
01:52:18,638 --> 01:52:19,838
(Merry Christmas to everyone!)

3109
01:52:22,968 --> 01:52:25,078
(The year 2025 begins...)

3110
01:52:25,079 --> 01:52:26,637
(with the daughter of Dongjak-gu.)

3111
01:52:26,638 --> 01:52:28,279
(Pride of Dongjak-gu)

3112
01:52:28,478 --> 01:52:30,079
(Han Ji Min, Whenever Friend)

3113
01:52:31,348 --> 01:52:33,717
(With Ji Min who has talented hands, )

3114
01:52:33,718 --> 01:52:36,489
(they start the new year splendidly!)

3115
01:52:36,819 --> 01:52:38,387
(I guess our drama will hit the jackpot!)

3116
01:52:38,388 --> 01:52:40,419
(And Lee Jun Hyuk, Whenever Friend)

3117
01:52:40,789 --> 01:52:42,128
(Assisting with sweet manners)

3118
01:52:42,129 --> 01:52:43,428
(See? My perfect secretary.)

3119
01:52:43,928 --> 01:52:44,998
(You can do it.)

3120
01:52:44,999 --> 01:52:45,999
(Relax.)

3121
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:47,727
(Gentle and perfect)

3122
01:52:47,728 --> 01:52:49,169
(Please don't look at me.)

3123
01:52:49,298 --> 01:52:51,069
(He feels uncomfortable getting attention.)

3124
01:52:51,468 --> 01:52:52,897
(What a great talker.)

3125
01:52:52,898 --> 01:52:54,169
(He just whispered to me.)

3126
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,638
(Feeling embarrassed when talking)

3127
01:52:56,869 --> 01:52:58,137
(Are you nervous?)

3128
01:52:58,138 --> 01:52:59,138
(You can do it!)

3129
01:52:59,139 --> 01:53:00,507
(Shy Secretary Jun Hyuk...)

3130
01:53:00,508 --> 01:53:01,878
(and Ji Min filled with a fighting spirit)

3131
01:53:01,879 --> 01:53:02,949
You can do it!

3132
01:53:03,148 --> 01:53:04,978
(It becomes a perfect day.)

3133
01:53:05,218 --> 01:53:07,449
(I don't know why I'm tearing up.)

3134
01:53:07,789 --> 01:53:09,318
Can't I be on this show as a regular?

3135
01:53:09,319 --> 01:53:11,588
(Whenever Possible)
