1
00:00:06,247 --> 00:00:07,607
(One colorful day in November)

2
00:00:07,608 --> 00:00:09,278
This place is a first for me.

3
00:00:09,548 --> 00:00:11,147
- Me too. - I've driven by...

4
00:00:11,148 --> 00:00:13,486
- but never actually looked around. - The view is amazing.

5
00:00:13,487 --> 00:00:16,157
We're on the upper side of Hannam-dong.

6
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:18,126
Don't you come to love the mountains?

7
00:00:18,127 --> 00:00:20,227
The mountains are nice. I like mountains.

8
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,797
As you get older,

9
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:24,696
- you grow fonder of mountains. - You come to like mountains.

10
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:26,828
- You're right about that. - I like mountains too.

11
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:29,567
- The mountains. - I like plants...

12
00:00:29,568 --> 00:00:31,098
- and trees. - Trees are nice.

13
00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,937
Gosh, it's been a while.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,708
The weather is great.

15
00:00:35,778 --> 00:00:36,977
This place is lovely.

16
00:00:37,778 --> 00:00:40,947
I've only been on YouTube these days.

17
00:00:40,948 --> 00:00:42,976
Being on a TV show has been a while.

18
00:00:42,977 --> 00:00:46,186
I also watched Whenever Possible on YouTube.

19
00:00:46,187 --> 00:00:47,216
(Who are the two Whenever Friends?)

20
00:00:47,217 --> 00:00:49,187
Puffer jackets should be sold.

21
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:50,818
Right now, puffer jackets are...

22
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:52,087
At drama shoots...

23
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:53,926
- I'm already... - Goodness.

24
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:56,098
- Already? Gosh. - Hee Won.

25
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,197
- Goodness. - Already? Gosh.

26
00:00:58,198 --> 00:01:00,226
- Hi. - Hee Won.

27
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:01,638
It's been...

28
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,907
- Ji Hoon. - It's been so long, Hee Won.

29
00:01:04,908 --> 00:01:06,107
Gosh. What's this?

30
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:08,577
I meet Ji Hoon more than you, Hee Won.

31
00:01:08,578 --> 00:01:09,878
- Is that so? - Yes.

32
00:01:10,408 --> 00:01:11,506
(Today's Whenever Friends, Ju Ji Hoon and Kim Hee Won)

33
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:13,946
- Hee Won. Why aren't you... - Come up.

34
00:01:13,947 --> 00:01:15,717
Why aren't you on variety shows these days?

35
00:01:15,718 --> 00:01:16,917
- Me? - Yes.

36
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:18,946
- I'm not being asked. - Sit.

37
00:01:18,947 --> 00:01:21,256
That's not true. Don't you refuse the invitation?

38
00:01:21,257 --> 00:01:22,817
- No, I don't get asked. - Wait.

39
00:01:22,818 --> 00:01:24,827
Why are you being formal with me?

40
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:26,987
I've always been formal with you.

41
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:28,427
No, you haven't.

42
00:01:28,697 --> 00:01:30,128
(11 years ago on "Running Man")

43
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,866
(Having fun being silly to each other)

44
00:01:33,867 --> 00:01:35,997
It's okay, Hee Won. It's no big deal.

45
00:01:35,998 --> 00:01:38,137
I'm left-handed, okay?

46
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:39,836
- This is a setup. - Hee Won.

47
00:01:39,837 --> 00:01:42,507
(Teasing Hee Won without a break)

48
00:01:44,548 --> 00:01:46,107
(Naturally acting formally after 9 years)

49
00:01:46,108 --> 00:01:48,416
- Let's sit. - I haven't seen Hee Won in so long.

50
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:50,647
Why has it been this long, Hee Won?

51
00:01:51,617 --> 00:01:54,147
Well, because we didn't have a reason to meet.

52
00:01:54,887 --> 00:01:56,217
- Aren't I right? - Seriously.

53
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:57,818
(Bright)

54
00:01:57,858 --> 00:02:00,287
Did you have to say that after our opening comment?

55
00:02:01,188 --> 00:02:03,157
- Ji Hoon. - Hi.

56
00:02:03,158 --> 00:02:05,767
Ji Hoon sure is cool.

57
00:02:05,768 --> 00:02:06,998
He's full-on leather today.

58
00:02:07,128 --> 00:02:08,497
- Right? - Well...

59
00:02:08,498 --> 00:02:11,137
My stylist makes me wear leather whenever I meet Jae Suk.

60
00:02:11,808 --> 00:02:13,807
Don't you like leather jackets, Jae Suk?

61
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,337
- Me? - Shiny leather jackets.

62
00:02:15,338 --> 00:02:16,637
It'll make you sweaty.

63
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,777
We have to play some games today.

64
00:02:18,778 --> 00:02:20,178
I'll try my best.

65
00:02:21,248 --> 00:02:22,647
(Mellow eyes)

66
00:02:22,648 --> 00:02:24,416
- Hee Won. - Hee Won just looked at me sweetly.

67
00:02:24,417 --> 00:02:25,546
- How come? - We haven't met in years.

68
00:02:25,547 --> 00:02:27,417
It's been a long time since I last met him.

69
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,718
It was about 13 years ago.

70
00:02:30,887 --> 00:02:33,887
We were in a drama titled "Midnight Hospital."

71
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,326
I was just a member...

72
00:02:36,327 --> 00:02:38,098
- of the gang. - I see.

73
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:40,398
Hee Won was the second boss.

74
00:02:40,968 --> 00:02:42,196
The gang's second boss.

75
00:02:42,197 --> 00:02:44,213
Has it been 13 years since you last saw each other?

76
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:46,006
No, we were in that too.

77
00:02:46,007 --> 00:02:47,867
- The movie "The Beauty Inside." - Right.

78
00:02:47,868 --> 00:02:49,136
We were in a movie together.

79
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:51,077
- That too. - But that was a while ago too.

80
00:02:51,207 --> 00:02:53,607
How have you been, Hee Won? Wasn't your last work...

81
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:55,047
"Moving?"

82
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:57,818
"Moving" was my most recent work.

83
00:02:58,047 --> 00:03:00,818
- You know... "Light Shop." - That...

84
00:03:01,318 --> 00:03:03,516
Hee Won became the director.

85
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,226
Is he the director of the drama?

86
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,087
- Yes, he's the director. - Hee Won is the director.

87
00:03:07,088 --> 00:03:08,826
- What? - You directed the drama, right?

88
00:03:08,827 --> 00:03:10,296
Is he here as a director today?

89
00:03:10,297 --> 00:03:13,128
- That's why he looks charismatic. - Oh, that's why...

90
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:15,197
No wonder he felt strange.

91
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,107
- Wait. Hee Won? - Well...

92
00:03:18,308 --> 00:03:19,837
- How funny of you. - No.

93
00:03:19,838 --> 00:03:22,277
He didn't act like this on "Running Man."

94
00:03:22,278 --> 00:03:23,837
What's wrong with you?

95
00:03:23,838 --> 00:03:24,946
Gosh.

96
00:03:24,947 --> 00:03:28,076
- I'm not acting like a director. - No, you are.

97
00:03:28,077 --> 00:03:30,416
Your outfit is like that of a director today.

98
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:32,688
No, I simply wore what was given.

99
00:03:33,017 --> 00:03:34,956
- It was already styled. - Really?

100
00:03:34,957 --> 00:03:36,317
As a matter of fact, Haha and I...

101
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:38,386
were going on about how much we missed you.

102
00:03:38,387 --> 00:03:40,057
We wondered why you were nowhere to be seen.

103
00:03:40,058 --> 00:03:41,756
- So you directed a drama. - Yes.

104
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,657
Tell us about the upcoming drama.

105
00:03:43,658 --> 00:03:46,027
Continuing the world of "Moving,"

106
00:03:46,028 --> 00:03:47,927
it's Kang Full's "Light Shop."

107
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:49,567
- Is it that work? - Yes.

108
00:03:49,568 --> 00:03:52,907
Hee Won is the director, and I appear in the drama.

109
00:03:52,908 --> 00:03:54,338
When is the drama being released?

110
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:56,106
December 4.

111
00:03:56,107 --> 00:03:57,706
- December 4? - December 4?

112
00:03:57,707 --> 00:03:59,507
- It's just around the corner. - That's soon.

113
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:01,546
Is this your first work, Hee Won?

114
00:04:01,547 --> 00:04:02,947
Yes, it is.

115
00:04:03,178 --> 00:04:05,886
Did you cast the actors and actresses...

116
00:04:05,887 --> 00:04:07,916
- yourself, Director Kim? - Yes.

117
00:04:07,917 --> 00:04:11,017
- How he cast me was funny. - What happened?

118
00:04:11,088 --> 00:04:13,157
Hee Won called, asked what I was doing,

119
00:04:13,158 --> 00:04:14,857
told me what he had planned,

120
00:04:15,158 --> 00:04:16,697
and hoped I'd take part in it.

121
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,767
After reading the script, I said, "I like it."

122
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,396
"But which role am I acting?"

123
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:21,798
I asked what my role was.

124
00:04:22,168 --> 00:04:23,567
"Pick whatever you want."

125
00:04:23,568 --> 00:04:25,407
(Pick whatever you want.)

126
00:04:26,038 --> 00:04:27,107
(A wild way of casting)

127
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:29,007
That was an odd way of casting.

128
00:04:29,878 --> 00:04:32,707
How was it working with Hee Won the director?

129
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:34,077
Well...

130
00:04:34,878 --> 00:04:36,447
It was really nice.

131
00:04:36,918 --> 00:04:37,946
- I'm serious. - Really?

132
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:40,047
If Hee Won directs a new work, go for it.

133
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:42,386
He had six months to prepare for the drama.

134
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:44,217
He didn't miss a single day of preparation...

135
00:04:44,387 --> 00:04:45,787
and got everything ready.

136
00:04:45,788 --> 00:04:48,657
When we were at the site, everything was as promised.

137
00:04:48,897 --> 00:04:50,557
Everything was as he explained.

138
00:04:50,558 --> 00:04:52,667
There was no confusion at all.

139
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:54,297
- Was everything set? - Yes, totally.

140
00:04:54,298 --> 00:04:55,737
It was the best shoot.

141
00:04:55,738 --> 00:04:58,507
Goodness. You're being highly praised.

142
00:04:58,637 --> 00:05:01,038
I did it so as not to get criticized.

143
00:05:01,337 --> 00:05:03,336
"That's wrong. This is wrong."

144
00:05:03,337 --> 00:05:05,276
- I kept criticizing what was wrong. - Right.

145
00:05:05,277 --> 00:05:07,107
But you were now in the director's shoes.

146
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:09,548
That was why I didn't want to get criticized.

147
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:12,487
- He saw through everything. - You're right.

148
00:05:12,488 --> 00:05:13,488
(Stiff after being shy)

149
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:17,188
Are you here as a detective today or something?

150
00:05:18,058 --> 00:05:20,386
- No. - Are you here to catch a culprit?

151
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,633
(Detective Kim is always stiff.)

152
00:05:21,657 --> 00:05:23,497
You did get a good night's sleep, right?

153
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,428
- I did. - I see.

154
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,896
But I have the worst muscle cramp on this side.

155
00:05:28,897 --> 00:05:30,696
- A muscle cramp. - You've got treatment marks here.

156
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,136
It's hard for me to move right now.

157
00:05:33,137 --> 00:05:36,478
- When did the shoot end? - Sorry?

158
00:05:36,707 --> 00:05:38,346
The shoot ended on April 6.

159
00:05:38,347 --> 00:05:40,678
In a condition where you can't move well...

160
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:43,547
Hee Won, this is...

161
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,346
Is that why you can't turn your head?

162
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,216
It hurts whenever I turn.

163
00:05:47,217 --> 00:05:48,558
No wonder.

164
00:05:48,657 --> 00:05:50,187
The viewers might think...

165
00:05:50,188 --> 00:05:53,288
Hee Won has become stiff after years of not being on TV shows.

166
00:05:53,558 --> 00:05:55,326
Like he has changed.

167
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,798
But it's due to his muscle cramp.

168
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,497
Hee Won hasn't become arrogant.

169
00:05:58,498 --> 00:06:00,367
We also thought he was acting like a director.

170
00:06:00,368 --> 00:06:01,497
- No. - But no.

171
00:06:01,498 --> 00:06:02,873
- A muscle cramp. - Yes, a muscle cramp.

172
00:06:02,897 --> 00:06:05,137
This is how he's turning to look at others.

173
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:08,337
Thank goodness you spoke about your muscle cramp.

174
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,477
We had this conversation on our way here.

175
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:11,877
Yeon Seok has a pelvis issue.

176
00:06:11,878 --> 00:06:13,477
I have a pelvis issue.

177
00:06:13,478 --> 00:06:14,677
- Is that so? - How come?

178
00:06:14,678 --> 00:06:18,187
I don't know. There was one action scene during the shoot.

179
00:06:18,188 --> 00:06:20,846
It started since then. The scene was of me jumping.

180
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,318
We're simply at that age.

181
00:06:22,887 --> 00:06:25,086
If a part of the body hurts in the morning,

182
00:06:25,087 --> 00:06:26,627
it's nothing strange.

183
00:06:26,628 --> 00:06:28,257
Just think, "I'm just not well today."

184
00:06:28,657 --> 00:06:30,826
It's not a big deal.

185
00:06:30,827 --> 00:06:32,728
I get cramps when I yawn these days.

186
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:35,466
Do you know this? When you get a cramp here.

187
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,667
(Relieving the cramp)

188
00:06:36,668 --> 00:06:37,798
This is what you should do.

189
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:40,307
You get a muscle cramp when coughing.

190
00:06:40,308 --> 00:06:41,308
(Pelvis issue, Vocal cord issue, Neck issue, Feeling bittersweet)

191
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:42,507
Are you good at games?

192
00:06:42,707 --> 00:06:43,777
No.

193
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,276
- But don't you try your best? - I do.

194
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:48,377
Your outfit today worries me, Ji Hoon.

195
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:50,177
- I'm worried. - I'll do my best.

196
00:06:50,178 --> 00:06:52,447
- Right. Do your best. - Are you good at games, Hee Won?

197
00:06:52,717 --> 00:06:54,957
- I suck at it. - Hee Won sucks at it.

198
00:06:55,418 --> 00:06:57,187
Among the guests on "Running Man,"

199
00:06:57,188 --> 00:07:00,157
Hee Soon and Hee Won were the worst.

200
00:07:00,327 --> 00:07:02,497
Haha and Seok Jin always wish Hee Won...

201
00:07:02,498 --> 00:07:04,227
to come on the show.

202
00:07:04,228 --> 00:07:06,096
They want to arm wrestle with him.

203
00:07:06,097 --> 00:07:07,266
What if today's guests...

204
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,467
- can't get any gifts? - Exactly.

205
00:07:09,668 --> 00:07:12,567
Either way, we should try our best.

206
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:13,937
Hee Won turned his whole body.

207
00:07:13,938 --> 00:07:15,177
(His fighting spirit)

208
00:07:15,178 --> 00:07:17,678
- This is how Hee Won is nodding. - Yes, like this.

209
00:07:17,738 --> 00:07:19,346
- It's because of the muscle cramp. - Yes.

210
00:07:19,347 --> 00:07:20,977
Now then, let's check...

211
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:22,446
where we're going today.

212
00:07:22,447 --> 00:07:24,417
That must be why we're here today.

213
00:07:24,418 --> 00:07:25,516
What's that?

214
00:07:25,517 --> 00:07:27,724
- Today's Whenever Guest is here. - It's like a business card.

215
00:07:27,748 --> 00:07:29,357
- I see. - Yoon Young Min.

216
00:07:29,358 --> 00:07:30,386
Young Min.

217
00:07:30,387 --> 00:07:33,756
"With the love our couple received from Lucky Number One,"

218
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:35,997
"we formed a happy family..."

219
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,097
"together with Numbers 2, 3, and 4."

220
00:07:39,467 --> 00:07:41,836
- They must have 4 children. - Do they?

221
00:07:41,837 --> 00:07:44,196
"At this place, I'm devoting..."

222
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:47,108
"my 24 hours to someone's Number 1."

223
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,906
"Please become a welcome rain..."

224
00:07:48,907 --> 00:07:50,206
- What? - "in my everyday life,"

225
00:07:50,207 --> 00:07:52,447
"which passes between the line of life and death."

226
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:54,406
- What does that mean? - "The line of life and death?"

227
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,917
- A hospital? - Is it a hospital?

228
00:07:55,918 --> 00:07:57,276
Is there a hospital nearby?

229
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,446
Soonchunhyang University Seoul Hospital.

230
00:07:58,447 --> 00:07:59,516
(A Hannam-dong resident)

231
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:00,846
It could be possible.

232
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:02,558
Isn't it the ER?

233
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:04,216
- Hannam-dong. - Is it around here?

234
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,057
- Hannam-dong. - How's it a line of life and death?

235
00:08:06,058 --> 00:08:08,086
- Is it down there? - It's down at the UN Village...

236
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:09,827
- Down there? - and on the roadside.

237
00:08:10,157 --> 00:08:11,297
Shall we go?

238
00:08:11,298 --> 00:08:14,397
Wasn't it ten years ago that you were on "Running Man," Hee Won?

239
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:17,537
- It's been about ten years. - Right?

240
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,506
Have you been on any variety shows lately, Ji Hoon?

241
00:08:19,507 --> 00:08:21,776
I've only been on YouTube these days.

242
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:22,907
- I see. - Yes.

243
00:08:23,137 --> 00:08:24,178
It was a drinking show.

244
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:25,478
I see.

245
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,178
- I won't go on it again. - How come?

246
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:28,248
I don't remember a thing.

247
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,617
You mean Dong Yeob's?

248
00:08:30,618 --> 00:08:32,716
- All of them. - All of the drinking shows?

249
00:08:32,717 --> 00:08:34,746
- I can't remember anything. - That's why...

250
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,258
- What happens? - Since I know them personally,

251
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:39,658
I keep drinking and blacking out.

252
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,996
You don't drink, do you?

253
00:08:41,997 --> 00:08:43,297
- I can't drink. - Right?

254
00:08:43,298 --> 00:08:45,067
You don't drink either, right, Hee Won?

255
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,428
- No. - He can't drink.

256
00:08:46,768 --> 00:08:48,798
- Jae Suk can't drink, right? - I can't.

257
00:08:49,668 --> 00:08:52,007
- Hee Won... - Jae Suk lost too much weight.

258
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:53,438
- Me? - Yes.

259
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:55,907
We haven't seen each other in ages.

260
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,706
It's been ten years or something.

261
00:08:57,707 --> 00:08:59,677
- You're right. - Long time no see, Hee Won.

262
00:08:59,678 --> 00:09:01,008
Right.

263
00:09:01,148 --> 00:09:02,517
Yeon Seok and I talked a lot about the military.

264
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,746
Why did we talk about the military?

265
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:05,787
I don't know, but we did.

266
00:09:05,788 --> 00:09:06,788
Salute!

267
00:09:06,987 --> 00:09:08,956
- Hi. - Hi.

268
00:09:08,957 --> 00:09:10,657
(Coming across a saluting citizen)

269
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:11,986
- Nice to meet you. - A salute just in time.

270
00:09:11,987 --> 00:09:13,027
I manage this place.

271
00:09:13,028 --> 00:09:14,727
- Is that so? - Salute.

272
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,988
- Keep up the good work. - Keep up the good work.

273
00:09:18,497 --> 00:09:21,327
He's very energetic.

274
00:09:21,398 --> 00:09:23,496
You're a lot more skinnier than imagined.

275
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:24,736
I heard...

276
00:09:24,737 --> 00:09:26,538
those exact words up that hill.

277
00:09:27,008 --> 00:09:28,507
Thank you. Keep up the good work.

278
00:09:28,508 --> 00:09:30,237
(A chilling deja vu)

279
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:33,346
- We... - During "Running Man,"

280
00:09:33,347 --> 00:09:34,576
- Yes? - I was surprised by...

281
00:09:34,577 --> 00:09:36,777
how good Jae Suk was at sports.

282
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:38,888
Hee Won. You're the one who's bad at it.

283
00:09:39,217 --> 00:09:41,048
(I see.)

284
00:09:42,018 --> 00:09:43,986
I'm not good at sports.

285
00:09:43,987 --> 00:09:46,187
- Are you not? - I only look fine on the outside.

286
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:47,326
- Really? - Yes.

287
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:49,558
- Is that so? - I'm not that competent.

288
00:09:49,827 --> 00:09:50,996
- Hee Won. - Yes?

289
00:09:50,997 --> 00:09:53,097
Have you been working out these days?

290
00:09:53,367 --> 00:09:55,697
Working out? No, not really.

291
00:09:55,898 --> 00:09:58,298
What do you do then? What do you like doing?

292
00:09:59,268 --> 00:10:00,668
I don't really do much.

293
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:03,476
- He's serious. - Yes.

294
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,606
- Is that so? How Hee Won walks... - Yes?

295
00:10:05,607 --> 00:10:07,778
Has zero motivation right now.

296
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,617
(Trudging)

297
00:10:11,247 --> 00:10:12,846
- Actually, - Yes?

298
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:14,587
I'm in great condition right now.

299
00:10:14,617 --> 00:10:16,158
- Are you? - Yes.

300
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:19,527
- Hee Won... - I got so happy at the thought...

301
00:10:19,528 --> 00:10:20,887
- that we'd meet after years. - Right?

302
00:10:20,888 --> 00:10:22,658
- That includes Yeon Seok. - Right?

303
00:10:22,898 --> 00:10:24,757
- But right now, - Stick to the side.

304
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:27,467
Things are... You know.

305
00:10:27,568 --> 00:10:30,898
I prefer working with people who lack motivation...

306
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:33,307
over those who are highly motivated.

307
00:10:33,308 --> 00:10:35,308
- Isn't it relaxing? - It's relaxing.

308
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:37,507
It's hot during the day...

309
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:38,947
- but cold at night. - Right.

310
00:10:39,207 --> 00:10:41,147
But compared to before, it's a lot warmer...

311
00:10:41,148 --> 00:10:43,017
- at night. - The address is around here.

312
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,447
- Jae Suk. - "Pilates?"

313
00:10:45,418 --> 00:10:46,447
Is it this place?

314
00:10:46,788 --> 00:10:49,418
But why did it say, "Between the line of life and death?"

315
00:10:49,818 --> 00:10:51,257
Where does the map direct?

316
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:53,226
- A vet clinic? - The vet clinic is over there.

317
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:55,028
- It must be a vet clinic. - You're right.

318
00:10:55,058 --> 00:10:56,596
- It's right here. - I see.

319
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:59,027
Then the four family members...

320
00:10:59,028 --> 00:11:00,798
must be dogs.

321
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,236
It's a medical center.

322
00:11:02,237 --> 00:11:03,336
- Hi. - Hi.

323
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:05,367
- Is Yoon Young Min here? - Yes.

324
00:11:05,668 --> 00:11:06,907
- Are they inside? - Yes.

325
00:11:06,908 --> 00:11:08,007
- Is he the director? - This...

326
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:10,077
- It's a vet clinic. - It's a vet clinic.

327
00:11:10,737 --> 00:11:13,048
To think there'd be a vet clinic here.

328
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:15,418
Who sent us the story?

329
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:16,716
- Our director. - Is he...

330
00:11:16,717 --> 00:11:17,917
- inside? - Is he the director?

331
00:11:17,918 --> 00:11:19,616
- This is the director's office. - Yes.

332
00:11:19,617 --> 00:11:20,647
(Knocking to meet the Whenever Guest)

333
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:22,317
- Yes? - He was getting ready.

334
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:24,356
- Hi. - Hi.

335
00:11:24,357 --> 00:11:26,126
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

336
00:11:26,127 --> 00:11:27,357
- Hi. - Hi.

337
00:11:28,028 --> 00:11:30,226
- May I ask what your name is? - Our Whenever Guest.

338
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:31,456
It's Yoon Young Min.

339
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:33,797
- So you're Director Yoon Young Min. - Yes.

340
00:11:33,798 --> 00:11:35,897
- Is the clinic open for 24 hours? - Yes.

341
00:11:35,898 --> 00:11:37,537
- I run it... - Yes?

342
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,707
For 24 hours with my team.

343
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:41,467
How long...

344
00:11:41,908 --> 00:11:44,437
have you been running this clinic?

345
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,507
It's been eight years.

346
00:11:45,508 --> 00:11:47,277
- That's quite long. - Yes, eight years.

347
00:11:47,278 --> 00:11:48,817
Is this your first clinic?

348
00:11:48,818 --> 00:11:50,917
It's the first clinic I opened.

349
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,387
I was a paid vet...

350
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:54,716
in a different clinic before.

351
00:11:54,717 --> 00:11:55,787
- I see. - Yes.

352
00:11:55,788 --> 00:11:57,558
Your letter said...

353
00:11:58,117 --> 00:12:00,326
that with the love received from your Number One,

354
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:02,356
Numbers 2, 3, and 4...

355
00:12:02,357 --> 00:12:04,856
- came to your life. - Yes.

356
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:06,227
What did you mean by that?

357
00:12:06,428 --> 00:12:08,966
It was hard for my wife and I to have a baby.

358
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:11,398
My wife wasn't getting pregnant.

359
00:12:11,908 --> 00:12:15,476
It was becoming emotionally taxing on my wife.

360
00:12:15,477 --> 00:12:18,907
She wanted to have a puppy, so I brought one.

361
00:12:18,908 --> 00:12:20,846
Since then, we suddenly had...

362
00:12:20,847 --> 00:12:22,917
three children, one after the other.

363
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:24,716
Maybe because we became emotionally relaxed.

364
00:12:24,717 --> 00:12:27,217
- Goodness. - That was what happened.

365
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:28,887
We now have three children.

366
00:12:28,888 --> 00:12:31,517
That was why you mentioned that Number One brought you...

367
00:12:31,518 --> 00:12:32,687
- Numbers 2, 3, and 4, - Yes.

368
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:33,956
- right? - Exactly.

369
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:34,986
Isn't it a miracle?

370
00:12:34,987 --> 00:12:38,227
I thought the first dog had given birth to puppies.

371
00:12:39,097 --> 00:12:42,437
Number One, our dog,

372
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:44,167
takes great care of...

373
00:12:44,168 --> 00:12:45,866
- Does it care for them? - Numbers 2, 3, and 4.

374
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,236
- Really? - Yes.

375
00:12:47,237 --> 00:12:48,366
Our dog takes care of them.

376
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,807
What does your dog do?

377
00:12:49,808 --> 00:12:53,047
When my children were babies, my dog went to them first when they cried.

378
00:12:53,048 --> 00:12:54,807
- Really? - My dog was the first to go.

379
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,148
She was there before my wife and I went to our children.

380
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,417
Our dog would lick them or stay next to them,

381
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:00,888
and my children stopped crying.

382
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:02,917
She's a parenting dog.

383
00:13:02,918 --> 00:13:04,187
It must be touching.

384
00:13:04,188 --> 00:13:06,757
- I know, right? - We adore her. She's so lovely.

385
00:13:06,758 --> 00:13:08,657
- You must love her a lot. - Yes, we do.

386
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:11,258
Who here has a pet?

387
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,827
- We have two. - You too, Ji Hoon?

388
00:13:13,127 --> 00:13:15,126
- I have one. - You have one.

389
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,397
His name is Rita.

390
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:17,996
- Isn't your dog big? - Yes.

391
00:13:17,997 --> 00:13:20,007
- He's a English Setter. - I see.

392
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,637
- He's seven years old. - Seven.

393
00:13:21,638 --> 00:13:24,376
If a dog is seven years old,

394
00:13:24,377 --> 00:13:26,447
what kind of illness can they have?

395
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:28,817
Why are you expecting an illness?

396
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:30,317
- That's a bit... - Usually,

397
00:13:30,318 --> 00:13:32,486
people also need to be careful of some things,

398
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:33,846
depending on their age.

399
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,557
Actually,

400
00:13:35,558 --> 00:13:38,317
Rita suffered from pancreatitis recently.

401
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,057
He got better within a week after taking...

402
00:13:41,058 --> 00:13:42,596
- some medicine. - Rita is healthy now.

403
00:13:42,597 --> 00:13:44,357
The problem is that...

404
00:13:44,497 --> 00:13:46,168
Rita has become a picky eater.

405
00:13:46,528 --> 00:13:47,567
Does he want tastier food?

406
00:13:47,568 --> 00:13:49,366
- When I gave him his medicine, - Yes?

407
00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,937
- I mixed it... - You fed him snacks, right?

408
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:53,807
- into a delicious canned snack. - Right.

409
00:13:53,808 --> 00:13:55,876
- The same as children. - Leave it, and they'll eat it.

410
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:57,606
- Yes, that's why... - Ji Hoon...

411
00:13:57,607 --> 00:13:59,076
- It's a sudden advice from Ji Hoon. - He's right.

412
00:13:59,077 --> 00:14:00,746
- You have to be cold-hearted. - Exactly.

413
00:14:00,747 --> 00:14:02,846
- Is that correct? - Yes, he's spot on.

414
00:14:02,847 --> 00:14:04,946
- Cut it off right then and there. - How old is your dog, Ji Hoon?

415
00:14:04,947 --> 00:14:06,417
- My dog is ten years old. - What?

416
00:14:06,418 --> 00:14:08,017
- He's quite old now. - Yes.

417
00:14:08,018 --> 00:14:09,857
His fur has turned white.

418
00:14:10,758 --> 00:14:14,357
My dog used to be a monkey, but now he's calm.

419
00:14:14,857 --> 00:14:16,856
- He's a Shiba Inu. - A Shiba Inu.

420
00:14:16,857 --> 00:14:20,027
Aren't Shiba Inu known to be crybabies?

421
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:21,596
Yes, they're crybabies.

422
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,697
Here's the funny part. Dogs are just like humans.

423
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:26,866
My dog acts differently when I'm with him.

424
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,237
- How? - I'm strict with him.

425
00:14:29,438 --> 00:14:30,507
So...

426
00:14:30,508 --> 00:14:31,836
Is he not a crybaby in front of you?

427
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:33,347
He doesn't try me.

428
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,476
- Does he not take a shot? - No, never.

429
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:38,946
Other people can't walk him.

430
00:14:38,947 --> 00:14:40,216
Why does he refuse to walk?

431
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,057
He hates it and runs away.

432
00:14:42,058 --> 00:14:45,158
My dog would lie down if others walked him.

433
00:14:45,487 --> 00:14:46,788
But with me, he's a good boy.

434
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,126
What about you, Hee Won?

435
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:53,126
I like pets.

436
00:14:53,127 --> 00:14:54,627
Didn't you have one?

437
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:56,538
No, I didn't.

438
00:14:58,638 --> 00:15:01,167
- He has a muscle cramp right now. - I see. He looks uncomfortable.

439
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,907
- He may look stiff. - Okay.

440
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:05,277
Oh, right. I have a question.

441
00:15:05,278 --> 00:15:06,346
- Go ahead. - What is it?

442
00:15:06,347 --> 00:15:07,847
Do dogs also get muscle cramps?

443
00:15:08,077 --> 00:15:11,047
There are times when dogs do get muscle cramps.

444
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:13,417
- Is that so? - But since they can't express well,

445
00:15:13,418 --> 00:15:14,986
- it's hard to figure out. - I see.

446
00:15:14,987 --> 00:15:17,187
It's hard to know if it's a muscle cramp...

447
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:19,757
or an actual problem with the muscle.

448
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:21,257
But as dogs are flexible,

449
00:15:21,258 --> 00:15:23,456
it's not usual for them to get muscle cramps.

450
00:15:23,457 --> 00:15:25,897
Humans can express...

451
00:15:25,898 --> 00:15:27,797
- where their bodies hurt. - Exactly.

452
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:30,797
- But pets can't. - No.

453
00:15:30,798 --> 00:15:32,737
Then how do you know?

454
00:15:32,967 --> 00:15:36,337
The most important part is history taking.

455
00:15:36,377 --> 00:15:38,577
A lot of conversation is vital with the owner.

456
00:15:38,808 --> 00:15:41,446
The vet can deduce the illness,

457
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:43,976
according to the symptoms, even the hidden ones.

458
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:46,246
Some owners didn't even know those were symptoms.

459
00:15:46,247 --> 00:15:48,447
Aren't there times when...

460
00:15:48,918 --> 00:15:51,486
the owner and dog can't communicate well?

461
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:55,086
Since the owner is with their dog for almost 24 hours,

462
00:15:55,087 --> 00:15:57,496
it's easier for them to catch those symptoms.

463
00:15:57,497 --> 00:15:59,267
You were like a detective, Hee Won.

464
00:15:59,268 --> 00:16:01,297
- It's just that... - You were like...

465
00:16:01,298 --> 00:16:03,767
I have a muscle cramp right now.

466
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:05,213
(The muscle cramp detective is curious.)

467
00:16:05,237 --> 00:16:07,866
Do you mind examining his muscle cramp?

468
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,376
Sure. Where is it painful?

469
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:11,337
No, it's okay.

470
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:14,877
Don't you get asked to loosen the muscles of big dogs?

471
00:16:15,048 --> 00:16:17,376
- I do. - You look like you're in pain.

472
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,347
- No, I'm really fine. - But...

473
00:16:19,717 --> 00:16:21,346
- Your muscle cramp... - No.

474
00:16:21,347 --> 00:16:22,788
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

475
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:26,027
By the way, why did you send us the story?

476
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:27,188
You see...

477
00:16:27,428 --> 00:16:31,257
I tend to work without any spare time.

478
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,428
- Right. - Yes.

479
00:16:32,528 --> 00:16:34,767
Even during our one-hour lunch break,

480
00:16:34,768 --> 00:16:38,197
we would eat within 5 to 10 minutes most of the time.

481
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:41,706
That has become tough.

482
00:16:41,707 --> 00:16:44,707
Although we met for the first time, you look very tired.

483
00:16:45,678 --> 00:16:47,947
- I see. - The built-up fatigue...

484
00:16:48,577 --> 00:16:50,177
- Right? - Yes.

485
00:16:50,178 --> 00:16:51,777
That and...

486
00:16:51,778 --> 00:16:54,917
I've been mentally drained these days.

487
00:16:54,918 --> 00:16:57,616
I've been running this clinic for eight years.

488
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:01,527
No one can go against time.

489
00:17:01,528 --> 00:17:05,497
Encountering pets crossing the rainbow bridge...

490
00:17:05,498 --> 00:17:06,927
has become...

491
00:17:07,367 --> 00:17:08,867
emotionally challenging.

492
00:17:09,597 --> 00:17:11,268
The most recent heartbreaking case was...

493
00:17:11,637 --> 00:17:14,467
doing CPR on a patient I had been caring for years...

494
00:17:14,468 --> 00:17:16,176
before it could cross...

495
00:17:16,177 --> 00:17:17,937
the rainbow bridge.

496
00:17:18,308 --> 00:17:21,278
CPR performed over 15 minutes becomes meaningless.

497
00:17:21,548 --> 00:17:24,616
But the dog kept reacting to my CPR.

498
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,787
It blinked and tried to move,

499
00:17:26,788 --> 00:17:28,717
but not when I stopped doing it.

500
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:31,357
I did CPR for about 30 minutes until the owner came.

501
00:17:31,857 --> 00:17:34,987
And the owner told me I could stop.

502
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:38,228
But it was me who couldn't stop.

503
00:17:38,597 --> 00:17:41,426
I sank down to the floor with trembling legs.

504
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,797
After experiencing this...

505
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,573
- several times, - You had to go through that.

506
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:46,308
It took a toll on me.

507
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:48,468
So I wanted to get some good energy from you guys.

508
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:50,978
I see. That was the reason behind that.

509
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,207
Goodness. What a tough job this is.

510
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,747
- My gosh. - That's why.

511
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:58,846
I didn't realize that vets could struggle with this too.

512
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,646
We do. I've been a vet for a long time,

513
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:02,886
but I just can't seem to get used to it.

514
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:05,257
Afterward, I thought to myself that I shouldn't get too attached.

515
00:18:05,258 --> 00:18:07,227
I thought I should only focus on treating them.

516
00:18:07,228 --> 00:18:08,487
But no matter how hard I try to do that,

517
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,326
- it's not possible. No. - That's not possible.

518
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:12,268
- Right. - That's just not possible.

519
00:18:13,268 --> 00:18:14,727
It might be because of your story,

520
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:15,797
- but I can tell... - Yes?

521
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:18,097
Just by looking at your face that you cry quite easily.

522
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,467
- Right? - Yes.

523
00:18:20,468 --> 00:18:22,777
- But pet owners... - Right.

524
00:18:22,778 --> 00:18:25,606
Feel grateful to vets who take care of their pets...

525
00:18:25,607 --> 00:18:27,247
- as if they were their own. - You would be so grateful then.

526
00:18:27,248 --> 00:18:28,916
- We would be so grateful. - Right.

527
00:18:28,917 --> 00:18:30,916
Well, we're here today.

528
00:18:30,917 --> 00:18:33,146
- You said you wanted... - Let's give him some energy.

529
00:18:33,147 --> 00:18:34,147
To feel energetic again.

530
00:18:34,148 --> 00:18:36,186
We ought to liven up his day today.

531
00:18:36,187 --> 00:18:38,086
- Games... - I'll do my best.

532
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,288
Thank you.

533
00:18:40,157 --> 00:18:42,027
- So you wanted an energetic day. - Yes.

534
00:18:42,028 --> 00:18:43,757
But these guys are the opposite of energetic.

535
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:44,927
(Energy deficiency)

536
00:18:45,157 --> 00:18:46,728
All right. Let's go with Round One.

537
00:18:48,597 --> 00:18:49,997
- Okay. - The present...

538
00:18:49,998 --> 00:18:51,498
- should energize you first. - Yes.

539
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,637
What is it?

540
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,428
"You will become the best dad to your kids with this."

541
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,907
"Five day passes to Everland."

542
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,477
- Everland. - Five day passes!

543
00:19:02,478 --> 00:19:04,754
(A present from their dad, 5 day passes to an amusement park)

544
00:19:04,778 --> 00:19:06,988
I was actually planning to go there. Thank you.

545
00:19:07,687 --> 00:19:08,787
- Great. - Thank you so much.

546
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:09,916
- So this is the present. - Yes.

547
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:12,387
(Heading to the mission spot)

548
00:19:12,488 --> 00:19:13,826
All right. So...

549
00:19:13,827 --> 00:19:14,857
- Gosh. - Thank you.

550
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:17,627
A puppy is right here. I see.

551
00:19:18,397 --> 00:19:19,497
How cute.

552
00:19:19,498 --> 00:19:21,397
- This one has a long tail. - Hello.

553
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:22,698
Come here.

554
00:19:22,699 --> 00:19:23,797
(Greeting the puppy)

555
00:19:23,798 --> 00:19:25,606
All right. You know,

556
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:27,737
I'm curious to find out about our game. What is it?

557
00:19:27,738 --> 00:19:30,376
(You Can Do It!)

558
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,406
(Push the can...)

559
00:19:31,407 --> 00:19:33,907
(to land it in a target spot.)

560
00:19:33,948 --> 00:19:37,076
(Round 1: Canned pet food)

561
00:19:37,077 --> 00:19:39,487
- So... - The can has to go inside the box?

562
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:41,116
- Yes. - It's like playing curling.

563
00:19:41,117 --> 00:19:44,357
(To win, 2 cans must land in the box.)

564
00:19:45,117 --> 00:19:46,457
So two of us have to succeed.

565
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:48,386
But you can push each other's can.

566
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:50,027
Then we could end up pushing it out of the box too.

567
00:19:50,028 --> 00:19:51,227
- Right. - I see.

568
00:19:51,228 --> 00:19:53,666
You know what this reminds me of? A long time ago,

569
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:54,697
- it was... - Thanks.

570
00:19:54,698 --> 00:19:56,166
- when Yu Jin was on our show. - Right.

571
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,867
- You have to play, Ji Hoon. - Is that so?

572
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,567
(Laughing)

573
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,337
- Ji Hoon. You have to play. - Yes.

574
00:20:02,808 --> 00:20:03,936
All right.

575
00:20:03,937 --> 00:20:05,778
- We should practice. - Let's practice.

576
00:20:06,347 --> 00:20:07,376
See? Are you comfortable...

577
00:20:07,377 --> 00:20:08,576
- in the leather pants? - Yes.

578
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:09,916
- I bet they're tight. - Actually,

579
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:11,547
- they're better for this game. - Is that so?

580
00:20:11,548 --> 00:20:13,318
- This is the starting line, right? - Yes.

581
00:20:13,887 --> 00:20:15,988
You have to start there and get that in the box.

582
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:19,387
So it means 2 of us must succeed to complete Round 1.

583
00:20:19,488 --> 00:20:20,857
My gosh, this will be tough.

584
00:20:22,427 --> 00:20:23,458
(Sliding)

585
00:20:23,827 --> 00:20:25,768
You have to get the hang of it first.

586
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,366
(It perfectly lands in the target spot.)

587
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,397
My gosh!

588
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:31,968
- He's good! - Hey.

589
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:34,837
(Excited)

590
00:20:35,538 --> 00:20:36,676
Hey, what just happened?

591
00:20:36,677 --> 00:20:37,708
I don't know.

592
00:20:38,177 --> 00:20:39,907
(Jae Suk practices next.)

593
00:20:41,778 --> 00:20:43,916
- That was too short. - So I must push it harder.

594
00:20:43,917 --> 00:20:45,376
Hee Won is good at pool.

595
00:20:45,377 --> 00:20:46,777
- So he might be good at it. - Yes.

596
00:20:48,617 --> 00:20:49,657
- There you go. - My gosh.

597
00:20:49,887 --> 00:20:51,156
This should have been our first try.

598
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:52,197
- There you go. - My gosh.

599
00:20:52,357 --> 00:20:53,387
(Disappointed)

600
00:20:54,288 --> 00:20:56,127
- What? - What was that?

601
00:20:56,597 --> 00:20:58,998
It turns out, these guys were good at games.

602
00:20:59,268 --> 00:21:01,166
What is this? Is this an episode from "Moving?"

603
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:02,467
Hey, you know what? We might...

604
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:04,548
- complete Round One pretty fast. - This is hopeful.

605
00:21:05,038 --> 00:21:06,137
Push it slightly harder.

606
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,477
- Okay. - Gosh. That won't count, though.

607
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,507
- That won't count? - No.

608
00:21:11,508 --> 00:21:12,508
It can't touch the line.

609
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,076
- It can't even be on the line? - It can't be on the line.

610
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:15,508
If it's slightly over the line,

611
00:21:16,018 --> 00:21:18,277
- we'll push it in with another can. - So it has to be fully inside.

612
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:19,487
- Yes. - We got this in the box.

613
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,694
- We can totally pull this off. - Yes.

614
00:21:20,718 --> 00:21:21,994
- Let's just go for it. - If we keep this up...

615
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:23,057
Let's try it.

616
00:21:23,058 --> 00:21:24,517
- All right. - I'm nervous.

617
00:21:24,518 --> 00:21:25,616
Let's do a team cheer. All right.

618
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:26,957
We got this. All right. Bring it in.

619
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,078
- In 1, 2, 3. We got this! - In 1, 2, 3. We got this!

620
00:21:29,258 --> 00:21:31,896
- You... - We must liven up Young Min's day.

621
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:32,926
Should we go for it?

622
00:21:32,927 --> 00:21:34,998
His energy level is pretty low.

623
00:21:35,397 --> 00:21:37,836
- I'll give you good energy. - Thank you.

624
00:21:37,837 --> 00:21:39,336
- Hee Won. - He's the least energetic among us.

625
00:21:39,337 --> 00:21:40,666
You go and find more energy for yourself first.

626
00:21:40,667 --> 00:21:43,053
- I'll give you some energy. - You find more energy for yourself.

627
00:21:43,077 --> 00:21:45,607
- Everything will be good. - Okay.

628
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:46,847
Thank you.

629
00:21:47,048 --> 00:21:48,646
Hee Won. Say, "Here I go," loudly.

630
00:21:48,647 --> 00:21:49,748
- Yes. - Here I go.

631
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:51,747
Here we go.

632
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:52,847
This is our first try.

633
00:21:53,647 --> 00:21:54,887
(Glaring)

634
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:57,117
(Hee Won will start off the game.)

635
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:00,887
No!

636
00:22:00,888 --> 00:22:02,288
(His can goes past the box.)

637
00:22:02,327 --> 00:22:03,327
It went too far.

638
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:04,698
I'm sorry.

639
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,198
(He apologizes right away.)

640
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,127
- Should I go for it? - You go for it.

641
00:22:08,298 --> 00:22:10,418
You sounded disappointed, but you weren't even close.

642
00:22:11,768 --> 00:22:13,067
It's better to fall short...

643
00:22:13,068 --> 00:22:15,136
- than go over the box. - Right. It's better to be gentle.

644
00:22:15,137 --> 00:22:16,176
Go ahead.

645
00:22:16,177 --> 00:22:18,113
- I'll be gentle with my push. - The probability will go down then.

646
00:22:18,137 --> 00:22:20,407
- You got this. Let's do this. - I'll be gentle.

647
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:23,847
(It was short.)

648
00:22:24,278 --> 00:22:26,218
- You can push my can in. - Okay.

649
00:22:27,288 --> 00:22:28,517
- Ji Hoon, you go first. - It happened as planned.

650
00:22:28,518 --> 00:22:30,356
- Mine didn't hit the box yet. - You try it, Ji Hoon.

651
00:22:30,357 --> 00:22:31,987
- That's better than going over. - Should I go?

652
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:33,926
- Okay. Here I go. Right. - You can hit his can.

653
00:22:33,927 --> 00:22:35,086
Gently hit my can.

654
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:36,356
- You can hit the can. - Okay.

655
00:22:36,357 --> 00:22:37,957
(Their strategy is to push in the can in the front.)

656
00:22:37,958 --> 00:22:39,198
(The target can)

657
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:40,826
- You got this. - I got this.

658
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:42,738
Let's do this. Let's complete Round One.

659
00:22:43,768 --> 00:22:44,768
Let's do it.

660
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:56,577
(The man in the leather pants sinks his head.)

661
00:22:57,917 --> 00:22:59,948
(What was that?)

662
00:23:00,687 --> 00:23:02,147
- Gosh. - Ji Hoon.

663
00:23:02,387 --> 00:23:03,488
- What... - Hey.

664
00:23:03,617 --> 00:23:05,718
This is why I told you not to wear leather pants.

665
00:23:05,887 --> 00:23:07,488
- I... - Your legs are too stiff.

666
00:23:07,788 --> 00:23:09,958
- He seemed so determined. - Hey.

667
00:23:10,397 --> 00:23:11,757
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

668
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:12,798
Come on!

669
00:23:12,927 --> 00:23:15,027
You know what? I can push in one of those cans.

670
00:23:15,028 --> 00:23:17,136
- You basically have to hit it hard. - Right.

671
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,366
We'll make it work.

672
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,687
(His strategy is to hit the target can hard like curling.)

673
00:23:27,248 --> 00:23:29,147
- My gosh. - I should have made it happen.

674
00:23:30,218 --> 00:23:31,677
(He was the only one who succeeded.)

675
00:23:32,278 --> 00:23:35,887
(He couldn't push in the can, but his can landed in the box.)

676
00:23:37,657 --> 00:23:38,856
My gosh.

677
00:23:38,857 --> 00:23:40,557
(They fail with their first try.)

678
00:23:40,558 --> 00:23:42,387
- Why... - My gosh.

679
00:23:42,698 --> 00:23:44,057
We were doing well before.

680
00:23:44,058 --> 00:23:46,027
- Hold on. - My gosh.

681
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:47,927
You know what I think? We must feel...

682
00:23:48,597 --> 00:23:50,068
- a bit of pressure. - Yes.

683
00:23:50,198 --> 00:23:51,866
We were better during practice.

684
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:52,867
(Practicing again)

685
00:23:54,008 --> 00:23:55,436
- Ji Hoon, this isn't cool. - My gosh.

686
00:23:55,437 --> 00:23:56,537
- What? - Once we start...

687
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:58,376
- Listen. - This isn't easy.

688
00:23:58,377 --> 00:23:59,708
(Surprised)

689
00:24:00,448 --> 00:24:02,308
(Hee Won starts practicing too.)

690
00:24:04,617 --> 00:24:07,387
- Hee Won. Come on. - He's not even close.

691
00:24:07,617 --> 00:24:09,917
Where in the world did you get the courage to try it?

692
00:24:10,258 --> 00:24:11,616
You guys were just lucky earlier.

693
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,527
- Right. They just got lucky. - We have to practice.

694
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:16,126
- Right. - Should we go for our second try?

695
00:24:16,127 --> 00:24:18,197
- Let me try it from here. - Yes.

696
00:24:18,198 --> 00:24:20,897
- Why are they suddenly practicing? - All of a sudden...

697
00:24:23,498 --> 00:24:24,896
- Yes. Just like that. - This is better.

698
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,567
- That's better, right? - Yes, this is better.

699
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:27,636
Hey, leave it there.

700
00:24:27,637 --> 00:24:28,707
- Isn't this our second try? - No. Try it.

701
00:24:28,708 --> 00:24:29,936
(Chuckling)

702
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:31,107
- Move. - You're sensitive.

703
00:24:32,278 --> 00:24:34,107
- Did you get annoyed? - No.

704
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,307
He's sensitive when he plays games.

705
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:36,617
- I totally got it now. - Good.

706
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:38,717
- All right. Let's go for it. - Should we go for it?

707
00:24:38,718 --> 00:24:40,487
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

708
00:24:40,488 --> 00:24:41,846
- Here we go! - Here we go! We got this.

709
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:43,047
It's our second try. Let's go!

710
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:44,817
I hope mine goes in.

711
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:45,856
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

712
00:24:45,857 --> 00:24:48,337
(As he was the only one who succeeded before, he'll go first.)

713
00:24:50,897 --> 00:24:51,958
You got it!

714
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:55,867
(Did he succeed again this time?)

715
00:24:56,198 --> 00:24:57,268
You got it!

716
00:24:59,238 --> 00:25:00,336
- My gosh! - Goodness.

717
00:25:00,337 --> 00:25:01,836
- We can make it work. - You can hit my can.

718
00:25:01,837 --> 00:25:03,008
- You got it! - My gosh!

719
00:25:03,177 --> 00:25:04,606
(It just needs a slight push to be in the box.)

720
00:25:04,607 --> 00:25:05,677
You can push it in.

721
00:25:06,778 --> 00:25:09,008
(The next player is happy with how it turned out.)

722
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:11,346
- Hee Won. This is our chance. - You can push it in.

723
00:25:11,347 --> 00:25:12,687
All right. Just push it in.

724
00:25:13,087 --> 00:25:15,346
- This is it. You got this. - Hee Won. This is our chance.

725
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,617
(Hee Won gets a chance to redeem himself.)

726
00:25:19,427 --> 00:25:20,856
- Let's go! - Hee Won, remember what you did.

727
00:25:20,857 --> 00:25:21,886
Push it slightly harder.

728
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:23,097
Director Kim!

729
00:25:23,397 --> 00:25:26,167
It's been a while since I saw you this enthusiastic.

730
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:28,667
(Super enthusiastic)

731
00:25:36,337 --> 00:25:38,137
- Wait, doesn't that count as in? - Hold on.

732
00:25:38,437 --> 00:25:40,548
(Doesn't that count as in?)

733
00:25:40,948 --> 00:25:42,076
It's out?

734
00:25:42,077 --> 00:25:43,217
That's out.

735
00:25:43,218 --> 00:25:44,646
Just hit my can in.

736
00:25:44,647 --> 00:25:46,217
- Here's my plan. - Okay.

737
00:25:46,218 --> 00:25:48,287
- I'll go from this angle. - Yes.

738
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,248
- Just focus on hitting only one. - It will go...

739
00:25:50,357 --> 00:25:51,457
- Ta-da. - No.

740
00:25:51,458 --> 00:25:53,257
- Just focus on hitting 1. - Just 1?

741
00:25:53,258 --> 00:25:54,528
Just focus on hitting one can.

742
00:25:54,558 --> 00:25:56,398
- Was that too much? - Yes, that was too much.

743
00:25:56,498 --> 00:25:58,126
Hey, Yeon Seok. Let's make this work.

744
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:00,067
- Just one? Then... - Seriously. Let's win this for him.

745
00:26:00,068 --> 00:26:01,267
Let's give him good energy.

746
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,944
- Let me try hitting just one. - Go ahead.

747
00:26:02,968 --> 00:26:04,166
- You got this! - I got this.

748
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:06,383
Let's do this. Make it work. Let's make a cool scene here.

749
00:26:06,407 --> 00:26:08,708
It can't fall short.

750
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:10,336
Think about doing a birdie putt.

751
00:26:10,337 --> 00:26:12,106
- It must pass through. - Yes. Make sure it passes through.

752
00:26:12,107 --> 00:26:13,107
- I must make sure it passes. - Yes.

753
00:26:13,108 --> 00:26:15,607
(Let's just push one in.)

754
00:26:16,318 --> 00:26:17,417
Be confident!

755
00:26:18,748 --> 00:26:19,887
Be confident!

756
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:22,128
- I got one in. - Did it...

757
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:23,488
Be confident!

758
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:26,156
(He gets his can inside.)

759
00:26:26,157 --> 00:26:27,357
- Great job. - My gosh.

760
00:26:27,988 --> 00:26:29,896
(He somehow gets his can in the box.)

761
00:26:29,897 --> 00:26:31,257
- Great job. - My gosh.

762
00:26:31,258 --> 00:26:33,366
- Good. You did well. - It wasn't what I had in mind.

763
00:26:33,367 --> 00:26:34,527
- That's good. - But it's in.

764
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,997
(Everyone is cheering.)

765
00:26:37,998 --> 00:26:39,238
- That's good. - But it's in.

766
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:41,067
- Anyway, that's life. - That's unexpected.

767
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:42,406
- It doesn't go as planned. - My gosh.

768
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:43,836
- Ji Hoon. Just push that in. - Ji Hoon.

769
00:26:43,837 --> 00:26:45,037
- Okay. - Ji Hoon.

770
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:46,708
- Push it in or get yours in. - Okay.

771
00:26:46,847 --> 00:26:48,007
Just do 1 of the 2 things.

772
00:26:48,008 --> 00:26:49,247
This is a lot of pressure.

773
00:26:49,248 --> 00:26:50,576
You have to make it work.

774
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:52,318
You must do it.

775
00:26:52,948 --> 00:26:54,687
Hey, you sort of look like SUNMI right now.

776
00:26:55,018 --> 00:26:56,317
You know her song, "24 Hours."

777
00:26:56,318 --> 00:26:57,356
(A sexy pose)

778
00:26:57,357 --> 00:26:59,626
- We always run out of time. Right. - Twenty-four hours aren't enough.

779
00:26:59,627 --> 00:27:00,788
Great.

780
00:27:02,387 --> 00:27:03,498
(Blowing)

781
00:27:05,397 --> 00:27:07,298
- Ji Hoon, make it work. Seriously. - Okay.

782
00:27:07,568 --> 00:27:08,866
- You got this. - I got this.

783
00:27:08,867 --> 00:27:10,396
(This is my chance.)

784
00:27:10,397 --> 00:27:11,798
Please!

785
00:27:17,823 --> 00:27:20,063
(Zooming by)

786
00:27:21,033 --> 00:27:22,264
It's okay.

787
00:27:23,464 --> 00:27:25,204
(Covering his mouth)

788
00:27:25,803 --> 00:27:28,103
(SUNMI is kneeling down.)

789
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:29,572
It's okay.

790
00:27:29,573 --> 00:27:30,603
(Trying to comfort him)

791
00:27:30,773 --> 00:27:33,014
(Unable to hear anything)

792
00:27:35,444 --> 00:27:37,113
- Can't we... - I'm sorry.

793
00:27:37,514 --> 00:27:38,984
- I'm sorry. - Ji Hoon.

794
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:42,552
- It just went past the box. - I'm sorry.

795
00:27:42,553 --> 00:27:44,283
- It went past the box. - Ji Hoon.

796
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:46,893
- Everyone... - He didn't have enough time.

797
00:27:46,894 --> 00:27:48,769
(Ji Hoon lost the perfect chance to complete Round One.)

798
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:51,622
- But... - This was really close. Gosh.

799
00:27:51,623 --> 00:27:53,983
So how far should our can be from the line for it to count?

800
00:27:54,394 --> 00:27:56,503
- Must it come in this much? - That doesn't matter.

801
00:27:56,504 --> 00:27:58,224
- Ji Hoon, what happened this time? - Okay.

802
00:27:58,264 --> 00:27:59,434
I don't know.

803
00:27:59,974 --> 00:28:01,494
I think I was under a lot of pressure.

804
00:28:02,744 --> 00:28:05,144
It looks like all of us get nervous once we start.

805
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,173
Goodness. That was so close.

806
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:08,573
I think we're under pressure.

807
00:28:08,714 --> 00:28:09,843
Yes, it's a lot of pressure.

808
00:28:10,484 --> 00:28:11,684
- Really? - Yes.

809
00:28:12,553 --> 00:28:13,883
We'll do our best.

810
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,353
What was that? Hee Won.

811
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,574
You'll get a muscle cramp on this side tomorrow.

812
00:28:18,853 --> 00:28:20,394
Don't overwork it.

813
00:28:20,454 --> 00:28:22,214
What if you wake up tomorrow morning and go,

814
00:28:22,264 --> 00:28:24,069
"What's wrong with my shoulder?" Don't let that happen.

815
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,062
- He's not using his left shoulder. - Right.

816
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:27,963
- He has a muscle cramp. - Ji Hoon, you were under pressure.

817
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:29,403
- Yes. Quite a lot. - You should go first.

818
00:28:29,404 --> 00:28:30,904
- Shall I? - Go first.

819
00:28:30,964 --> 00:28:32,103
My gosh.

820
00:28:32,303 --> 00:28:34,132
- We had the perfect chance earlier. - Right.

821
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:35,434
I hope we do well this time.

822
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,303
Try again.

823
00:28:38,744 --> 00:28:41,043
- I'll do it this time. - That's SUNMI's pose.

824
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,582
- I think I can do it. Here I go. - Go ahead.

825
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:44,582
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

826
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,913
- Are you going for it now? - Yes, I am.

827
00:28:45,914 --> 00:28:48,254
- So this one is going to count. - Okay. You got this.

828
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:51,654
Be confident.

829
00:28:52,994 --> 00:28:53,994
(Slapping)

830
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,694
Be confident.

831
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:00,033
(Grunting)

832
00:29:01,464 --> 00:29:02,533
Hold on.

833
00:29:03,434 --> 00:29:04,862
- Did you say, "Here I go?" - Yes.

834
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:07,063
- My gosh. How could this happen? - No, leave it there.

835
00:29:07,174 --> 00:29:08,573
Right. I have to leave it there.

836
00:29:08,803 --> 00:29:10,703
- I'm sorry. - Hey, didn't your palm hurt?

837
00:29:10,704 --> 00:29:11,744
A bit.

838
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,612
- Should I go next? - Hee Won.

839
00:29:14,613 --> 00:29:15,983
- Don't even try to push it in. - That...

840
00:29:15,984 --> 00:29:17,342
- We should just forget about it. - Forget about it.

841
00:29:17,343 --> 00:29:18,713
Hee Won, the three of us have to make it work.

842
00:29:18,714 --> 00:29:20,552
By the way, look at his can. His can...

843
00:29:20,553 --> 00:29:22,233
- It's in the way. - is blocking our path.

844
00:29:22,383 --> 00:29:23,423
(An obstacle in their path)

845
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:25,223
- If this were a game of skeleton, - Right.

846
00:29:25,224 --> 00:29:26,592
- our opponent... - Right.

847
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,593
(Sinking his head)

848
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,623
- Our opponent... - Right.

849
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:32,394
(Hee Won gets the feel of the can on his own.)

850
00:29:32,833 --> 00:29:33,893
Here I go.

851
00:29:33,894 --> 00:29:35,214
(He moved to avoid the obstacle.)

852
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:38,264
What are you doing?

853
00:29:38,833 --> 00:29:40,103
My gosh. This...

854
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:44,174
(Adding one more obstacle)

855
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:46,243
- What are you doing? - They're the worst.

856
00:29:46,244 --> 00:29:47,644
My gosh. This...

857
00:29:47,944 --> 00:29:49,042
Come on.

858
00:29:49,043 --> 00:29:50,643
(The duo from "Light Shop" causes trouble.)

859
00:29:50,644 --> 00:29:52,283
- They're the worst guests. - Right.

860
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:54,183
- I... - How...

861
00:29:54,184 --> 00:29:55,454
Seriously.

862
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:57,224
Why are you blocking our path?

863
00:29:58,783 --> 00:30:01,092
Hee Won, Ji Hoon. Why did you block our path?

864
00:30:01,093 --> 00:30:03,693
I'm not sure. Gosh, I'm too embarrassed to face you.

865
00:30:03,694 --> 00:30:04,993
- My gosh. - Hey, look.

866
00:30:04,994 --> 00:30:06,393
- But Young Min is laughing a lot. - Let's try it.

867
00:30:06,394 --> 00:30:07,394
- Right. - Yes.

868
00:30:07,395 --> 00:30:08,893
- Thanks to you. - You're laughing a lot, right?

869
00:30:08,894 --> 00:30:10,003
- Yes, thanks to you. - Right.

870
00:30:10,004 --> 00:30:11,832
- I love it. - I think he laughed out of shock.

871
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:12,833
All right.

872
00:30:13,533 --> 00:30:15,572
- Jae Suk, you have to get it in. - Push it hard.

873
00:30:15,573 --> 00:30:16,603
I must.

874
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:20,049
- My gosh. The direction... - But...

875
00:30:20,073 --> 00:30:21,842
My direction was off because of those two cans.

876
00:30:21,843 --> 00:30:23,612
If not, it would've been in the box.

877
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,513
- You should... - I'll hit the cans really hard.

878
00:30:25,514 --> 00:30:27,484
- Yes, hit them hard. - No matter what happens...

879
00:30:30,783 --> 00:30:32,623
(Focused)

880
00:30:37,924 --> 00:30:39,063
Hey, that was...

881
00:30:40,164 --> 00:30:41,393
(But he did push two cans!)

882
00:30:41,394 --> 00:30:42,703
My gosh, he was so close!

883
00:30:42,704 --> 00:30:44,433
- You did well. - Gosh, that was good.

884
00:30:44,434 --> 00:30:46,674
- My gosh. We got this. - Goodness.

885
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:49,043
- Okay. - But we haven't won anything.

886
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:51,873
Gosh, that was so close.

887
00:30:52,313 --> 00:30:53,713
This is our fourth try already.

888
00:30:53,714 --> 00:30:55,643
- We must succeed this time. Okay. - Yes.

889
00:30:55,644 --> 00:30:57,643
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

890
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:58,743
Who will go first?

891
00:30:58,744 --> 00:31:00,053
- I'll go first. - Great.

892
00:31:00,514 --> 00:31:04,052
(Hee Won is back to being the first player.)

893
00:31:04,053 --> 00:31:07,954
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

894
00:31:08,894 --> 00:31:09,894
Please.

895
00:31:10,724 --> 00:31:12,632
It will be great if his can ends up in the box.

896
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:15,833
(Careful)

897
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:17,603
Show us.

898
00:31:22,644 --> 00:31:24,203
(It safely stops right before the line.)

899
00:31:24,204 --> 00:31:25,444
Isn't this acceptable?

900
00:31:26,214 --> 00:31:29,514
(It will only count if it hasn't gone over the line.)

901
00:31:35,014 --> 00:31:37,883
(It stopped before the line just by a hair.)

902
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:39,622
- It's good. We got this. - Yes!

903
00:31:39,623 --> 00:31:40,654
All right. Hold on.

904
00:31:41,023 --> 00:31:43,393
- Then we can't hit his can. - We got this.

905
00:31:43,394 --> 00:31:45,322
- Right. - We can't hit his can out.

906
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:48,193
All right. We just need 1 more can to complete Round 1.

907
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:49,710
(They just need to succeed 1 more time to complete Round 1.)

908
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:51,264
(Glancing)

909
00:31:52,063 --> 00:31:53,203
Ji Hoon?

910
00:31:53,204 --> 00:31:54,573
(You go.)

911
00:31:55,073 --> 00:31:56,302
Don't you want...

912
00:31:56,303 --> 00:31:57,643
to have a taste of victory?

913
00:31:57,644 --> 00:31:59,173
- Ji Hoon. Go for it. - No?

914
00:31:59,174 --> 00:32:00,572
- I should go for it? - A chance to taste victory.

915
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:01,743
- Have a taste of victory. - Ji Hoon.

916
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:02,842
- Let's make it work. - My gosh.

917
00:32:02,843 --> 00:32:03,983
- You can do it. - Let's go!

918
00:32:03,984 --> 00:32:04,984
Let's go.

919
00:32:05,714 --> 00:32:07,513
My gosh. I have a bad feeling about this.

920
00:32:07,514 --> 00:32:09,523
- You can't hit the can. - Exactly.

921
00:32:09,583 --> 00:32:11,753
- It's okay. No pressure. Do it. - Okay.

922
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:12,853
(Breathing)

923
00:32:14,523 --> 00:32:17,694
(He tries it out as he feels immense pressure.)

924
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:23,964
You got it!

925
00:32:25,033 --> 00:32:26,572
You got it!

926
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:29,674
(Did it land in the box?)

927
00:32:31,103 --> 00:32:32,144
You got it!

928
00:32:36,684 --> 00:32:37,713
You got it!

929
00:32:37,714 --> 00:32:39,254
(It perfectly goes in the box.)

930
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:43,954
(Ji Hoon did it!)

931
00:32:44,883 --> 00:32:47,954
(Round 1 is complete!)

932
00:32:49,323 --> 00:32:50,723
(Nervous Ji Hoon's clinching moment)

933
00:32:50,724 --> 00:32:52,734
- That was amazing! - My gosh.

934
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:56,164
(The duo from "Light Shop" brought them the victory.)

935
00:32:56,434 --> 00:32:58,503
- My gosh. That was great. - The two of you did it.

936
00:32:58,903 --> 00:33:00,733
- Look at Hee Won's big smile. - That was...

937
00:33:00,834 --> 00:33:02,973
(Revealing his gums)

938
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:05,302
Great. Five day passes to Everland!

939
00:33:05,303 --> 00:33:07,572
- Not yet. - Why not?

940
00:33:07,573 --> 00:33:09,143
- Let me give it to him first. - No.

941
00:33:09,144 --> 00:33:10,913
- Not yet. - He'll decide what to do next.

942
00:33:10,914 --> 00:33:13,153
- We have to take it back from him. - Sure. Okay.

943
00:33:13,253 --> 00:33:14,982
So now,

944
00:33:14,983 --> 00:33:16,382
you have to decide whether or not...

945
00:33:16,383 --> 00:33:18,183
- you will keep going. - Okay.

946
00:33:18,184 --> 00:33:19,893
You just saw us play.

947
00:33:19,894 --> 00:33:20,922
It's your call.

948
00:33:20,923 --> 00:33:22,723
- Should we keep going or stop? - You have to decide.

949
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,023
Even if I lose everything, I'll keep going.

950
00:33:24,024 --> 00:33:25,223
- Go? - Yes, keep going.

951
00:33:25,224 --> 00:33:27,193
All right. We'll keep going and tackle Round Two.

952
00:33:27,294 --> 00:33:28,593
Gosh, that was great.

953
00:33:28,894 --> 00:33:30,574
- Our momentum is great now. - What is it?

954
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:33,902
- "All of your babies can enjoy it." - This is a good one.

955
00:33:33,903 --> 00:33:36,743
"Animal Crossing and Nintendo Switch Bundle."

956
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,343
- My gosh. - Hold on.

957
00:33:38,744 --> 00:33:41,374
(Cheering)

958
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:44,513
The veterinary assistants...

959
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:46,552
- Are you his family? - They are so happy about it.

960
00:33:46,553 --> 00:33:47,882
(Nintendo Switch with Animal Crossing...)

961
00:33:47,883 --> 00:33:49,223
(that the children can enjoy together)

962
00:33:49,224 --> 00:33:50,353
(Round 2)

963
00:33:50,354 --> 00:33:53,053
(The can will get longer.)

964
00:33:53,124 --> 00:33:54,692
(The can from Round One...)

965
00:33:54,693 --> 00:33:57,024
(got much longer.)

966
00:33:57,323 --> 00:33:59,563
- I see. It's heavier. - I see.

967
00:33:59,564 --> 00:34:01,593
Wait, this can might topple over and roll.

968
00:34:01,894 --> 00:34:04,263
- I think it might fall over. - It's heavier, so it's more stable.

969
00:34:04,264 --> 00:34:05,834
- I have to push it. - Try it.

970
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:11,273
- Gosh, that's heavy. - We'll have to push it hard.

971
00:34:11,274 --> 00:34:13,442
- It doesn't fall over. - It doesn't.

972
00:34:13,443 --> 00:34:15,213
(Hee Won practices next.)

973
00:34:18,343 --> 00:34:19,513
- My gosh. - Goodness.

974
00:34:19,514 --> 00:34:20,752
- Just like that. - Director Kim.

975
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:21,782
(Did you see that?)

976
00:34:21,783 --> 00:34:23,623
- He looked so arrogant. - Director Kim.

977
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:26,553
(Director Kim celebrates with a gesture.)

978
00:34:27,624 --> 00:34:28,723
(He feels excited after completing Round 1.)

979
00:34:28,724 --> 00:34:30,164
My gosh, Director Kim.

980
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:31,563
- Gosh. - Goodness.

981
00:34:31,564 --> 00:34:33,193
He's always good during practice.

982
00:34:33,463 --> 00:34:35,333
- Because there's no pressure. - Right.

983
00:34:35,334 --> 00:34:37,654
- There's no pressure. - Everyone is good during practice.

984
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:39,604
- See? - What was that?

985
00:34:40,073 --> 00:34:41,572
All of our cans are going in.

986
00:34:41,573 --> 00:34:42,603
I didn't even try hard.

987
00:34:42,604 --> 00:34:43,873
- It went in so easily. - But...

988
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:46,113
(Practicing endlessly)

989
00:34:47,673 --> 00:34:49,393
- Great. - It stopped right before the box.

990
00:34:50,113 --> 00:34:51,244
That...

991
00:34:53,014 --> 00:34:54,083
- Ji Hoon. - Yes?

992
00:34:54,084 --> 00:34:55,382
- You're getting annoyed, right? - No.

993
00:34:55,383 --> 00:34:56,923
It stopped right in front of the box.

994
00:34:57,124 --> 00:34:58,644
- Gosh. - It's natural to get annoyed.

995
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,322
It's getting hot.

996
00:35:01,323 --> 00:35:02,793
(He starts to get hot.)

997
00:35:02,794 --> 00:35:04,754
- Isn't it hot? - He took off the leather jacket.

998
00:35:05,124 --> 00:35:06,632
- Should we go for it? - Let's do it.

999
00:35:06,633 --> 00:35:08,732
- All right. Great. Let's do it. - Let's do it.

1000
00:35:08,733 --> 00:35:10,433
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - In 1, 2, 3. Here we go!

1001
00:35:10,434 --> 00:35:11,502
(They try it out energetically.)

1002
00:35:11,503 --> 00:35:12,672
- I'll go first. - Okay. Go ahead.

1003
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:14,373
I'll be confident. Let me do this confidently.

1004
00:35:14,374 --> 00:35:16,334
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

1005
00:35:16,744 --> 00:35:19,414
(Do it just like I practiced.)

1006
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:29,493
- It's good. - It's good, right?

1007
00:35:30,454 --> 00:35:32,624
(It went in!)

1008
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,524
(He succeeds as the first player.)

1009
00:35:37,124 --> 00:35:38,163
(I have a good feeling about this.)

1010
00:35:38,164 --> 00:35:39,834
- You got it. - I got it.

1011
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,793
You got it. It went in perfectly.

1012
00:35:41,794 --> 00:35:43,334
I got it. Good.

1013
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:44,962
- Okay. - Hee Won. What do you say?

1014
00:35:44,963 --> 00:35:46,672
- Do you want a taste of victory? - All right.

1015
00:35:46,673 --> 00:35:48,373
- Should I go next? - You can do this!

1016
00:35:48,374 --> 00:35:49,894
- You got this. - Let's go. All right.

1017
00:35:50,503 --> 00:35:51,503
You can do this.

1018
00:35:51,803 --> 00:35:53,323
- You got this. - Let's go. All right.

1019
00:35:53,744 --> 00:35:55,212
(They just need one more can in the box.)

1020
00:35:55,213 --> 00:35:57,283
- Don't push it out. - Let's go.

1021
00:35:57,383 --> 00:35:58,783
Don't think about that. Just do it.

1022
00:35:58,983 --> 00:36:00,183
Don't think about that.

1023
00:36:00,184 --> 00:36:02,304
- Hee Won. Just go for it. - Have a taste of victory.

1024
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:08,053
(It was a bit short.)

1025
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:12,124
(Utterly disappointed)

1026
00:36:13,834 --> 00:36:15,664
- All right. It's okay. - Okay. You go.

1027
00:36:15,863 --> 00:36:17,703
- Let's do this! - Push it in.

1028
00:36:17,704 --> 00:36:18,962
- Let's go. - But...

1029
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:20,002
- You can push it in. - Okay.

1030
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,649
- Or just get your can in the box. - Ji Hoon, just push it hard.

1031
00:36:21,673 --> 00:36:22,703
Here I go. Okay.

1032
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:24,373
- Okay, Ji Hoon. Let's do this. - Okay.

1033
00:36:24,374 --> 00:36:26,072
- Make up for your earlier mistake. - Ji Hoon.

1034
00:36:26,073 --> 00:36:27,112
- Okay. - Let's do this.

1035
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:28,144
(Breathing out)

1036
00:36:33,753 --> 00:36:34,783
(Exclaiming)

1037
00:36:36,624 --> 00:36:37,624
(Exclaiming)

1038
00:36:38,854 --> 00:36:41,394
Am I the only one who is bummed out? That was pretty close.

1039
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:42,962
What do you mean...

1040
00:36:42,963 --> 00:36:44,422
How is this...

1041
00:36:44,423 --> 00:36:46,140
- The direction was a bit... - That wasn't close at all.

1042
00:36:46,164 --> 00:36:48,233
- Wait... - I think the power was good.

1043
00:36:48,363 --> 00:36:50,063
Hold on.

1044
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:51,402
There are so many people here,

1045
00:36:51,403 --> 00:36:53,033
and nobody thought it was close.

1046
00:36:53,173 --> 00:36:54,273
You're just...

1047
00:36:54,274 --> 00:36:55,333
(Being bummed out by himself after sliding it into the corner)

1048
00:36:55,334 --> 00:36:57,274
- But... - Only Ji Hoon was bummed.

1049
00:36:57,744 --> 00:36:59,342
Only Ji Hoon was bummed.

1050
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,043
The distance was good, but the direction was a bit...

1051
00:37:01,044 --> 00:37:02,314
We should hit that one out...

1052
00:37:02,374 --> 00:37:05,113
(Yeon Seok will go last.)

1053
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:08,882
We should hit this one out, right?

1054
00:37:08,883 --> 00:37:10,623
Just push in the middle and hit it hard.

1055
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:11,882
- The middle? - Yes, the middle.

1056
00:37:11,883 --> 00:37:14,724
Don't think about pushing Hee Won's out and go in the middle.

1057
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,393
- You can do it! - It needs to be a bit powerful.

1058
00:37:17,394 --> 00:37:18,523
Let's go.

1059
00:37:18,524 --> 00:37:19,533
I can do it.

1060
00:37:21,434 --> 00:37:22,664
Let's go, retriever.

1061
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,033
Right there, okay?

1062
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,032
Hit it and go in, okay?

1063
00:37:26,033 --> 00:37:27,374
(The target)

1064
00:37:34,644 --> 00:37:36,713
Right there, okay? Hit it and go in, okay?

1065
00:37:40,014 --> 00:37:42,014
(He hit it!)

1066
00:37:42,514 --> 00:37:43,883
- Oh, no! - Oh, no!

1067
00:37:45,724 --> 00:37:48,524
(If it crosses the line, you fail.)

1068
00:37:48,854 --> 00:37:50,494
- Oh, no! - Oh, no!

1069
00:37:50,823 --> 00:37:54,132
(Screaming)

1070
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:57,503
(It was so close.)

1071
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:01,104
You did well.

1072
00:38:01,733 --> 00:38:02,942
Didn't I do well?

1073
00:38:02,943 --> 00:38:04,643
- You did. - You did really well.

1074
00:38:04,644 --> 00:38:06,373
- You did so well. - It was too strong.

1075
00:38:06,374 --> 00:38:07,442
(They're extra bummed out because he did so well.)

1076
00:38:07,443 --> 00:38:09,072
It was off by just this much.

1077
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:10,513
- It was so good. - Is that not okay?

1078
00:38:10,514 --> 00:38:11,843
That was so close.

1079
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:13,283
Oh, gosh.

1080
00:38:13,684 --> 00:38:15,113
I feel so much pressure.

1081
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:16,322
Okay.

1082
00:38:16,323 --> 00:38:18,552
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

1083
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:19,724
- Let's do it. - Here we go!

1084
00:38:20,394 --> 00:38:21,993
You should go first this time, Ji Hoon.

1085
00:38:21,994 --> 00:38:23,870
- Okay. Without pressure. - Try without pressure.

1086
00:38:23,894 --> 00:38:25,362
Ji Hoon will go first.

1087
00:38:25,363 --> 00:38:26,493
Then Hee Won will go.

1088
00:38:26,494 --> 00:38:28,240
- That combination earlier was good. - Right.

1089
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,164
- Without pressure. - Without pressure. Go.

1090
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:32,503
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1091
00:38:32,874 --> 00:38:34,172
Oh, no.

1092
00:38:34,173 --> 00:38:36,343
- Ji Hoon. I'll leave it to you. - Okay.

1093
00:38:36,474 --> 00:38:39,104
(Stretching from feeling so anxious)

1094
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:41,814
Should I eat something?

1095
00:38:42,414 --> 00:38:43,882
- This time... - Let's get it this time.

1096
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,112
(We must succeed this time!)

1097
00:38:45,113 --> 00:38:46,514
Next time will be too hard.

1098
00:38:49,483 --> 00:38:51,422
(Sliding it with no pressure)

1099
00:38:51,423 --> 00:38:53,294
- You got it... Oh, no! - Oh, it went past.

1100
00:38:54,224 --> 00:38:56,494
(Shouting)

1101
00:38:56,994 --> 00:38:58,164
Does your palm hurt?

1102
00:38:58,724 --> 00:39:01,863
(The can won't move as he would like it to.)

1103
00:39:02,394 --> 00:39:03,402
- Oh, no! - Oh, it went past.

1104
00:39:03,403 --> 00:39:06,334
(Feeling extra anxious)

1105
00:39:06,774 --> 00:39:08,733
Hee Won.

1106
00:39:09,003 --> 00:39:10,244
Let's go!

1107
00:39:12,073 --> 00:39:15,173
(They're desperate for one good slide right now.)

1108
00:39:19,514 --> 00:39:22,283
(The direction is perfect!)

1109
00:39:22,314 --> 00:39:24,053
You got it!

1110
00:39:26,593 --> 00:39:29,323
- You got it! - Nice!

1111
00:39:30,863 --> 00:39:31,993
- You got it! - Nice!

1112
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:34,593
(It went in!)

1113
00:39:35,863 --> 00:39:38,303
(Dancing happily)

1114
00:39:38,503 --> 00:39:40,334
Nice.

1115
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:42,374
He danced.

1116
00:39:43,604 --> 00:39:46,644
Hee Won. You're a really energetic person.

1117
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:48,773
Oh, gosh.

1118
00:39:48,774 --> 00:39:50,083
- You go next. - Okay.

1119
00:39:50,084 --> 00:39:52,283
(They just need to get 1 more in.)

1120
00:39:52,483 --> 00:39:54,014
The worst is if I hit that out.

1121
00:39:54,454 --> 00:39:56,283
That's a scary thing to say. Don't say that.

1122
00:39:59,894 --> 00:40:01,024
Oh, no.

1123
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:03,893
I feel too much pressure.

1124
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:05,894
(Extremely nervous)

1125
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:08,934
I feel so much pressure.

1126
00:40:09,033 --> 00:40:11,104
Just go. Don't hesitate.

1127
00:40:12,133 --> 00:40:14,733
(Giving it a go while clenching his nervous heart)

1128
00:40:21,974 --> 00:40:23,143
(A little bit too short)

1129
00:40:23,144 --> 00:40:24,184
It's on the line.

1130
00:40:24,943 --> 00:40:26,313
(The can landed on the line, so it's a fail.)

1131
00:40:26,314 --> 00:40:28,413
It stopped on the line. Oh, gosh.

1132
00:40:28,414 --> 00:40:30,752
(Suddenly feeling down)

1133
00:40:30,753 --> 00:40:33,494
I can't do it because I'm too nervous.

1134
00:40:33,593 --> 00:40:34,793
Hold on. This is...

1135
00:40:34,794 --> 00:40:37,123
- Just think of getting it in. - Yes. I think that's better.

1136
00:40:37,124 --> 00:40:39,293
I'll think of that as blocking me in.

1137
00:40:39,294 --> 00:40:40,493
Assume that mine will block you in.

1138
00:40:40,494 --> 00:40:42,063
I'll slide it slightly over here...

1139
00:40:42,064 --> 00:40:43,733
- No, Ji Hoon. - So this hits...

1140
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:46,064
Think of pushing mine out.

1141
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:47,373
- Ji Hoon? - It's not my turn.

1142
00:40:47,374 --> 00:40:48,854
- It's my turn. - Oh, it's your turn?

1143
00:40:49,774 --> 00:40:50,774
- Ji Hoon? - It's not my turn.

1144
00:40:50,775 --> 00:40:52,255
- It's my turn. - Oh, it's your turn?

1145
00:40:53,843 --> 00:40:56,414
Hee Won. I thought you were seeing a ghost.

1146
00:40:57,843 --> 00:40:59,553
Yeon Seok.

1147
00:40:59,684 --> 00:41:00,954
Why are you talking to Ji Hoon?

1148
00:41:01,253 --> 00:41:03,724
- I thought... - How do you direct movies?

1149
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:06,293
You said you really wanted to see Yeon Seok, Hee Won.

1150
00:41:06,294 --> 00:41:07,454
I just...

1151
00:41:07,693 --> 00:41:08,953
I thought it was Ji Hoon.

1152
00:41:08,954 --> 00:41:10,664
- He confuses people. - No.

1153
00:41:11,064 --> 00:41:12,293
Let's get it in this time.

1154
00:41:12,294 --> 00:41:14,163
- I'll aim it toward the inside... - Okay.

1155
00:41:14,164 --> 00:41:15,363
Of that can.

1156
00:41:17,403 --> 00:41:18,723
I have a good feeling about this.

1157
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:22,703
(We just need to get 1 more in, and it'll be a success!)

1158
00:41:22,704 --> 00:41:24,403
- Retriever. - Please.

1159
00:41:24,604 --> 00:41:25,703
Let's go, retriever.

1160
00:41:25,704 --> 00:41:28,474
(Their seventh try is in Yeon Seok's hands.)

1161
00:41:29,914 --> 00:41:31,113
Hey!

1162
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:34,314
(The direction is good!)

1163
00:41:35,814 --> 00:41:36,854
Hey!

1164
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:39,524
(Sighing)

1165
00:41:39,854 --> 00:41:40,953
Hey!

1166
00:41:40,954 --> 00:41:43,363
(They failed their 7th try.)

1167
00:41:46,294 --> 00:41:49,264
(Sighing deeply)

1168
00:41:51,604 --> 00:41:53,573
(Frozen in place)

1169
00:41:53,604 --> 00:41:54,884
It makes you freeze, doesn't it?

1170
00:41:55,934 --> 00:41:57,274
It makes you freeze, doesn't it?

1171
00:41:58,544 --> 00:41:59,644
Hold on...

1172
00:41:59,943 --> 00:42:01,814
Oh, no. I have no words.

1173
00:42:02,113 --> 00:42:03,743
I should've done it earlier.

1174
00:42:03,744 --> 00:42:05,684
- Oh, no. - What should we do about this?

1175
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:07,953
- I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.

1176
00:42:07,954 --> 00:42:09,213
Oh, this is...

1177
00:42:09,823 --> 00:42:11,524
- Let's practice a bit. - Exactly.

1178
00:42:13,454 --> 00:42:14,794
I can do it so well.

1179
00:42:15,693 --> 00:42:17,263
That's because you're not nervous.

1180
00:42:17,264 --> 00:42:18,994
- You're right. - Oh, goodness.

1181
00:42:19,593 --> 00:42:20,593
The skill...

1182
00:42:22,093 --> 00:42:24,803
Let Ji Hoon get some practice.

1183
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:26,633
He kept waiting.

1184
00:42:28,274 --> 00:42:31,204
(Earlier, he stood behind Jae Suk to wait for his turn to practice.)

1185
00:42:31,673 --> 00:42:33,773
(Yeon Seok joined the line too.)

1186
00:42:33,774 --> 00:42:37,084
(Cutting in line)

1187
00:42:37,343 --> 00:42:40,584
(Cutting in line again)

1188
00:42:40,883 --> 00:42:43,883
(Cutting in line again)

1189
00:42:44,184 --> 00:42:46,653
(He kept waiting while holding onto his pants.)

1190
00:42:47,794 --> 00:42:50,664
(He finally cracked down on the line cutting.)

1191
00:42:51,494 --> 00:42:52,494
(He endlessly waited for his turn to practice.)

1192
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:53,763
I'm sorry, Ji Hoon.

1193
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:55,484
- I didn't know... - What's wrong with you?

1194
00:42:55,593 --> 00:42:57,163
You wanted to try so badly.

1195
00:42:57,164 --> 00:42:58,834
(He finally got his chance to practice.)

1196
00:43:00,604 --> 00:43:02,033
That was too short.

1197
00:43:02,874 --> 00:43:05,974
Why do you have an X on your back?

1198
00:43:06,573 --> 00:43:08,342
(And like that, the curse of the X started.)

1199
00:43:08,343 --> 00:43:09,712
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1200
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,084
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

1201
00:43:12,343 --> 00:43:13,982
(The 8th try, fail)

1202
00:43:13,983 --> 00:43:15,943
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

1203
00:43:16,553 --> 00:43:18,684
(The 9th try, fail)

1204
00:43:19,483 --> 00:43:22,193
(They only have one try left.)

1205
00:43:22,394 --> 00:43:23,494
If so...

1206
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:25,993
- Let's have him... - Should we get his help?

1207
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:27,092
- Just look at the person. - Okay.

1208
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:28,470
(Out of the 2 coupons, they use 1.)

1209
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:30,104
- Do you want to take a break? - Sure.

1210
00:43:31,533 --> 00:43:33,834
(Ju Ji Hoon has been demoted.)

1211
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:35,873
(Laughing)

1212
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:37,973
Ji Hoon.

1213
00:43:37,974 --> 00:43:41,112
- He had to pick someone. - Right.

1214
00:43:41,113 --> 00:43:42,113
(And the coupon round began.)

1215
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:44,213
- Should I go? - Yes.

1216
00:43:44,514 --> 00:43:47,153
He handles these cans a lot.

1217
00:43:51,153 --> 00:43:53,494
(It's a close fail.)

1218
00:43:54,553 --> 00:43:57,063
(He missed the goal by a hair.)

1219
00:43:57,064 --> 00:43:58,564
That was so close.

1220
00:43:58,794 --> 00:43:59,963
That's not in, right?

1221
00:44:00,093 --> 00:44:01,434
Oh, that was so close.

1222
00:44:01,863 --> 00:44:03,032
What should we do?

1223
00:44:03,033 --> 00:44:04,203
- We need to get this. - We need to get this.

1224
00:44:04,204 --> 00:44:07,173
We need to win that game console for him.

1225
00:44:07,633 --> 00:44:08,833
(Practice is the only way.)

1226
00:44:08,834 --> 00:44:10,173
There are many cans.

1227
00:44:10,843 --> 00:44:12,474
So we can keep practicing.

1228
00:44:13,073 --> 00:44:14,414
Practice is the only way.

1229
00:44:15,514 --> 00:44:16,583
What was that?

1230
00:44:16,584 --> 00:44:17,883
(Sliding away)

1231
00:44:19,184 --> 00:44:20,213
(Sliding away)

1232
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:22,713
(Sliding away)

1233
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:25,583
(Diligent Ji Hoon is in despair.)

1234
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:26,793
- Hey, Ji Hoon. - Yes?

1235
00:44:26,794 --> 00:44:28,723
You disregard the situation and go your own way, don't you?

1236
00:44:28,724 --> 00:44:30,323
This is...

1237
00:44:30,894 --> 00:44:34,064
Okay. Who else wants to practice?

1238
00:44:35,434 --> 00:44:37,934
- Practice is the only way. - Look at everyone practicing.

1239
00:44:38,033 --> 00:44:39,434
This is our last chance.

1240
00:44:39,604 --> 00:44:41,803
- Practice as much as you need. - We need to practice.

1241
00:44:41,974 --> 00:44:43,273
- Come in. - Okay.

1242
00:44:43,274 --> 00:44:44,644
(Approximately his 100th practice)

1243
00:44:46,044 --> 00:44:48,173
- This is it. - That's it.

1244
00:44:48,274 --> 00:44:50,083
- I think we can go now. - Oh, really?

1245
00:44:50,084 --> 00:44:51,084
Just like that.

1246
00:44:51,085 --> 00:44:52,443
- Should we try? - Okay.

1247
00:44:52,514 --> 00:44:53,552
Here we go!

1248
00:44:53,553 --> 00:44:55,453
(Giving it a go when he has the feel for it!)

1249
00:44:55,454 --> 00:44:57,083
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their last try.)

1250
00:44:57,084 --> 00:44:58,752
- This is our last try. - Here we go!

1251
00:44:58,753 --> 00:45:00,323
- The tenth try. Let's go! - Let's go!

1252
00:45:00,454 --> 00:45:01,454
Let's go!

1253
00:45:01,455 --> 00:45:04,224
(The last chance to win all of the presents!)

1254
00:45:05,463 --> 00:45:08,294
(Sliding it like how he did just now)

1255
00:45:10,204 --> 00:45:11,463
(Fail)

1256
00:45:14,874 --> 00:45:17,002
(Diligent Ji Hoon's sorrowful end)

1257
00:45:17,003 --> 00:45:18,572
I'm sorry. Oh, gosh.

1258
00:45:18,573 --> 00:45:20,473
- I'll go. - I really tried my best.

1259
00:45:20,474 --> 00:45:21,720
I got the feeling for it earlier.

1260
00:45:21,744 --> 00:45:22,813
I'll go.

1261
00:45:22,814 --> 00:45:23,814
(Yeon Seok has volunteered to go next.)

1262
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:25,743
- I got the feeling for it earlier. - Let's go!

1263
00:45:25,744 --> 00:45:26,982
- Let's go. - When I put my leg like this,

1264
00:45:26,983 --> 00:45:28,112
it felt just right.

1265
00:45:28,113 --> 00:45:29,213
(He found a new pose.)

1266
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:30,883
Let's go.

1267
00:45:34,253 --> 00:45:36,193
(His can went right through the box.)

1268
00:45:40,593 --> 00:45:44,164
(The air has become cold.)

1269
00:45:44,963 --> 00:45:47,303
(Solemn)

1270
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:49,434
Hee Won.

1271
00:45:49,803 --> 00:45:51,502
- Please get one for us. - We can do it.

1272
00:45:51,503 --> 00:45:52,744
Please!

1273
00:45:54,943 --> 00:45:56,374
We can't fail here.

1274
00:45:59,184 --> 00:46:02,753
(Kim Hee Won, the key player in their success in Round 1)

1275
00:46:03,753 --> 00:46:06,553
(and Jae Suk must succeed.)

1276
00:46:06,954 --> 00:46:10,124
(Their hope rests on these two.)

1277
00:46:15,934 --> 00:46:17,862
(Please!)

1278
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:20,133
(Go in!)

1279
00:46:25,974 --> 00:46:27,943
(Fail)

1280
00:46:29,213 --> 00:46:32,144
(Gasping)

1281
00:46:37,553 --> 00:46:38,624
Gosh.

1282
00:46:40,193 --> 00:46:41,454
What are we going to do?

1283
00:46:43,463 --> 00:46:46,164
(It's too far from them to even push it in.)

1284
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:48,893
(There is already no hope.)

1285
00:46:48,894 --> 00:46:50,003
Wait a second.

1286
00:46:50,303 --> 00:46:51,303
Gosh.

1287
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:52,363
Wait a second.

1288
00:46:52,604 --> 00:46:55,172
(It is really over.)

1289
00:46:55,173 --> 00:46:57,744
(Laughing)

1290
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:03,343
(Their 10 tries end like that.)

1291
00:47:05,144 --> 00:47:06,513
You ruined the vibe.

1292
00:47:06,514 --> 00:47:08,354
No, it's okay.

1293
00:47:09,854 --> 00:47:10,882
They're taking it right away.

1294
00:47:10,883 --> 00:47:11,883
(Taking the present.)

1295
00:47:12,084 --> 00:47:13,393
(The cheerleader is sad.)

1296
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:14,423
That was so quick.

1297
00:47:14,593 --> 00:47:16,322
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1298
00:47:16,323 --> 00:47:18,063
(Instead of the amusement park tickets and gaming console...)

1299
00:47:18,064 --> 00:47:19,923
- These are souvenirs. - Thank you.

1300
00:47:19,994 --> 00:47:22,433
- This is a T-shirt. - Okay.

1301
00:47:22,434 --> 00:47:25,104
- I'll enjoy wearing it. - This is a clock.

1302
00:47:25,264 --> 00:47:27,180
- I'll hang it in the hospital. - Maybe over there.

1303
00:47:27,204 --> 00:47:28,773
- I'm sorry. - Don't say that.

1304
00:47:28,774 --> 00:47:31,374
It's okay. I loved it.

1305
00:47:33,073 --> 00:47:34,373
We should get going.

1306
00:47:34,374 --> 00:47:35,942
(It ends with them giving him energy instead of presents.)

1307
00:47:35,943 --> 00:47:37,243
- Thank you. - I'm sorry.

1308
00:47:37,244 --> 00:47:38,414
No, it's okay.

1309
00:47:38,613 --> 00:47:41,814
They recharged me.

1310
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:44,382
I felt an adrenaline rush...

1311
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,893
when they succeeded in Round One.

1312
00:47:46,894 --> 00:47:48,323
I loved it.

1313
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:50,223
Whenever possible,

1314
00:47:50,224 --> 00:47:51,923
gather, Numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4!

1315
00:47:55,294 --> 00:47:56,592
That was disappointing.

1316
00:47:56,593 --> 00:47:58,133
(The four's shoulders are sagging.)

1317
00:47:58,664 --> 00:48:01,104
(Glancing)

1318
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:03,403
The X makes me uneasy.

1319
00:48:03,544 --> 00:48:04,743
The X on your back.

1320
00:48:04,744 --> 00:48:06,143
- It makes me uneasy. - I'll put my jacket on.

1321
00:48:06,144 --> 00:48:07,643
- You should cover it. - Good idea.

1322
00:48:07,644 --> 00:48:10,612
(It's too late, but he covers the bad sign.)

1323
00:48:10,613 --> 00:48:13,113
I'm so bad at games.

1324
00:48:13,213 --> 00:48:14,583
But you tried really hard.

1325
00:48:14,584 --> 00:48:16,684
That's why I don't play golf or any other sports.

1326
00:48:16,753 --> 00:48:18,083
- I see. - It's a struggle.

1327
00:48:18,084 --> 00:48:19,623
It was funny...

1328
00:48:19,624 --> 00:48:21,464
when you were the only one who was devastated.

1329
00:48:21,753 --> 00:48:23,494
Wasn't it close?

1330
00:48:23,593 --> 00:48:26,123
It was far, but in the right direction.

1331
00:48:26,124 --> 00:48:27,394
It was in the right direction.

1332
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:29,033
I feel sad.

1333
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:30,802
What a bummer.

1334
00:48:30,803 --> 00:48:32,479
(They leave their spare time feeling sad.)

1335
00:48:32,503 --> 00:48:35,003
Let's get a meal.

1336
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:36,374
Wait a minute.

1337
00:48:36,874 --> 00:48:38,873
- Don't you live nearby? - Yes, I do.

1338
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,513
Then you must know the area.

1339
00:48:40,514 --> 00:48:43,044
- I'll tell you your options. - Okay.

1340
00:48:43,343 --> 00:48:45,743
There is a well-known dried pollack soup restaurant...

1341
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:47,552
called Hannam Dried Pollack Soup...

1342
00:48:47,553 --> 00:48:49,653
- that has a variety of Korean food. - I see.

1343
00:48:49,783 --> 00:48:52,282
Then there is a small restaurant...

1344
00:48:52,283 --> 00:48:54,552
that has stir-fried spicy pork, cheonggukjang, and grilled fish.

1345
00:48:54,553 --> 00:48:55,724
That's an option.

1346
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:57,264
There is also a budae jjigae place.

1347
00:48:57,593 --> 00:48:59,893
The restaurants I mentioned are in the same area.

1348
00:48:59,894 --> 00:49:01,632
- I see. - We can head that way.

1349
00:49:01,633 --> 00:49:03,032
- Over there? - Yes.

1350
00:49:03,033 --> 00:49:04,633
- Let's go. - Okay.

1351
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,462
Our next guest is at 3:30pm.

1352
00:49:06,463 --> 00:49:08,633
- Okay. Let's eat. - Okay.

1353
00:49:10,144 --> 00:49:11,943
(Looking around)

1354
00:49:13,144 --> 00:49:14,842
It's right here.

1355
00:49:14,843 --> 00:49:15,873
- What is? - The restaurants.

1356
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:18,083
There are many nice and pretty places in Hannam-dong.

1357
00:49:18,084 --> 00:49:19,244
(Figuring out where they are)

1358
00:49:19,843 --> 00:49:22,014
Where do you often eat, Hee Won?

1359
00:49:22,814 --> 00:49:24,052
I go to Seongbuk-dong often.

1360
00:49:24,053 --> 00:49:25,423
Do you live in Seongbuk-dong?

1361
00:49:25,584 --> 00:49:27,453
No, I don't.

1362
00:49:27,454 --> 00:49:28,752
But I'm close by.

1363
00:49:28,753 --> 00:49:30,093
- You're near it? - Yes.

1364
00:49:30,323 --> 00:49:33,092
- The place we go to. - We often see each other there.

1365
00:49:33,093 --> 00:49:34,132
In Seongbuk-dong?

1366
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:36,764
He bicycles there,

1367
00:49:37,003 --> 00:49:38,302
and we run into each other in the street.

1368
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,962
- Really? - There are cafes there...

1369
00:49:39,963 --> 00:49:41,732
- and the Bugak Skyway. - Yes.

1370
00:49:41,733 --> 00:49:43,543
- That area? - I like to go there...

1371
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:46,172
for a drive, to ride by bicycle,

1372
00:49:46,173 --> 00:49:47,842
- or to ride my motorcycle. - Right.

1373
00:49:47,843 --> 00:49:49,342
It's the same route.

1374
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:51,043
- He is always in that area. - I see.

1375
00:49:51,044 --> 00:49:52,183
I call out to him when I see him.

1376
00:49:52,184 --> 00:49:54,013
You go for a drive in that area?

1377
00:49:54,014 --> 00:49:55,183
Yes. I always go there,

1378
00:49:55,184 --> 00:49:57,023
whether it be by car, bicycle, or motorcycle.

1379
00:49:57,024 --> 00:49:58,982
You live here but go all the way there?

1380
00:49:58,983 --> 00:50:02,393
Yes, because I believe it's the best route in Seoul.

1381
00:50:02,394 --> 00:50:03,394
- That's right. - I take...

1382
00:50:03,395 --> 00:50:05,493
- Sowol-gil along Mount Nam. - You go that way?

1383
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:07,732
I pass Gwanghwamun and Samcheong-dong.

1384
00:50:07,733 --> 00:50:10,092
I arrive at Seongbuk-dong to ride along Bugak Skyway.

1385
00:50:10,093 --> 00:50:12,132
Then I take Inwangsan-gil home.

1386
00:50:12,133 --> 00:50:13,773
That's an amazing route.

1387
00:50:13,774 --> 00:50:15,774
I love it. It's the best.

1388
00:50:15,803 --> 00:50:18,002
It's also a nice route for a walk.

1389
00:50:18,003 --> 00:50:19,003
I see.

1390
00:50:19,144 --> 00:50:20,213
(Ji Hoon sees something.)

1391
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:22,373
This is the cheonggukjang place.

1392
00:50:22,374 --> 00:50:23,782
- Hello. - Cheonggukjang?

1393
00:50:23,783 --> 00:50:25,144
- There is a long line. - Gosh.

1394
00:50:25,314 --> 00:50:27,152
- It's popular. - The line is long.

1395
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:29,482
- That won't work. - It must be popular.

1396
00:50:29,483 --> 00:50:31,083
(Sad)

1397
00:50:31,084 --> 00:50:32,353
The budae jjigae restaurant is right here.

1398
00:50:32,354 --> 00:50:34,422
- Where? - Down there.

1399
00:50:34,423 --> 00:50:35,592
- Here? - Yes.

1400
00:50:35,593 --> 00:50:36,922
- There is no line there. - Right.

1401
00:50:36,923 --> 00:50:39,163
- But it's popular. - I served in the military with him.

1402
00:50:40,024 --> 00:50:41,393
- There is no line there. - Right.

1403
00:50:41,394 --> 00:50:43,634
- But it's popular. - I served in the military with him.

1404
00:50:44,463 --> 00:50:45,533
Really?

1405
00:50:46,363 --> 00:50:47,833
(Yeon Seok runs into someone he knows.)

1406
00:50:47,834 --> 00:50:49,802
- He was the driver. - The driver?

1407
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:50,874
Yes, that's right.

1408
00:50:51,073 --> 00:50:52,773
He is in charge of the parking in this area.

1409
00:50:52,774 --> 00:50:54,543
- He's in charge? - He's in charge of the parking.

1410
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:57,112
- In this area? - Yes, in this area.

1411
00:50:57,113 --> 00:50:58,953
What kind of driver was Yeon Seok in the army?

1412
00:50:59,283 --> 00:51:01,252
He's the person I respected the most.

1413
00:51:01,253 --> 00:51:03,753
(He's the person I respected the most.)

1414
00:51:05,383 --> 00:51:06,822
- He was like my father. - Thank you.

1415
00:51:06,823 --> 00:51:09,023
It's because he joined later.

1416
00:51:09,024 --> 00:51:11,294
You should salute each other since it's been a while.

1417
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:12,494
Salute.

1418
00:51:12,724 --> 00:51:13,794
Salute.

1419
00:51:14,363 --> 00:51:15,994
- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.

1420
00:51:16,564 --> 00:51:18,732
- You served with him. - Yes, he's in charge.

1421
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:20,874
- He is in charge of the parking. - Yes.

1422
00:51:21,133 --> 00:51:23,132
- Parking in Hannam-dong. - That's right.

1423
00:51:23,133 --> 00:51:24,743
Gosh, Yeon Seok.

1424
00:51:24,744 --> 00:51:26,172
You know so many people.

1425
00:51:26,173 --> 00:51:27,913
It's right here.

1426
00:51:27,914 --> 00:51:30,112
- It became famous because... - That's right.

1427
00:51:30,113 --> 00:51:31,583
People in the movie industry loved it.

1428
00:51:31,584 --> 00:51:33,612
I already smell the food.

1429
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:36,553
Director Park Chan Wook...

1430
00:51:36,713 --> 00:51:38,922
and actors like Gang Dong Won...

1431
00:51:38,923 --> 00:51:41,353
like it because the food is good and it goes well...

1432
00:51:41,354 --> 00:51:42,953
- The food is good? - with makgeolli.

1433
00:51:42,954 --> 00:51:44,223
They have a second floor.

1434
00:51:44,224 --> 00:51:45,623
It's busy inside.

1435
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:47,232
(They decide to have lunch here.)

1436
00:51:47,233 --> 00:51:48,632
Should we go upstairs? Thank you.

1437
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:49,994
Hello.

1438
00:51:51,264 --> 00:51:53,424
We're visiting a good restaurant in Hannam-dong today.

1439
00:51:54,003 --> 00:51:55,274
You haven't been here, right?

1440
00:51:55,633 --> 00:51:56,703
No, I haven't.

1441
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:59,072
You can think of this place as the Hannam-dong version...

1442
00:51:59,073 --> 00:52:01,044
- of Seocho Ha Nee's place. - All right.

1443
00:52:01,474 --> 00:52:03,782
- Hello. - Hello.

1444
00:52:03,783 --> 00:52:05,713
- They have so many tasty dishes. - Right.

1445
00:52:06,914 --> 00:52:08,883
- You know this place too? - Yes.

1446
00:52:09,153 --> 00:52:10,823
Let's choose the dishes.

1447
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:13,893
Is everything available for lunch?

1448
00:52:13,894 --> 00:52:15,153
Yes.

1449
00:52:15,854 --> 00:52:17,363
Look at that.

1450
00:52:17,624 --> 00:52:18,624
The food is delicious.

1451
00:52:18,625 --> 00:52:20,933
They have yellowtail sashimi and croaker stew.

1452
00:52:20,934 --> 00:52:23,462
The owner must be confident...

1453
00:52:23,463 --> 00:52:24,934
to put all this up on the wall.

1454
00:52:25,133 --> 00:52:27,073
- Gungjung tripe? - Gosh.

1455
00:52:27,204 --> 00:52:28,232
They have tripe now.

1456
00:52:28,233 --> 00:52:29,303
(Swallowing hard)

1457
00:52:29,673 --> 00:52:31,544
I'll have the red snow crab bibimbap.

1458
00:52:31,704 --> 00:52:34,113
- Me too. - I'll have the mackerel.

1459
00:52:34,644 --> 00:52:36,543
- Mackerel? - I'll have mul milmyeon.

1460
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:38,183
- Mul milmyeon? - Yes.

1461
00:52:38,184 --> 00:52:40,083
- Let's order something to share. - A broth?

1462
00:52:40,084 --> 00:52:41,483
It'd be nice to have a broth.

1463
00:52:41,584 --> 00:52:43,413
Let's order a main dish.

1464
00:52:43,414 --> 00:52:44,653
- A main dish? - A samhap?

1465
00:52:44,724 --> 00:52:46,354
- We'll have a samhap. - Yes.

1466
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,553
That's it.

1467
00:52:47,894 --> 00:52:48,923
All right.

1468
00:52:49,354 --> 00:52:51,163
Yellowtail is in season.

1469
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:53,593
- That would be too much food. - Gosh.

1470
00:52:53,693 --> 00:52:55,233
That would mean...

1471
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:58,233
we'd have to wrap up the shoot.

1472
00:52:59,434 --> 00:53:01,302
That's enough food. Don't order more.

1473
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,433
(Having trouble giving up)

1474
00:53:02,434 --> 00:53:05,073
- People must come here to drink. - Yes.

1475
00:53:05,173 --> 00:53:06,442
The food goes well with drinks.

1476
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:09,013
I'm not sure if it is now, but it used to be open 24 hours.

1477
00:53:09,014 --> 00:53:10,143
I see.

1478
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:12,304
So people came late at night and even in the mornings.

1479
00:53:12,443 --> 00:53:14,184
I had wine here.

1480
00:53:14,283 --> 00:53:15,882
Korean food goes well with wine.

1481
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:17,482
- That's right. - White wine.

1482
00:53:17,483 --> 00:53:18,883
Yes, white wine.

1483
00:53:18,983 --> 00:53:20,793
Do you have a high tolerance, Yeon Seok?

1484
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:23,294
- I like to drink. - He used to own a bar.

1485
00:53:24,294 --> 00:53:27,393
A few days ago, I went to Jeju Island to ride my motorcycle.

1486
00:53:27,394 --> 00:53:29,732
- Jeju Island? - Yes, I often go there.

1487
00:53:29,733 --> 00:53:31,732
- Park Sung Woong joined me. - I see.

1488
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:33,164
He rides motorcycles too.

1489
00:53:33,363 --> 00:53:35,572
We met around 1pm and drove around for 10 minutes.

1490
00:53:35,573 --> 00:53:37,543
We saw old restaurants along the beach.

1491
00:53:37,544 --> 00:53:38,942
They grill squid for you and stuff.

1492
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,842
Sung Woong said he wanted to try visiting one.

1493
00:53:40,843 --> 00:53:42,244
So we got off our motorcycles.

1494
00:53:42,414 --> 00:53:44,134
I was shredding squid when Sung Woong said,

1495
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:45,613
"Let's leave our motorcycles..."

1496
00:53:46,184 --> 00:53:47,354
"and get drunk here."

1497
00:53:49,483 --> 00:53:51,223
We drank for 12 hours from 1pm.

1498
00:53:51,224 --> 00:53:52,323
Really?

1499
00:53:53,483 --> 00:53:54,553
Seriously.

1500
00:53:54,724 --> 00:53:57,962
You seem to enjoy riding your motorcycle on the weekend.

1501
00:53:57,963 --> 00:53:58,963
Yes, I do.

1502
00:53:58,964 --> 00:54:00,264
What kind do you have?

1503
00:54:00,494 --> 00:54:02,092
- A Harley-Davidson. - I have one too.

1504
00:54:02,093 --> 00:54:03,563
Really? Let's ride together.

1505
00:54:03,564 --> 00:54:05,002
I have a Fat Boy.

1506
00:54:05,003 --> 00:54:06,632
- I do too. - I didn't expect that.

1507
00:54:06,633 --> 00:54:08,473
I have the 1999 Evo engine.

1508
00:54:08,474 --> 00:54:09,632
- It's the old one. - I have the 1994 Evo engine too.

1509
00:54:09,633 --> 00:54:11,203
- What? - You have good taste.

1510
00:54:11,204 --> 00:54:13,144
(Gosh, you have good taste.)

1511
00:54:13,713 --> 00:54:16,613
- You have good taste. - It's over 20 years old.

1512
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:19,044
It's the last engine that sounds like a galloping horse.

1513
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,283
It sounds like hoofbeats.

1514
00:54:21,553 --> 00:54:22,953
Mine is a 1994, and his is a 1999.

1515
00:54:22,954 --> 00:54:24,083
- I have a 1999. - Really?

1516
00:54:24,084 --> 00:54:26,683
The engines used back then are called Evo engines.

1517
00:54:26,684 --> 00:54:27,793
It feels different.

1518
00:54:27,794 --> 00:54:29,894
It's the same engine,

1519
00:54:30,053 --> 00:54:32,123
but his is an early model.

1520
00:54:32,124 --> 00:54:33,764
We don't know what they're talking about.

1521
00:54:34,193 --> 00:54:35,393
They're classical bikes.

1522
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:37,902
I feel all the worries vanish from my chest when I'm riding.

1523
00:54:37,903 --> 00:54:38,962
Really?

1524
00:54:38,963 --> 00:54:40,263
I drive cautiously.

1525
00:54:40,264 --> 00:54:42,473
We don't have to drive fast.

1526
00:54:42,474 --> 00:54:44,043
I usually drive along the coast...

1527
00:54:44,044 --> 00:54:46,002
at 50km per hour.

1528
00:54:46,003 --> 00:54:47,442
I drive safely.

1529
00:54:47,443 --> 00:54:48,974
I enjoy the scenery.

1530
00:54:49,173 --> 00:54:50,882
Yes, that's nice.

1531
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:52,112
- Thank you. - This is the samhap.

1532
00:54:52,113 --> 00:54:54,354
- It looks amazing. - Gosh, this...

1533
00:54:56,383 --> 00:54:58,683
- They created a combination... - They made this.

1534
00:54:58,684 --> 00:55:00,123
- Yes, there is pork... - Instead of skate.

1535
00:55:00,124 --> 00:55:01,653
They use octopus instead of skate.

1536
00:55:02,624 --> 00:55:04,763
I can tell why you mentioned the dried pollack soup.

1537
00:55:04,764 --> 00:55:07,233
(Dried pollack soup, the warm main dish)

1538
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:10,193
(Red snow crab bibimbap and mul milmyeon)

1539
00:55:11,064 --> 00:55:13,633
(It's a feast.)

1540
00:55:14,803 --> 00:55:17,244
(He tries the dried pollack soup first.)

1541
00:55:18,073 --> 00:55:19,774
(Nervous)

1542
00:55:22,644 --> 00:55:24,584
Gosh.

1543
00:55:25,443 --> 00:55:27,523
I can tell why you mentioned the dried pollack soup.

1544
00:55:27,954 --> 00:55:30,213
- It's really good, right? - Gosh.

1545
00:55:31,354 --> 00:55:33,283
I can't stop myself from adding rice to it.

1546
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,393
This is amazing.

1547
00:55:35,394 --> 00:55:36,834
(They all dig in as if in a trance.)

1548
00:55:36,894 --> 00:55:39,294
(Pleased)

1549
00:55:39,624 --> 00:55:41,764
I'd totally recommend this place.

1550
00:55:42,093 --> 00:55:43,264
The food is tasty.

1551
00:55:43,693 --> 00:55:47,334
Everyone who lives in Hannam-dong knows it.

1552
00:55:48,573 --> 00:55:49,802
Excuse me.

1553
00:55:49,803 --> 00:55:52,072
- Can we have more kimchi? - Yes.

1554
00:55:52,073 --> 00:55:54,544
(He refills Jae Suk's kimchi.)

1555
00:55:55,814 --> 00:55:56,873
Put it here.

1556
00:55:56,874 --> 00:56:00,144
(Hee Won devours the food too.)

1557
00:56:01,383 --> 00:56:02,684
(Marveling)

1558
00:56:03,084 --> 00:56:05,124
(Giving it a thumbs-up)

1559
00:56:05,553 --> 00:56:07,124
Look at this leg.

1560
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:08,453
(The thick legs)

1561
00:56:08,454 --> 00:56:09,894
This is unbelievable.

1562
00:56:10,093 --> 00:56:11,394
I'm not a pro,

1563
00:56:12,423 --> 00:56:14,664
but I think people who drink would love this.

1564
00:56:15,764 --> 00:56:19,063
(He takes a big bite...)

1565
00:56:19,064 --> 00:56:20,833
(and automatically marvels.)

1566
00:56:20,834 --> 00:56:22,974
- Yeon Seok likes this type of food. - Yes, I do.

1567
00:56:23,104 --> 00:56:24,720
- Right? - Yes, I like this kind of food.

1568
00:56:24,744 --> 00:56:27,774
(While everyone is enjoying their food)

1569
00:56:28,774 --> 00:56:30,583
(sweet Ji Hoon mixes the bibimbap.)

1570
00:56:30,584 --> 00:56:31,644
Okay.

1571
00:56:31,983 --> 00:56:33,314
Gosh.

1572
00:56:33,584 --> 00:56:35,382
(Red snow crab bibimbap)

1573
00:56:35,383 --> 00:56:36,713
This is so good.

1574
00:56:37,113 --> 00:56:38,922
I'll put this here and this here.

1575
00:56:38,923 --> 00:56:40,592
This is made of wheat, right?

1576
00:56:40,593 --> 00:56:41,724
Look at that.

1577
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:44,394
(Marveling)

1578
00:56:46,794 --> 00:56:49,794
(He finally starts eating.)

1579
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:51,803
This is amazing.

1580
00:56:53,133 --> 00:56:54,672
(He sniffs it first.)

1581
00:56:54,673 --> 00:56:56,434
(Then he takes a bite.)

1582
00:56:59,343 --> 00:57:01,744
(It's therapeutic.)

1583
00:57:03,613 --> 00:57:04,713
This is tasty.

1584
00:57:06,843 --> 00:57:08,523
Do we deserve to enjoy the food this much?

1585
00:57:09,713 --> 00:57:11,283
You're right.

1586
00:57:12,024 --> 00:57:13,224
I feel bad.

1587
00:57:14,093 --> 00:57:15,322
I forgot about him.

1588
00:57:15,323 --> 00:57:17,724
We should've brought Young Min to lunch.

1589
00:57:19,323 --> 00:57:20,394
Ji Hoon.

1590
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:22,270
I'm only saying this since it's over.

1591
00:57:22,294 --> 00:57:23,863
But I hope you do better next time.

1592
00:57:25,334 --> 00:57:26,933
Yes, I'll try my best.

1593
00:57:26,934 --> 00:57:27,973
(Feeling apologetic)

1594
00:57:27,974 --> 00:57:29,703
Hee Won surprisingly...

1595
00:57:29,704 --> 00:57:31,274
succeeded a few times.

1596
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,874
(Smiling)

1597
00:57:34,774 --> 00:57:36,734
- That was a good meal. - It was an amazing meal.

1598
00:57:37,213 --> 00:57:38,782
Someone has to pay.

1599
00:57:38,783 --> 00:57:40,854
Isn't the director paying?

1600
00:57:40,883 --> 00:57:42,782
- No. - Director Kim Hee Won?

1601
00:57:42,783 --> 00:57:44,084
(Nodding?)

1602
00:57:44,124 --> 00:57:45,404
Should we play a game to decide?

1603
00:57:46,184 --> 00:57:48,052
- Sounds good. - Should we play a game?

1604
00:57:48,053 --> 00:57:49,822
(Who will get the check?)

1605
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,463
- What do you think of that? - What?

1606
00:57:51,994 --> 00:57:54,064
- I'll add some rice to this soup. - And?

1607
00:57:54,334 --> 00:57:55,434
We scoop the rice up...

1608
00:57:56,334 --> 00:57:57,764
with chopsticks.

1609
00:57:57,934 --> 00:57:59,362
You get one try.

1610
00:57:59,363 --> 00:58:00,874
- Good idea. - One try?

1611
00:58:01,003 --> 00:58:02,572
Whoever has...

1612
00:58:02,573 --> 00:58:05,104
- The most wins? - the least pays.

1613
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:07,313
- Okay. - Even if we don't count it.

1614
00:58:07,314 --> 00:58:08,314
Here I go.

1615
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,613
(They start playing right away.)

1616
00:58:11,814 --> 00:58:12,883
Gosh.

1617
00:58:13,814 --> 00:58:15,552
(It's just a game, )

1618
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:16,553
(but the four turn serious.)

1619
00:58:16,554 --> 00:58:18,024
It's over if you move.

1620
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:20,482
- No, they're slipping through. - Bring it up in one swift move.

1621
00:58:20,483 --> 00:58:21,843
(Who will lose and pay for lunch?)

1622
00:58:21,923 --> 00:58:23,223
- Thank you for the lunch. - Of course.

1623
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:25,592
(Director Kim paid!)

1624
00:58:25,593 --> 00:58:27,493
- Thank you for the lunch. - Thank you for the lunch.

1625
00:58:27,494 --> 00:58:28,962
- Gosh. - Director Kim.

1626
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,403
- Thank you for the lunch. - I'm furious.

1627
00:58:31,963 --> 00:58:33,133
You're furious?

1628
00:58:33,334 --> 00:58:35,232
(After lunch)

1629
00:58:35,233 --> 00:58:37,342
- I'm a chef and a huge fan. - Really?

1630
00:58:37,343 --> 00:58:39,544
- I just made this, and it's tasty. - Thank you.

1631
00:58:40,713 --> 00:58:41,773
Was this just made?

1632
00:58:41,774 --> 00:58:43,673
- Yes, it's really good. - It's delicious.

1633
00:58:44,113 --> 00:58:45,443
Hee Won.

1634
00:58:46,613 --> 00:58:48,253
You have to do things like this now.

1635
00:58:49,053 --> 00:58:50,883
It's good for your shoulders.

1636
00:58:51,084 --> 00:58:53,483
These sports facilities...

1637
00:58:54,093 --> 00:58:55,192
are surprisingly good for you.

1638
00:58:55,193 --> 00:58:57,052
I used to do it every day.

1639
00:58:57,053 --> 00:58:59,462
- Really? It's helpful. - I did it every day.

1640
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:00,994
When you're young,

1641
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:03,293
- it looks too easy. - Right.

1642
00:59:03,294 --> 00:59:05,064
- I wondered why they made it. - Yes.

1643
00:59:05,434 --> 00:59:06,962
But there are many elders nowadays.

1644
00:59:06,963 --> 00:59:08,403
And it feels good.

1645
00:59:09,274 --> 00:59:10,819
Do you know this? It's for your shoulders.

1646
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:13,043
My right shoulder has been hurting ever since we fenced.

1647
00:59:13,044 --> 00:59:15,573
This is good for your shoulders.

1648
00:59:15,713 --> 00:59:17,212
Those who have tried it are different.

1649
00:59:17,213 --> 00:59:18,560
You've never used it before, right?

1650
00:59:18,584 --> 00:59:21,083
- If you have a frozen shoulder, - Yes?

1651
00:59:21,084 --> 00:59:23,382
- you can't lift it. - That's right.

1652
00:59:23,383 --> 00:59:25,084
If you have a frozen shoulder,

1653
00:59:25,423 --> 00:59:26,830
- Do you turn it wider? - turn it to the side.

1654
00:59:26,854 --> 00:59:29,100
- You have to turn it to the side? - Turn it to the side.

1655
00:59:29,124 --> 00:59:31,923
(The actor in his 40s practices.)

1656
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:33,463
Try it.

1657
00:59:34,334 --> 00:59:36,192
- Try it, Ji Hoon. - You feel it in your back.

1658
00:59:36,193 --> 00:59:37,733
- The shoulder blades. - That's right.

1659
00:59:39,233 --> 00:59:41,402
- It feels good, doesn't it? - I'm old now.

1660
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:43,334
Why does this feel so good?

1661
00:59:43,974 --> 00:59:45,044
It feels good, right?

1662
00:59:45,704 --> 00:59:47,343
Why does this feel so good?

1663
00:59:47,713 --> 00:59:49,514
- It feels good, right? - Yes.

1664
00:59:50,073 --> 00:59:53,144
- Why does this feel so good? - It feels surprisingly good.

1665
00:59:53,283 --> 00:59:55,084
Let's check...

1666
00:59:55,314 --> 00:59:56,982
- our next guest... - Yes, let's check.

1667
00:59:56,983 --> 00:59:59,024
Before we take a rest.

1668
00:59:59,383 --> 01:00:01,524
- Her name is Kim Yoon Mi. - Yoon Mi.

1669
01:00:01,593 --> 01:00:03,653
"It's been 17 years since I moved from Okcheon."

1670
01:00:04,024 --> 01:00:07,593
"I am now a manager who leads a team."

1671
01:00:07,994 --> 01:00:10,963
"When the sun sets and the hidden door opens,"

1672
01:00:11,064 --> 01:00:13,962
"the clock of my team starts ticking."

1673
01:00:13,963 --> 01:00:16,502
"We overcome our lives where our days and nights are switched..."

1674
01:00:16,503 --> 01:00:18,802
"through chatting and team meals."

1675
01:00:18,803 --> 01:00:21,072
"Please give my teammates some energy."

1676
01:00:21,073 --> 01:00:22,143
Their days and nights are switched?

1677
01:00:22,144 --> 01:00:24,343
They must work during the night.

1678
01:00:24,814 --> 01:00:26,483
- Gosh! - What?

1679
01:00:27,014 --> 01:00:28,184
Is it a place you know?

1680
01:00:28,213 --> 01:00:29,733
- Yes. - Is it somewhere you frequent?

1681
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:31,483
It's near my home.

1682
01:00:31,684 --> 01:00:32,783
It's near your home?

1683
01:00:33,053 --> 01:00:34,354
The Hyatt.

1684
01:00:34,454 --> 01:00:36,092
- The Hyatt? That's near your home. - Yes.

1685
01:00:36,093 --> 01:00:37,623
- I told you. - A hotel?

1686
01:00:37,624 --> 01:00:38,794
Yes, it's a hotel.

1687
01:00:38,923 --> 01:00:40,523
Should we head over?

1688
01:00:40,524 --> 01:00:42,132
Yes, let's go.

1689
01:00:42,133 --> 01:00:44,363
(They head to a bus stop.)

1690
01:00:45,463 --> 01:00:47,164
I haven't taken a bus in a long time.

1691
01:00:47,403 --> 01:00:49,802
I didn't take it until we started this show.

1692
01:00:49,803 --> 01:00:52,603
- You know the electric bikes? - Yes.

1693
01:00:52,604 --> 01:00:54,743
- The electric share bikes. - Many people use them.

1694
01:00:54,744 --> 01:00:56,973
- You don't sweat if you take them. - I see.

1695
01:00:56,974 --> 01:00:58,683
You can easily go uphill too.

1696
01:00:58,684 --> 01:01:00,243
- You don't have traffic. - That's right.

1697
01:01:00,244 --> 01:01:01,612
I either walk or take those bikes.

1698
01:01:01,613 --> 01:01:03,212
We take the 402 from here.

1699
01:01:03,213 --> 01:01:04,453
(The bus arrives just on time.)

1700
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:05,724
It's here.

1701
01:01:06,024 --> 01:01:07,954
- We have to pay. - Yes.

1702
01:01:08,624 --> 01:01:10,293
- Use your card. - I have one.

1703
01:01:10,294 --> 01:01:11,524
- Just get on. - Hello.

1704
01:01:11,963 --> 01:01:14,564
- Four adults. - I haven't taken a bus in a while.

1705
01:01:14,633 --> 01:01:15,794
- Right? - Yes.

1706
01:01:17,434 --> 01:01:18,533
Hello.

1707
01:01:18,903 --> 01:01:19,934
Hello.

1708
01:01:22,503 --> 01:01:23,603
(They each sit in empty seats.)

1709
01:01:23,604 --> 01:01:25,604
It's been a really long time since I took the bus.

1710
01:01:27,544 --> 01:01:30,314
We're all scattered.

1711
01:01:30,943 --> 01:01:32,782
- I don't know what to do. - I'm sorry.

1712
01:01:32,783 --> 01:01:33,883
- It's okay. - Okay.

1713
01:01:34,854 --> 01:01:36,753
We're all sitting separately.

1714
01:01:37,314 --> 01:01:39,200
- There weren't any other seats. - You can get off.

1715
01:01:39,224 --> 01:01:40,524
It's okay. You can stay seated.

1716
01:01:41,394 --> 01:01:43,624
- Getting off. - She has to get off. Why are you...

1717
01:01:48,394 --> 01:01:49,894
(Glancing)

1718
01:01:50,693 --> 01:01:52,732
- Where are you headed? - Back to work.

1719
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:53,834
I see.

1720
01:01:54,274 --> 01:01:55,933
- Where is your office located? - Near Namdaemun.

1721
01:01:55,934 --> 01:01:57,603
Namdaemun. I see.

1722
01:01:57,604 --> 01:01:59,842
- You had to go somewhere for work? - Yes.

1723
01:01:59,843 --> 01:02:01,374
- I visited a client. - I see.

1724
01:02:02,244 --> 01:02:04,584
- I'm in IT sales. - He's the master of communication.

1725
01:02:05,084 --> 01:02:07,584
- IT is... - I'm interested...

1726
01:02:07,914 --> 01:02:09,553
in IT.

1727
01:02:10,514 --> 01:02:12,482
I also invest in that field.

1728
01:02:12,483 --> 01:02:13,854
Invest a lot, please.

1729
01:02:15,193 --> 01:02:16,523
He's good at this.

1730
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,593
He's one of the hosts.

1731
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:19,023
He is?

1732
01:02:19,024 --> 01:02:20,463
Yes, he's the host of this show.

1733
01:02:20,794 --> 01:02:23,334
Yeon Seok and Jae Suk are the hosts.

1734
01:02:23,564 --> 01:02:26,033
- I'm sorry. - No, he's good.

1735
01:02:27,164 --> 01:02:30,874
(The communication is lively.)

1736
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:34,003
Elon Musk...

1737
01:02:34,814 --> 01:02:36,814
They filmed a new drama called "Light Shop..."

1738
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:38,683
that will be on an OTT platform.

1739
01:02:38,684 --> 01:02:40,342
- I see. I'll make sure to watch it. - Okay.

1740
01:02:40,343 --> 01:02:41,482
Hee Won is the director.

1741
01:02:41,483 --> 01:02:42,983
- And Ji Hoon is in it. - I see.

1742
01:02:43,713 --> 01:02:47,253
Then are you visiting light shops?

1743
01:02:47,593 --> 01:02:49,724
No, I don't think so.

1744
01:02:49,994 --> 01:02:53,164
He's asking how to visit the "Light Shop."

1745
01:02:54,193 --> 01:02:55,993
It will be released on December 4...

1746
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:57,863
- on an OTT platform. - I see.

1747
01:02:57,963 --> 01:02:59,203
I'll make sure to watch it.

1748
01:02:59,204 --> 01:03:00,632
If you visit the site,

1749
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:03,133
you'll find the drama, "Light Shop."

1750
01:03:03,803 --> 01:03:07,743
Ji Hoon, sitting behind us, is the owner of the light shop.

1751
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:11,544
Hee Won is the director of the drama.

1752
01:03:11,783 --> 01:03:13,913
- What about you? - I didn't do anything.

1753
01:03:13,914 --> 01:03:15,013
I see.

1754
01:03:15,014 --> 01:03:17,354
I'm just on Whenever Possible.

1755
01:03:17,724 --> 01:03:19,152
I'll watch Whenever Possible first.

1756
01:03:19,153 --> 01:03:20,353
Please do.

1757
01:03:20,354 --> 01:03:21,993
It's on at 10:20pm on Tuesdays.

1758
01:03:21,994 --> 01:03:23,600
(He promotes the show whenever possible.)

1759
01:03:23,624 --> 01:03:24,692
What are you doing?

1760
01:03:24,693 --> 01:03:27,123
(You're doing an amazing job.)

1761
01:03:27,124 --> 01:03:28,763
- Good job, Yeon Seok. - I'm being a diligent MC.

1762
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:29,934
You're doing great.

1763
01:03:30,064 --> 01:03:32,363
He's the Promotion Fairy.

1764
01:03:33,264 --> 01:03:34,604
Don't we have to get off here?

1765
01:03:35,033 --> 01:03:37,572
- Yes, I think so. - This is our stop.

1766
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:39,373
I'm also in a new drama.

1767
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:40,473
I see.

1768
01:03:40,474 --> 01:03:41,874
Next week, on the 22nd.

1769
01:03:42,073 --> 01:03:43,942
- I'll make sure to watch it. - Thank you.

1770
01:03:43,943 --> 01:03:46,083
It's called "When the Phone Rings."

1771
01:03:46,084 --> 01:03:47,814
It's "WPR."

1772
01:03:48,553 --> 01:03:49,683
- Make sure to watch it. - Okay.

1773
01:03:49,684 --> 01:03:51,084
- Bye. - Bye.

1774
01:03:51,923 --> 01:03:53,153
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1775
01:03:53,323 --> 01:03:54,922
(That was a good promotion.)

1776
01:03:54,923 --> 01:03:56,322
That was nice.

1777
01:03:56,323 --> 01:03:57,422
I told him about all our dramas.

1778
01:03:57,423 --> 01:03:59,323
You were the Promotion Fairy.

1779
01:03:59,724 --> 01:04:01,862
- Thank you. - I'm so proud of you.

1780
01:04:01,863 --> 01:04:03,632
- You're proud of me? - Yes.

1781
01:04:03,633 --> 01:04:05,132
You're the master of communication.

1782
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:06,302
I learned from you.

1783
01:04:06,303 --> 01:04:07,833
- Good job. - Thank you.

1784
01:04:07,834 --> 01:04:09,479
- That's how you do it. - We have to go right.

1785
01:04:09,503 --> 01:04:11,203
Where are you going? We have to go that way.

1786
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:12,442
- Is it that way? - Yes.

1787
01:04:12,443 --> 01:04:14,744
- It's so pretty here. - That's the botanical garden.

1788
01:04:15,014 --> 01:04:17,543
Mount Nam is beautiful right now.

1789
01:04:17,544 --> 01:04:20,183
I was taking a walk yesterday, and the fall foliage...

1790
01:04:20,184 --> 01:04:22,353
- was at its peak. - It is at its peak.

1791
01:04:22,354 --> 01:04:24,083
- Here... - It's at its peak this week.

1792
01:04:24,084 --> 01:04:26,354
Get a drink and watch it from here.

1793
01:04:26,783 --> 01:04:28,152
It's nice here.

1794
01:04:28,153 --> 01:04:30,354
It's so nice. I come here...

1795
01:04:31,064 --> 01:04:33,063
to take a walk almost every day.

1796
01:04:33,064 --> 01:04:34,962
- I bet. - I get to see all four seasons.

1797
01:04:34,963 --> 01:04:36,193
It's amazing.

1798
01:04:36,363 --> 01:04:39,033
Would you like to take a walk along the route I take...

1799
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:41,003
- Shall we? - with a drink.

1800
01:04:41,604 --> 01:04:42,973
This is nice.

1801
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:44,704
(Navi Yoo looks more relaxed than ever.)

1802
01:04:46,274 --> 01:04:48,543
(This is how he usually looks.)

1803
01:04:48,544 --> 01:04:49,672
The bus?

1804
01:04:49,673 --> 01:04:52,414
(His eyes are glued to the map.)

1805
01:04:53,244 --> 01:04:56,014
(His eyes are glued to the map.)

1806
01:04:56,753 --> 01:04:58,523
(Whether it's raining...)

1807
01:04:58,524 --> 01:05:01,323
(or sunny, )

1808
01:05:01,923 --> 01:05:04,003
(he was always nervous they might go the wrong way.)

1809
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:06,293
(Navi Yoo has changed.)

1810
01:05:06,294 --> 01:05:07,834
This is great.

1811
01:05:07,894 --> 01:05:09,334
(Relaxed)

1812
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:12,733
- Look at the huge leaves. - There is a moss garden over there.

1813
01:05:13,733 --> 01:05:16,532
The sprinklers take care of the moss garden at all times.

1814
01:05:16,533 --> 01:05:19,402
(This is Yeon Seok's road, and he guides them with ease.)

1815
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:21,942
The scenery is beautiful.

1816
01:05:21,943 --> 01:05:23,813
- It's so beautiful. - It's nice, isn't it?

1817
01:05:23,814 --> 01:05:26,443
- Look at the color of the leaves. - I know.

1818
01:05:26,584 --> 01:05:30,083
Yeon Seok knows his area well.

1819
01:05:30,084 --> 01:05:31,553
(Shrugging)

1820
01:05:32,383 --> 01:05:34,593
These are old trees.

1821
01:05:34,794 --> 01:05:36,353
It's nice even in the winter.

1822
01:05:36,354 --> 01:05:37,823
- Right? - Even when it's cold,

1823
01:05:37,994 --> 01:05:39,523
- if you hike up the hill, - Yes.

1824
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:42,093
You start sweating, and it's nice in the winter.

1825
01:05:42,693 --> 01:05:44,294
Nowadays,

1826
01:05:45,003 --> 01:05:46,763
- when I walk even a little... - Yes?

1827
01:05:46,764 --> 01:05:49,103
- Did we walk for three minutes? - Yes.

1828
01:05:49,104 --> 01:05:50,533
My bottom hurts.

1829
01:05:51,374 --> 01:05:52,974
- Wait. - Which part?

1830
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:55,213
- And it's just... - Your glutes?

1831
01:05:55,374 --> 01:05:57,473
Just the right side hurts.

1832
01:05:57,474 --> 01:06:00,544
You shouldn't have come today.

1833
01:06:01,283 --> 01:06:03,513
- You should've gotten some rest. - You should've come next week.

1834
01:06:03,514 --> 01:06:06,223
You came when your body was feeling the worst.

1835
01:06:06,224 --> 01:06:08,693
You also constantly bent over earlier.

1836
01:06:09,024 --> 01:06:11,323
- Right? - I don't think that's the reason.

1837
01:06:11,564 --> 01:06:13,793
- Let's go this way. - This is to Mount Nam, right?

1838
01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:15,933
- It leads straight to the Hyatt. - Gosh.

1839
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:17,462
- Look at that. - It's amazing.

1840
01:06:17,463 --> 01:06:19,933
Yeon Seok, this is spectacular.

1841
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,573
It is a radiant day.

1842
01:06:22,934 --> 01:06:24,204
It's so pretty.

1843
01:06:24,334 --> 01:06:25,703
It's perfect.

1844
01:06:25,704 --> 01:06:26,802
How is it this pretty?

1845
01:06:26,803 --> 01:06:28,543
- It's great here, isn't it? - I love it here.

1846
01:06:28,544 --> 01:06:29,784
It looks beautiful, doesn't it?

1847
01:06:30,314 --> 01:06:31,443
This fall...

1848
01:06:31,814 --> 01:06:33,882
- We're spending this fall... - With four men.

1849
01:06:33,883 --> 01:06:36,354
Us four men are enjoying fall together. Gosh.

1850
01:06:36,653 --> 01:06:38,224
This is the worst!

1851
01:06:38,684 --> 01:06:41,322
Seriously. It's the worst!

1852
01:06:41,323 --> 01:06:42,623
Our shoulders...

1853
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,169
We have our arms around our shoulders too.

1854
01:06:44,193 --> 01:06:46,093
Us four men...

1855
01:06:46,264 --> 01:06:48,363
are enjoying fall together.

1856
01:06:48,863 --> 01:06:50,462
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1857
01:06:50,463 --> 01:06:53,132
And we can fold this into butterflies.

1858
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:54,233
This is the worst.

1859
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:56,104
This is just the worst.

1860
01:06:56,533 --> 01:06:58,973
Fall is the season of men.

1861
01:06:58,974 --> 01:07:00,573
- Right. - I love it, though.

1862
01:07:01,144 --> 01:07:03,173
- It's beautiful. - I can smell the ginkgos.

1863
01:07:04,173 --> 01:07:05,773
It'll be great out here in this weather.

1864
01:07:06,413 --> 01:07:08,382
There are outdoor seats.

1865
01:07:08,383 --> 01:07:09,752
- It's nice here. - This place...

1866
01:07:09,753 --> 01:07:11,623
- feels like a scene from a drama. - Right.

1867
01:07:12,284 --> 01:07:14,184
So there's a cafe here.

1868
01:07:15,024 --> 01:07:16,052
I had no idea.

1869
01:07:16,053 --> 01:07:17,153
(The cafe that Yeon Seok recommends as a person from this area)

1870
01:07:17,154 --> 01:07:19,162
- It's great here. - It's great here.

1871
01:07:19,163 --> 01:07:21,363
- Let's move to the corner. - Let's move to the corner.

1872
01:07:21,564 --> 01:07:23,194
This is the perfect image of fall.

1873
01:07:24,034 --> 01:07:25,132
(A dog comes to Ji Hoon with its tail wagging.)

1874
01:07:25,133 --> 01:07:27,162
Gosh, Ji Hoon. It feels like a scene from a drama.

1875
01:07:27,163 --> 01:07:28,903
There was a retriever earlier. It must be this dog.

1876
01:07:28,904 --> 01:07:30,302
You're not sure if you should be happy to see me or not, right?

1877
01:07:30,303 --> 01:07:31,372
(Is he someone familiar?)

1878
01:07:31,373 --> 01:07:34,074
You want to be on your back as you're excited, right?

1879
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:36,843
(Mesmerized)

1880
01:07:37,043 --> 01:07:39,843
You should've told me about this place. I had no idea.

1881
01:07:40,243 --> 01:07:42,723
I've gone past this place so often, but I never knew about it.

1882
01:07:42,753 --> 01:07:45,752
I've taken a lot of walks here, but it's my first time coming here.

1883
01:07:45,753 --> 01:07:48,122
I've gone past this place so often, but I never knew.

1884
01:07:48,123 --> 01:07:50,123
It's perfect to be outside.

1885
01:07:51,394 --> 01:07:53,824
- I love being outside. - Right.

1886
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:56,132
- Should I loosen up your neck? - Did you get acupuncture?

1887
01:07:56,133 --> 01:07:57,263
- What? - Did you get acupuncture?

1888
01:07:57,264 --> 01:07:58,403
I did.

1889
01:07:58,404 --> 01:08:00,103
Ji Hoon knows what to do with my sides.

1890
01:08:00,104 --> 01:08:01,872
- This is a great tip. - Okay.

1891
01:08:01,873 --> 01:08:03,533
When our neck feels stiff...

1892
01:08:03,534 --> 01:08:05,474
I saw this medical information.

1893
01:08:05,803 --> 01:08:07,103
Nine times out of ten,

1894
01:08:07,104 --> 01:08:09,144
it's because the armpit was pressed while sleeping.

1895
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:12,513
If you press the tendons in the armpit,

1896
01:08:12,514 --> 01:08:14,883
it will get better right away.

1897
01:08:16,314 --> 01:08:17,882
- Try moving your neck. - What?

1898
01:08:17,883 --> 01:08:19,623
Try moving your neck.

1899
01:08:19,784 --> 01:08:21,052
- Doesn't it feel better? - I think it feels better.

1900
01:08:21,053 --> 01:08:22,592
Right. It works right away.

1901
01:08:22,593 --> 01:08:23,793
(That's fascinating.)

1902
01:08:25,194 --> 01:08:26,592
- Gosh, it hurts. - You have to endure it.

1903
01:08:26,593 --> 01:08:28,033
There's nothing you can do about it.

1904
01:08:29,394 --> 01:08:30,894
My gosh.

1905
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:33,763
He does all sorts of things.

1906
01:08:33,764 --> 01:08:36,734
(The men from "Light Shop" help with the stiff neck.)

1907
01:08:37,604 --> 01:08:39,042
- Is it better now? - Okay.

1908
01:08:39,043 --> 01:08:40,673
It has to be done from time to time.

1909
01:08:41,173 --> 01:08:42,913
What's good here, Yeon Seok?

1910
01:08:43,743 --> 01:08:45,882
You're going to have the light barley tea coffee again.

1911
01:08:45,883 --> 01:08:48,014
We'll get two of those today.

1912
01:08:48,154 --> 01:08:49,983
He drinks coffee just like you do.

1913
01:08:49,984 --> 01:08:51,582
- I'll have a light iced Americano. - Right.

1914
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,123
- What about you? - Me too.

1915
01:08:53,484 --> 01:08:56,224
I'll have an iced Americano that's lighter than barley tea.

1916
01:08:57,963 --> 01:08:59,693
(Give me your card, )

1917
01:08:59,694 --> 01:09:01,694
(so I can pay for the coffee.)

1918
01:09:02,064 --> 01:09:03,462
- Shall we play a game? - Well...

1919
01:09:03,463 --> 01:09:05,264
- Shall we play a game? - Let's play a game.

1920
01:09:05,803 --> 01:09:08,103
- I got a bit mad earlier. - We'll be playing again?

1921
01:09:08,104 --> 01:09:10,672
I paid earlier, so we have to play.

1922
01:09:10,673 --> 01:09:12,242
- What should we play? - That's why you want to play?

1923
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:13,574
- What should we play? - Then...

1924
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:15,073
we'll play the game where you have to get up first.

1925
01:09:15,074 --> 01:09:16,143
The one who gets up late...

1926
01:09:16,144 --> 01:09:17,672
- or with someone else gets caught. - We have to get up in order.

1927
01:09:17,673 --> 01:09:18,814
Right.

1928
01:09:19,144 --> 01:09:20,883
(False start)

1929
01:09:21,413 --> 01:09:22,413
- One. - Two.

1930
01:09:22,414 --> 01:09:24,283
- It's after the start. - Gosh.

1931
01:09:24,284 --> 01:09:26,952
- My knees hurt. - The one who gets up last.

1932
01:09:26,953 --> 01:09:28,524
Start.

1933
01:09:29,194 --> 01:09:30,194
- One. - Two.

1934
01:09:30,195 --> 01:09:31,224
Three.

1935
01:09:31,663 --> 01:09:32,864
(Disappointed)

1936
01:09:33,163 --> 01:09:34,193
- One. - Two.

1937
01:09:34,194 --> 01:09:35,194
Three.

1938
01:09:35,195 --> 01:09:38,064
(Losing at the speed of light)

1939
01:09:38,264 --> 01:09:39,403
What were you doing, Ji Hoon?

1940
01:09:39,404 --> 01:09:40,764
(Happy)

1941
01:09:41,064 --> 01:09:42,872
- Ji Hoon. - It usually never continues...

1942
01:09:42,873 --> 01:09:44,234
until the end.

1943
01:09:44,503 --> 01:09:46,103
- Ji Hoon. - Gosh.

1944
01:09:46,104 --> 01:09:48,672
- It never goes until the end. - What were you doing?

1945
01:09:48,673 --> 01:09:49,873
Gosh.

1946
01:09:50,614 --> 01:09:52,542
I'll order it. Let's go together.

1947
01:09:52,543 --> 01:09:53,684
- Go ahead. - Okay.

1948
01:09:54,444 --> 01:09:57,883
(Free coffee is the best.)

1949
01:09:59,024 --> 01:10:01,224
- Hello. - Hello.

1950
01:10:01,793 --> 01:10:02,823
We'll get...

1951
01:10:02,824 --> 01:10:06,123
- three light iced Americanos. - Okay.

1952
01:10:06,194 --> 01:10:08,493
I'll have a cafe latte.

1953
01:10:09,264 --> 01:10:10,693
A warm or iced cafe latte?

1954
01:10:10,694 --> 01:10:12,363
- A warm one. - A warm one.

1955
01:10:12,364 --> 01:10:14,403
Also... Should we get some of these?

1956
01:10:14,404 --> 01:10:15,672
- The walnut pie? - One piece of the walnut pie.

1957
01:10:15,673 --> 01:10:16,733
All right.

1958
01:10:16,734 --> 01:10:18,774
The cheese pie? Which one do you want?

1959
01:10:18,873 --> 01:10:20,302
- Milk? - Sure. We'll get this one too.

1960
01:10:20,303 --> 01:10:22,143
- Okay. - One piece of the milk cake...

1961
01:10:22,144 --> 01:10:23,790
- and one piece of the walnut pie. - The walnut pie.

1962
01:10:23,814 --> 01:10:25,284
Here you are.

1963
01:10:26,743 --> 01:10:30,314
Gosh. It's great to have the younger ones with us.

1964
01:10:30,583 --> 01:10:31,854
Okay. Gosh.

1965
01:10:32,484 --> 01:10:34,284
What? This is all you got?

1966
01:10:35,253 --> 01:10:36,593
What is all this?

1967
01:10:36,953 --> 01:10:38,563
- It's dessert. - Thank you, Ji Hoon.

1968
01:10:38,564 --> 01:10:39,694
Gosh.

1969
01:10:39,993 --> 01:10:41,223
Thank you.

1970
01:10:41,224 --> 01:10:43,093
He got us dessert too.

1971
01:10:43,293 --> 01:10:45,734
- It'll be our dessert. - I love pecan pie.

1972
01:10:46,564 --> 01:10:47,633
It looks good.

1973
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:50,373
Ji Hoon is a lot...

1974
01:10:50,604 --> 01:10:52,743
- He's a warm person. - He's a warm person.

1975
01:10:56,274 --> 01:10:58,514
- It's perfect. - It's really nice.

1976
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:00,514
- It's good. - The milk.

1977
01:11:02,583 --> 01:11:04,154
- It's really nice. - Right.

1978
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:05,984
- It's good. - The milk.

1979
01:11:06,123 --> 01:11:07,484
It's nice and sweet.

1980
01:11:07,883 --> 01:11:09,992
- It's great. - It's delicious.

1981
01:11:09,993 --> 01:11:11,153
Along with the autumn leaves.

1982
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:14,832
We're really enjoying fall thanks to you.

1983
01:11:14,833 --> 01:11:16,210
(They're enjoying the last moments of fall thanks to Yeon Seok.)

1984
01:11:16,234 --> 01:11:17,332
(Eating)

1985
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,063
Gosh, it's good.

1986
01:11:19,064 --> 01:11:20,434
(Peeking)

1987
01:11:22,074 --> 01:11:25,144
I can see an image from here.

1988
01:11:25,444 --> 01:11:27,604
Jae Suk feels like a poet...

1989
01:11:27,843 --> 01:11:29,842
or a writer.

1990
01:11:29,843 --> 01:11:31,043
- Do I have that image? - Yes.

1991
01:11:31,173 --> 01:11:32,644
But if I look here,

1992
01:11:33,444 --> 01:11:36,184
he is like someone who has retired.

1993
01:11:36,383 --> 01:11:39,953
He's like a retired mafia who still has his blood boiling.

1994
01:11:40,784 --> 01:11:43,153
- A retired boss. - Right.

1995
01:11:43,154 --> 01:11:45,863
- A retired boss. - He still has no peace inside.

1996
01:11:45,864 --> 01:11:47,363
- He's full of anger. - Right.

1997
01:11:47,364 --> 01:11:48,792
Get on his nerves,

1998
01:11:48,793 --> 01:11:51,764
- and you'll disappear in no time. - Right.

1999
01:11:51,904 --> 01:11:53,264
- The boss of a gang. - Right.

2000
01:11:53,364 --> 01:11:55,434
I like sitting around like this.

2001
01:11:55,503 --> 01:11:56,632
Right.

2002
01:11:56,633 --> 01:12:00,703
(Things four men talk about at a cafe)

2003
01:12:00,904 --> 01:12:02,613
Do you meet people who are the same age as you?

2004
01:12:02,614 --> 01:12:04,073
I don't. I don't know a lot of people who are my age.

2005
01:12:04,074 --> 01:12:06,383
- Born in 1982? - I don't know people born in 1982.

2006
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:08,213
- There's Jung Ji Hoon, - Right.

2007
01:12:08,514 --> 01:12:09,882
- Hyun Bin, - Right.

2008
01:12:09,883 --> 01:12:11,523
And Lee Joon Gi. I'm the same age as him.

2009
01:12:11,883 --> 01:12:13,423
We're the same age.

2010
01:12:13,784 --> 01:12:16,324
But I barely meet up with them.

2011
01:12:16,524 --> 01:12:17,922
We barely get together.

2012
01:12:17,923 --> 01:12:21,324
Last year, I gathered people who were born in 1984.

2013
01:12:21,793 --> 01:12:24,292
- There was Simon Dominic, - Right.

2014
01:12:24,293 --> 01:12:27,103
Kim Yong Jun of SG Wannabe,

2015
01:12:27,104 --> 01:12:28,934
and Se7en.

2016
01:12:29,133 --> 01:12:31,573
Kian84 was there too.

2017
01:12:31,574 --> 01:12:33,403
- Lee Jun Hyuk. - Jun Hyuk.

2018
01:12:33,404 --> 01:12:35,542
- Hyun Bong Sik was there too. - Bong Sik.

2019
01:12:35,543 --> 01:12:37,513
- Bong Sik was born in 1984, right? - Yes.

2020
01:12:37,514 --> 01:12:39,582
- He was born in 1984. - It's hard to believe.

2021
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,784
He's someone who can act as someone in their 60s.

2022
01:12:42,284 --> 01:12:44,653
It's quite shocking that Bon Sik was born in 1984.

2023
01:12:44,654 --> 01:12:46,582
- He was born in 1984 too? - Yes.

2024
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:48,663
There's something you can make with the ginkgo leaf.

2025
01:12:48,923 --> 01:12:50,354
What can you make?

2026
01:12:51,093 --> 01:12:52,193
Is it something amazing?

2027
01:12:52,194 --> 01:12:54,292
It's not something amazing. It's just something cute.

2028
01:12:54,293 --> 01:12:55,462
It's the same with him.

2029
01:12:55,463 --> 01:12:58,034
- He does all sorts of things. - He does all sorts of things.

2030
01:12:59,064 --> 01:13:00,832
Is Yeon Seok 41 right now?

2031
01:13:00,833 --> 01:13:02,734
- He should be 41 right now. - Right.

2032
01:13:03,333 --> 01:13:05,104
He's definitely over 40 now.

2033
01:13:06,743 --> 01:13:07,743
(The man in his 40s picks up ginkgo leaves.)

2034
01:13:07,744 --> 01:13:09,713
You do a lot of things when you are 40.

2035
01:13:10,944 --> 01:13:12,243
What will you make with them?

2036
01:13:13,913 --> 01:13:15,583
You should do this for your children.

2037
01:13:15,953 --> 01:13:17,552
- It's a butterfly. - A butterfly?

2038
01:13:17,553 --> 01:13:18,553
(A yellow butterfly made with ginkgo leaves)

2039
01:13:18,554 --> 01:13:20,224
It has to come apart well.

2040
01:13:20,623 --> 01:13:22,969
- It really looks like a butterfly. - It does look like a butterfly.

2041
01:13:22,993 --> 01:13:24,993
- Hold on. - It really looks like a butterfly.

2042
01:13:25,293 --> 01:13:28,194
You have to take it apart well in the middle.

2043
01:13:29,133 --> 01:13:30,662
It really looks like a butterfly, Yeon Seok.

2044
01:13:30,663 --> 01:13:32,604
- Gosh. - It really looks like a butterfly.

2045
01:13:33,133 --> 01:13:34,163
It's a butterfly.

2046
01:13:34,333 --> 01:13:35,373
Right.

2047
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:39,242
(The man in his 40s feels happy.)

2048
01:13:39,243 --> 01:13:40,443
It really looks like a butterfly.

2049
01:13:40,444 --> 01:13:42,172
Kids love it when you make these.

2050
01:13:42,173 --> 01:13:44,643
- It really looks like a butterfly. - Right.

2051
01:13:44,644 --> 01:13:46,483
It really looks like an actual butterfly...

2052
01:13:46,484 --> 01:13:48,553
- from a distance. - Right.

2053
01:13:49,014 --> 01:13:50,484
It's a butterfly like this.

2054
01:13:50,553 --> 01:13:51,833
My nephews and nieces love this.

2055
01:13:52,953 --> 01:13:54,952
- Check out the quinces on the tree. - Right.

2056
01:13:54,953 --> 01:13:56,723
They look very ripe.

2057
01:13:56,724 --> 01:13:57,894
- Right? - Yes.

2058
01:13:58,694 --> 01:14:00,463
- Shall we try smelling it? - Shall we?

2059
01:14:01,764 --> 01:14:03,564
- Pass it to me. - You can smell it.

2060
01:14:07,133 --> 01:14:08,653
It's been so long since I smelled one.

2061
01:14:08,703 --> 01:14:09,774
Right?

2062
01:14:11,303 --> 01:14:12,773
Are quinces inedible?

2063
01:14:12,774 --> 01:14:14,343
I know them to be inedible.

2064
01:14:14,774 --> 01:14:17,143
- But they're used to make tea. - As a fruit.

2065
01:14:17,144 --> 01:14:21,443
- They aren't eaten like a fruit. - Aren't they bitter?

2066
01:14:21,444 --> 01:14:22,553
Try cutting it.

2067
01:14:22,883 --> 01:14:24,923
They are used to make tea.

2068
01:14:25,383 --> 01:14:27,252
- They're made into a syrup. - It looks like a pear.

2069
01:14:27,253 --> 01:14:28,853
- It's white. - It's hard to cut.

2070
01:14:28,854 --> 01:14:29,993
It's hard to cut it.

2071
01:14:30,524 --> 01:14:31,693
- Be careful. - Okay.

2072
01:14:31,694 --> 01:14:33,764
(The quince tasting started all of a sudden.)

2073
01:14:35,894 --> 01:14:37,363
There are seeds here.

2074
01:14:37,364 --> 01:14:39,164
- It's like an apple seed. - They have seeds.

2075
01:14:40,663 --> 01:14:42,273
The meat is really hard.

2076
01:14:42,274 --> 01:14:43,872
I thought you were taking a big bite of it.

2077
01:14:43,873 --> 01:14:45,444
(Trying a bite)

2078
01:14:47,444 --> 01:14:50,573
- I knew it would be bitter. - It's really bitter.

2079
01:14:50,574 --> 01:14:51,644
(A bitter ending)

2080
01:14:53,284 --> 01:14:54,444
Hey!

2081
01:14:56,154 --> 01:14:57,883
There must be a reason it's not eaten.

2082
01:14:58,583 --> 01:15:00,154
Gosh, it's so bitter.

2083
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:02,483
- Gosh! - It already looks bitter.

2084
01:15:02,593 --> 01:15:05,123
If you think about it, even birds don't peck on them.

2085
01:15:05,724 --> 01:15:07,764
Right. It's because they taste bad.

2086
01:15:08,864 --> 01:15:10,393
Birds eat things like persimmons.

2087
01:15:10,394 --> 01:15:11,903
Oh, right.

2088
01:15:11,904 --> 01:15:13,203
There's a reason for everything.

2089
01:15:13,264 --> 01:15:15,464
There are so many birds, but the quinces are untouched.

2090
01:15:15,673 --> 01:15:16,833
Not one of them is eaten.

2091
01:15:17,203 --> 01:15:19,243
It's already 3pm already.

2092
01:15:20,203 --> 01:15:22,212
Where do we have to go? I always went by this place.

2093
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:24,473
I'm not sure what the LL Floor is.

2094
01:15:24,474 --> 01:15:26,183
It's behind the sheep sculpture?

2095
01:15:26,184 --> 01:15:28,043
- LL Floor? - A lot of people got married...

2096
01:15:28,484 --> 01:15:30,654
- at the Hyatt in the past. - Right.

2097
01:15:30,713 --> 01:15:32,223
I want to get married here in the future.

2098
01:15:32,224 --> 01:15:33,864
- It's because you live by here. - Right.

2099
01:15:35,894 --> 01:15:37,593
The wedding reception can be at my house.

2100
01:15:38,253 --> 01:15:40,364
We're at a hotel this time.

2101
01:15:40,894 --> 01:15:42,592
It's behind the sheep sculpture.

2102
01:15:42,593 --> 01:15:43,863
- This is it. - The sheep sculpture.

2103
01:15:43,864 --> 01:15:45,833
- Is this it? - I think it is.

2104
01:15:46,833 --> 01:15:48,063
What is this place?

2105
01:15:48,064 --> 01:15:49,803
- Right. It's a bar. - Is it a restaurant?

2106
01:15:49,873 --> 01:15:50,973
Hello.

2107
01:15:50,974 --> 01:15:52,573
Are you Yoon Mi?

2108
01:15:52,574 --> 01:15:54,443
- Yes. Hello. - Hello.

2109
01:15:54,444 --> 01:15:55,543
- Gosh! - Hello.

2110
01:15:55,774 --> 01:15:57,644
- Hello. - There's a place like this here.

2111
01:15:57,673 --> 01:15:59,883
- Hello. - Hello.

2112
01:15:59,984 --> 01:16:02,114
- It's great to see you. Gosh. - Hello.

2113
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:05,452
(Kim Yoon Mi, the second Whenever Guest)

2114
01:16:05,453 --> 01:16:07,023
- This place is really... - Gosh.

2115
01:16:07,024 --> 01:16:08,523
Is this a club?

2116
01:16:08,524 --> 01:16:09,823
- No. It's a bar. - It's a bar.

2117
01:16:09,824 --> 01:16:11,252
- It's a bar? - Yes.

2118
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:12,363
- It's for members? - At night...

2119
01:16:12,364 --> 01:16:14,863
- It's open only in the evenings. - Is this place only for members?

2120
01:16:14,864 --> 01:16:17,332
- No. It's open to anyone. - No?

2121
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:19,764
Gosh, it looks amazing here.

2122
01:16:20,934 --> 01:16:23,903
Would you like some non-alcoholic cocktails while you're here?

2123
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:25,603
- That would be great! - Right.

2124
01:16:25,604 --> 01:16:26,672
It's non-alcoholic.

2125
01:16:26,673 --> 01:16:27,773
- It's non-alcoholic. - Yes. It's non-alcoholic.

2126
01:16:27,774 --> 01:16:29,173
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2127
01:16:31,474 --> 01:16:32,644
What is this?

2128
01:16:32,843 --> 01:16:35,952
This is the Namsan Mojito made with tangerines.

2129
01:16:35,953 --> 01:16:37,553
Namsan Mojito?

2130
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:39,824
"We have to have a glass of Namsan in Mojito."

2131
01:16:40,184 --> 01:16:42,422
This is called the Bronze Punch.

2132
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:45,764
It's a golden cocktail with the scent of an apple.

2133
01:16:48,564 --> 01:16:50,364
Gosh, it's delicious.

2134
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:53,604
- It's delicious. - It's delicious. This...

2135
01:16:53,663 --> 01:16:56,234
- feels like a sujeonggwa. - Yes. You're right.

2136
01:16:56,373 --> 01:16:58,702
It's a grapefruit cocktail that you can enjoy cold.

2137
01:16:58,703 --> 01:17:00,073
- It's a grapefruit cocktail. - Yes.

2138
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:03,143
This one is called the Blood Hill.

2139
01:17:03,144 --> 01:17:04,814
- Blood Hill. - Right.

2140
01:17:07,543 --> 01:17:12,053
This is a fizzy orange drink.

2141
01:17:14,453 --> 01:17:17,224
(He starts his own grapefruit eating show.)

2142
01:17:17,423 --> 01:17:19,663
Gosh, Hee Won is starting with this.

2143
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:20,993
Is that a rib?

2144
01:17:21,963 --> 01:17:23,492
(He tears the grapefruit rib.)

2145
01:17:23,493 --> 01:17:24,934
This is good.

2146
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:26,802
Did you happen to make these...

2147
01:17:26,803 --> 01:17:28,403
based on each of our images?

2148
01:17:28,404 --> 01:17:31,803
Yes. It seemed like Jae Suk would like that sort of taste.

2149
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:34,343
Do I look like someone who would like ginger?

2150
01:17:35,074 --> 01:17:37,372
- Gosh. - Someone who would like ginger?

2151
01:17:37,373 --> 01:17:39,184
His humor is coming out in the afternoon.

2152
01:17:39,444 --> 01:17:41,583
He kept his mouth shut in the morning.

2153
01:17:42,514 --> 01:17:44,413
My neck feels a lot better now.

2154
01:17:46,123 --> 01:17:48,654
Gosh. He finished it in a flash.

2155
01:17:48,953 --> 01:17:51,422
At what time does this place open?

2156
01:17:51,423 --> 01:17:53,063
It opens at 6pm.

2157
01:17:53,064 --> 01:17:54,523
I see.

2158
01:17:54,524 --> 01:17:56,092
That was why you said...

2159
01:17:56,093 --> 01:17:58,393
work starts for your team when the sun comes down.

2160
01:17:58,394 --> 01:18:00,433
- Right. - You live through each day...

2161
01:18:00,434 --> 01:18:02,632
with team meals and chatting.

2162
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:03,873
Yes. That's right.

2163
01:18:03,934 --> 01:18:06,302
Then are you a hotel manager?

2164
01:18:06,303 --> 01:18:08,073
- Yes. - I see.

2165
01:18:08,074 --> 01:18:09,889
How long has it been since you have worked here?

2166
01:18:09,913 --> 01:18:12,883
It's my 17th year here.

2167
01:18:13,114 --> 01:18:15,183
You look like...

2168
01:18:15,184 --> 01:18:16,613
you've been here for a while too.

2169
01:18:16,638 --> 01:18:18,378
It's my 15th year here.

2170
01:18:18,654 --> 01:18:20,654
What about at this bar?

2171
01:18:20,784 --> 01:18:22,452
It's been a year and a half since I've been here.

2172
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:25,463
- I see. - She was my first senior.

2173
01:18:26,224 --> 01:18:28,962
Did you work as a team?

2174
01:18:28,963 --> 01:18:33,162
No. We both entered together and worked together.

2175
01:18:33,163 --> 01:18:34,563
We were in separate teams and happened to meet here again.

2176
01:18:34,564 --> 01:18:36,073
- You two got together again. - You two got together again.

2177
01:18:36,074 --> 01:18:37,372
(Their close relationship continued until now.)

2178
01:18:37,373 --> 01:18:40,343
How is Team Manager Yoon Mi?

2179
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:43,114
Well, yes.

2180
01:18:43,514 --> 01:18:45,073
Well, yes.

2181
01:18:45,074 --> 01:18:46,683
She feels like a brother.

2182
01:18:46,684 --> 01:18:48,324
Why did you take your back off the chair?

2183
01:18:48,814 --> 01:18:51,083
- I'm feeling nervous. - Right.

2184
01:18:51,453 --> 01:18:52,483
She feels like a brother.

2185
01:18:52,484 --> 01:18:56,092
She takes care of me like a family member more than my wife.

2186
01:18:56,093 --> 01:18:58,764
- That's how great she is. - That won't be easy to do.

2187
01:18:59,064 --> 01:19:01,162
- That's how warm she is. - Right.

2188
01:19:01,163 --> 01:19:03,033
- My back is off the chair. - Right.

2189
01:19:03,034 --> 01:19:05,934
Are they all sitting in order of their positions?

2190
01:19:06,503 --> 01:19:09,033
They all happened to sit like this.

2191
01:19:09,034 --> 01:19:11,073
- By their seniority? - They happened to sit like this.

2192
01:19:11,074 --> 01:19:12,273
- He's the youngest. - He's the youngest.

2193
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:13,342
I see.

2194
01:19:13,343 --> 01:19:15,943
How long has it been since you've worked here?

2195
01:19:15,944 --> 01:19:17,613
- It has been around four months. - It hasn't been that long.

2196
01:19:17,614 --> 01:19:19,620
How is it after working here for around four months?

2197
01:19:19,644 --> 01:19:22,183
We rest when others are working,

2198
01:19:22,184 --> 01:19:24,513
and we work when others are resting.

2199
01:19:24,514 --> 01:19:26,529
There are times when that's tough, but I'm having fun here.

2200
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,792
That could be bad, but at times,

2201
01:19:28,793 --> 01:19:29,893
- It could be good. - it could be good.

2202
01:19:29,894 --> 01:19:31,323
- It's quite similar to us. - Right.

2203
01:19:31,324 --> 01:19:32,893
- We work when others don't. - Well,

2204
01:19:32,894 --> 01:19:34,962
you don't have to wait in long lines at a good restaurant.

2205
01:19:34,963 --> 01:19:36,832
Even with the place we went to earlier,

2206
01:19:36,833 --> 01:19:38,132
if you go at 11 or 11:30am,

2207
01:19:38,133 --> 01:19:39,364
you don't have to get in line.

2208
01:19:39,503 --> 01:19:42,233
It's the same for them. They can get up past 1pm...

2209
01:19:42,234 --> 01:19:43,632
when the peak time is over.

2210
01:19:43,633 --> 01:19:44,832
I really like those moments.

2211
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:47,672
There are many moments when I don't have to get in line for places.

2212
01:19:47,673 --> 01:19:50,274
Are there any privileges for the employees here?

2213
01:19:50,514 --> 01:19:52,543
I'm not sure if I can share this.

2214
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:56,284
The employees here go on trips often.

2215
01:19:56,514 --> 01:19:59,622
It's because all of us can stay in this hotel for free...

2216
01:19:59,623 --> 01:20:01,923
- Right. - throughout the world.

2217
01:20:02,354 --> 01:20:03,653
- As an employee? - Gosh.

2218
01:20:03,654 --> 01:20:05,694
- It's in many different countries. - Right.

2219
01:20:05,724 --> 01:20:07,922
- What is it, Hee Won? - So you can stay in...

2220
01:20:07,923 --> 01:20:09,533
- the same hotel in other countries? - Right.

2221
01:20:09,534 --> 01:20:11,193
How many days a year?

2222
01:20:11,194 --> 01:20:12,233
Around two weeks.

2223
01:20:12,234 --> 01:20:14,033
- Two weeks? - That's more than enough.

2224
01:20:14,034 --> 01:20:16,502
Gosh, that's a great privilege.

2225
01:20:16,503 --> 01:20:18,273
That is why our employees go on trips really often.

2226
01:20:18,274 --> 01:20:20,342
(Do you need to have your staff ID?)

2227
01:20:20,343 --> 01:20:22,144
Do you need to have your staff ID?

2228
01:20:22,413 --> 01:20:24,143
- We have to... - Our faces are checked.

2229
01:20:24,144 --> 01:20:25,382
- All of us get checked. - Gosh.

2230
01:20:25,383 --> 01:20:27,644
- I wanted to borrow it. - What are you saying?

2231
01:20:28,444 --> 01:20:29,813
What are you saying?

2232
01:20:29,814 --> 01:20:32,183
- That doesn't make sense. - He's planning to fake it.

2233
01:20:32,184 --> 01:20:34,023
Why are you asking about the staff ID?

2234
01:20:34,024 --> 01:20:35,854
- I can use it for hotels abroad. - Gosh.

2235
01:20:36,694 --> 01:20:38,353
(Eyes opening wide)

2236
01:20:38,354 --> 01:20:40,723
It came this far. Why would you ask for this?

2237
01:20:40,724 --> 01:20:43,033
I can be in a hotel for free abroad.

2238
01:20:43,034 --> 01:20:45,503
- You sent in an application. - Right.

2239
01:20:45,764 --> 01:20:48,132
What made you apply to this show?

2240
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:49,273
(What was the reason she applied to Whenever Possible?)

2241
01:20:49,274 --> 01:20:52,473
I was watching TV at home on my own.

2242
01:20:52,474 --> 01:20:55,774
I thought that having my teammates appear in the show...

2243
01:20:56,114 --> 01:20:58,842
would spur them up and be a great time for them.

2244
01:20:58,843 --> 01:21:00,742
It sounded like fun as well. That was why I applied.

2245
01:21:00,743 --> 01:21:02,752
- I see. - It was for your teammates.

2246
01:21:02,753 --> 01:21:03,983
- I see. - Yes.

2247
01:21:03,984 --> 01:21:06,882
Do you have team dinners...

2248
01:21:06,883 --> 01:21:08,184
after work?

2249
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:10,793
We had a lot of team dinners at first,

2250
01:21:10,824 --> 01:21:13,793
but as we get off work late,

2251
01:21:13,923 --> 01:21:16,363
the young ones complained that there wasn't anything good...

2252
01:21:16,364 --> 01:21:18,393
- during that time. - Right.

2253
01:21:18,394 --> 01:21:21,033
We're closed on Mondays.

2254
01:21:21,034 --> 01:21:23,333
- On Mondays? - So we meet on Mondays.

2255
01:21:23,534 --> 01:21:25,742
We have good food together in the evening.

2256
01:21:25,743 --> 01:21:27,474
Do you like going out on your days off?

2257
01:21:28,104 --> 01:21:29,814
(Do you like coming out on your days off?)

2258
01:21:30,173 --> 01:21:32,114
(The question came in sharply.)

2259
01:21:32,484 --> 01:21:34,284
Come on, Hee Won.

2260
01:21:34,514 --> 01:21:36,854
- The teammates won't like it. - Gosh.

2261
01:21:37,053 --> 01:21:38,513
- But they have to be honest. - It's not good.

2262
01:21:38,514 --> 01:21:40,423
Right. But for them,

2263
01:21:40,484 --> 01:21:42,752
it's more important to have good food...

2264
01:21:42,753 --> 01:21:45,224
than to spend the day off.

2265
01:21:45,293 --> 01:21:46,723
Right.

2266
01:21:46,724 --> 01:21:48,162
They love having team dinners.

2267
01:21:48,163 --> 01:21:49,394
- Really? - It's true.

2268
01:21:49,434 --> 01:21:51,662
Well,

2269
01:21:51,663 --> 01:21:54,702
we failed in our previous spare time.

2270
01:21:54,703 --> 01:21:55,774
Oh, no.

2271
01:21:57,673 --> 01:22:00,842
Hee Won is feeling a lot better now.

2272
01:22:00,843 --> 01:22:03,114
He struggled earlier with a stiff neck.

2273
01:22:03,173 --> 01:22:04,742
We'll make sure to do well...

2274
01:22:04,743 --> 01:22:07,284
and reach Round Three.

2275
01:22:07,314 --> 01:22:10,252
Let's start with Round 1 1st.

2276
01:22:10,253 --> 01:22:12,184
Let's see what present we will be playing for.

2277
01:22:12,354 --> 01:22:13,753
All right. Check what it is.

2278
01:22:15,694 --> 01:22:16,752
What is it?

2279
01:22:16,753 --> 01:22:19,223
"The manager will be paying. Let's go for a pork belly party."

2280
01:22:19,224 --> 01:22:20,622
It's 300 dollars for a team dinner.

2281
01:22:20,623 --> 01:22:22,894
(300 dollars for a team dinner)

2282
01:22:23,564 --> 01:22:25,064
The cash is given right away.

2283
01:22:25,364 --> 01:22:26,764
I can see Shin Saimdang right away.

2284
01:22:27,264 --> 01:22:30,003
(300 dollars for a pork belly team dinner)

2285
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:31,803
Do you all...

2286
01:22:32,243 --> 01:22:34,574
enjoy drinking?

2287
01:22:35,543 --> 01:22:37,242
I like drinking, and I drink a lot.

2288
01:22:37,243 --> 01:22:38,412
- Do you drink a lot? - Yes.

2289
01:22:38,413 --> 01:22:40,582
We might pay more for soju than the pork belly.

2290
01:22:40,583 --> 01:22:41,813
- For soju? - Right.

2291
01:22:41,814 --> 01:22:43,582
I was expecting people who work in a bar...

2292
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:46,753
to enjoy soju in a different way. Is that not true?

2293
01:22:46,784 --> 01:22:48,484
We just go with straight soju.

2294
01:22:48,993 --> 01:22:51,122
(The mission for 300 dollars for a team dinner)

2295
01:22:51,123 --> 01:22:53,363
(Cocktail Blow)

2296
01:22:53,364 --> 01:22:54,792
(Round 1)

2297
01:22:54,793 --> 01:22:58,263
(Each person will blow the table tennis ball over.)

2298
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:00,604
(There's a time limit of 30 seconds.)

2299
01:23:00,904 --> 01:23:02,003
That's for Round One?

2300
01:23:02,274 --> 01:23:04,473
- Come on. - Each person will blow once?

2301
01:23:04,474 --> 01:23:07,404
We only get 30 seconds when all 4 of us have to do it?

2302
01:23:08,373 --> 01:23:09,913
You must have a good lung capacity.

2303
01:23:12,713 --> 01:23:14,913
- When one person is done... - The next person will go.

2304
01:23:15,043 --> 01:23:17,453
(It is a relay.)

2305
01:23:18,053 --> 01:23:20,533
- Right. It can't go over like that. - So that was too strong.

2306
01:23:20,854 --> 01:23:22,253
This is hard.

2307
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:24,154
You need to control the strength.

2308
01:23:26,163 --> 01:23:27,493
Gosh, it flies away so easily.

2309
01:23:27,593 --> 01:23:29,493
- You need to control the strength. - Gosh.

2310
01:23:29,894 --> 01:23:32,034
Does this show not want to give out presents?

2311
01:23:32,934 --> 01:23:35,574
We're guests, but we were told to use our own credit cards.

2312
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:39,404
This show surely doesn't want to spend any money.

2313
01:23:41,043 --> 01:23:42,043
Gosh.

2314
01:23:42,044 --> 01:23:43,774
He complains a lot.

2315
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:48,382
(Ji Hoon did it at once.)

2316
01:23:48,383 --> 01:23:50,814
You have to blow toward the bottom really lightly.

2317
01:23:51,913 --> 01:23:53,484
(Really surprised)

2318
01:23:54,453 --> 01:23:56,224
(He tries again.)

2319
01:23:56,894 --> 01:23:58,194
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2320
01:23:58,864 --> 01:24:00,524
You're good at this.

2321
01:24:01,623 --> 01:24:03,183
It's about time he does something well.

2322
01:24:04,963 --> 01:24:06,404
Your neck must be a lot better now.

2323
01:24:09,104 --> 01:24:10,104
He must have...

2324
01:24:10,105 --> 01:24:11,202
- Okay. - Great.

2325
01:24:11,203 --> 01:24:12,774
All right. Let's do this!

2326
01:24:13,274 --> 01:24:15,372
(He's an ace during practice.)

2327
01:24:15,373 --> 01:24:16,644
He looks amazing.

2328
01:24:17,644 --> 01:24:19,114
- That must be it. - Right.

2329
01:24:20,383 --> 01:24:22,514
- You have to blow beneath that. - Right.

2330
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:24,114
The bottom.

2331
01:24:24,484 --> 01:24:25,484
(Blowing)

2332
01:24:25,485 --> 01:24:27,824
I think that sounds too strong.

2333
01:24:28,324 --> 01:24:29,324
Oh, right.

2334
01:24:31,394 --> 01:24:32,423
(Blowing)

2335
01:24:33,264 --> 01:24:34,922
(He succeeds after changing the method of blowing.)

2336
01:24:34,923 --> 01:24:37,194
- Right. Toward the bottom. - It's around this much.

2337
01:24:37,963 --> 01:24:39,333
(Yeon Seok practices this time.)

2338
01:24:41,904 --> 01:24:43,502
(He looks intently.)

2339
01:24:43,503 --> 01:24:45,202
- I must have strong lungs. - It can't be too strong.

2340
01:24:45,203 --> 01:24:46,574
It must be done really lightly.

2341
01:24:46,904 --> 01:24:48,920
- It can't be too strong. - It must be done really lightly.

2342
01:24:48,944 --> 01:24:49,973
There you go!

2343
01:24:49,974 --> 01:24:51,342
- I see. - Around this much?

2344
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:52,883
He'll get it after a few tries.

2345
01:24:53,314 --> 01:24:55,042
- It has to be done lightly. - Hee Won.

2346
01:24:55,043 --> 01:24:57,083
- It has to be done lightly. - Right.

2347
01:24:57,154 --> 01:24:59,783
It has to go in that gap. Try practicing.

2348
01:24:59,784 --> 01:25:01,253
You have to find the feel for it.

2349
01:25:02,394 --> 01:25:05,034
- It'll be harder toward the end. - It'll be a difficult position.

2350
01:25:06,564 --> 01:25:09,264
(The ball moves away as they succeed.)

2351
01:25:09,463 --> 01:25:11,023
- It's hard to find the angle. - Right.

2352
01:25:13,564 --> 01:25:15,733
Gosh. We will fail if this happens.

2353
01:25:15,734 --> 01:25:17,273
- It's harder from here. - Right.

2354
01:25:17,274 --> 01:25:19,580
- It's hard to find the angle. - It's easier at the start.

2355
01:25:19,604 --> 01:25:21,443
(The 3rd, 4th, and 5th glasses are the hardest.)

2356
01:25:21,444 --> 01:25:23,213
Gosh, this is hard.

2357
01:25:23,543 --> 01:25:25,172
- The fourth spot is hard? - Yes.

2358
01:25:25,173 --> 01:25:26,943
- It's hard to find the angle. - I'll try.

2359
01:25:26,944 --> 01:25:28,042
It's hard to find the angle.

2360
01:25:28,043 --> 01:25:30,163
We have to find someone who is good in this position.

2361
01:25:31,514 --> 01:25:33,052
We have to find the right angle for the fourth spot.

2362
01:25:33,053 --> 01:25:34,154
- Okay! - Gosh!

2363
01:25:35,284 --> 01:25:36,423
- Okay! - Gosh!

2364
01:25:36,593 --> 01:25:37,922
Hee Won found it!

2365
01:25:37,923 --> 01:25:39,592
Get ready to get a present.

2366
01:25:39,593 --> 01:25:40,723
(The person in the 4th spot is ready as well.)

2367
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:42,933
- We're ready. - Hee Won can do it.

2368
01:25:42,934 --> 01:25:44,263
All right. We'll go with...

2369
01:25:44,264 --> 01:25:45,863
our first attempt.

2370
01:25:45,864 --> 01:25:46,962
- Cheer for us, please. - Let's go!

2371
01:25:46,963 --> 01:25:49,234
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2372
01:25:49,534 --> 01:25:51,002
Round One.

2373
01:25:51,003 --> 01:25:52,073
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2374
01:25:52,074 --> 01:25:53,202
Who will go first?

2375
01:25:53,203 --> 01:25:54,443
- Should I go first? - Sure.

2376
01:25:54,444 --> 01:25:55,742
- We have 30 seconds, right? - All right.

2377
01:25:55,743 --> 01:25:57,172
- Get ready. - Should I go next?

2378
01:25:57,173 --> 01:25:58,173
Go!

2379
01:26:01,383 --> 01:26:02,582
He always struggles...

2380
01:26:02,583 --> 01:26:04,383
- when the game starts. - I got it.

2381
01:26:04,953 --> 01:26:06,923
(They pass with the 1st glass.)

2382
01:26:13,724 --> 01:26:14,764
Hey.

2383
01:26:15,993 --> 01:26:17,534
(Checking the time)

2384
01:26:20,203 --> 01:26:21,904
- Gosh! - Yeon Seok.

2385
01:26:22,163 --> 01:26:23,303
- Okay! - Nice!

2386
01:26:24,104 --> 01:26:26,774
- It's okay. - Is that it?

2387
01:26:27,843 --> 01:26:28,923
We have a few seconds left.

2388
01:26:29,944 --> 01:26:30,944
Again.

2389
01:26:31,873 --> 01:26:32,883
Again.

2390
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:35,903
- Start over from the beginning. - You have to start over.

2391
01:26:37,913 --> 01:26:39,853
(He goes back to the beginning.)

2392
01:26:39,854 --> 01:26:40,953
Five,

2393
01:26:42,623 --> 01:26:44,053
- four... - It's over.

2394
01:26:44,194 --> 01:26:45,894
Two, one.

2395
01:26:47,694 --> 01:26:48,724
One.

2396
01:26:49,064 --> 01:26:50,064
(Blowing the whistle)

2397
01:26:50,694 --> 01:26:53,163
That whistle is so infuriating.

2398
01:26:54,133 --> 01:26:55,734
Can't you at least blow hard on it?

2399
01:26:57,003 --> 01:26:58,074
Goodness.

2400
01:26:59,243 --> 01:27:00,773
- It's hard. - I know.

2401
01:27:00,774 --> 01:27:02,873
- Round One is hard. - Gosh, this is...

2402
01:27:03,173 --> 01:27:04,313
It's hard.

2403
01:27:04,314 --> 01:27:05,684
(It's too hard.)

2404
01:27:05,883 --> 01:27:07,213
Gosh, this is hard.

2405
01:27:07,843 --> 01:27:09,854
Then, this time, for our second try,

2406
01:27:10,083 --> 01:27:12,284
- let's have Ji Hoon start. - Yes, I'll go first.

2407
01:27:12,383 --> 01:27:14,082
- Then, let's start our second try. - Okay.

2408
01:27:14,083 --> 01:27:15,523
- Shall we go in this order? - Okay.

2409
01:27:15,524 --> 01:27:17,122
- Okay. In 1, 2, 3. - All right.

2410
01:27:17,123 --> 01:27:18,992
- Here we go! Let's do it! - You can do it!

2411
01:27:18,993 --> 01:27:20,340
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2412
01:27:20,364 --> 01:27:21,922
- I'll go for it. - We really have to do well.

2413
01:27:21,923 --> 01:27:22,934
Ready,

2414
01:27:23,463 --> 01:27:25,364
set, go.

2415
01:27:27,163 --> 01:27:28,833
You got it. I'm second.

2416
01:27:34,343 --> 01:27:36,873
Come on. This game is so...

2417
01:27:37,474 --> 01:27:38,743
- Darn it. - Gosh, start over.

2418
01:27:39,284 --> 01:27:41,684
(Frustrated)

2419
01:27:43,253 --> 01:27:44,614
Oh, nice.

2420
01:27:46,724 --> 01:27:48,524
- Darn it. - Hurry up. Start over.

2421
01:27:48,724 --> 01:27:50,293
- Darn it. - Hurry up. Start over.

2422
01:27:52,993 --> 01:27:54,663
- Gosh. - No, this is...

2423
01:27:55,864 --> 01:27:56,894
It's almost over.

2424
01:27:57,394 --> 01:27:58,434
It's almost over.

2425
01:27:58,734 --> 01:27:59,864
Hey.

2426
01:28:00,663 --> 01:28:01,702
Hey!

2427
01:28:01,703 --> 01:28:03,433
- My goodness! - This is so...

2428
01:28:03,434 --> 01:28:04,514
(They fail the second try.)

2429
01:28:05,104 --> 01:28:07,774
What's wrong with you today?

2430
01:28:09,444 --> 01:28:10,473
(His cramp is back.)

2431
01:28:10,474 --> 01:28:11,673
Why won't it work today?

2432
01:28:13,413 --> 01:28:14,882
- Gosh... - Goodness!

2433
01:28:14,883 --> 01:28:15,984
But I...

2434
01:28:16,684 --> 01:28:18,183
If we do this well,

2435
01:28:18,184 --> 01:28:20,484
please lend us your staff ID.

2436
01:28:21,784 --> 01:28:23,623
- We will. - It's right here.

2437
01:28:25,154 --> 01:28:27,092
(Practicing once more)

2438
01:28:27,093 --> 01:28:28,493
You should keep practicing for now.

2439
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:30,662
But you don't have to do that one.

2440
01:28:30,663 --> 01:28:33,264
We won't let you go first.

2441
01:28:38,703 --> 01:28:41,203
Start from the 3rd one. We won't let you go 1st.

2442
01:28:42,043 --> 01:28:43,043
Okay.

2443
01:28:43,173 --> 01:28:44,513
All right. Goodness.

2444
01:28:44,514 --> 01:28:46,114
If we can't do this, we really...

2445
01:28:46,284 --> 01:28:50,814
- Pork belly! - Pork belly!

2446
01:28:52,083 --> 01:28:54,252
We have to succeed today.

2447
01:28:54,253 --> 01:28:55,792
- I'm not confident. - We have to do it.

2448
01:28:55,793 --> 01:28:57,893
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go.

2449
01:28:57,894 --> 01:28:59,723
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

2450
01:28:59,724 --> 01:29:01,463
We have to succeed here.

2451
01:29:01,623 --> 01:29:02,764
Here we go.

2452
01:29:02,993 --> 01:29:04,034
Ready,

2453
01:29:04,534 --> 01:29:05,833
set, go.

2454
01:29:10,873 --> 01:29:11,974
Darn it.

2455
01:29:13,303 --> 01:29:14,373
Okay.

2456
01:29:14,743 --> 01:29:16,713
(He gets through the first part quickly.)

2457
01:29:24,883 --> 01:29:25,923
Darn it.

2458
01:29:26,654 --> 01:29:29,592
(The place where they often get stuck)

2459
01:29:29,593 --> 01:29:30,894
Darn it.

2460
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:32,894
We're in big trouble now.

2461
01:29:33,894 --> 01:29:34,963
Hey.

2462
01:29:35,564 --> 01:29:36,564
Hey, Yeon Seok.

2463
01:29:36,565 --> 01:29:37,934
All right. Your turn.

2464
01:29:38,034 --> 01:29:39,034
Hey, Yeon Seok.

2465
01:29:39,035 --> 01:29:40,333
All right. Your turn.

2466
01:29:40,604 --> 01:29:42,034
No. Is it my turn?

2467
01:29:47,003 --> 01:29:50,172
- It's over. - He did it.

2468
01:29:50,173 --> 01:29:53,882
Ji Hoon. Go.

2469
01:29:53,883 --> 01:29:55,184
Hey! Hurry!

2470
01:29:56,514 --> 01:29:57,783
Hey! Hurry!

2471
01:29:57,784 --> 01:29:59,623
(There isn't much time left.)

2472
01:30:00,524 --> 01:30:02,354
(Now, it's time for the last part.)

2473
01:30:04,053 --> 01:30:07,163
(They will succeed as long as it goes in.)

2474
01:30:07,923 --> 01:30:09,364
Hey! Hurry!

2475
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:19,243
But still...

2476
01:30:19,974 --> 01:30:21,103
That was a meaningful try.

2477
01:30:21,104 --> 01:30:22,343
(They fail their fourth try.)

2478
01:30:23,043 --> 01:30:24,974
(So close.)

2479
01:30:25,514 --> 01:30:27,212
- Then... - Today's game is so hard.

2480
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:28,484
Gosh, today...

2481
01:30:28,784 --> 01:30:30,483
- So... - Are you trying not to gift them?

2482
01:30:30,484 --> 01:30:31,953
- So... - One moment.

2483
01:30:32,154 --> 01:30:33,684
Let's use the coupon this time.

2484
01:30:34,123 --> 01:30:35,894
Yoon Mi, you should play instead of me.

2485
01:30:36,194 --> 01:30:38,223
- Yes, let's try... - No, Yoon Mi should...

2486
01:30:38,224 --> 01:30:39,523
Don't you need to practice? Are you okay?

2487
01:30:39,524 --> 01:30:41,024
- I'll try it once. - Go ahead.

2488
01:30:41,524 --> 01:30:43,393
- Gosh, but this is so hard. - I'm not good at this stuff.

2489
01:30:43,394 --> 01:30:44,394
You can do it.

2490
01:30:45,394 --> 01:30:46,764
We want to eat meat.

2491
01:30:47,264 --> 01:30:48,503
You're pressuring her.

2492
01:30:49,534 --> 01:30:51,833
- It doesn't work if you... - There you go.

2493
01:30:53,003 --> 01:30:54,173
- There you go. - That's it.

2494
01:30:56,444 --> 01:30:57,514
That's it.

2495
01:30:58,543 --> 01:30:59,582
(A hidden talent appears.)

2496
01:30:59,583 --> 01:31:01,082
- What was that? - You got it.

2497
01:31:01,083 --> 01:31:02,783
Then, Yoon Mi, you should go in.

2498
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:05,083
- Just decide on the order. - A hidden skill.

2499
01:31:05,514 --> 01:31:07,382
- Then, Yoon Mi will go 2nd. - I'll go 3rd.

2500
01:31:07,383 --> 01:31:08,452
Third and fourth.

2501
01:31:08,453 --> 01:31:10,393
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2502
01:31:10,394 --> 01:31:11,552
Let's go!

2503
01:31:11,553 --> 01:31:12,694
Let's do this!

2504
01:31:12,864 --> 01:31:14,764
You have to get this today.

2505
01:31:15,093 --> 01:31:16,133
Let's go.

2506
01:31:16,333 --> 01:31:17,333
Ready,

2507
01:31:17,694 --> 01:31:19,064
set, go.

2508
01:31:19,163 --> 01:31:20,163
(Blowing)

2509
01:31:20,764 --> 01:31:21,764
(Blowing)

2510
01:31:22,934 --> 01:31:23,934
(Blowing)

2511
01:31:24,074 --> 01:31:25,074
Goodness.

2512
01:31:25,474 --> 01:31:27,043
Gosh, what do we do?

2513
01:31:27,843 --> 01:31:28,843
My goodness.

2514
01:31:30,814 --> 01:31:31,873
Okay.

2515
01:31:34,014 --> 01:31:37,014
Jae Suk, why do you keep reacting to what I do?

2516
01:31:46,394 --> 01:31:48,223
- Oh, nice. - She got it.

2517
01:31:48,224 --> 01:31:51,092
She got it. You never know.

2518
01:31:51,093 --> 01:31:52,394
She got it.

2519
01:31:52,963 --> 01:31:53,963
Okay.

2520
01:31:55,064 --> 01:31:56,774
(Ji Hoon succeeds in a flash too.)

2521
01:31:57,274 --> 01:31:59,843
(Now, only Hee Won is left.)

2522
01:32:01,274 --> 01:32:04,274
(There is 1 second left!)

2523
01:32:05,213 --> 01:32:07,014
(Please...)

2524
01:32:07,684 --> 01:32:10,284
(We have to succeed this time.)

2525
01:32:11,354 --> 01:32:14,024
(His final breath that their fate depends on)

2526
01:32:18,154 --> 01:32:21,163
(It went in!)

2527
01:32:22,224 --> 01:32:24,534
(Cheering)

2528
01:32:27,104 --> 01:32:30,104
(A buzzer beater right before time ran out)

2529
01:32:30,474 --> 01:32:31,934
- Right until the end. - My gosh!

2530
01:32:33,303 --> 01:32:35,672
(They dramatically succeed in Round 1.)

2531
01:32:35,673 --> 01:32:37,973
- Kim Yoon Mi! - Kim Yoon Mi!

2532
01:32:37,974 --> 01:32:39,413
With 29.23 seconds.

2533
01:32:39,514 --> 01:32:40,684
- Gosh. - No way.

2534
01:32:41,083 --> 01:32:42,883
(Thrilled)

2535
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:44,912
(They win 300 dollars for Round 1!)

2536
01:32:44,913 --> 01:32:46,324
Gosh, that was thrilling.

2537
01:32:47,553 --> 01:32:48,983
- Goodness. - My gosh.

2538
01:32:48,984 --> 01:32:50,092
(They clean up perfectly too.)

2539
01:32:50,093 --> 01:32:51,154
Gosh, that was thrilling.

2540
01:32:51,753 --> 01:32:53,764
Goodness, Yoon Mi was the key.

2541
01:32:55,194 --> 01:32:56,264
- Goodness. - Yes!

2542
01:32:56,934 --> 01:32:59,534
(And Hee Won's neat finish too.)

2543
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:03,872
This is Round Two now.

2544
01:33:03,873 --> 01:33:05,872
- Should we do this or not? - Go.

2545
01:33:05,873 --> 01:33:07,473
- Should we go for it? - No matter what.

2546
01:33:08,074 --> 01:33:10,073
- This is Round Two... - I'm not confident.

2547
01:33:10,074 --> 01:33:11,873
- now. - It's better not to do it.

2548
01:33:13,684 --> 01:33:15,144
It's better not to do it.

2549
01:33:16,284 --> 01:33:18,854
- The prize does get better. - You might not eat pork belly.

2550
01:33:19,083 --> 01:33:20,883
- The prize... - I think we should go for it.

2551
01:33:21,053 --> 01:33:22,183
Does get better.

2552
01:33:22,184 --> 01:33:23,693
- Anyway, you get to decide. - It's Yoon Mi's...

2553
01:33:23,694 --> 01:33:24,830
- She gets to choose. - choice, anyway.

2554
01:33:24,854 --> 01:33:26,763
It's Yoon Mi's choice.

2555
01:33:26,764 --> 01:33:29,093
(What will Yoon Mi's choice be?)

2556
01:33:30,293 --> 01:33:31,492
We want to eat beef.

2557
01:33:31,493 --> 01:33:32,592
Let's go for Round Two.

2558
01:33:32,593 --> 01:33:33,833
- You want to go for it? - Yes.

2559
01:33:33,934 --> 01:33:34,963
You want to go for it?

2560
01:33:35,234 --> 01:33:36,404
"You want to go for it?"

2561
01:33:36,503 --> 01:33:38,274
Hey, so...

2562
01:33:38,703 --> 01:33:39,773
You might not even get to eat pork.

2563
01:33:39,774 --> 01:33:41,273
- Right. - But...

2564
01:33:41,274 --> 01:33:43,242
You will lose this prize too if we fail in Round Two.

2565
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:44,413
This goes away.

2566
01:33:44,514 --> 01:33:46,343
- I will pay for the team dinner. - Nice.

2567
01:33:47,114 --> 01:33:49,144
Then, we can't stop here.

2568
01:33:49,484 --> 01:33:50,814
Let's go.

2569
01:33:52,253 --> 01:33:53,753
The difficulty level was already...

2570
01:33:55,724 --> 01:33:56,753
- What is it? - What?

2571
01:33:57,724 --> 01:33:59,763
"Today is a celebration. Let's have beef for the team dinner."

2572
01:33:59,764 --> 01:34:00,962
"Money for a team dinner, 500 dollars."

2573
01:34:00,963 --> 01:34:01,963
(The prize for Round 2 is 500 dollars for a team dinner.)

2574
01:34:01,964 --> 01:34:03,524
Then, do they get 800 dollars in total?

2575
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,263
(Today is a celebration. Let's have beef for the team dinner.)

2576
01:34:06,264 --> 01:34:08,534
(500 dollars for a team dinner)

2577
01:34:08,764 --> 01:34:11,302
(If they succeed in Round 2, they get a total of 800 dollars.)

2578
01:34:11,303 --> 01:34:13,444
- So... - Do the staff...

2579
01:34:13,543 --> 01:34:15,803
volunteer to have team dinners?

2580
01:34:15,974 --> 01:34:17,013
I always ask the others to go out for drinks.

2581
01:34:17,014 --> 01:34:18,672
- Is that so? - Oh, really?

2582
01:34:18,673 --> 01:34:21,243
- You're not being forced? - Well, if that's the case...

2583
01:34:21,343 --> 01:34:22,583
He's the villain.

2584
01:34:23,883 --> 01:34:26,082
And they have clear tastes. In the middle, he likes pork belly.

2585
01:34:26,083 --> 01:34:27,223
On either side, they like grilled thin skirts.

2586
01:34:27,224 --> 01:34:28,623
Oh, grilled thin skirts.

2587
01:34:29,184 --> 01:34:32,193
- Anyway, she's going for Round Two. - Right.

2588
01:34:32,194 --> 01:34:33,622
- What is it? - What do we do?

2589
01:34:33,623 --> 01:34:34,662
(Round 2)

2590
01:34:34,663 --> 01:34:37,733
(Blowing the table tennis ball from one glass to another)

2591
01:34:37,734 --> 01:34:40,703
(However, you must do it with a single breath.)

2592
01:34:41,104 --> 01:34:43,033
- Oh, one breath? - A single breath.

2593
01:34:43,034 --> 01:34:44,274
With one breath?

2594
01:34:44,373 --> 01:34:45,832
It's over if the ball falls.

2595
01:34:45,833 --> 01:34:47,703
- Okay. - With one breath.

2596
01:34:48,074 --> 01:34:49,074
(Land the ball in the other glass with one breath.)

2597
01:34:49,075 --> 01:34:51,212
- This is hard. - Like that, in one breath?

2598
01:34:51,213 --> 01:34:52,613
Just 1 out of 4 has to succeed.

2599
01:34:52,614 --> 01:34:54,483
Since they're not stuck together...

2600
01:34:54,484 --> 01:34:55,684
(If he does this, he fails.)

2601
01:34:55,883 --> 01:34:57,113
Just one has to succeed?

2602
01:34:57,114 --> 01:34:58,614
Your condition has improved a lot.

2603
01:34:58,883 --> 01:34:59,984
Just one has to succeed.

2604
01:35:02,324 --> 01:35:03,523
- Oh, my. - So close.

2605
01:35:03,524 --> 01:35:05,592
Since they're not stuck together...

2606
01:35:05,593 --> 01:35:06,763
You're right.

2607
01:35:06,764 --> 01:35:08,662
- We can't... - It can't slide over.

2608
01:35:08,663 --> 01:35:10,393
It just has to land perfectly.

2609
01:35:10,394 --> 01:35:11,663
We need to practice this a lot.

2610
01:35:12,493 --> 01:35:13,863
- Yes, that's right. - It can't go like this, right?

2611
01:35:13,864 --> 01:35:15,263
Can it go into the glass to the side?

2612
01:35:15,264 --> 01:35:16,744
- That's a failure. - No, you'd fail.

2613
01:35:17,274 --> 01:35:19,503
They didn't even listen to you until the end.

2614
01:35:21,474 --> 01:35:23,173
"Into the glass to..." "That's a failure."

2615
01:35:25,543 --> 01:35:28,284
I was just asking...

2616
01:35:29,284 --> 01:35:30,983
- This is... - But...

2617
01:35:30,984 --> 01:35:32,553
Shall I try this?

2618
01:35:34,583 --> 01:35:37,694
You're back to being Kim Hee Won, the actor.

2619
01:35:38,224 --> 01:35:40,122
- Earlier, he was a director. - He came back.

2620
01:35:40,123 --> 01:35:42,223
- He was Director Kim this morning. - He came back in the afternoon.

2621
01:35:42,224 --> 01:35:43,832
- Yes. - His authority...

2622
01:35:43,833 --> 01:35:45,693
- Right, he lost his authority. - Yes.

2623
01:35:45,694 --> 01:35:46,863
I shouldn't play this.

2624
01:35:46,864 --> 01:35:48,679
(He has become flexible after his cramp went away.)

2625
01:35:48,703 --> 01:35:50,273
- This is so hard. - Have some water.

2626
01:35:50,274 --> 01:35:51,332
- This is hard. - Practice.

2627
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:53,074
We should all practice once.

2628
01:35:53,144 --> 01:35:55,144
But even if we practice...

2629
01:35:55,774 --> 01:35:57,043
(To the side)

2630
01:35:57,243 --> 01:35:58,712
Why do your balls keep going to the side?

2631
01:35:58,713 --> 01:35:59,713
I know.

2632
01:36:00,043 --> 01:36:01,519
- It's like... - Why do you think so?

2633
01:36:01,543 --> 01:36:02,843
His oral structure...

2634
01:36:03,114 --> 01:36:05,154
I didn't say anything.

2635
01:36:06,114 --> 01:36:07,523
- Hey. - I didn't say a word.

2636
01:36:07,524 --> 01:36:09,623
- Jae Suk. - We should be working together.

2637
01:36:10,053 --> 01:36:11,653
- My tooth is crooked, okay? - Your tooth...

2638
01:36:11,654 --> 01:36:13,864
- It is really crooked. - It's crooked.

2639
01:36:13,963 --> 01:36:15,524
This one is too crooked.

2640
01:36:16,024 --> 01:36:17,832
It's way too crooked, Jae Suk.

2641
01:36:17,833 --> 01:36:20,002
- In that case... - Aim to the side on purpose.

2642
01:36:20,003 --> 01:36:21,502
- To the side. - Look that way?

2643
01:36:21,503 --> 01:36:22,663
"Aim to the side..."

2644
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:25,173
I'll look this way and try it.

2645
01:36:28,043 --> 01:36:29,872
- Hey! - I was right!

2646
01:36:29,873 --> 01:36:31,172
(This actually works?)

2647
01:36:31,173 --> 01:36:32,213
You were right.

2648
01:36:32,474 --> 01:36:34,234
- I have to aim to the side. - You're right.

2649
01:36:34,314 --> 01:36:35,583
Nice.

2650
01:36:36,413 --> 01:36:39,114
Yes, aiming to the side was the right solution.

2651
01:36:41,484 --> 01:36:44,164
- Saying "Po" worked well earlier. - You have to find your own way.

2652
01:36:45,553 --> 01:36:46,623
(Blowing)

2653
01:36:46,764 --> 01:36:47,992
The po is a bit...

2654
01:36:47,993 --> 01:36:49,023
(Blowing)

2655
01:36:49,024 --> 01:36:50,493
- Peu? - Peu.

2656
01:36:51,394 --> 01:36:53,404
- Peu. - Why do you keep...

2657
01:36:53,604 --> 01:36:54,662
(Blowing)

2658
01:36:54,663 --> 01:36:56,033
Why do you keep...

2659
01:36:56,034 --> 01:36:58,202
- I'm practicing right now. - Hey.

2660
01:36:58,203 --> 01:36:59,333
He's...

2661
01:37:00,703 --> 01:37:02,373
I've never tried this hard in my life.

2662
01:37:03,043 --> 01:37:04,773
I'm practicing right now.

2663
01:37:04,774 --> 01:37:06,294
I've never tried this hard in my life.

2664
01:37:06,413 --> 01:37:07,743
Peu. No.

2665
01:37:08,184 --> 01:37:09,213
Po.

2666
01:37:09,684 --> 01:37:10,684
Po.

2667
01:37:11,213 --> 01:37:13,622
- Po. - Po.

2668
01:37:13,623 --> 01:37:15,083
- Po works for you. - Po.

2669
01:37:15,184 --> 01:37:16,253
A short breath.

2670
01:37:16,694 --> 01:37:17,724
Po.

2671
01:37:18,623 --> 01:37:19,864
Will you get a move on?

2672
01:37:20,163 --> 01:37:21,623
Po... Hey, just...

2673
01:37:24,593 --> 01:37:27,203
Just aim correctly, will you?

2674
01:37:30,434 --> 01:37:32,373
Gosh, but I can't get the hang of this.

2675
01:37:33,203 --> 01:37:36,444
(It's not easy to find the right distance.)

2676
01:37:37,373 --> 01:37:39,613
- We have to succeed today. - I'm not confident.

2677
01:37:39,614 --> 01:37:41,814
- Let's try it again. We have to. - This is impossible.

2678
01:37:43,784 --> 01:37:44,984
- My gosh! - What?

2679
01:37:46,154 --> 01:37:47,952
I have to practice the sound too.

2680
01:37:47,953 --> 01:37:49,582
Just one of us has to succeed.

2681
01:37:49,583 --> 01:37:50,863
- I know. - That was too strong.

2682
01:37:51,053 --> 01:37:52,724
I bet one of us will get it.

2683
01:37:53,493 --> 01:37:55,064
Oh, Ji Hoon. Pa.

2684
01:37:55,463 --> 01:37:56,733
- Pa. - I think he'll get it.

2685
01:37:56,734 --> 01:37:58,364
(He succeeds every time he blows on it.)

2686
01:37:58,694 --> 01:38:00,133
He's killing it.

2687
01:38:01,133 --> 01:38:03,273
- Okay. - There is no time limit now.

2688
01:38:03,274 --> 01:38:04,703
Okay.

2689
01:38:04,873 --> 01:38:07,003
- Well, then... - Let's try it.

2690
01:38:07,173 --> 01:38:08,943
- Let's go for it. - Yes.

2691
01:38:08,944 --> 01:38:10,042
If Ji Hoon succeeds,

2692
01:38:10,043 --> 01:38:11,773
- we'll succeed in Round 2 anyway. - Yes, Ji Hoon.

2693
01:38:11,774 --> 01:38:13,483
- No... Should I? - You should go last...

2694
01:38:13,484 --> 01:38:14,643
- You should go last. - No.

2695
01:38:14,644 --> 01:38:16,183
- Let's do this in 1, 2, 3, and 4. - All right.

2696
01:38:16,184 --> 01:38:18,153
- This has to be in one breath. - That's right.

2697
01:38:18,154 --> 01:38:19,483
- I'm not good under pressure. - All right.

2698
01:38:19,484 --> 01:38:20,753
Then, which try is this?

2699
01:38:20,953 --> 01:38:23,052
The sixth try.

2700
01:38:23,053 --> 01:38:24,353
- Here we go! - Here we go! Let's do this.

2701
01:38:24,354 --> 01:38:26,024
- Let's do this. - You can do it.

2702
01:38:27,024 --> 01:38:28,123
I should aim to the side.

2703
01:38:30,194 --> 01:38:31,233
Just go for it.

2704
01:38:31,234 --> 01:38:33,303
(He aims to the side to fit his crooked weapon.)

2705
01:38:35,364 --> 01:38:36,404
Darn it.

2706
01:38:37,633 --> 01:38:39,202
(He missed again this time.)

2707
01:38:39,203 --> 01:38:42,143
Jae Suk, just look over here.

2708
01:38:42,144 --> 01:38:43,664
(He needs to aim way off to the side.)

2709
01:38:44,014 --> 01:38:45,413
I'll do that next time.

2710
01:38:45,673 --> 01:38:46,883
It's fine, anyway.

2711
01:38:47,083 --> 01:38:49,952
I'm not the ace of this game.

2712
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:51,883
(He's not the ace in other games either.)

2713
01:38:52,253 --> 01:38:53,923
I practiced my sound.

2714
01:38:54,724 --> 01:38:55,724
Po.

2715
01:38:55,953 --> 01:38:58,423
- Not two syllables. Just "Po." - Po.

2716
01:38:59,293 --> 01:39:02,323
(Yeon Seok had found the perfect sound for him.)

2717
01:39:02,324 --> 01:39:04,734
(Will his sound tactic succeed?)

2718
01:39:10,104 --> 01:39:12,234
(Exclaiming)

2719
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:17,673
(Will they succeed right away?)

2720
01:39:19,913 --> 01:39:21,583
(It went in to the side.)

2721
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:27,753
But shouldn't you count this as a success?

2722
01:39:28,184 --> 01:39:30,553
- Honestly, this is even harder. - Goal.

2723
01:39:31,553 --> 01:39:34,393
- It went in and bounced out. - Right.

2724
01:39:34,394 --> 01:39:37,833
But why do you keep putting it in to the side?

2725
01:39:38,394 --> 01:39:40,033
- Step out. - You should just aim correctly.

2726
01:39:40,034 --> 01:39:41,064
Why are you...

2727
01:39:42,003 --> 01:39:43,473
- Gosh. - He did something harder.

2728
01:39:43,474 --> 01:39:45,033
- All right. Hee Won. - You can do it.

2729
01:39:45,034 --> 01:39:46,604
- You can do it. - You can do it!

2730
01:39:47,343 --> 01:39:49,223
If we succeed now, we can even try Round Three.

2731
01:39:50,170 --> 01:39:51,441
(You can do it.)

2732
01:39:52,470 --> 01:39:54,440
(Totally focused)

2733
01:39:58,739 --> 01:40:00,079
(Fail)

2734
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,418
- Now, it's just Ji Hoon. - All right. Ji Hoon.

2735
01:40:03,419 --> 01:40:05,278
- Just do as you did before. - Ji Hoon, let's do this.

2736
01:40:05,279 --> 01:40:06,618
- Just do what you did earlier. - I'm...

2737
01:40:06,619 --> 01:40:08,449
I'm so sleepy now from all the stress.

2738
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:09,889
You can do it.

2739
01:40:09,890 --> 01:40:12,090
- You can do it, Ji Hoon! - Okay!

2740
01:40:12,419 --> 01:40:13,589
Let's go!

2741
01:40:13,590 --> 01:40:15,190
- Ju Ji Hoon, let's go! - Let's go!

2742
01:40:15,529 --> 01:40:16,599
Just like you practiced.

2743
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:18,760
(He scored every shot during practice.)

2744
01:40:19,499 --> 01:40:22,900
(Will he continue with his good vibe?)

2745
01:40:27,409 --> 01:40:30,409
(The ace's one shot with everyone's hopes riding on it)

2746
01:40:32,980 --> 01:40:34,680
(It went in!)

2747
01:40:38,050 --> 01:40:40,150
(Roaring)

2748
01:40:41,289 --> 01:40:43,760
(Ji Hoon did it!)

2749
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:47,430
(No way!)

2750
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:52,100
(The ace doesn't let them down.)

2751
01:40:54,999 --> 01:40:56,999
- Yes! - Hey, that was...

2752
01:40:57,569 --> 01:40:58,939
(Laughing)

2753
01:40:58,940 --> 01:41:00,669
- Hey, the adrenaline. - Yes!

2754
01:41:03,310 --> 01:41:04,778
(Shouting excitedly)

2755
01:41:04,779 --> 01:41:06,409
I was like, "What if it doesn't work?"

2756
01:41:07,010 --> 01:41:08,679
My goodness.

2757
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:10,578
(Round 2, success!)

2758
01:41:10,579 --> 01:41:12,378
My goodness. I feel hot.

2759
01:41:12,379 --> 01:41:13,719
- Goodness. - Hey, was this why...

2760
01:41:13,720 --> 01:41:15,049
you were doing so badly until now?

2761
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:17,919
That was the most thrilling moment in the past six months.

2762
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:20,289
(Truly happy)

2763
01:41:21,629 --> 01:41:23,099
All right. Round Two.

2764
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,498
- Success! - Success!

2765
01:41:24,499 --> 01:41:26,576
(They succeed in Rounds 1 and 2 for 300 and 500 dollars each.)

2766
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:28,300
Gosh, but you really did well.

2767
01:41:29,100 --> 01:41:31,399
- At the end. - You should watch the show later.

2768
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:32,470
"Yes!"

2769
01:41:33,569 --> 01:41:39,010
(A review of Ju Ji Hoon's 3-combo shout)

2770
01:41:39,650 --> 01:41:41,278
I almost don't remember it.

2771
01:41:41,279 --> 01:41:43,418
- But we're in trouble. - But this...

2772
01:41:43,419 --> 01:41:45,649
- But Round Three is... - How many tries do we have left?

2773
01:41:45,650 --> 01:41:46,719
- Four tries. - We have four tries left.

2774
01:41:46,720 --> 01:41:48,319
- Only four? - But this is...

2775
01:41:48,419 --> 01:41:49,519
This is a little iffy.

2776
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:52,118
If we succeeded at about the eighth try,

2777
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:53,629
they wouldn't go for Round Three.

2778
01:41:54,289 --> 01:41:56,599
But you can stop here.

2779
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:57,800
Really. This is...

2780
01:41:58,029 --> 01:41:59,868
- You have to decide. - You don't have to go for it.

2781
01:41:59,869 --> 01:42:02,068
- There are 4 tries left? - There are 4 tries left.

2782
01:42:02,069 --> 01:42:05,299
- But the prize does get bigger. - It is a bit awkward.

2783
01:42:05,300 --> 01:42:08,509
- I can't say. - Greed always leads to ruin.

2784
01:42:08,510 --> 01:42:10,139
It will be super hard.

2785
01:42:10,140 --> 01:42:11,778
- It does get harder than this. - We...

2786
01:42:11,779 --> 01:42:13,248
- Our team members... - Yes?

2787
01:42:13,249 --> 01:42:15,208
Really like the money for the team dinner,

2788
01:42:15,209 --> 01:42:16,819
but they love the game so much.

2789
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:19,465
- They've been giving me looks... - That's because you're not playing.

2790
01:42:19,489 --> 01:42:20,890
Only they are having fun.

2791
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,089
All right. Yoon Mi. What's your decision?

2792
01:42:24,090 --> 01:42:25,260
We'll go for it.

2793
01:42:25,289 --> 01:42:26,459
- Goodness. - Go!

2794
01:42:27,489 --> 01:42:29,288
- My gosh. - Goodness.

2795
01:42:29,289 --> 01:42:30,399
Hey, but this is...

2796
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,560
- Go. - Go!

2797
01:42:32,869 --> 01:42:33,930
My goodness.

2798
01:42:34,230 --> 01:42:35,569
Gosh, this is...

2799
01:42:35,800 --> 01:42:37,969
- My gosh. - That's right.

2800
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:41,470
"For a full and warm year-end, let's have a year-end party!"

2801
01:42:41,539 --> 01:42:43,038
"Money for a team dinner, 1,000 dollars."

2802
01:42:43,039 --> 01:42:45,278
(Round 3's prize is 1,000 dollars for the team dinner.)

2803
01:42:45,279 --> 01:42:46,448
How much is that now?

2804
01:42:46,449 --> 01:42:50,879
(For a full and warm year-end, 1,000 dollars for a team dinner)

2805
01:42:52,119 --> 01:42:53,289
How much is that now?

2806
01:42:53,390 --> 01:42:54,619
It's 1,800 dollars?

2807
01:42:55,419 --> 01:42:56,689
And it's in cash?

2808
01:42:56,690 --> 01:42:58,560
- I almost took it now. - It's 1,800 dollars.

2809
01:42:58,720 --> 01:43:01,759
(Round 3, the same as Round 2)

2810
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,659
(However, the glasses are on different levels.)

2811
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:07,540
The glasses are of different heights.

2812
01:43:07,699 --> 01:43:09,300
- Oh, it's actually lower. - I see.

2813
01:43:09,430 --> 01:43:10,698
This will make it harder.

2814
01:43:10,699 --> 01:43:12,738
It would be nice for the two glasses to switch spots.

2815
01:43:12,739 --> 01:43:14,439
It would be easy if the glasses were the other way around.

2816
01:43:14,440 --> 01:43:15,440
(Scoring from the higher glass into the lower glass)

2817
01:43:15,441 --> 01:43:16,510
Oh, no.

2818
01:43:17,010 --> 01:43:20,180
I mean, can't we do it the other way around?

2819
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:22,480
Gosh, this is...

2820
01:43:22,510 --> 01:43:24,149
- Just one has to succeed? - Yes.

2821
01:43:24,150 --> 01:43:25,150
Okay.

2822
01:43:25,151 --> 01:43:27,690
- Still, only one has to do it. - Right.

2823
01:43:27,789 --> 01:43:30,658
If all four had to do it, it would've been impossible.

2824
01:43:30,659 --> 01:43:32,190
- This is hard. - This is...

2825
01:43:32,390 --> 01:43:33,458
It's harder as the glass is bigger.

2826
01:43:33,459 --> 01:43:34,529
I know.

2827
01:43:34,789 --> 01:43:37,259
Because it bounces up with the added height.

2828
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,668
We have to blow on it hard to go over the edge.

2829
01:43:40,669 --> 01:43:43,069
- If you blow too hard... - The angle is hard to figure out.

2830
01:43:45,499 --> 01:43:46,640
All right. Let's go.

2831
01:43:47,270 --> 01:43:49,209
I'm not the ace anyway.

2832
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:53,248
- I trust you. - Just try it.

2833
01:43:53,249 --> 01:43:55,209
- "Po." - The aces should practice.

2834
01:43:56,050 --> 01:43:57,078
Po.

2835
01:43:57,079 --> 01:43:58,849
It's a different feeling.

2836
01:43:58,850 --> 01:44:00,618
(He looks for the best sound again this time.)

2837
01:44:00,619 --> 01:44:01,619
Pyo.

2838
01:44:01,690 --> 01:44:02,720
"Pyo?"

2839
01:44:03,489 --> 01:44:04,489
Ping.

2840
01:44:05,090 --> 01:44:06,159
- "Ping?" - Ping.

2841
01:44:07,129 --> 01:44:08,158
- "Ping?" - Ping?

2842
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:09,759
- I think that was good. - Yeon Seok Ping?

2843
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:11,730
- Yes, ping. - Yeon Seok Ping.

2844
01:44:13,569 --> 01:44:14,600
Ping.

2845
01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:16,900
- That was the best one. - It's about right.

2846
01:44:17,770 --> 01:44:18,868
(Yeon Seok Ping of pronunciation)

2847
01:44:18,869 --> 01:44:20,549
- Ping is pretty good. - It's about right.

2848
01:44:21,209 --> 01:44:22,238
Ping.

2849
01:44:22,239 --> 01:44:24,140
Yeon Seok, that's enough.

2850
01:44:24,879 --> 01:44:26,909
Get out of the way so the aces can practice.

2851
01:44:29,050 --> 01:44:31,749
- Ji Hoon is practicing. - Let the aces practice.

2852
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:34,488
- Ji Hoon is practicing. - Let the aces practice.

2853
01:44:34,489 --> 01:44:36,860
(The ace comes up to practice.)

2854
01:44:37,390 --> 01:44:39,220
Peo.

2855
01:44:39,459 --> 01:44:40,989
Gosh, it's too hard.

2856
01:44:45,499 --> 01:44:47,668
- Keep going. - He's the ace.

2857
01:44:47,669 --> 01:44:50,069
- Just one of us has to do it. - He's the ace today.

2858
01:44:51,640 --> 01:44:53,969
- It's a "peo" sound. - It is.

2859
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:55,239
- Good. - Peo.

2860
01:44:55,409 --> 01:44:56,480
There you go.

2861
01:44:58,110 --> 01:44:59,879
- Peo. Look at this. - We've got this.

2862
01:45:00,310 --> 01:45:02,179
- Peo. - There you go. Hey.

2863
01:45:02,180 --> 01:45:03,949
(The reliable ace)

2864
01:45:04,449 --> 01:45:05,679
Just Ji Hoon has to succeed.

2865
01:45:05,680 --> 01:45:07,280
- Yes, Ji Hoon. It's all on you. - What?

2866
01:45:07,749 --> 01:45:08,788
You just have to do it.

2867
01:45:08,789 --> 01:45:10,158
- Okay. - Let's go for it.

2868
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,389
Then, in the same order.

2869
01:45:11,390 --> 01:45:13,589
- The same order. - One, two, three, and four.

2870
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:15,128
All right. The seventh try.

2871
01:45:15,129 --> 01:45:16,998
Round Three. Let's go for it.

2872
01:45:16,999 --> 01:45:18,328
- Okay. - In 1, 2, 3.

2873
01:45:18,329 --> 01:45:19,970
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2874
01:45:20,029 --> 01:45:21,429
- You can do it! - Okay!

2875
01:45:21,430 --> 01:45:23,640
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2876
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:28,270
(Fail)

2877
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:29,569
My gosh.

2878
01:45:29,779 --> 01:45:32,110
Goodness. Nobody had their hopes up.

2879
01:45:33,650 --> 01:45:35,350
Gosh, this game isn't for me.

2880
01:45:35,550 --> 01:45:37,179
- This game isn't for me. - Ping.

2881
01:45:37,180 --> 01:45:38,980
(Yeon Seok Ping gets ready to try it.)

2882
01:45:40,390 --> 01:45:43,789
(Yeon Seok Ping found the perfect sound.)

2883
01:45:44,260 --> 01:45:45,488
(Focused)

2884
01:45:45,489 --> 01:45:46,529
Ping.

2885
01:45:48,989 --> 01:45:50,930
(What?)

2886
01:45:51,760 --> 01:45:52,760
Ping.

2887
01:45:53,270 --> 01:45:55,829
(Yeon Seok Ping fails.)

2888
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:57,568
(So close.)

2889
01:45:57,569 --> 01:45:58,600
Okay, let's go!

2890
01:45:58,840 --> 01:46:00,239
- Ping. - Ping.

2891
01:46:01,369 --> 01:46:02,408
All right.

2892
01:46:02,409 --> 01:46:05,079
(The third player, Hee Won)

2893
01:46:06,779 --> 01:46:08,050
You've got this.

2894
01:46:09,079 --> 01:46:11,749
(Hee Won has totally recovered.)

2895
01:46:13,249 --> 01:46:14,949
(Fail)

2896
01:46:15,720 --> 01:46:17,690
Come on out.

2897
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:19,480
You must have used up all of your strength.

2898
01:46:19,730 --> 01:46:22,628
Hee Won, you must've used up all of your energy.

2899
01:46:22,629 --> 01:46:23,799
My goodness.

2900
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:24,800
My gosh.

2901
01:46:24,801 --> 01:46:26,281
- Ji Hoon, you can do it. - Let's go.

2902
01:46:27,270 --> 01:46:29,840
- You can do it! - You can do it!

2903
01:46:30,600 --> 01:46:32,569
(Serious)

2904
01:46:32,900 --> 01:46:34,039
Peo.

2905
01:46:36,069 --> 01:46:37,279
Please...

2906
01:46:40,980 --> 01:46:43,279
(The driving force behind the success of Round 2)

2907
01:46:45,274 --> 01:46:47,243
(The final player, ace Ji Hoon)

2908
01:46:47,774 --> 01:46:50,413
- You can do it! - You can do it!

2909
01:46:50,883 --> 01:46:53,154
(The driving force behind the success of Round 2)

2910
01:46:53,283 --> 01:46:54,354
Peo.

2911
01:46:57,583 --> 01:46:58,654
Peo.

2912
01:47:01,024 --> 01:47:02,992
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2913
01:47:02,993 --> 01:47:05,863
- It's okay. - It's so hard.

2914
01:47:05,864 --> 01:47:08,193
- Gosh, this was... - It's okay. You did well.

2915
01:47:08,194 --> 01:47:09,903
This is a lot of pressure.

2916
01:47:09,904 --> 01:47:11,332
- It's stressful. - I know.

2917
01:47:11,333 --> 01:47:14,132
- All right. Let's go. - Let's do it.

2918
01:47:14,133 --> 01:47:16,743
Let's go. The eighth try. Come here.

2919
01:47:16,944 --> 01:47:19,243
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

2920
01:47:19,644 --> 01:47:20,773
Here we go.

2921
01:47:20,774 --> 01:47:22,912
- Jae Suk, you go 1st. - Should I go 1st?

2922
01:47:22,913 --> 01:47:24,742
(Jae Suk tries first.)

2923
01:47:24,743 --> 01:47:26,984
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2924
01:47:27,453 --> 01:47:31,224
(He aims the table tennis ball with his crooked weapon.)

2925
01:47:44,234 --> 01:47:46,633
(It went in!)

2926
01:47:50,474 --> 01:47:53,974
(Exclaiming)

2927
01:47:58,083 --> 01:48:02,253
(Yoo Jae Suk did it!)

2928
01:48:03,554 --> 01:48:04,922
(To the side)

2929
01:48:04,923 --> 01:48:06,683
(Why does your ball keep going to the side?)

2930
01:48:06,953 --> 01:48:10,462
(He was teased mercilessly for his crooked teeth.)

2931
01:48:10,463 --> 01:48:13,234
(Jae Suk kept consoling himself that he wasn't the ace.)

2932
01:48:15,033 --> 01:48:18,032
(He shot a miracle with his crooked weapon.)

2933
01:48:18,033 --> 01:48:19,104
What was that?

2934
01:48:19,873 --> 01:48:20,973
What was this?

2935
01:48:20,974 --> 01:48:22,172
(Getting choked up)

2936
01:48:22,173 --> 01:48:23,774
- No way. - What was that?

2937
01:48:24,774 --> 01:48:26,944
What do I do?

2938
01:48:26,974 --> 01:48:28,742
- I didn't know I'd get this. - No way.

2939
01:48:28,743 --> 01:48:30,113
I didn't know I'd score.

2940
01:48:30,114 --> 01:48:32,582
(They succeed in all 3 rounds.)

2941
01:48:32,583 --> 01:48:34,383
- Round 1, 300 dollars. - That was thrilling.

2942
01:48:34,554 --> 01:48:36,213
Round 2, 500 dollars.

2943
01:48:36,684 --> 01:48:38,382
And Round 3, 1,000 dollars!

2944
01:48:38,383 --> 01:48:40,693
(They win a total of 1,800 dollars.)

2945
01:48:40,694 --> 01:48:43,394
(Let's have a team dinner!)

2946
01:48:46,093 --> 01:48:47,193
Gosh, that was awesome.

2947
01:48:47,194 --> 01:48:48,493
Today, I came here...

2948
01:48:49,163 --> 01:48:50,532
and felt a thrill...

2949
01:48:50,533 --> 01:48:52,033
I can't really talk right now.

2950
01:48:52,104 --> 01:48:54,404
My adrenaline is pumping so hard.

2951
01:48:54,503 --> 01:48:55,903
- It was so thrilling, right? - Yes, right now...

2952
01:48:55,904 --> 01:48:58,002
I came out to have fun on this beautiful autumn day.

2953
01:48:58,003 --> 01:48:59,603
Thanks to you, I feel so happy.

2954
01:48:59,604 --> 01:49:00,973
- Thank you. - "So happy."

2955
01:49:00,974 --> 01:49:02,813
And Hee Won. Our director.

2956
01:49:02,814 --> 01:49:04,643
I had so much fun.

2957
01:49:04,644 --> 01:49:06,952
- I'm so happy that we succeeded. - Aren't you so happy?

2958
01:49:06,953 --> 01:49:08,153
We're so happy too.

2959
01:49:08,154 --> 01:49:10,382
- Gosh, it was so great. - I get to go home so happy.

2960
01:49:10,383 --> 01:49:12,859
(Ji Hoon and Hee Won shined brightly today like a "Light Shop.")

2961
01:49:12,883 --> 01:49:14,153
(It's our first time leaving Seoul.)

2962
01:49:14,154 --> 01:49:16,194
(Whenever Possible goes to Daejeon!)

2963
01:49:16,663 --> 01:49:18,383
(A Whenever Friend who represents Daejeon?)

2964
01:49:19,764 --> 01:49:22,293
(Whenever Friend, Pak Se Ri)

2965
01:49:22,793 --> 01:49:24,032
(Aren't you good at games?)

2966
01:49:24,033 --> 01:49:25,132
(I have a competitive spirit.)

2967
01:49:25,133 --> 01:49:26,733
(Se Ri has a strong competitive spirit.)

2968
01:49:27,104 --> 01:49:28,332
(It has to go more to the right.)

2969
01:49:28,333 --> 01:49:29,533
(Go harder!)

2970
01:49:29,904 --> 01:49:31,144
(With harsh Coach Se Ri, )

2971
01:49:31,644 --> 01:49:33,944
(the two players struggle.)

2972
01:49:34,343 --> 01:49:36,043
(So frustrated)

2973
01:49:36,314 --> 01:49:37,714
(In the end, she steps up herself.)

2974
01:49:39,743 --> 01:49:41,554
(Darn it! It doesn't work like I want it to!)

2975
01:49:41,614 --> 01:49:42,684
(It hurts.)

2976
01:49:42,753 --> 01:49:44,324
(I was too timid.)

2977
01:49:44,554 --> 01:49:45,824
(Why were you so timid?)

2978
01:49:46,253 --> 01:49:47,753
(Exploding with an unexpected charm)

2979
01:49:48,194 --> 01:49:49,792
(She doesn't hesitate.)

2980
01:49:49,793 --> 01:49:50,893
I don't care about how much I eat.

2981
01:49:50,894 --> 01:49:52,364
(With her fiery charm...)

2982
01:49:52,824 --> 01:49:54,162
(What? A flower has bloomed.)

2983
01:49:54,163 --> 01:49:56,234
(She's even cute.)

2984
01:49:56,434 --> 01:49:58,104
(I like Almighty Se.)

2985
01:49:58,503 --> 01:49:59,803
(A day out in Daejeon...)

2986
01:49:59,804 --> 01:50:01,533
(with Almighty Se.)

2987
01:50:01,833 --> 01:50:03,604
(We're becoming so close today.)

2988
01:50:03,904 --> 01:50:05,663
(Whenever Possible)
