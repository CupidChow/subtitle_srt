1
00:00:01,875 --> 00:00:04,545
It has snowed a bunch.

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:05,915
(One snow-filled winter day)

3
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:07,816
But really, it's...

4
00:00:08,246 --> 00:00:10,245
a wonderful sight here today.

5
00:00:10,246 --> 00:00:12,185
(Today's spare time is full of dreams and fantasies.)

6
00:00:12,186 --> 00:00:13,756
No map is needed in Everland.

7
00:00:14,656 --> 00:00:15,886
I know the whole place.

8
00:00:16,355 --> 00:00:17,785
Right here...

9
00:00:18,785 --> 00:00:21,026
We've come to a place I love.

10
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:22,964
Hi.

11
00:00:22,965 --> 00:00:24,065
(Jae Suk is coming alone?)

12
00:00:24,066 --> 00:00:26,835
It has snowed a bunch.

13
00:00:27,496 --> 00:00:29,206
I heard Yeon Seok couldn't make it today.

14
00:00:29,965 --> 00:00:31,365
Because of his drama shoot.

15
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:34,736
Viewers. Yeon Seok tried...

16
00:00:35,136 --> 00:00:37,475
to move his schedule around but couldn't.

17
00:00:37,605 --> 00:00:40,445
The drama shoot is intense.

18
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:44,016
Unfortunately, Yeon Seok is unable to join us this week.

19
00:00:44,215 --> 00:00:45,886
So, I'm greeting everyone in his stead.

20
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:48,115
But we have a new MC...

21
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,086
who will fill in for Yeon Seok today.

22
00:00:51,925 --> 00:00:53,456
Wait, it's not that cold.

23
00:00:53,795 --> 00:00:54,924
(Laughing)

24
00:00:54,925 --> 00:00:56,365
There he is.

25
00:00:56,696 --> 00:00:58,696
Here he comes. He's wearing a backpack.

26
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:03,836
Apparently, the look we've been ordered to wear today...

27
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:07,205
is a student look.

28
00:01:07,605 --> 00:01:10,276
My stylist prepared one for me, but I refused to wear it.

29
00:01:11,075 --> 00:01:13,515
I told her that students had the freedom to style themselves.

30
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:18,246
"It's not a rule that students have to wear duffle coats."

31
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:20,255
But he's wearing one today.

32
00:01:20,256 --> 00:01:21,755
(The spare MC is rushing over with a duffle coat on.)

33
00:01:21,756 --> 00:01:23,425
- Dae Myeung! - Yes.

34
00:01:23,426 --> 00:01:25,324
- Over here. You don't have to rush. - Okay.

35
00:01:25,325 --> 00:01:27,926
(Special spare MC, Kim Dae Myeung)

36
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:30,595
(Happy to see him)

37
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:34,196
He came wearing an outfit as ordered by the production crew.

38
00:01:35,465 --> 00:01:37,836
- Hi. - Dae Myeung.

39
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:41,234
(To fill in for his best friend Yeon Seok, )

40
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:43,306
(I'm here.)

41
00:01:44,276 --> 00:01:47,175
(Dae Myeung showed great chemistry in "Hospital Playlist.")

42
00:01:47,176 --> 00:01:49,485
In Yeon Seok's stead,

43
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,386
Yeon Seok's close friend,

44
00:01:52,786 --> 00:01:54,815
Dae Myeung, has come.

45
00:01:54,985 --> 00:01:56,226
Hi.

46
00:01:56,655 --> 00:01:57,855
Well...

47
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:00,455
- Whenever Possible gave you a call. - Yes.

48
00:02:00,526 --> 00:02:02,725
Dae Myeung has a strong sense of loyalty.

49
00:02:02,726 --> 00:02:05,465
- To think that out of the blue, - Yes?

50
00:02:05,935 --> 00:02:08,336
- when I had spare time, - Right.

51
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:11,606
Whenever Possible needed a spare MC,

52
00:02:11,766 --> 00:02:13,235
and I just became an MC.

53
00:02:13,236 --> 00:02:14,634
What do you have in your bag?

54
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:17,305
In my bag? All sorts of things like gimbap.

55
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:19,046
"Gimbap?" Why did you bring gimbap?

56
00:02:19,076 --> 00:02:20,814
Since we were coming to an amusement park.

57
00:02:20,815 --> 00:02:22,176
I see.

58
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:24,184
I brought gimbap, a disposable camera, and such.

59
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,414
So those are what you brought.

60
00:02:25,415 --> 00:02:27,586
I heard you came here two days ago.

61
00:02:28,056 --> 00:02:30,755
- But why? - Well...

62
00:02:30,885 --> 00:02:33,325
Thinking about filling in as the spare MC well,

63
00:02:33,326 --> 00:02:34,425
I was worried.

64
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,565
Dae Myeung visited this place in advance.

65
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:39,634
You didn't have to. Why would you visit Everland in advance?

66
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:42,335
I'm a regular viewer of this TV show.

67
00:02:42,336 --> 00:02:43,964
- Really? - And so,

68
00:02:43,965 --> 00:02:47,135
I thought deeply about Yeon Seok's role.

69
00:02:47,336 --> 00:02:49,245
Yeon Seok is the navigator.

70
00:02:49,246 --> 00:02:52,344
I'm well aware of other regions, but...

71
00:02:52,345 --> 00:02:54,814
Wait. Is Yeon Seok's role the navigator?

72
00:02:54,815 --> 00:02:56,184
(A regular viewer's analysis)

73
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:58,414
- That's the conclusion you made. - Yes.

74
00:02:58,415 --> 00:02:59,684
Yeon Seok is the navigator.

75
00:02:59,685 --> 00:03:01,515
- Yeon Seok equals navigator. - And?

76
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:04,955
I know other regions like Eulji-ro, Pil-dong,

77
00:03:04,956 --> 00:03:06,755
and such really well.

78
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:08,624
But Yongin?

79
00:03:08,625 --> 00:03:10,395
And Everland?

80
00:03:10,396 --> 00:03:12,495
That was why you visited this place in advance.

81
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:14,594
I thought, "This won't do. I should stop by in person."

82
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:15,664
That's amazing of you.

83
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:18,305
I had no work two days ago, so I came in the afternoon.

84
00:03:18,306 --> 00:03:19,735
But it rained that day.

85
00:03:19,736 --> 00:03:21,034
Right? It rained two days ago.

86
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:23,306
- My junior... - Yes?

87
00:03:23,445 --> 00:03:25,746
He's the director of an acting academy.

88
00:03:25,975 --> 00:03:29,145
He had no classes that day. So we, two old men, came here.

89
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,645
They came here and walked around in the rain.

90
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:33,956
Dae Myeung recalled many memories.

91
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:37,754
Because of the memories with his past girlfriends,

92
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:39,396
he had a rough time back at home.

93
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:41,355
My junior and I arrived all excited.

94
00:03:41,356 --> 00:03:43,194
We were having a blast.

95
00:03:43,195 --> 00:03:45,525
Two old men even bought headbands...

96
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,296
and wore them around the park.

97
00:03:47,366 --> 00:03:49,134
But out of nowhere,

98
00:03:49,135 --> 00:03:51,664
we started saying, "Hey, do you remember her?"

99
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,235
All of a sudden, right? I get it.

100
00:03:53,236 --> 00:03:54,905
That brought the mood down.

101
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,306
- That's not good. - "Should we just have drinks?"

102
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:01,146
- With that, I got depressed. - I see.

103
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:02,944
The director and Dae Myeung...

104
00:04:02,945 --> 00:04:04,784
- walked home on a bittersweet note. - Yes.

105
00:04:04,785 --> 00:04:07,085
I found out while we were talking earlier.

106
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:08,585
- Aren't you from Suyu-ri? - Yes.

107
00:04:08,586 --> 00:04:11,455
Dae Myeung and I are both from Suyu-ri.

108
00:04:11,456 --> 00:04:13,095
His parents still live around the 4.19 Monument.

109
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:14,156
- Yes. - Right?

110
00:04:14,356 --> 00:04:17,095
We lived in the same neighborhood, Jae Suk.

111
00:04:17,096 --> 00:04:18,564
- Where? - My parents...

112
00:04:18,565 --> 00:04:19,866
live near the 4.19 Monument.

113
00:04:19,895 --> 00:04:22,504
- Really? In Suyu-ri? - Yes.

114
00:04:22,505 --> 00:04:24,306
I lived there since I was young.

115
00:04:24,335 --> 00:04:25,704
Which school did you graduate?

116
00:04:25,705 --> 00:04:26,774
Sunduck High School.

117
00:04:26,775 --> 00:04:28,205
- Sunduck High School? - Yes.

118
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:29,504
And Kangbuk Middle School.

119
00:04:29,505 --> 00:04:31,074
(My dear Dae Myeung)

120
00:04:31,075 --> 00:04:32,715
So you're a Sunduck High School graduate.

121
00:04:33,846 --> 00:04:36,084
Dae Myeung is close friends with Yeon Seok.

122
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,115
And as mentioned earlier,

123
00:04:38,116 --> 00:04:39,455
we have regionalism.

124
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:42,986
We have school relations and regionalism.

125
00:04:43,085 --> 00:04:46,324
Either way, I'll try to fill in as the spare MC well.

126
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:48,295
You don't have to be so determined.

127
00:04:48,296 --> 00:04:49,324
(The spare MC has a great sense of duty.)

128
00:04:49,325 --> 00:04:51,524
I should still do a good job...

129
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,834
- Of course. - for Yeon Seok's sake.

130
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,796
Please support Yeon Seok a lot.

131
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,606
You know "When the Phone Rings," right?

132
00:04:58,705 --> 00:05:01,634
He's on a roll in that drama as the cold-hearted handsome guy.

133
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:04,205
- Yeon Seok is on fire. - For real.

134
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,574
I don't know how they did it, but his hair could cut people.

135
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:10,285
He moved sideways, but his hair did not move an inch.

136
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:12,754
Did the stylist use a glue gun on his hair or something?

137
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:14,954
- That's just... - How did they fix it in place?

138
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:16,525
Goodness.

139
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:17,684
- Oh, gosh. - Hi.

140
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,056
- Hi. - Hi.

141
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:21,425
- Oh, gosh. - Hi.

142
00:05:21,426 --> 00:05:22,765
- Hi. - Hi.

143
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,366
What?

144
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,635
- Hi. - Hi.

145
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,465
Hold on. What brought you here?

146
00:05:29,466 --> 00:05:31,205
I simply came to the amusement park.

147
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,525
Are you here for the "2 Days 1 Night" shoot?

148
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:35,635
No.

149
00:05:36,406 --> 00:05:37,945
- Where am I? - Is he our guest?

150
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:40,445
(Shocked for real)

151
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:41,815
Did he come alone?

152
00:05:43,246 --> 00:05:44,315
What?

153
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,356
Where's Yeon Seok?

154
00:05:46,955 --> 00:05:48,755
- Today, Dae Myeung is... - I see.

155
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:50,655
Do you remember me?

156
00:05:50,656 --> 00:05:52,124
Of course, I do.

157
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:54,225
Around 13 years ago,

158
00:05:54,226 --> 00:05:55,555
- "Around 13 years ago?" - Yes.

159
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,895
I was in the friend episode on "2 Nights 1 Day."

160
00:05:57,966 --> 00:05:59,894
- Weren't you Joo Won's friend? - Yes.

161
00:05:59,895 --> 00:06:00,895
I remember.

162
00:06:00,896 --> 00:06:02,435
- You sound like you don't. - I do.

163
00:06:02,496 --> 00:06:03,806
Seeing him helped me remember.

164
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:06,874
Today's guest is...

165
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,805
Dae Myeung has come to fill in for Yeon Seok.

166
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:10,546
Is Jong Min our only guest today?

167
00:06:10,676 --> 00:06:12,375
- Am I? - What were you thinking?

168
00:06:13,976 --> 00:06:15,815
- I adore Jong Min, but... - Right.

169
00:06:16,185 --> 00:06:17,786
I didn't know I was the only guest.

170
00:06:18,746 --> 00:06:20,585
- This is bad. - We...

171
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:23,356
Our solo guests were Ji Chang Wook,

172
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,325
- Seo Jin, - Yes, Seo Jin.

173
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,195
- Shin Hye, - I see.

174
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:28,596
And Jong Min.

175
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:31,195
- So what? - No, but...

176
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,395
- Okay. - Okay?

177
00:06:33,565 --> 00:06:35,434
- Okay. - Right? Well...

178
00:06:35,435 --> 00:06:37,735
In the variety show scene,

179
00:06:37,736 --> 00:06:40,134
people like Jong Min are extremely busy.

180
00:06:40,135 --> 00:06:43,374
Surprisingly, Jong Min is hard to cast on a show.

181
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,475
That's true.

182
00:06:44,476 --> 00:06:45,745
And congratulations on getting married.

183
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:47,116
Thank you. But for real?

184
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:48,416
What...

185
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:51,716
- Would I fake congratulate you? - No, thank you.

186
00:06:51,945 --> 00:06:53,884
- I'm getting married. - Jong Min is getting married.

187
00:06:53,885 --> 00:06:55,084
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

188
00:06:55,085 --> 00:06:56,455
Jong Min is...

189
00:06:56,786 --> 00:06:58,454
- a junior of mine from Suyu-ri. - That's right.

190
00:06:58,455 --> 00:06:59,725
- Right. - He's from Suyu-ri.

191
00:06:59,726 --> 00:07:00,925
- Are you from Suyu-ri? - Yes.

192
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:02,965
- I'm from Suyu-ri. - It's a Suyu-ri Special today.

193
00:07:02,966 --> 00:07:04,865
I lived near Suyu Station, around the 4.19 Monument.

194
00:07:04,866 --> 00:07:06,634
- The 4.19 Monument? - Yes.

195
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:07,795
He attended Dobong Middle School.

196
00:07:07,796 --> 00:07:09,834
- What about you? - Kangbuk Middle School.

197
00:07:09,835 --> 00:07:10,865
- Kangbuk Middle School? - Yes.

198
00:07:10,866 --> 00:07:12,306
I graduated from Suyu Middle School.

199
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,705
- Jong Min. - Gosh, really.

200
00:07:16,106 --> 00:07:17,245
We're a family.

201
00:07:17,246 --> 00:07:18,906
(We're a family.)

202
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,546
Stop lying.

203
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:23,345
Yes, it is a lie.

204
00:07:23,346 --> 00:07:25,314
Kangbuk Middle School, Suyu Middle School,

205
00:07:25,315 --> 00:07:26,355
- and Dobong Middle School. - Dobong Middle School.

206
00:07:26,356 --> 00:07:27,584
Others won't know,

207
00:07:27,585 --> 00:07:29,454
but to people like us, it's an incredible thing.

208
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:31,855
Our three areas are the genuine ones.

209
00:07:31,856 --> 00:07:33,425
- He's right. - Totally.

210
00:07:33,426 --> 00:07:35,194
It's the core Suyu-ri.

211
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:36,195
Yes.

212
00:07:36,466 --> 00:07:37,996
(A while later)

213
00:07:38,426 --> 00:07:40,495
(We, Suyu-ri, are on the same page.)

214
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:43,366
(The birth of SuPa, Suyu-ri Party)

215
00:07:44,005 --> 00:07:46,275
(Suyu-ri is making history.)

216
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:49,945
(The SuPa Trio has united.)

217
00:07:50,705 --> 00:07:54,375
(Please look forward to SuPa's remarkable performance.)

218
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,644
- Dae Myeung. - Yes?

219
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:57,645
Where are we heading to first?

220
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:59,785
Allow me to read the letter we got.

221
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:00,986
- Okay. - So we have a letter.

222
00:08:01,755 --> 00:08:02,925
Give me a minute.

223
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:04,384
Dae Myeung knows good places.

224
00:08:04,385 --> 00:08:05,985
Yes, he's good at talking.

225
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:07,695
No, I said places.

226
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,764
He knows nothing about Dae Myeung.

227
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,665
- At least he knows something. - Exactly.

228
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,264
- I'm grateful. - He knows many must-eat places.

229
00:08:14,265 --> 00:08:15,495
He must be a gourmet.

230
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:16,806
- Yes. - He is one.

231
00:08:16,866 --> 00:08:18,865
Now then,

232
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:21,775
- I will read today's... - Gosh.

233
00:08:22,036 --> 00:08:23,605
- I will read today's... - Gosh.

234
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:25,574
- Goodness. - It's not going as planned.

235
00:08:25,575 --> 00:08:28,345
- Yeon Seok was good at this. - You don't have to be good at it.

236
00:08:28,346 --> 00:08:30,446
- I even practiced at home. - Well...

237
00:08:30,586 --> 00:08:32,615
- But it fell out. - He practiced...

238
00:08:32,616 --> 00:08:33,856
and even visited in advance.

239
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,585
Life is just like that, Dae Myeung.

240
00:08:35,586 --> 00:08:37,225
Plans never work out well.

241
00:08:37,226 --> 00:08:38,955
- You're right. - It's like that at first.

242
00:08:38,956 --> 00:08:40,196
- Yes. - Right.

243
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:41,856
Here it is.

244
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:44,326
Oh, here we have it.

245
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:46,736
It's the first letter.

246
00:08:47,366 --> 00:08:48,395
He's quite unique.

247
00:08:48,596 --> 00:08:50,804
- "Lee..." - Jong Min.

248
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:53,174
To whisper that he's unique when Dae Myeung is reading it.

249
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,335
(A new character for even the veteran)

250
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:56,445
- It's because of his tone. - Right, his tone.

251
00:08:56,446 --> 00:08:58,305
What a good tone for variety shows.

252
00:08:58,476 --> 00:08:59,476
All right.

253
00:08:59,477 --> 00:09:01,075
- Here's the first letter. - Okay.

254
00:09:01,076 --> 00:09:03,445
- Her name is Lee Ye Rim. - Ye Rim.

255
00:09:03,446 --> 00:09:05,216
"Dreams come true."

256
00:09:05,816 --> 00:09:07,254
"I'm a cast full of joy..."

257
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,326
"who has achieved her long-awaited bucket list."

258
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,825
"I spend a boring day..."

259
00:09:13,826 --> 00:09:16,295
"when there are no guests to escort."

260
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:19,966
"I'll share tailored tips..."

261
00:09:20,795 --> 00:09:23,935
"for Jae Suk, who hates waiting in line."

262
00:09:23,936 --> 00:09:25,236
Really?

263
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:28,004
It must be where lining up isn't necessary.

264
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:29,274
Hye Rim or Ye Rim?

265
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,644
Ye Rim. Lee Ye Rim.

266
00:09:30,645 --> 00:09:32,874
- Now then, roll it. - It's your die.

267
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,715
- Me? Okay. - Yes.

268
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:36,215
We get as many coupons as the number you get.

269
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:38,045
- I'm throwing it. - Dae Myeung knows well.

270
00:09:38,385 --> 00:09:39,415
Gosh.

271
00:09:41,116 --> 00:09:44,226
(How many coupons will they get today?)

272
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,024
One.

273
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:48,655
(1 bonus coupon)

274
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:50,565
At least it's one.

275
00:09:50,566 --> 00:09:51,865
- It's better than 0. - It's not 0.

276
00:09:51,866 --> 00:09:53,736
- Right? - Goodness.

277
00:09:53,966 --> 00:09:55,565
Let's go inside.

278
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:57,336
- Shall we head inside? - Come this way.

279
00:09:57,535 --> 00:10:00,236
It's nice to be here after a while.

280
00:10:00,875 --> 00:10:02,206
I like it.

281
00:10:02,576 --> 00:10:04,275
- Hi. - Hi.

282
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,575
They're already waving at us.

283
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:07,576
(The casts are greeting them.)

284
00:10:07,577 --> 00:10:10,186
This is the reason our worries disappear.

285
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,586
Here, your worries disappear.

286
00:10:12,885 --> 00:10:14,486
Hi.

287
00:10:14,755 --> 00:10:15,885
- Hi. - Nice to meet you.

288
00:10:16,055 --> 00:10:17,725
- It's been some time for me. - Hi.

289
00:10:17,726 --> 00:10:19,325
(Entering with excitement)

290
00:10:19,326 --> 00:10:20,395
The weather is...

291
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:23,424
- It's warm. - Goodness.

292
00:10:23,425 --> 00:10:25,066
- My gosh. - Gosh.

293
00:10:26,196 --> 00:10:27,795
- It's gorgeous. - Right?

294
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:30,435
Coming to an amusement park on a day like this is great.

295
00:10:30,436 --> 00:10:31,466
- I agree. - Right?

296
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,735
Today's weather is perfect for coming to an amusement park.

297
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:35,235
But really...

298
00:10:35,236 --> 00:10:36,874
Being in the amusement park makes me happy.

299
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,374
This is my first time here.

300
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,375
Seriously?

301
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:41,644
Dae Myeung. Jong Min. Just look at it.

302
00:10:41,645 --> 00:10:43,445
- We should go on rides. - Yes, we should.

303
00:10:43,446 --> 00:10:45,245
I remember taking photos in front of here.

304
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:46,531
- Me too. - As soon as you enter?

305
00:10:46,555 --> 00:10:48,014
Didn't you come here two days ago?

306
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,685
I did. I bought a headband right away...

307
00:10:49,686 --> 00:10:51,384
- before hanging out. - Come over here.

308
00:10:51,385 --> 00:10:52,554
- Did you come here? - Yes.

309
00:10:52,555 --> 00:10:53,894
When were you last here, Jong Min?

310
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:55,055
I...

311
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,924
- For gigs, right? - Yes, only for gigs...

312
00:10:56,925 --> 00:10:58,294
and TV shows.

313
00:10:58,295 --> 00:10:59,534
Jong Min only came here to perform.

314
00:10:59,535 --> 00:11:00,535
Never to have fun.

315
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,656
He never came to hang out, so everything must be new.

316
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:04,106
Over there.

317
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,706
- There are many food stalls. - I see a lot.

318
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:08,534
That's new.

319
00:11:08,535 --> 00:11:09,774
It must be a restaurant.

320
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:11,245
Unlike in the past,

321
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:13,816
- there are coffee shops. - Has it changed?

322
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:15,976
Yes. Things change one at a time.

323
00:11:16,116 --> 00:11:17,745
The big tree that used to be here is gone.

324
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,384
- Hi. - There was a club here?

325
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:20,456
Yes.

326
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:24,325
It changed depending on the season.

327
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:26,696
(Never heard of that.)

328
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:28,754
Jong Min. You can talk casually to me.

329
00:11:28,755 --> 00:11:30,524
- Really? - Be careful.

330
00:11:30,525 --> 00:11:32,225
Dae Myeung told me to talk casually.

331
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,894
- Of course. Be careful. - Relax around me.

332
00:11:33,895 --> 00:11:35,465
- You're my town junior. - Exactly.

333
00:11:35,466 --> 00:11:36,505
All right.

334
00:11:36,836 --> 00:11:37,965
What is that? Snacks?

335
00:11:37,966 --> 00:11:39,635
- Hi. - Cotton candy.

336
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,874
I tried all the snacks this place had...

337
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:43,575
when I came two days ago.

338
00:11:43,576 --> 00:11:44,644
How was it? What was good?

339
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:47,475
- Goodness. The hot dog, - Hot dogs sound nice.

340
00:11:47,476 --> 00:11:49,685
Corn cheese,

341
00:11:49,686 --> 00:11:50,915
and even tteokbokki.

342
00:11:51,246 --> 00:11:53,455
- Things have changed. - We should try them.

343
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:55,385
Did you come here just because of the show?

344
00:11:55,555 --> 00:11:57,054
- He did. - For this show?

345
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,725
- Yes. Two days ago. - That's amazing.

346
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,394
- I know, right? - I should know the place a bit.

347
00:12:00,395 --> 00:12:01,524
He's the best.

348
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,024
- Actually, - Yes?

349
00:12:03,025 --> 00:12:04,495
There was one snack...

350
00:12:04,496 --> 00:12:05,802
- that I really enjoyed. - What was it?

351
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,435
- The hot dog is incredible. - Let's go.

352
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,865
- Let's go. - It's right up there.

353
00:12:08,866 --> 00:12:10,786
- I didn't have breakfast. - We still have time.

354
00:12:11,066 --> 00:12:13,535
The name of it was Eccentric Hot Dog.

355
00:12:13,976 --> 00:12:16,004
- I took a bite of it, - Was it good?

356
00:12:16,005 --> 00:12:17,206
And it was eccentric.

357
00:12:18,746 --> 00:12:21,116
- We must be here. - Yes, at the Central Snack.

358
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:23,115
You can already smell the delicious food.

359
00:12:23,116 --> 00:12:24,784
- There's already a line. - There's a line.

360
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:25,815
You're right.

361
00:12:25,816 --> 00:12:28,054
- They're all lined up. - I can't believe it's still here.

362
00:12:28,055 --> 00:12:29,285
What is it? A pirate ship?

363
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,955
I think it's called Hurricane.

364
00:12:30,956 --> 00:12:32,024
(They spot the ride, Hurricane.)

365
00:12:32,025 --> 00:12:33,995
- It's really old. - It's called Hurricane.

366
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:35,096
- Right? - Yes.

367
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:38,295
I have one memorable story about that ride, Hurricane.

368
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:42,235
When things weren't going well for Seok Jin and me,

369
00:12:42,236 --> 00:12:43,936
we hung out here all day long.

370
00:12:44,265 --> 00:12:46,576
And this ride, Hurricane, was so fun that...

371
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:48,105
we agreed to ride it...

372
00:12:48,106 --> 00:12:50,106
twice in a row before going home and did so.

373
00:12:50,946 --> 00:12:52,346
After that, we both threw up.

374
00:12:53,576 --> 00:12:56,044
We had to lie down in the car for an hour before heading home.

375
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:57,805
- Because of the dizziness? - We were dizzy.

376
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,315
- Goodness. - It must be like the pirate ship.

377
00:13:00,316 --> 00:13:02,055
- That's... - We better line up quickly.

378
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,086
(The line is already super long.)

379
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:05,124
Hold on.

380
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,284
- That one! - The entrance is here.

381
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,595
- It's that one. - Which one?

382
00:13:07,596 --> 00:13:09,131
- Are you lined up? - The Eccentric Hot Dog.

383
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,265
- Is it that one? - Yes.

384
00:13:10,366 --> 00:13:12,226
- Hi. - Hi.

385
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:13,995
- You mentioned... - What was good again?

386
00:13:13,996 --> 00:13:15,134
- Eccentric Hot Dog? - Yes.

387
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,804
- Eccentric Hot Dog? - It looks good.

388
00:13:16,805 --> 00:13:18,335
Can't you buy me one, please?

389
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:20,374
Of course, I can. It will be on me.

390
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,476
- Really? - Yes.

391
00:13:21,805 --> 00:13:23,404
I must treat my Suyu-ri juniors.

392
00:13:23,405 --> 00:13:25,505
- You're the best. - Hold on. One hot dog.

393
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:27,874
Doesn't Chicken Pastry Bake sound good?

394
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,885
- That sounds good. - Right?

395
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:32,485
- Hi. - Hi.

396
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,254
- Which grade are you in? - Sixth grade.

397
00:13:34,255 --> 00:13:35,685
- Sixth grade. - Are you in sixth grade?

398
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:36,785
Which school are you from?

399
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,725
Poeun Elementary School in Yeongcheon.

400
00:13:39,726 --> 00:13:41,356
- Yeongcheon? - I see, Yeongcheon.

401
00:13:41,456 --> 00:13:42,901
Yeongcheon in North Gyeongsang Province?

402
00:13:42,925 --> 00:13:45,095
- My mom is a fan of yours. - Yes?

403
00:13:45,096 --> 00:13:46,325
- Is that so? - Your mom?

404
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:47,894
- Please thank your mother. - Okay.

405
00:13:47,895 --> 00:13:49,465
My mom is a fan of yours, Jong Min.

406
00:13:49,466 --> 00:13:50,735
- Is that so? - Really?

407
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:52,764
For real? Thanks. Tell her I said thank you.

408
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:53,875
(Heartwarming)

409
00:13:54,206 --> 00:13:55,475
What are you having?

410
00:13:55,476 --> 00:13:56,805
- Sorry? - What are you having?

411
00:13:57,005 --> 00:13:58,105
Churros.

412
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:59,715
- Churros? - Churros.

413
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:01,346
Why not a hot dog? I heard it was good.

414
00:14:02,116 --> 00:14:03,345
I like churros.

415
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:04,914
- You like churros? Then have that. - Churros?

416
00:14:04,915 --> 00:14:06,085
Churros is good.

417
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,154
(So cute.)

418
00:14:07,155 --> 00:14:08,255
Churros are what's good.

419
00:14:08,586 --> 00:14:09,986
Goodness.

420
00:14:11,155 --> 00:14:12,855
- What... - Do you have money?

421
00:14:12,856 --> 00:14:14,294
It'll be on us.

422
00:14:14,295 --> 00:14:15,654
- What? - Yes.

423
00:14:15,655 --> 00:14:16,895
Two churros, right?

424
00:14:17,096 --> 00:14:18,625
Tell us if you want anything else.

425
00:14:19,366 --> 00:14:21,366
- What is it? - Order everything.

426
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:23,566
What do you want?

427
00:14:24,106 --> 00:14:25,466
- Churros? - Yes.

428
00:14:25,566 --> 00:14:27,004
- Thank you. - Thank you.

429
00:14:27,005 --> 00:14:28,304
- All right. Two churros. - Thank you.

430
00:14:28,305 --> 00:14:29,375
What else?

431
00:14:29,505 --> 00:14:30,875
- Nothing. - Is that it?

432
00:14:30,946 --> 00:14:32,386
It's our turn now. We are getting...

433
00:14:32,446 --> 00:14:33,774
- One of these. - Eccentric Hot Dog.

434
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,015
- I want one Eccentric Hot Dog. - One Eccentric Hot Dog.

435
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:37,144
Now then.

436
00:14:37,145 --> 00:14:38,815
(Jae Suk even pays for the churros.)

437
00:14:38,816 --> 00:14:40,216
It's on Jae Suk.

438
00:14:41,885 --> 00:14:43,486
(Finishing ordering)

439
00:14:43,856 --> 00:14:45,336
- This place is... Dae Myeung. - Yes?

440
00:14:45,425 --> 00:14:46,894
This is a must-eat place.

441
00:14:46,895 --> 00:14:48,624
I've tried this place, and it was good.

442
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:49,795
- Was it? - Yes.

443
00:14:49,895 --> 00:14:52,024
- Thank you. - What about ketchup?

444
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,394
It's over there.

445
00:14:53,395 --> 00:14:54,566
- Do we go left? - Yes.

446
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:56,835
- The churros... - It's out.

447
00:14:56,836 --> 00:14:58,404
- Here it is. - The churros is out.

448
00:14:58,405 --> 00:14:59,605
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

449
00:14:59,606 --> 00:15:01,274
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

450
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,735
- Enjoy. - Bye.

451
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:03,846
- Bye. - Bye.

452
00:15:04,005 --> 00:15:06,405
When you earn a lot of money later, treat us to some.

453
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,014
- When you earn lots. - Okay.

454
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:09,144
- Please do. - Enjoy.

455
00:15:09,145 --> 00:15:11,616
If we meet 10 or 20 years later,

456
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:14,654
you might be working. Treat us then, okay?

457
00:15:14,655 --> 00:15:16,355
- We're table tennis athletes. - Table tennis athletes.

458
00:15:16,356 --> 00:15:18,085
- Are you table tennis athletes? - Table tennis athletes?

459
00:15:18,086 --> 00:15:19,895
- Come this way. - Really?

460
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:23,466
We might see you in the Summer Games soon.

461
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:26,995
Hold on. What are your names?

462
00:15:26,996 --> 00:15:28,196
Lee Hyeon Seo.

463
00:15:28,466 --> 00:15:29,565
Hyeon Seo.

464
00:15:29,566 --> 00:15:30,566
Jeong Da Ae.

465
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,066
- Da Ae? - Jeong Da Ae.

466
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:34,534
- Don't forget about us. - We won't.

467
00:15:34,535 --> 00:15:36,004
Da Ae and Hyeon Seo.

468
00:15:36,005 --> 00:15:37,745
- I hope you win the gold medal. - The gold medal.

469
00:15:37,746 --> 00:15:40,144
Good luck with your training.

470
00:15:40,145 --> 00:15:41,715
All right. Bye.

471
00:15:41,716 --> 00:15:43,384
- Good luck! - Bye! Good luck!

472
00:15:43,385 --> 00:15:44,715
(Saying bye to the table tennis girls)

473
00:15:44,716 --> 00:15:46,345
- Bye. - Bye.

474
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,386
(Saying bye until the end)

475
00:15:47,686 --> 00:15:49,414
- You never know. - Right.

476
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,086
We might see those two girls...

477
00:15:51,356 --> 00:15:53,086
- in the future Summer Games. - Right.

478
00:15:53,196 --> 00:15:54,255
Goodness.

479
00:15:54,596 --> 00:15:56,595
- Thank you. - Thank you. I'll enjoy it.

480
00:15:56,596 --> 00:15:58,702
- I'd like some ketchup. - The sauces are over there.

481
00:15:58,726 --> 00:15:59,795
This is...

482
00:16:00,566 --> 00:16:02,135
covered in sugar.

483
00:16:03,135 --> 00:16:05,866
- I want some ketchup. - Isn't this too much sugar?

484
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:08,135
But it's that good.

485
00:16:08,675 --> 00:16:10,606
It's impossible not to be good.

486
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:11,976
- Let's try it. - Okay.

487
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:14,914
- Give me some. - I'll put on some ketchup.

488
00:16:14,915 --> 00:16:17,315
(Dae Myeung the Gourmet squeezes the ketchup on top.)

489
00:16:17,316 --> 00:16:19,544
You sure are a gourmet, Dae Myeung.

490
00:16:19,545 --> 00:16:22,685
I wouldn't put ketchup on like this.

491
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:24,186
But Dae Myeung...

492
00:16:25,986 --> 00:16:27,055
Do we need this too?

493
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:30,866
(The cheese is stretching out.)

494
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:32,466
It must have cheese inside.

495
00:16:36,366 --> 00:16:37,606
Try some of this.

496
00:16:37,765 --> 00:16:39,836
- Goodness. - It's good, right?

497
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:42,774
The more you bite into it,

498
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:44,044
the more the taste changes.

499
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,576
Goodness.

500
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:48,216
My gosh.

501
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,044
It's delicious.

502
00:16:50,045 --> 00:16:51,486
- Goodness. - Oh, gosh.

503
00:16:51,846 --> 00:16:52,946
It's really good.

504
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:55,456
- You must sacrifice a bit... - Yes?

505
00:16:56,555 --> 00:16:57,956
Of your health for this.

506
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:01,226
It can't be helped.

507
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:03,966
- But it's worth it. - Right?

508
00:17:04,795 --> 00:17:06,125
It's really delicious.

509
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:08,834
I was being rained on while having this back then.

510
00:17:08,835 --> 00:17:10,835
- It's so good. - It was worth it.

511
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,735
I can totally get it.

512
00:17:12,736 --> 00:17:13,976
(The recommender is proud.)

513
00:17:15,376 --> 00:17:16,905
It's packed with sugar.

514
00:17:16,906 --> 00:17:20,476
(In the zone)

515
00:17:22,515 --> 00:17:23,614
The hot dog is incredible.

516
00:17:23,615 --> 00:17:26,386
(The Suyu-ri Trio is in love with the hot dog.)

517
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:29,216
People who are worried and such...

518
00:17:29,686 --> 00:17:31,054
should come to the amusement park.

519
00:17:31,055 --> 00:17:33,155
Gosh. All the worries disappear.

520
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,426
- Right? - Right.

521
00:17:34,855 --> 00:17:35,855
(Done eating the Eccentric Hot Dog)

522
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:36,926
That was good.

523
00:17:38,025 --> 00:17:39,465
Where to, Dae Myeung?

524
00:17:39,466 --> 00:17:42,835
The employee's passageway between Bao Haus and the lounge.

525
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:45,565
I've been here before.

526
00:17:45,835 --> 00:17:48,274
There's a cafeteria for the casts...

527
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,775
to dine in.

528
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:53,376
Come to think of it,

529
00:17:53,876 --> 00:17:55,945
I used to work at an amusement park.

530
00:17:55,946 --> 00:17:57,014
- Really? - Really?

531
00:17:57,015 --> 00:17:58,186
I worked at Dreamland.

532
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:00,084
Do you remember?

533
00:18:00,085 --> 00:18:01,614
- Yes, in Wolgye-dong. - Wolgye-dong.

534
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:03,854
- If we talk about Wolgye-dong... - I know.

535
00:18:03,855 --> 00:18:05,024
(An amusement park that was in Wolgye-dong, near Suyu-ri)

536
00:18:05,025 --> 00:18:06,155
It just crossed my mind.

537
00:18:06,156 --> 00:18:07,294
(Everyone has good memories of the place.)

538
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:10,225
It was our town's natural farm, right?

539
00:18:10,226 --> 00:18:11,226
- Yes. - Totally.

540
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:12,625
- Dae Myeung. - Yes?

541
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:13,995
To think you'd know the natural farm.

542
00:18:13,996 --> 00:18:15,095
Of course, I do.

543
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,706
- Did you work part-time? - Yes.

544
00:18:17,105 --> 00:18:18,635
Which course were you in?

545
00:18:18,636 --> 00:18:20,105
I worked in the ice cream shop.

546
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,505
I made a huge mistake back then.

547
00:18:23,075 --> 00:18:26,205
I mixed up the price. The customers bought it at different prices.

548
00:18:26,206 --> 00:18:29,615
- Was that a mistake? - Yes, I got the price wrong.

549
00:18:29,876 --> 00:18:31,014
That's hilarious.

550
00:18:31,015 --> 00:18:32,486
I got scolded tons for that.

551
00:18:32,886 --> 00:18:35,685
But wasn't the price fixed?

552
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,425
- What happened? - They must've been in the red.

553
00:18:37,426 --> 00:18:39,707
I got the prices mixed up for the big and the small ones.

554
00:18:39,855 --> 00:18:42,132
They said, "I paid that much earlier. Why is it this much now?"

555
00:18:42,156 --> 00:18:43,926
- That's funny. - What's that?

556
00:18:44,265 --> 00:18:45,564
What's with this place?

557
00:18:45,565 --> 00:18:48,765
- What? - We seem to be in a museum.

558
00:18:49,035 --> 00:18:50,334
Where are we supposed to go?

559
00:18:50,335 --> 00:18:52,405
(Current time, 11:30am)

560
00:18:52,406 --> 00:18:54,706
- Is this the place? - I think she's here.

561
00:18:56,206 --> 00:18:57,774
(Going in carefully)

562
00:18:57,775 --> 00:18:59,645
- Hi. - Hi.

563
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:00,976
Is Ye Rim here?

564
00:19:01,146 --> 00:19:02,245
It's me.

565
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,215
- Hi. - Hi.

566
00:19:04,216 --> 00:19:05,315
Nice to meet you.

567
00:19:05,615 --> 00:19:09,754
(The first Whenever Guest, Lee Ye Rim)

568
00:19:09,755 --> 00:19:11,584
What's the purpose of this place?

569
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,324
This is Dream Tour's office.

570
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:14,955
- Dream Tour? - Dream Tour?

571
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,254
(The tour program's office)

572
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,795
Do you usually wear headbands when you work?

573
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:21,965
We must wear it.

574
00:19:21,966 --> 00:19:23,095
Is that so?

575
00:19:23,365 --> 00:19:25,565
You didn't put it on for us, right?

576
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,605
- No. - Really?

577
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,534
Where should we talk with Ye Rim?

578
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:30,646
Over here?

579
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,544
Do you usually work in the office with the hat on?

580
00:19:33,545 --> 00:19:36,814
Yes. Since we meet a lot of children here,

581
00:19:36,815 --> 00:19:38,084
we want to look nice for them...

582
00:19:38,085 --> 00:19:39,514
- and encourage them to follow us. - I see.

583
00:19:39,515 --> 00:19:40,554
So we dress up like this.

584
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:44,656
I get it, though. They must dress up to suit the atmosphere here.

585
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,685
They have to match the vibe of the rides here.

586
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,725
When you observe them, you'll see a lot of unique styles.

587
00:19:49,726 --> 00:19:51,725
- Right. - I noticed many unique styles.

588
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,024
- Right. - Yes.

589
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,165
When I get paid,

590
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,534
I spend 30 percent of my paycheck on buying merchandise.

591
00:19:56,535 --> 00:19:58,235
- You have to buy them? - See? They really do that.

592
00:19:58,236 --> 00:20:00,774
The company doesn't provide them? You have to buy them yourself?

593
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:01,905
If we want more accessories, we buy them.

594
00:20:01,906 --> 00:20:04,575
- Right. - As you can see here,

595
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:05,804
- we have a lot of... - She has to buy them.

596
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,814
Communal accessories.

597
00:20:06,815 --> 00:20:08,715
So there are communal accessories.

598
00:20:08,716 --> 00:20:10,284
But you spend some of your money to buy more...

599
00:20:10,285 --> 00:20:12,415
- for your satisfaction. - Right.

600
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:13,416
That's not communal. Right?
- You bought it, right? - Yes.

601
00:20:14,417 --> 00:20:15,854
This is a new product for the winter season.

602
00:20:15,855 --> 00:20:17,685
- It's a new product. - When I walked in...

603
00:20:17,686 --> 00:20:19,854
- The ears are huge. - This one...

604
00:20:19,855 --> 00:20:21,324
(Eye-catching)

605
00:20:21,325 --> 00:20:23,294
- I wanted to look pretty. - I have...

606
00:20:23,295 --> 00:20:26,595
I have a personal question. Then do you get employee discounts?

607
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:29,465
We can get 20 percent off on the merchandise.

608
00:20:29,466 --> 00:20:30,705
- Only 20 percent? - I see.

609
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,186
Shouldn't it be 50 percent, at least?

610
00:20:32,936 --> 00:20:34,875
- Right. That's not much. - For the employees.

611
00:20:34,876 --> 00:20:36,605
The company should make some profits.

612
00:20:37,345 --> 00:20:38,865
- But it's for the employees. - I see.

613
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:41,375
- How about 30 percent? - Right, 30 percent.

614
00:20:41,376 --> 00:20:43,945
- That's a reasonable number. - That would be nice.

615
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:46,585
Could you tell us about the department you work in?

616
00:20:46,785 --> 00:20:49,854
Our customers can enjoy Everland with an itinerary...

617
00:20:49,855 --> 00:20:52,185
tailored just for them...

618
00:20:52,186 --> 00:20:53,995
with the accompaniment of guides like us.

619
00:20:53,996 --> 00:20:55,354
- I see. - So you show them around.

620
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,895
- That's nice. - We guide people...

621
00:20:56,896 --> 00:20:58,264
and explain the animals to them.

622
00:20:58,265 --> 00:20:59,965
- They can go on the rides first. - That's so convenient.

623
00:20:59,966 --> 00:21:01,795
Gosh, I heard about this.

624
00:21:02,466 --> 00:21:05,666
When you go to palaces, there are history docents.

625
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,875
And she's like a guide here.

626
00:21:07,876 --> 00:21:10,436
- We can tailor the programs too. - You can tailor the programs.

627
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,085
- I hope it helped. - Oh, right.

628
00:21:12,176 --> 00:21:15,115
- With your bride-to-be, - Yes?

629
00:21:15,216 --> 00:21:17,314
- you should take this tour. - Try out this tour.

630
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:19,886
- That sounds great. - Yes, this is a great program.

631
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:21,685
We can also tailor the program for couples.

632
00:21:21,686 --> 00:21:22,915
- There's a separate program? - Yes.

633
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:23,955
(Couples, families, friends, or any group can request it.)

634
00:21:23,956 --> 00:21:25,855
- I heard that there are... - Yes.

635
00:21:26,555 --> 00:21:29,755
Some celebrities who secretly use this tour service.

636
00:21:30,295 --> 00:21:31,324
(Is this a secret date spot for celebrities?)

637
00:21:31,325 --> 00:21:34,466
- Right? - Celebrities also visit the park.

638
00:21:34,896 --> 00:21:36,764
(Listening intently)

639
00:21:36,765 --> 00:21:38,936
- But I can't tell you who they are. - Really?

640
00:21:39,136 --> 00:21:40,736
- We won't ask you that. - My gosh.

641
00:21:41,476 --> 00:21:43,875
- No. Why not? - We won't ask you that.

642
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,105
- Tell us. - We won't.

643
00:21:45,575 --> 00:21:47,215
- Why keep it a secret? - Here's why.

644
00:21:47,216 --> 00:21:49,074
We work in the same industry. We ought to protect them.

645
00:21:49,075 --> 00:21:50,646
- Right. - But I know people do this.

646
00:21:50,785 --> 00:21:53,084
They wear masks and do the tour.

647
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:55,114
- Really? Some people do it? - Yes, they do.

648
00:21:55,115 --> 00:21:57,486
My gosh. I'm envious.

649
00:21:57,986 --> 00:21:58,986
Are they singers?

650
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:00,226
(Hesitant)

651
00:22:00,496 --> 00:22:01,695
I can't say anything.

652
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,496
- Right. So... - I'm so curious.

653
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,765
Is there a reason you chose this profession?

654
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,205
Ever since I was a child,

655
00:22:10,206 --> 00:22:12,804
I loved acting, dancing, and singing.

656
00:22:12,805 --> 00:22:15,104
I always wanted to come here at least once.

657
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:16,804
I started my career...

658
00:22:16,805 --> 00:22:19,285
as a kindergarten teacher with my younger sibling's influence.

659
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,274
- A kindergarten teacher. - When I started working,

660
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:23,375
I thought if I got older, it would be hard...

661
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,014
- to work here. - You thought you couldn't then.

662
00:22:25,015 --> 00:22:26,985
- So you quickly got this job. - That's why...

663
00:22:26,986 --> 00:22:28,655
I got a job here, and I'm trying this out now.

664
00:22:28,656 --> 00:22:29,886
- I see. - Okay.

665
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,535
How is it now that you've worked here?

666
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:33,794
Personally, I love fairytale-like worlds.

667
00:22:33,795 --> 00:22:36,294
- I love fantasies. - Right.

668
00:22:36,295 --> 00:22:38,195
While guiding my customers,

669
00:22:38,196 --> 00:22:39,564
I get to go on a trip with them.

670
00:22:39,565 --> 00:22:42,695
And they make special memories with our tour programs.

671
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:45,834
That's so rewarding for me. So I'm happy with my job.

672
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:47,735
You know, as I told you before,

673
00:22:47,736 --> 00:22:48,875
- Yes? - a long time ago,

674
00:22:48,876 --> 00:22:50,276
when my career wasn't going well...

675
00:22:50,446 --> 00:22:51,675
- or when I felt frustrated, - Yes?

676
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:53,476
I came here often with Seok Jin.

677
00:22:53,615 --> 00:22:55,255
I guess his career didn't go well either.

678
00:22:56,315 --> 00:22:57,985
Did things get better after visiting our park?

679
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,686
- No. They didn't. - Oh, no.

680
00:22:59,845 --> 00:23:01,915
The moment we left this place,

681
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,125
we were frustrated to face our reality again.

682
00:23:04,126 --> 00:23:06,785
But while staying here, we could forget our troubles.

683
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:08,995
You know, that's what this place does for people.

684
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:10,094
- Right. - Yes.

685
00:23:10,095 --> 00:23:12,666
People feel young again when they come here.

686
00:23:12,865 --> 00:23:14,094
That's so true.

687
00:23:14,095 --> 00:23:15,735
All right. Anyway,

688
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:17,564
the most important thing is that...

689
00:23:17,565 --> 00:23:18,804
- we ought to... - Yes.

690
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:21,074
Do something nice for her since she invited us.

691
00:23:21,075 --> 00:23:22,406
Right. What must we do?

692
00:23:25,446 --> 00:23:27,446
I'm about to get to that.

693
00:23:27,845 --> 00:23:30,044
- Our Whenever Friend is Jong Min. - That's me.

694
00:23:30,045 --> 00:23:32,145
- And he's filling in for Yeon Seok. - Yes.

695
00:23:32,146 --> 00:23:33,584
- Dae Myeung is the MC. - I see.

696
00:23:33,585 --> 00:23:35,584
- Yeon Seok should be here. - Yes.

697
00:23:35,585 --> 00:23:37,455
- But I'm here today to fill in... - Yes.

698
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:38,486
As the spare MC.

699
00:23:38,785 --> 00:23:40,926
- I like both of you. - My gosh.

700
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:42,555
She's so sweet.

701
00:23:43,795 --> 00:23:44,926
I know what this means.

702
00:23:45,196 --> 00:23:47,236
- What does this mean? - It means she doesn't care.

703
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:49,712
- "That's not important." - "I don't care."

704
00:23:49,736 --> 00:23:51,165
"That's not important."

705
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,465
- I'm good with everything. - "That doesn't matter. Okay."

706
00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:54,775
You're not thrilled or anything.

707
00:23:55,805 --> 00:23:58,975
(This is how Gen MZ expresses their likes and dislikes.)

708
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,544
All right. Ye Rim.

709
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:03,246
Dae Myeung. Could you bring in the prize box?

710
00:24:04,386 --> 00:24:06,345
- Gosh. - Goodness.

711
00:24:06,845 --> 00:24:08,115
Gosh, Dae Myeung.

712
00:24:09,956 --> 00:24:11,385
The prize hasn't even been revealed yet.

713
00:24:11,386 --> 00:24:12,625
- "Gosh." - "Gosh."

714
00:24:12,626 --> 00:24:14,324
It looks much better in person...

715
00:24:14,325 --> 00:24:15,655
- than on TV. - Right.

716
00:24:15,656 --> 00:24:17,564
There are fortune cookies for Rounds 1, 2, and 3.

717
00:24:17,565 --> 00:24:19,925
- But let's start with Round One. - Yes.

718
00:24:19,926 --> 00:24:21,765
- My gosh. - Open it.

719
00:24:23,906 --> 00:24:25,564
- All right. - "I want to endure..."

720
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:27,235
"the cold winter in Everland with warmth."

721
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,804
"Sheepskin slippers from UGG."

722
00:24:28,805 --> 00:24:29,905
- My gosh. - Sheepskin.

723
00:24:29,906 --> 00:24:30,906
(Happy)

724
00:24:31,646 --> 00:24:33,815
- Gosh, you'll show them to me? - Oh, my.

725
00:24:34,115 --> 00:24:35,746
- This is the present? - This is nice.

726
00:24:35,916 --> 00:24:37,645
You need these slippers for winter.

727
00:24:37,646 --> 00:24:38,985
It snowed a lot too.

728
00:24:38,986 --> 00:24:41,655
- My gosh, they are so cute. - Oh, my. This is amazing.

729
00:24:41,656 --> 00:24:43,354
I saw these shoes online recently.

730
00:24:43,355 --> 00:24:44,956
- Gosh, they seem so happy. - Goodness.

731
00:24:45,055 --> 00:24:46,685
- That's a great pair. - Oh, my.

732
00:24:46,686 --> 00:24:47,854
- They're great, right? - Oh, my.

733
00:24:47,855 --> 00:24:49,324
- They're sold out. - Pardon?

734
00:24:49,325 --> 00:24:50,495
- They're going wild. - I wanted to buy them,

735
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:51,496
so I was searching.

736
00:24:51,497 --> 00:24:52,966
- So you know about them. - Really?

737
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:55,935
- I was looking for winter shoes. - They're sold out.

738
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:57,034
(Winter shoes are rare these days.)

739
00:24:57,035 --> 00:24:58,465
Gosh, I wanted to have one of these,

740
00:24:58,466 --> 00:24:59,981
- Hey. - so I was looking for them too.

741
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:02,074
My gosh. Hey, this is the perfect present.

742
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:04,274
- I love it. - All right. Yes.

743
00:25:04,275 --> 00:25:07,574
(On a Nose, It's a Nose Ring. On an Antler, It's an Antler Ring)

744
00:25:07,575 --> 00:25:09,675
(They must throw the ring...)

745
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:13,314
(and hook it on the animal headband.)

746
00:25:13,315 --> 00:25:17,386
(Round 1: Hook 5 rings out of 10.)

747
00:25:18,555 --> 00:25:20,285
- Five? - That sounds way too hard.

748
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:21,956
Five.

749
00:25:22,525 --> 00:25:23,525
But we only have 30 seconds.

750
00:25:23,526 --> 00:25:24,966
- So we must hurry. - We must hurry.

751
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:26,125
Only 30 seconds?

752
00:25:26,126 --> 00:25:27,165
- Then hold on. - Can the receiver...

753
00:25:27,166 --> 00:25:28,166
- move? - Not bad.

754
00:25:28,196 --> 00:25:29,395
- That doesn't sound that bad. - So...

755
00:25:29,396 --> 00:25:30,865
(They practice first.)

756
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,435
I think we can do this. Can we practice?

757
00:25:32,436 --> 00:25:33,836
- Yes, you can. - We must practice.

758
00:25:34,275 --> 00:25:35,304
But do it well.

759
00:25:35,305 --> 00:25:36,975
(Fail)

760
00:25:36,976 --> 00:25:38,075
You must throw it fast.

761
00:25:42,115 --> 00:25:43,675
(Dae Myeung succeeds on his first try.)

762
00:25:45,845 --> 00:25:46,916
All right.

763
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:48,216
- That's it. - Gosh!

764
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:49,785
All right.

765
00:25:50,986 --> 00:25:52,055
(Jong Min succeeds too.)

766
00:25:52,755 --> 00:25:53,956
(Landing between two antlers)

767
00:25:55,426 --> 00:25:56,456
All right.

768
00:25:56,825 --> 00:25:59,265
You must do it quickly. Throw it high like Dae Myeung.

769
00:26:02,835 --> 00:26:04,104
- Gosh. Hey. - Goodness.

770
00:26:04,105 --> 00:26:06,304
- That's not easy. - Hooking 5 in 30 seconds...

771
00:26:06,305 --> 00:26:07,804
When the last one landed, it messed everything up.

772
00:26:07,805 --> 00:26:08,805
Right.

773
00:26:08,806 --> 00:26:10,446
- Should I be the receiver? - You try it.

774
00:26:10,876 --> 00:26:12,074
Gosh, this isn't easy.

775
00:26:12,075 --> 00:26:13,844
- All right. - You can't see, right?

776
00:26:13,845 --> 00:26:15,765
- You can't see the antlers, right? - Like this?

777
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:16,916
That's it.

778
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:18,845
That's it.

779
00:26:19,986 --> 00:26:21,115
That's it.

780
00:26:21,755 --> 00:26:23,486
- That's it. Great. - My gosh.

781
00:26:25,055 --> 00:26:26,085
My gosh.

782
00:26:26,656 --> 00:26:27,726
- Gosh, wait. - Goodness.

783
00:26:28,025 --> 00:26:29,524
(He catches 4 rings swiftly.)

784
00:26:29,525 --> 00:26:30,996
Great. The last one.

785
00:26:31,295 --> 00:26:32,325
The last one.

786
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:33,936
(They succeed.)

787
00:26:35,236 --> 00:26:36,334
(Deer Dae Myeung successfully catches exactly 5.)

788
00:26:36,335 --> 00:26:38,405
- All right. Just like that. - My gosh.

789
00:26:38,406 --> 00:26:40,875
- Dae Myeung, you're a good catcher. - Should we do it?

790
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:42,716
- Yes, you're good at this. - Should we do it?

791
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,845
Yes. Let's do it.

792
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:45,275
I saw hope.

793
00:26:45,946 --> 00:26:48,345
Let's try Round One now.

794
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:49,745
Should we do a group cheer?

795
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:51,785
- Let's do a group cheer. - What?

796
00:26:52,686 --> 00:26:53,715
(Screaming)

797
00:26:53,716 --> 00:26:55,215
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 2, 3.

798
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,486
- Let's go! - Let's go!

799
00:26:58,456 --> 00:26:59,555
Round One.

800
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,925
- You got this. - Let's do this!

801
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:03,325
- I can't stiffen up. - Let's go!

802
00:27:03,525 --> 00:27:04,895
- Oh, please. - Let's go!

803
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:06,466
- I can't stiffen up. - Let's go!

804
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:08,335
- I can't stiffen up. - Let's go!

805
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:10,956
- Dae Myeung, stand behind the line. - Okay.

806
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:14,075
Get ready. Set.

807
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,315
Here I go.

808
00:27:29,255 --> 00:27:31,486
(They already hooked 3 rings.)

809
00:27:31,726 --> 00:27:32,785
Two more.

810
00:27:33,656 --> 00:27:35,824
- Gosh. - Gosh. Don't jump.

811
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,824
Two more.

812
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:38,896
Oh, no.

813
00:27:40,295 --> 00:27:41,595
Hold on.

814
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:43,696
Hold on.

815
00:27:45,305 --> 00:27:46,535
All right. One more.

816
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,335
(So far, they hooked 4 rings.)

817
00:27:49,775 --> 00:27:51,545
(All right. One more.)

818
00:27:52,146 --> 00:27:54,115
- All right. One more. - Here I go.

819
00:27:54,845 --> 00:27:55,876
Gosh, one more.

820
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:01,755
- Come on. Jong Min, one more. - It's the last one.

821
00:28:05,426 --> 00:28:07,295
- Jong Min, one more. - It's the last one.

822
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:12,966
(Fail)

823
00:28:16,166 --> 00:28:17,235
Oh, no!

824
00:28:17,236 --> 00:28:19,305
(Groaning)

825
00:28:25,206 --> 00:28:27,845
Hey. Why did you throw it over there?

826
00:28:29,676 --> 00:28:30,916
Exactly.

827
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,284
- No, we can do it. - They're criticizing me a lot.

828
00:28:34,285 --> 00:28:36,084
- We can do this. - Jong Min, you must've felt...

829
00:28:36,085 --> 00:28:38,085
a lot of pressure about the last one.

830
00:28:38,656 --> 00:28:40,324
How could you throw it over there?

831
00:28:40,325 --> 00:28:41,755
I didn't test it out enough.

832
00:28:42,025 --> 00:28:43,824
- This was only our 1st try. - All right. It was our 1st try.

833
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:45,364
- It was only our 1st try. - We have 10.

834
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:47,535
- I believe in you. - We have nine tries left.

835
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:49,142
- I believe in you. - You scared me.

836
00:28:49,166 --> 00:28:50,295
- Earlier... - This is...

837
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,035
- Right. - This was our first try.

838
00:28:53,466 --> 00:28:54,834
Dae Myeung, you throw it.

839
00:28:54,835 --> 00:28:56,176
- Okay. - I'll be the receiver.

840
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:59,406
- Jong Min, don't be nervous. - Yes? Okay.

841
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:00,774
- I'm sweating now. - Let's do this.

842
00:29:00,775 --> 00:29:02,646
- You can do this! - Let's go!

843
00:29:03,416 --> 00:29:04,486
All right.

844
00:29:05,315 --> 00:29:06,715
This is our second try. Let's go!

845
00:29:06,716 --> 00:29:07,985
- Let's go! - Let's go!

846
00:29:07,986 --> 00:29:09,156
(They have 9 tries left.)

847
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:12,426
- Relax. We can do it. Okay? - Okay.

848
00:29:13,156 --> 00:29:14,254
Get ready.

849
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:16,195
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

850
00:29:16,196 --> 00:29:17,196
Set.

851
00:29:22,365 --> 00:29:23,436
Okay.

852
00:29:24,265 --> 00:29:25,365
Okay.

853
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:27,835
We got this.

854
00:29:33,676 --> 00:29:34,716
Okay.

855
00:29:35,676 --> 00:29:36,746
Okay. Yes!

856
00:29:37,146 --> 00:29:38,186
Okay. Yes!

857
00:29:43,615 --> 00:29:45,655
(Once again, they have 4 rings.)

858
00:29:45,656 --> 00:29:48,426
(Just one more!)

859
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:54,496
- Gosh. - Slow down.

860
00:29:54,696 --> 00:29:55,765
Slow down.

861
00:29:56,595 --> 00:29:57,865
Slow down.

862
00:30:02,035 --> 00:30:03,075
Slow down.

863
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:06,446
(They successfully hook 5 rings!)

864
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,222
(Trying to figure out what's going on)

865
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:12,916
(We did it!)

866
00:30:14,755 --> 00:30:19,226
- We did it! - This is it!

867
00:30:19,555 --> 00:30:22,024
(Dae Myeung speaks frantically.)

868
00:30:22,025 --> 00:30:24,696
(This is amazing!)

869
00:30:25,696 --> 00:30:27,125
- All right. It's only Round One. - Gosh.

870
00:30:27,126 --> 00:30:28,736
- Right. Okay. - It's only Round One.

871
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,666
- All right. - Yes, it's Round One.

872
00:30:31,136 --> 00:30:32,264
- We completed... - That was easy.

873
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,435
- Round One! - We did it.

874
00:30:33,436 --> 00:30:35,004
(They obtain the sheepskin slippers for Round 1.)

875
00:30:35,005 --> 00:30:36,804
All right. Round Two.

876
00:30:36,805 --> 00:30:39,074
You can decide if you want to keep going or not.

877
00:30:39,075 --> 00:30:41,115
- We still have eight tries left. - Right.

878
00:30:41,775 --> 00:30:43,545
- Go! - Go!

879
00:30:44,045 --> 00:30:45,784
- So... - Gosh, that wasn't easy.

880
00:30:45,785 --> 00:30:46,785
My gosh.

881
00:30:46,786 --> 00:30:49,455
"I live in the dorm, but I still need my alone time."

882
00:30:49,456 --> 00:30:50,584
"AirPods Max."

883
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,284
(The prize for Round 2 is an AirPods Max.)

884
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:53,486
- No way. - That's the prize?

885
00:30:54,555 --> 00:30:55,956
(It's about 800 dollars.)

886
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,365
(This is amazing.)

887
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:00,496
- Everyone is shocked. - They're shocked.

888
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,295
Please perform well.

889
00:31:02,865 --> 00:31:04,034
Gosh, that's amazing.

890
00:31:04,035 --> 00:31:05,104
(Round 2)

891
00:31:05,105 --> 00:31:08,176
(The ears on the headband will get smaller.)

892
00:31:08,736 --> 00:31:10,605
- The ears? What? - That?

893
00:31:10,676 --> 00:31:12,445
- They got smaller too drastically. - No.

894
00:31:12,446 --> 00:31:13,946
This is unreasonable.

895
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:15,915
I don't think we can fit five rings on them.

896
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,756
We tried it out, and they're more than enough.

897
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,614
I don't think we can make it work with this headband.

898
00:31:22,615 --> 00:31:23,615
This is...

899
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:26,085
This...

900
00:31:27,226 --> 00:31:29,496
All right. You guys should practice again.

901
00:31:29,696 --> 00:31:30,696
- Try it. - Let's go.

902
00:31:30,697 --> 00:31:31,925
- You can do this. - Let's go.

903
00:31:31,926 --> 00:31:33,795
- Let's go! - Let's go!

904
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:37,765
- Let's practice. - Gosh, this won't be easy.

905
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:41,035
(Jae Suk will be the receiver.)

906
00:31:43,605 --> 00:31:44,676
My gosh. This...

907
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:47,045
(It bounced off the ear.)

908
00:31:47,446 --> 00:31:48,745
My gosh. This will be hard.

909
00:31:48,746 --> 00:31:51,015
- It's hard as expected. - It won't stay on the ear.

910
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:56,085
- See? It bounces off. - What do we do?

911
00:31:56,585 --> 00:31:58,625
- See? It bounces off. - Oh, no.

912
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:00,754
- Gosh, this is so hard. - This will be really tough.

913
00:32:00,755 --> 00:32:02,095
(Fidgeting)

914
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:04,565
(Pulling)

915
00:32:05,595 --> 00:32:06,595
(Stretching)

916
00:32:06,795 --> 00:32:08,465
(Squeezing the panda's ears)

917
00:32:08,466 --> 00:32:11,035
- The ears got smaller drastically. - Hold on.

918
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:13,436
All right.

919
00:32:13,565 --> 00:32:14,975
(Perking up)

920
00:32:14,976 --> 00:32:15,976
The ears are perking up.

921
00:32:17,176 --> 00:32:19,175
(They practice with the ears perked up.)

922
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:20,746
- Okay. - My gosh. Great.

923
00:32:20,876 --> 00:32:22,646
I need to assume the squat position.

924
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:27,386
Okay.

925
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:31,254
Okay. I got the hang of it now.

926
00:32:31,255 --> 00:32:32,425
(Jong Min succeeds 3 times in a row.)

927
00:32:32,426 --> 00:32:33,655
Dae Myeung, go for a long toss.

928
00:32:33,656 --> 00:32:34,926
I got the hang of it now.

929
00:32:35,525 --> 00:32:36,825
(A long toss)

930
00:32:37,966 --> 00:32:39,465
(They successfully hook five rings.)

931
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:40,524
- All right. - Remember that.

932
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:42,864
- My position was stable. - Yes, that was stable.

933
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:44,165
- Did you see that? - We got this.

934
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:45,926
- You can do this. - My position was stable.

935
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:47,635
- The squat position. - All right.

936
00:32:47,636 --> 00:32:48,905
- Gosh, this... - Great.

937
00:32:48,906 --> 00:32:50,505
- A big prize is at stake. - All right.

938
00:32:50,946 --> 00:32:53,505
Check this out. I got the position ready.

939
00:32:54,176 --> 00:32:55,616
(Making sure the ears are perked up)

940
00:32:56,045 --> 00:32:57,074
Let's do this!

941
00:32:57,075 --> 00:32:58,285
- Let's go! - Let's go!

942
00:33:00,686 --> 00:33:02,455
- Gosh, this was so sudden. - Get ready.

943
00:33:02,456 --> 00:33:04,402
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

944
00:33:04,426 --> 00:33:06,785
(Ready to play in the squat position)

945
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:11,496
Set.

946
00:33:14,865 --> 00:33:15,896
My gosh.

947
00:33:18,406 --> 00:33:19,436
My gosh.

948
00:33:21,805 --> 00:33:23,075
- Okay. - That was low.

949
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,376
- Okay. - That was low.

950
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:30,015
Okay.

951
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:32,246
No.

952
00:33:32,585 --> 00:33:34,785
Jong Min, your throws are lower than they were earlier.

953
00:33:34,886 --> 00:33:37,086
Jong Min, your throws are lower than they were earlier.

954
00:33:38,886 --> 00:33:39,956
Okay.

955
00:33:40,525 --> 00:33:41,525
Okay.

956
00:33:42,496 --> 00:33:44,926
(They have 3 rings remaining in their hands.)

957
00:33:51,365 --> 00:33:54,906
(They succeed with 4 rings.)

958
00:33:55,335 --> 00:33:57,206
(There's only 1 ring left.)

959
00:34:05,137 --> 00:34:06,137
You can do this.

960
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:10,619
(They fail as they're one ring short.)

961
00:34:12,619 --> 00:34:15,128
(Saddened by the last ring)

962
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,258
Gosh, that was so close.

963
00:34:20,398 --> 00:34:22,068
- I couldn't do it. - Why...

964
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:23,539
Dae Myeung.

965
00:34:23,738 --> 00:34:25,498
Don't be nervous. If you get nervous, it's over.

966
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:27,138
Why do I get nervous the moment I start?

967
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,385
- So don't be nervous. - Gosh...

968
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:30,107
You were doing well earlier. Why did your throws get shorter?

969
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:31,138
- They were too short. - This is so hard.

970
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,619
- Right. Don't be nervous. - My gosh.

971
00:34:33,048 --> 00:34:35,778
How many years have you been doing variety shows?

972
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,548
- Twenty years. - Right. So...

973
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,547
- So don't be scared. - Okay.

974
00:34:39,548 --> 00:34:41,308
- Don't be scared. Okay, Dae Myeung? - Okay.

975
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:43,187
I think we're doing well.

976
00:34:43,188 --> 00:34:44,959
- I think I should be the receiver. - Right.

977
00:34:45,059 --> 00:34:47,488
- You got this! - You can do it!

978
00:34:47,588 --> 00:34:49,358
- I think we can do this. - All right.

979
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,929
- We have many tries left. - Right.

980
00:34:52,128 --> 00:34:53,929
- Let's stretch. - Yes.

981
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:55,708
It's bound to make you nervous.

982
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,568
- Gosh. - Why are you stretching?

983
00:34:57,968 --> 00:34:59,098
- All right. - We're nervous too.

984
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,467
- All right. - Let's stretch our neck.

985
00:35:00,468 --> 00:35:02,209
All right. This... Oh, my.

986
00:35:02,438 --> 00:35:03,608
My goodness.

987
00:35:03,878 --> 00:35:04,909
(Exhaling)

988
00:35:05,809 --> 00:35:07,949
- You got this. - Let's do this.

989
00:35:09,048 --> 00:35:10,378
Just play it like you did before.

990
00:35:11,019 --> 00:35:12,349
- Here we go. - Here we go.

991
00:35:12,548 --> 00:35:14,619
- Let's go! - Let's go!

992
00:35:14,749 --> 00:35:16,918
- Slow down. - Get ready. Set.

993
00:35:19,789 --> 00:35:20,829
Okay.

994
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:22,688
Okay.

995
00:35:24,758 --> 00:35:25,798
Okay.

996
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:27,168
Okay.

997
00:35:28,398 --> 00:35:30,099
We got this. I got the hang of it now.

998
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:32,869
Gosh, no!

999
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,238
Calm down. Slowly.

1000
00:35:37,378 --> 00:35:38,409
It's okay. Slow down.

1001
00:35:39,608 --> 00:35:41,148
Slow down.

1002
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:42,778
We got this. Slow down.

1003
00:35:43,249 --> 00:35:45,949
(They successfully hook 4 rings.)

1004
00:35:46,918 --> 00:35:48,249
Slow down.

1005
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,418
Slow down.

1006
00:35:54,459 --> 00:35:56,658
Slow down. Dae Myeung. We have time left.

1007
00:35:56,659 --> 00:35:58,628
(It's down to the last ring again.)

1008
00:35:58,829 --> 00:36:00,929
Slow down. Dae Myeung. We have time left.

1009
00:36:07,838 --> 00:36:09,478
Slow down. Dae Myeung. We have time left.

1010
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:13,699
Slow down. We have time left.

1011
00:36:16,619 --> 00:36:18,718
(They succeed Round 2!)

1012
00:36:24,959 --> 00:36:26,328
This is crazy!

1013
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,988
(Celebrating frantically)

1014
00:36:33,298 --> 00:36:35,829
Gosh, how did we end up hooking exactly five?

1015
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,998
Yes!

1016
00:36:36,999 --> 00:36:38,598
- Suyu-ri did it! - Dae Myeung, you were amazing.

1017
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:39,708
(The guys from Suyu-ri did it!)

1018
00:36:39,709 --> 00:36:42,268
- The last one... Yes! - Yes!

1019
00:36:42,269 --> 00:36:44,079
- Yes! - Yes!

1020
00:36:44,639 --> 00:36:46,878
(The casts celebrate too.)

1021
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:49,479
- Great. All right. - You got the last one in.

1022
00:36:49,778 --> 00:36:51,678
- We completed Round 2! - We completed Round 2!

1023
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:53,487
(They also obtain the AirPods Max.)

1024
00:36:53,488 --> 00:36:55,849
My gosh, you didn't even get nervous for the last one.

1025
00:36:55,988 --> 00:36:58,019
- Gosh. - And you caught it stably.

1026
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:00,159
- I did. - That was very stable.

1027
00:37:00,258 --> 00:37:01,389
Gosh, this is it.

1028
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:03,228
- Should I keep going or not? - I think they can do it.

1029
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:04,728
But I'm curious about the last one.

1030
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:06,329
By the way,

1031
00:37:06,568 --> 00:37:07,667
starting now,

1032
00:37:07,668 --> 00:37:09,638
- My gosh, I... - we won't say much.

1033
00:37:09,639 --> 00:37:11,098
It will be much harder for Round Three.

1034
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,268
It will be really hard.

1035
00:37:12,269 --> 00:37:13,869
You must think carefully about this.

1036
00:37:14,008 --> 00:37:15,708
I don't think we can do it with six tries.

1037
00:37:15,709 --> 00:37:17,354
(I don't think we can do it with 6 tries.)

1038
00:37:17,378 --> 00:37:18,438
Are you tired?

1039
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:20,647
- But we got lucky. - Yes.

1040
00:37:20,648 --> 00:37:22,878
- Right. We were... - We got lucky just now too.

1041
00:37:23,249 --> 00:37:26,518
So in my opinion, we achieved more than our skills would've allowed.

1042
00:37:26,519 --> 00:37:29,087
All right. But the thing is,

1043
00:37:29,088 --> 00:37:31,458
it's completely up to you. It's your decision.

1044
00:37:31,459 --> 00:37:32,818
(How will Ye Rim decide?)

1045
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:34,929
They were never mine to begin with.

1046
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,459
- Go. - What?

1047
00:37:36,959 --> 00:37:39,829
- Okay. She wants to keep going. - Go.

1048
00:37:39,929 --> 00:37:41,328
- All right. - Please.

1049
00:37:41,329 --> 00:37:42,599
I can't trust us anymore.

1050
00:37:42,829 --> 00:37:43,937
But...

1051
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:45,667
(Curious)

1052
00:37:45,668 --> 00:37:47,937
"I want to embark on a dream tour for myself."

1053
00:37:47,938 --> 00:37:48,967
"A round-trip flight ticket to Da Nang..."

1054
00:37:48,968 --> 00:37:50,768
"and a hotel voucher for a three-night stay."

1055
00:37:50,809 --> 00:37:52,308
- Da Nang? - Da Nang?

1056
00:37:52,309 --> 00:37:53,849
(This is crazy!)

1057
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,908
- The dream tour. - Yes!

1058
00:37:55,909 --> 00:37:57,217
(A dream tour for myself, a 4-day trip voucher to Da Nang)

1059
00:37:57,218 --> 00:37:58,918
- Please! - Let's go.

1060
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:00,917
I really want to win this.

1061
00:38:00,918 --> 00:38:02,417
- What? - I've never been abroad.

1062
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:03,918
- What? - Really?

1063
00:38:04,289 --> 00:38:06,159
- You have never... - I've never been abroad.

1064
00:38:06,258 --> 00:38:08,389
Why would you say that now?

1065
00:38:09,028 --> 00:38:11,258
You should've said that when Yeon Seok was on the show.

1066
00:38:11,829 --> 00:38:14,027
- Gosh, this is... - Why did it have to be us?

1067
00:38:14,028 --> 00:38:15,798
For Ye Rim...

1068
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,238
- She has never traveled abroad. - What should we do?

1069
00:38:19,039 --> 00:38:20,467
We need to send her on the trip.

1070
00:38:20,468 --> 00:38:22,268
All right. What's the last one?

1071
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,408
(Round 3)

1072
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,878
(The rings are smaller.)

1073
00:38:26,479 --> 00:38:28,578
(The rings are smaller?)

1074
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:29,679
Gosh, this is...

1075
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:32,979
- Gosh, this is... - This is...

1076
00:38:33,488 --> 00:38:35,518
(Checking the weight)

1077
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,917
This is too...

1078
00:38:36,918 --> 00:38:38,388
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1079
00:38:38,389 --> 00:38:40,188
- We need to practice. - Yes.

1080
00:38:40,858 --> 00:38:41,889
This is incredible.

1081
00:38:42,358 --> 00:38:44,058
- All right. - But we got the hang of it.

1082
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,397
- Yes. - We can do it.

1083
00:38:45,398 --> 00:38:46,468
(I believe in you guys.)

1084
00:38:46,729 --> 00:38:49,027
(Dae Myeung is weak-hearted.)

1085
00:38:49,028 --> 00:38:50,768
- Stay calm like earlier. - You can do it.

1086
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:52,699
- Team Suyu-ri... - Yes?

1087
00:38:52,869 --> 00:38:54,737
- is doing very well. - That's good.

1088
00:38:54,738 --> 00:38:56,837
- Suyu-ri... - We spent...

1089
00:38:56,838 --> 00:38:59,579
- our school days in Suyu-ri. - Yes.

1090
00:38:59,749 --> 00:39:01,678
Seriously, Team Suyu-ri is doing an incredible job.

1091
00:39:01,679 --> 00:39:03,217
- Seriously. - Seriously. In Gangbuk...

1092
00:39:03,218 --> 00:39:04,378
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1093
00:39:04,519 --> 00:39:07,018
We grew up in Suyu-ri and entered the show business.

1094
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,288
We made it big in the rough show business.

1095
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:10,618
- I agree. - That's right.

1096
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,659
Of course. It's quite a feat.

1097
00:39:12,889 --> 00:39:14,658
Singer, actor, and comedian.

1098
00:39:14,659 --> 00:39:15,858
That's right.

1099
00:39:16,929 --> 00:39:19,798
(The Suyu-ri Trio praise each other.)

1100
00:39:21,829 --> 00:39:23,067
(I believe in Team Suyu-ri!)

1101
00:39:23,068 --> 00:39:24,368
- Let's begin. - It's practice.

1102
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,268
- It's practice. Hey. - I'll throw it. My goodness.

1103
00:39:26,269 --> 00:39:27,837
- I'll throw it. My goodness. - Hey.

1104
00:39:27,838 --> 00:39:28,908
(His aim was way off.)

1105
00:39:28,909 --> 00:39:29,979
You're nervous.

1106
00:39:30,579 --> 00:39:31,607
- The line... - Yes.

1107
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:33,979
- You know, this is definitely... - It's so small, right?

1108
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,909
- Even the weight is different. - Seriously.

1109
00:39:40,488 --> 00:39:41,587
(The ring grazes the ears.)

1110
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:42,718
This is hard.

1111
00:39:45,258 --> 00:39:47,059
I really can't get them on the ears.

1112
00:39:47,159 --> 00:39:48,659
The hole is different. Gosh.

1113
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:50,198
- The hole... - You guys...

1114
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:51,527
need to aim well.

1115
00:39:51,528 --> 00:39:53,128
I know. We need to get the hang of it.

1116
00:39:53,168 --> 00:39:54,398
It's too low.

1117
00:39:54,699 --> 00:39:55,829
(Should I throw it higher?)

1118
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,738
(The first success)

1119
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:07,948
(Only 1 out of 10 tries is a success.)

1120
00:40:07,949 --> 00:40:09,409
- Gosh. - It's so hard.

1121
00:40:14,148 --> 00:40:16,659
It really feels like a competition.

1122
00:40:17,088 --> 00:40:18,188
This is...

1123
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,158
nerve-racking.

1124
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,288
There's tension in the air.

1125
00:40:21,289 --> 00:40:23,297
I really want to send her abroad.

1126
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:24,758
- That must be why. - Yes.

1127
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:26,828
Let's go!

1128
00:40:26,829 --> 00:40:28,667
- Let's go! - Let's do our absolute best.

1129
00:40:28,668 --> 00:40:29,798
Let's do this.

1130
00:40:30,338 --> 00:40:32,039
- Let's do our absolute best. - Let's go.

1131
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,838
- Concentrate. - We need to concentrate.

1132
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,709
Don't drop it.

1133
00:40:38,278 --> 00:40:40,248
Get ready. Set.

1134
00:40:40,249 --> 00:40:42,209
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

1135
00:40:53,829 --> 00:40:55,388
Good.

1136
00:40:55,389 --> 00:40:57,159
Do it slowly.

1137
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:01,168
Okay.

1138
00:41:02,568 --> 00:41:04,199
- Okay. - Dae Myeung, a bit higher.

1139
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:08,668
A bit... That's good.

1140
00:41:09,468 --> 00:41:10,539
That's good.

1141
00:41:11,378 --> 00:41:13,448
Okay. There you go. One more.

1142
00:41:13,449 --> 00:41:15,108
(Jong Min succeeded 4 times in a row.)

1143
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:20,218
One more.

1144
00:41:20,418 --> 00:41:22,749
One more. Slowly. There's time.

1145
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:25,587
(Jong Min succeeded 4 times in a row.)

1146
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:27,258
Slowly. There's time.

1147
00:41:27,959 --> 00:41:29,059
There's time.

1148
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:32,158
(He fails the last one.)

1149
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:34,769
- One more. - Three...

1150
00:41:35,398 --> 00:41:38,068
(Only 1 ring remains!)

1151
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:40,869
Three, two...

1152
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:46,909
Two...

1153
00:41:49,249 --> 00:41:50,489
(The last ring misses the ear.)

1154
00:41:51,918 --> 00:41:53,389
(Sighing)

1155
00:41:55,188 --> 00:41:56,718
(Devastated)

1156
00:41:59,688 --> 00:42:01,728
- Gosh. - Three, four...

1157
00:42:01,729 --> 00:42:03,698
- My goodness. We can do it. - You're getting better.

1158
00:42:03,699 --> 00:42:04,959
We're getting better.

1159
00:42:07,729 --> 00:42:09,398
Concentrate.

1160
00:42:09,729 --> 00:42:11,538
Jong Min, you're doing well now.

1161
00:42:11,539 --> 00:42:13,138
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1162
00:42:13,139 --> 00:42:14,507
You're sweating so much.

1163
00:42:14,508 --> 00:42:16,039
- Are you okay? - The genre has...

1164
00:42:16,338 --> 00:42:19,208
Dae Myeung, you're much more nervous than usual.

1165
00:42:19,209 --> 00:42:22,277
How did all of them go in and bounce off?

1166
00:42:22,278 --> 00:42:23,718
- They bounce off. - That's right.

1167
00:42:23,979 --> 00:42:25,479
- I can do it. - It's okay.

1168
00:42:25,718 --> 00:42:27,548
- Let's go! - Let's go. We can do it.

1169
00:42:27,718 --> 00:42:28,988
I'll do it no matter what.

1170
00:42:30,918 --> 00:42:33,059
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1171
00:42:33,329 --> 00:42:35,049
We need to keep our concentration level up.

1172
00:42:36,028 --> 00:42:37,798
- Concentrate. - Hold on.

1173
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:40,228
(Snorting)

1174
00:42:40,229 --> 00:42:43,769
Experiencing this kind of tension at a workplace...

1175
00:42:45,139 --> 00:42:46,437
- is rare. - I agree.

1176
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:49,508
- You're right. - There's so much tension.

1177
00:42:49,838 --> 00:42:50,909
Right.

1178
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:54,008
- I really want to succeed. - Seriously.

1179
00:42:54,148 --> 00:42:55,308
I want to send her abroad.

1180
00:42:55,309 --> 00:42:57,378
All right. This is the seventh try.

1181
00:42:57,818 --> 00:42:58,818
Get ready.

1182
00:42:59,449 --> 00:43:02,148
(I'll succeed no matter what!)

1183
00:43:02,918 --> 00:43:05,418
(Determined)

1184
00:43:05,959 --> 00:43:07,028
Get ready.

1185
00:43:14,628 --> 00:43:15,628
Slowly.

1186
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,568
- Success. - Slowly.

1187
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:23,168
(2 successes in a row)

1188
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,679
Slowly.

1189
00:43:30,718 --> 00:43:31,818
Okay.

1190
00:43:32,718 --> 00:43:33,789
Slowly.

1191
00:43:33,988 --> 00:43:35,019
Slowly.

1192
00:43:40,488 --> 00:43:41,588
Slowly.

1193
00:43:42,088 --> 00:43:43,188
Slowly.

1194
00:43:45,499 --> 00:43:46,599
All right.

1195
00:43:48,369 --> 00:43:49,768
(They succeeded in getting 4 rings on the ear.)

1196
00:43:49,769 --> 00:43:50,938
We have enough time.

1197
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,039
All right. We have enough time.

1198
00:43:53,438 --> 00:43:55,084
We got 4 rings on the ear. We just need 1 more.

1199
00:43:55,108 --> 00:43:56,168
We have enough time.

1200
00:43:56,979 --> 00:43:59,278
(3 rings remain.)

1201
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:05,249
Five seconds.

1202
00:44:08,088 --> 00:44:09,119
Three...

1203
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:11,588
Three...

1204
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:13,659
Three...

1205
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:20,797
Three...

1206
00:44:20,798 --> 00:44:23,369
(They succeed in getting 5 rings on the ear!)

1207
00:44:27,238 --> 00:44:29,338
(They did it!)

1208
00:44:37,479 --> 00:44:40,648
(Suyu-ri did it!)

1209
00:44:41,619 --> 00:44:43,688
Is it a success?

1210
00:44:44,318 --> 00:44:46,288
(They succeeded with 2 seconds remaining.)

1211
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:49,588
- It's a success! - We did it!

1212
00:44:49,889 --> 00:44:51,698
- We did it! - We did it.

1213
00:44:51,699 --> 00:44:53,599
(Tension leaves their bodies.)

1214
00:44:54,398 --> 00:44:56,598
(Suyu-ri Trio shows their strength.)

1215
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:58,968
- All right. - I'll get on a plane!

1216
00:44:59,269 --> 00:45:01,468
- Yes! - We did it.

1217
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:03,878
- All right, Ye Rim. - Thank you.

1218
00:45:04,709 --> 00:45:06,508
You'll go to Da Nang.

1219
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,678
(Cheering)

1220
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:09,679
You didn't disappoint.

1221
00:45:10,148 --> 00:45:12,579
(Their excitement doesn't die down.)

1222
00:45:13,179 --> 00:45:14,718
- We did it. - That was incredible.

1223
00:45:14,889 --> 00:45:16,448
(I'm proud of my brothers.)

1224
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:18,218
- It was so hard. - Well done.

1225
00:45:22,429 --> 00:45:24,398
All right.

1226
00:45:25,429 --> 00:45:27,829
- The plane ticket to Da Nang, - This too?

1227
00:45:27,968 --> 00:45:31,768
The slippers, and the headphones.

1228
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:33,438
(She'll get all the presents.)

1229
00:45:34,008 --> 00:45:35,667
(Proud)

1230
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:36,809
My goodness.

1231
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:40,277
When Ye Rim received...

1232
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:42,778
these presents, her colleagues acted...

1233
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,749
- as if it concerned them directly. - I know.

1234
00:45:44,918 --> 00:45:47,265
They got nervous and happy as if it concerned them directly.

1235
00:45:47,289 --> 00:45:49,789
Ye Rim was the first person we met here.

1236
00:45:49,988 --> 00:45:52,668
She said the break ended at 12:30pm, and we got it done at 12:25pm.

1237
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,228
(They succeeded in wrapping up during the spare time.)

1238
00:45:54,229 --> 00:45:56,898
- Congratulations. - Thank you so much.

1239
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:59,297
Congratulations. Please enjoy your lunch.

1240
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,968
Congratulations.

1241
00:46:01,168 --> 00:46:03,499
- Thank you for your hard work. - Please enjoy your lunch.

1242
00:46:03,668 --> 00:46:05,269
- Seriously. - Please enjoy your lunch.

1243
00:46:06,668 --> 00:46:07,938
You know,

1244
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:10,678
- it was a very difficult mission. - Really?

1245
00:46:10,679 --> 00:46:13,209
- It wasn't an easy one, was it? - Of course not.

1246
00:46:13,709 --> 00:46:15,277
Had we failed...

1247
00:46:15,278 --> 00:46:17,718
- That's a scary thought. - Jong Min and Dae Myeung did well.

1248
00:46:18,218 --> 00:46:20,888
Jae Suk, it took me five tries to enter a university.

1249
00:46:20,889 --> 00:46:22,348
- "Five tries." - I worked ten times harder...

1250
00:46:22,349 --> 00:46:23,518
- than that time. - Hey,

1251
00:46:23,519 --> 00:46:24,817
did it take you five tries?

1252
00:46:24,818 --> 00:46:27,087
Five tries. That's incredible.

1253
00:46:27,088 --> 00:46:29,027
- My goodness. - Your patience is insane.

1254
00:46:29,028 --> 00:46:31,158
In any case, I can reveal it now.

1255
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,668
I worked ten times harder than that time.

1256
00:46:33,898 --> 00:46:35,729
You're incredible.

1257
00:46:35,898 --> 00:46:37,567
I wanted to give her that present.

1258
00:46:37,568 --> 00:46:39,568
- Yes. She has never been abroad. - Seriously.

1259
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:42,039
- The next spare time... - Where is it?

1260
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,908
It's the employees' passageway next to Tamu Snack...

1261
00:46:44,909 --> 00:46:46,978
that's between the Amazon and the Safari.

1262
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:48,678
The Amazon and the Safari are down there.

1263
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,425
- Yes. We go to the left. - They're down there.

1264
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:52,078
- We have some time. - Really?

1265
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,288
- When is it? - It's at 2pm.

1266
00:46:54,289 --> 00:46:56,547
In that case, we should have lunch.

1267
00:46:56,548 --> 00:46:57,757
- Let's have lunch. - Yes.

1268
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:59,289
We have enough time for lunch.

1269
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:01,958
- Would you like a recommendation? - Which place?

1270
00:47:01,959 --> 00:47:04,527
When I was here the other day,

1271
00:47:04,528 --> 00:47:05,828
I found a surprising place.

1272
00:47:05,829 --> 00:47:06,898
- Where? - Where?

1273
00:47:06,968 --> 00:47:08,897
There's a restaurant that's over 20 years old.

1274
00:47:08,898 --> 00:47:10,698
- Where is it? - But I didn't visit it that day.

1275
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,939
- It was closed. - Where is it?

1276
00:47:12,168 --> 00:47:13,499
It's a kimchi jjigae restaurant.

1277
00:47:13,608 --> 00:47:15,308
It must be outside.

1278
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:16,978
- It's in here. - A kimchi jjigae place in here...

1279
00:47:16,979 --> 00:47:18,038
is 20 years old?

1280
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,678
Is there a kimchi jjigae place in Everland?

1281
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,949
Yes. There's an old restaurant in here.

1282
00:47:22,378 --> 00:47:24,018
- Really? - Yes. Let's go.

1283
00:47:24,019 --> 00:47:25,777
- If it's 20 years old... - Is there a kimchi jjigae place?

1284
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:27,688
- Yes, there is. - Really?

1285
00:47:27,818 --> 00:47:29,417
- In here? - Hangaram.

1286
00:47:29,418 --> 00:47:30,458
- Right? - Yes.

1287
00:47:30,459 --> 00:47:31,889
- It's very old, right? - Yes.

1288
00:47:32,188 --> 00:47:34,257
- Is it tasty? - It's tasty.

1289
00:47:34,258 --> 00:47:35,788
You have to eat kimchi jjigae and mackerel.

1290
00:47:35,789 --> 00:47:36,998
- Really? - Mackerel?

1291
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:38,729
- We can go that way, right? - Yes.

1292
00:47:38,829 --> 00:47:40,868
- You can take the Sky Cruise. - What?

1293
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:42,397
- We can take it, right? - You can take it.

1294
00:47:42,398 --> 00:47:44,198
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1295
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:45,199
Enjoy your meal.

1296
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,667
I found a proper place.

1297
00:47:46,668 --> 00:47:47,869
You're right.

1298
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,778
- This place has changed. - Let's get in.

1299
00:47:52,008 --> 00:47:53,008
My goodness.

1300
00:47:53,539 --> 00:47:55,579
- The door is closing. - Yes.

1301
00:47:56,579 --> 00:47:58,519
My goodness. It's too fast.

1302
00:48:00,019 --> 00:48:01,419
It'll only be fast in this section.

1303
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,389
- Hello. - It's a bit...

1304
00:48:04,588 --> 00:48:05,619
It's scary.

1305
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:07,559
It's higher than I expected.

1306
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:10,459
Did you think it would go low?

1307
00:48:10,858 --> 00:48:14,729
I feel nostalgic seeing rides that were here for a long time.

1308
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:16,599
- That scared me. - I got scared.

1309
00:48:17,369 --> 00:48:19,369
(Gasping)

1310
00:48:19,499 --> 00:48:21,608
- This reminds me of old times. - Yes, it does.

1311
00:48:21,668 --> 00:48:23,238
When you couldn't jump.

1312
00:48:23,639 --> 00:48:25,378
- Jump from where? - From high places.

1313
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:29,179
It was on "The Best Baseball Team."

1314
00:48:30,148 --> 00:48:31,277
("The Best Baseball Team" aired in 2003.)

1315
00:48:31,278 --> 00:48:32,979
(I'm really scared.)

1316
00:48:34,188 --> 00:48:36,119
(Jae Suk made fun of him.)

1317
00:48:37,188 --> 00:48:39,388
(When it was his turn...)

1318
00:48:39,389 --> 00:48:42,289
- Jong Min, this is no joke. - I know.

1319
00:48:42,429 --> 00:48:44,158
I didn't know how you felt.

1320
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,459
But this is no joke.

1321
00:48:46,898 --> 00:48:48,397
(This is really scary.)

1322
00:48:48,398 --> 00:48:50,498
It wasn't just me who couldn't jump.

1323
00:48:50,499 --> 00:48:51,567
I wasn't able to jump either.

1324
00:48:51,568 --> 00:48:52,797
(Scaredy-cat brothers)

1325
00:48:52,798 --> 00:48:53,908
Aren't you scared of heights?

1326
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:56,208
I'm extremely scared of heights.

1327
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:57,639
- Really? - Yes.

1328
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,938
People from Suyu-ri seem to have acrophobia.

1329
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:03,208
I'm not sure how this will sound... Let's not generalize it.

1330
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:04,917
However, in our case,

1331
00:49:04,918 --> 00:49:06,598
many people from Suyu-ri are scaredy-cats.

1332
00:49:06,949 --> 00:49:08,417
- That's right. - From Suyu-ri.

1333
00:49:08,418 --> 00:49:09,749
- Yes. - It's because...

1334
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,288
there were scary guys in the neighborhood.

1335
00:49:11,289 --> 00:49:12,618
- Yes, that's right. - Yes, you're right.

1336
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,828
Have you ever had a bully take money from you?

1337
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,358
- Of course. - Yes, of course.

1338
00:49:15,789 --> 00:49:17,527
I gave them everything I had.

1339
00:49:17,528 --> 00:49:20,228
Right, they must all be over 60 now.

1340
00:49:20,229 --> 00:49:21,828
That's right.

1341
00:49:21,829 --> 00:49:23,897
- I'm sure they regret it. - Yes, I bet.

1342
00:49:23,898 --> 00:49:25,698
(They arrive, reminiscing about the bullies.)

1343
00:49:26,068 --> 00:49:27,567
Thank you. Have a nice day.

1344
00:49:27,568 --> 00:49:29,108
- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.

1345
00:49:29,438 --> 00:49:31,337
There is a kimchi jjigae place here?

1346
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:32,377
I know, right?

1347
00:49:32,378 --> 00:49:34,478
I gave them a call yesterday.

1348
00:49:34,479 --> 00:49:36,578
- Really? - They're open today.

1349
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:38,518
- That's impressive. - Yes.

1350
00:49:38,519 --> 00:49:40,448
- You're well-prepared. - I know.

1351
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:43,988
Life is easier with people like Yeon Seok and Dae Myeung around.

1352
00:49:44,059 --> 00:49:45,559
Are you a Type J, Dae Myeung?

1353
00:49:45,818 --> 00:49:47,527
- No, I'm not. - No?

1354
00:49:47,528 --> 00:49:50,757
But one thing I like is eating good food.

1355
00:49:50,758 --> 00:49:52,027
- This is something you like. - Yes.

1356
00:49:52,028 --> 00:49:53,128
Then are you a Type P?

1357
00:49:53,229 --> 00:49:54,329
Yes, I am.

1358
00:49:55,298 --> 00:49:56,668
If it's not J...

1359
00:49:57,738 --> 00:49:59,639
- It's either J or P. - Yes, that's right.

1360
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:01,139
That's why I said he's a Type P.

1361
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:02,845
(The conclusion he came to after much pondering)

1362
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:05,837
I was surprised when I saw the exterior of the restaurant.

1363
00:50:05,838 --> 00:50:07,507
- Hello. - Hello.

1364
00:50:07,508 --> 00:50:08,608
They want us to eat there.

1365
00:50:08,709 --> 00:50:10,717
- He's busy clearing the snow. - It snowed heavily.

1366
00:50:10,718 --> 00:50:11,917
- Yes. - It's a snowman.

1367
00:50:11,918 --> 00:50:13,217
- It's so cute. - It's a rabbit.

1368
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,587
- Look at that. - It's a rabbit snowman.

1369
00:50:14,588 --> 00:50:15,788
Someone did a great job.

1370
00:50:15,789 --> 00:50:17,088
Who made that?

1371
00:50:17,519 --> 00:50:18,757
An employee from the restaurant.

1372
00:50:18,758 --> 00:50:20,217
- Really? - I see.

1373
00:50:20,218 --> 00:50:22,559
- That's impressive. - How did they do such a good job?

1374
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:24,599
I've never seen a rabbit.

1375
00:50:24,898 --> 00:50:26,659
- I don't think it's a rabbit. - It isn't?

1376
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:27,828
Isn't it a rabbit?

1377
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,429
- It has small ears. - You're right.

1378
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,138
- Is it a squirrel? - A squirrel?

1379
00:50:31,139 --> 00:50:32,868
It looks like a rabbit. We should ask.

1380
00:50:32,869 --> 00:50:33,968
Is it a beaver?

1381
00:50:34,438 --> 00:50:35,539
We should ask.

1382
00:50:35,909 --> 00:50:38,278
- Ask how old the restaurant is. - "Grilled mackerels."

1383
00:50:38,579 --> 00:50:40,015
- I was told that was a must. - It looks tasty.

1384
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,547
They have many tasty dishes.

1385
00:50:41,548 --> 00:50:42,709
I also want a rolled omelet.

1386
00:50:43,709 --> 00:50:45,648
- Hello. - Hello.

1387
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:47,118
We pay at the kiosk.

1388
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,249
- At a kiosk? - Yes.

1389
00:50:48,889 --> 00:50:50,188
We have to pay.

1390
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:52,019
Of course, we have to pay.

1391
00:50:53,718 --> 00:50:56,187
Lunch is on me today.

1392
00:50:56,188 --> 00:50:57,598
Come on, Dae Myeung.

1393
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:58,897
- Since I... - No, don't do that.

1394
00:50:58,898 --> 00:51:00,527
I found the restaurant.

1395
00:51:00,528 --> 00:51:02,868
- This is the most expensive. - That's right.

1396
00:51:02,869 --> 00:51:04,869
Let me buy lunch today.

1397
00:51:04,999 --> 00:51:06,198
- Okay then. - Okay.

1398
00:51:06,199 --> 00:51:07,539
(If you wish.)

1399
00:51:07,738 --> 00:51:09,638
- I think that's enough. - Press "Pay."

1400
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:10,777
- Okay. - Look at that.

1401
00:51:10,778 --> 00:51:12,555
(Rolled omelet, 2 kimchi jjigae meals, grilled mackerel)

1402
00:51:12,579 --> 00:51:14,178
- Do we need a tray? - Yes.

1403
00:51:14,179 --> 00:51:15,809
(They receive the food on trays.)

1404
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:18,278
Gosh.

1405
00:51:18,449 --> 00:51:20,147
This is the grilled mackerel.

1406
00:51:20,148 --> 00:51:21,788
(The mackerel is being grilled to a golden crisp.)

1407
00:51:21,789 --> 00:51:23,587
- Take the side dishes you want. - Okay.

1408
00:51:23,588 --> 00:51:24,888
There is a self-service station for side dishes.

1409
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:26,687
- Okay. - Enjoy.

1410
00:51:26,688 --> 00:51:28,087
Do I also take the rice?

1411
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,488
Thank you.

1412
00:51:30,898 --> 00:51:33,499
This is the kind of kimchi I like.

1413
00:51:34,269 --> 00:51:35,968
It isn't too spicy.

1414
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:38,409
Cooked beans in soy sauce. I'll eat a lot of black beans.

1415
00:51:38,438 --> 00:51:39,668
It helps your hair grow.

1416
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,909
- Here is the rolled omelet. - Gosh.

1417
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:46,179
It looks tasty.

1418
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:48,849
- Gosh. - Look at the pork.

1419
00:51:49,778 --> 00:51:52,679
I personally like kimchi jjigae with pork.

1420
00:51:53,079 --> 00:51:55,217
- Me too. - I prefer it over tuna.

1421
00:51:55,218 --> 00:51:56,488
- Really? - Yes.

1422
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:01,987
Gosh.

1423
00:52:01,988 --> 00:52:03,388
Thank you for the lunch, Dae Myeung.

1424
00:52:03,389 --> 00:52:05,099
- This is tasty. - Enjoy.

1425
00:52:05,398 --> 00:52:06,898
- You know, - Thank you.

1426
00:52:07,059 --> 00:52:09,019
I can tell why people say the food is tasty here.

1427
00:52:10,668 --> 00:52:11,769
Here you go, Jong Min.

1428
00:52:13,968 --> 00:52:15,308
- It's tasty, isn't it? - It's really good.

1429
00:52:15,309 --> 00:52:16,368
- Is it tasty? - Yes, it is.

1430
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:17,529
The flavor is not too strong.

1431
00:52:18,438 --> 00:52:19,508
It has a clean taste.

1432
00:52:21,278 --> 00:52:22,949
It's tasty.

1433
00:52:29,488 --> 00:52:30,618
It has a clean taste.

1434
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,018
It doesn't have a gritty texture.

1435
00:52:32,019 --> 00:52:33,358
- It's tasty. - Yes.

1436
00:52:34,959 --> 00:52:35,959
I'll do it with my hand.

1437
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,628
(They try the grilled mackerel next.)

1438
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:39,198
Look how thick it is.

1439
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,698
(Thick)

1440
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,028
You look like a chef.

1441
00:52:42,898 --> 00:52:44,298
The mackerel has a lot of meat.

1442
00:52:45,338 --> 00:52:46,498
It's so tasty.

1443
00:52:46,499 --> 00:52:47,638
Dip it in this.

1444
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:48,838
Thank you, Dae Myeung.

1445
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:51,848
(He tries it after taking care of the others.)

1446
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:53,578
- It's tasty. - It is, right?

1447
00:52:53,579 --> 00:52:54,607
Yes.

1448
00:52:54,608 --> 00:52:56,278
- It's so nice... - Yes.

1449
00:52:56,479 --> 00:52:58,449
To have kimchi jjigae on a snowy day.

1450
00:52:59,579 --> 00:53:02,449
It makes me feel refreshed.

1451
00:53:02,688 --> 00:53:04,408
I think it's lowering my blood sugar level.

1452
00:53:06,059 --> 00:53:07,788
What do you do when you aren't working, Dae Myeung?

1453
00:53:07,789 --> 00:53:10,158
Me? I walk around a lot.

1454
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,357
And I like to travel by myself.

1455
00:53:12,358 --> 00:53:13,698
- Really? - Yes.

1456
00:53:13,699 --> 00:53:15,828
I take the KTX and get off at a random city.

1457
00:53:15,829 --> 00:53:16,968
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1458
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,369
I walk around with my script.

1459
00:53:19,869 --> 00:53:21,039
You do?

1460
00:53:21,539 --> 00:53:23,639
I like watching how old people live.

1461
00:53:23,838 --> 00:53:25,008
Gosh.

1462
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,337
Old people you don't know?

1463
00:53:26,338 --> 00:53:29,209
Yes, I go to restaurants and watch them.

1464
00:53:29,479 --> 00:53:30,917
(Finding it interesting)

1465
00:53:30,918 --> 00:53:33,748
People don't recognize me in the countryside.

1466
00:53:33,749 --> 00:53:35,318
I'm sure many people know you.

1467
00:53:35,688 --> 00:53:36,749
So,

1468
00:53:37,389 --> 00:53:40,487
I like listening to people tell me stories.

1469
00:53:40,488 --> 00:53:41,789
Really?

1470
00:53:42,528 --> 00:53:45,729
- That's impressive. - When I hear things like this,

1471
00:53:46,128 --> 00:53:48,668
I think about traveling by myself too.

1472
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,638
- But I don't have the courage. - Right.

1473
00:53:50,639 --> 00:53:51,698
- Right? - Yes.

1474
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:52,868
I think I might get bored.

1475
00:53:52,869 --> 00:53:53,938
What do you think about?

1476
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:57,269
- Once you're there. - I grab a beer...

1477
00:53:57,479 --> 00:53:59,608
- and read my script. - I see.

1478
00:54:00,008 --> 00:54:01,777
You get emotionally recharged.

1479
00:54:01,778 --> 00:54:03,378
- Yes. - Right?

1480
00:54:04,349 --> 00:54:05,619
Dae Myeung.

1481
00:54:06,349 --> 00:54:08,317
You took the CSAT five times?

1482
00:54:08,318 --> 00:54:09,547
That's impressive.

1483
00:54:09,548 --> 00:54:12,188
I wanted to do everything I could to start acting.

1484
00:54:12,358 --> 00:54:14,128
- So I kept trying. - And you got in?

1485
00:54:14,289 --> 00:54:15,688
Yes, I did.

1486
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:19,128
While studying, I took acting classes.

1487
00:54:19,459 --> 00:54:20,928
And I got accepted into Sungkyunkwan University.

1488
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:22,228
Sungkyunkwan University?

1489
00:54:22,229 --> 00:54:23,568
That's impressive.

1490
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,199
The funny thing is that the year before that,

1491
00:54:26,369 --> 00:54:27,808
I applied to Seoul Institute of the Arts.

1492
00:54:27,809 --> 00:54:29,644
- What happened? - It's when I took my fourth CSAT.

1493
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:32,508
I checked if I was accepted through an automated response.

1494
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:34,107
It said, "You are on the waitlist."

1495
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:37,547
"You are number one on the waitlist."

1496
00:54:37,548 --> 00:54:39,778
- Number one usually gets in. - That's right.

1497
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,187
But the numbers were given separately to boys and girls.

1498
00:54:43,188 --> 00:54:45,257
- Right. - Six girls on the waitlist got in,

1499
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:46,687
but not a single boy.

1500
00:54:46,688 --> 00:54:47,889
Not a single one?

1501
00:54:48,289 --> 00:54:50,389
- You didn't make it? - Not a single boy canceled.

1502
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,998
Gosh, that was so unfortunate.

1503
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,429
- How did that happen? - Right.

1504
00:54:54,568 --> 00:54:57,269
I kept getting so close but never made it.

1505
00:54:57,369 --> 00:54:59,397
When I took the written test for my driver's license,

1506
00:54:59,398 --> 00:55:02,508
the minimum requirement was 70 points.

1507
00:55:02,838 --> 00:55:04,538
But I failed by getting 68 points.

1508
00:55:04,539 --> 00:55:05,778
- Really? - Yes.

1509
00:55:05,909 --> 00:55:07,377
It drove me crazy.

1510
00:55:07,378 --> 00:55:08,777
I just had to get one more question right.

1511
00:55:08,778 --> 00:55:10,107
- So I went the next time. - Right.

1512
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:11,349
I got 64 points.

1513
00:55:13,818 --> 00:55:14,849
Come on.

1514
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,889
I failed three times.

1515
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:21,829
Really? Did you get 64 points after studying hard?

1516
00:55:22,329 --> 00:55:23,688
- Did you? - Yes.

1517
00:55:24,229 --> 00:55:26,659
That's a tough score to get after studying hard.

1518
00:55:26,929 --> 00:55:29,067
I already knew the basics.

1519
00:55:29,068 --> 00:55:30,897
(It's still a mystery.)

1520
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:33,198
It was nice to pass Round Three...

1521
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,809
- with our first guest. - Yes, it was.

1522
00:55:35,039 --> 00:55:36,908
I think we make quite a good team.

1523
00:55:36,909 --> 00:55:38,308
- Yes, you're right. - Suyu-ri Party.

1524
00:55:38,309 --> 00:55:40,337
- We share something. - We get one another.

1525
00:55:40,338 --> 00:55:41,547
- Suyu-ri Party. - Okay.

1526
00:55:41,548 --> 00:55:43,249
- SuPa. - Let's go, SuPa.

1527
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:44,619
Let's go.

1528
00:55:45,349 --> 00:55:47,318
We have some time left.

1529
00:55:47,449 --> 00:55:50,717
If it's okay, can we go see the pandas?

1530
00:55:50,718 --> 00:55:52,217
- Should we go see the pandas? - Sounds good.

1531
00:55:52,218 --> 00:55:54,159
I've never seen the pandas.

1532
00:55:54,258 --> 00:55:55,357
Have you seen them?

1533
00:55:55,358 --> 00:55:56,587
Have I?

1534
00:55:56,588 --> 00:55:58,297
- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.

1535
00:55:58,298 --> 00:56:01,398
- Bye. - Bye.

1536
00:56:01,798 --> 00:56:03,099
We should've asked...

1537
00:56:04,298 --> 00:56:05,639
- who made the snowman. - Right.

1538
00:56:05,798 --> 00:56:07,568
Who made the snowman out front?

1539
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:09,007
It was me.

1540
00:56:09,008 --> 00:56:10,308
- It was her. - Really?

1541
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:11,639
Is it a rabbit?

1542
00:56:12,278 --> 00:56:15,849
It's a capybara holding a mackerel.

1543
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,377
- A capybara? - A capybara.

1544
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,048
- Yes, it's a capybara. - A capybara?

1545
00:56:20,318 --> 00:56:22,048
How did you do such a good job?

1546
00:56:22,418 --> 00:56:24,688
It took me three hours yesterday.

1547
00:56:26,459 --> 00:56:28,458
It's a capybara holding a mackerel.

1548
00:56:28,459 --> 00:56:30,127
That's the mackerel in front.

1549
00:56:30,128 --> 00:56:31,128
Have a nice day.

1550
00:56:31,129 --> 00:56:34,269
The animals people make with snow are different from the past.

1551
00:56:34,898 --> 00:56:36,698
Not many people used to know what capybaras are.

1552
00:56:36,699 --> 00:56:38,798
- They had no idea. - That's right.

1553
00:56:39,168 --> 00:56:41,039
They sculpt different animals now.

1554
00:56:42,338 --> 00:56:44,068
(Current time, 1:20pm)

1555
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:48,409
Running like that won't help.

1556
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:50,749
I'm trying to burn off the sugar.

1557
00:56:51,249 --> 00:56:52,377
(The newlywed takes care of his body.)

1558
00:56:52,378 --> 00:56:55,949
You know this is something old people do, right?

1559
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,558
Even if we ate sweets,

1560
00:56:58,559 --> 00:57:01,857
we used to say, "We had too much."

1561
00:57:01,858 --> 00:57:04,659
After aging,

1562
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,528
you feel it.

1563
00:57:08,528 --> 00:57:12,139
(A characteristic of middle-aged men)

1564
00:57:12,639 --> 00:57:14,759
When the uphill section is long, this is what you do.

1565
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:16,608
(Expert in walking backward)

1566
00:57:17,209 --> 00:57:18,278
(Exclaiming)

1567
00:57:19,738 --> 00:57:20,978
Hello.

1568
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,579
(They have some spare time and are going to see the pandas.)

1569
00:57:25,278 --> 00:57:26,348
Wait.

1570
00:57:26,349 --> 00:57:27,688
(Jae Suk recognizes someone.)

1571
00:57:29,019 --> 00:57:30,987
Mr. Kang Cheol Won is here.

1572
00:57:30,988 --> 00:57:32,988
- Do you know him? - Of course.

1573
00:57:33,088 --> 00:57:34,628
(Surprised)

1574
00:57:36,329 --> 00:57:38,329
- You're right. - Mr. Kang.

1575
00:57:39,858 --> 00:57:40,898
Hey.

1576
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:42,599
"Hey?"

1577
00:57:42,729 --> 00:57:44,068
- Hello. - He's out here.

1578
00:57:44,769 --> 00:57:45,838
What are you doing here?

1579
00:57:46,298 --> 00:57:47,808
Long time no see.

1580
00:57:47,809 --> 00:57:49,308
- Hello. - Hello.

1581
00:57:49,309 --> 00:57:51,139
- This is... - Yes.

1582
00:57:51,438 --> 00:57:53,808
- Fu Bao's grandfather. - Yes, her grandpa.

1583
00:57:53,809 --> 00:57:55,348
How have you been?

1584
00:57:55,349 --> 00:57:56,749
- It snowed heavily. - Yes, it did.

1585
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:58,217
We met right here...

1586
00:57:58,218 --> 00:58:00,718
on "You Quiz on the Block."

1587
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,548
I'm surprised to see you in the same spot.

1588
00:58:03,449 --> 00:58:05,788
It snowed heavily the past two days.

1589
00:58:05,789 --> 00:58:07,628
That's right. Everyone is clearing snow.

1590
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:09,288
- I've cleared the path. - Yes?

1591
00:58:09,289 --> 00:58:11,929
- But if this freezes, it'll melt... - People would slip.

1592
00:58:12,298 --> 00:58:13,757
- and become icy. - Yes, it will.

1593
00:58:13,758 --> 00:58:15,897
- That's right. - People could slip.

1594
00:58:15,898 --> 00:58:17,198
So I'm clearing it.

1595
00:58:17,199 --> 00:58:21,369
- Mr. Kang is still here. - Gosh.

1596
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:22,668
"Still?"

1597
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,139
Did you think I wouldn't be here?

1598
00:58:25,438 --> 00:58:26,754
- Don't say that. - I didn't mean that.

1599
00:58:26,778 --> 00:58:29,478
- I'll stay here for a long time. - I thought you might've been...

1600
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:31,147
- promoted to a higher position. - To stay inside.

1601
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:33,147
Everyone has to help clear the snow.

1602
00:58:33,148 --> 00:58:34,317
- I see. - I see.

1603
00:58:34,318 --> 00:58:37,318
With his experience and fame,

1604
00:58:37,418 --> 00:58:40,558
- And his wisdom. - I expected...

1605
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:42,257
I've only been here for 37 years.

1606
00:58:42,258 --> 00:58:45,127
- That's impressive. - It's been 37 years?

1607
00:58:45,128 --> 00:58:47,458
The amusement park opened 40 years ago.

1608
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:49,099
- Right? - It opened almost 50 years ago.

1609
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,845
- It was 50 years ago? - It was 50 years ago?

1610
00:58:50,869 --> 00:58:52,068
That's half a century.

1611
00:58:52,499 --> 00:58:54,608
We have some spare time.

1612
00:58:54,809 --> 00:58:56,308
Go see Rui and Hui.

1613
00:58:56,309 --> 00:58:57,608
- Of course. - Who?

1614
00:58:57,878 --> 00:58:59,507
- Ruirui? - They're Fu Bao's younger siblings.

1615
00:58:59,508 --> 00:59:00,709
Her younger siblings?

1616
00:59:01,048 --> 00:59:02,848
- He isn't interested. - He knows nothing.

1617
00:59:02,849 --> 00:59:04,418
You should tell him about them.

1618
00:59:05,318 --> 00:59:06,777
Don't you know Rui Bao and Hui Bao?

1619
00:59:06,778 --> 00:59:08,618
I do. Fu Bao's siblings.

1620
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,119
(Laughing)

1621
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:12,217
Where are they? Shall we go?

1622
00:59:12,218 --> 00:59:13,687
(They are off to see the panda twins.)

1623
00:59:13,688 --> 00:59:16,357
Gosh, this place is beautiful.

1624
00:59:16,358 --> 00:59:18,357
- It's so pretty. - Yes.

1625
00:59:18,358 --> 00:59:19,698
Yes, it's so pretty.

1626
00:59:19,699 --> 00:59:21,128
The snowy landscape was beautiful.

1627
00:59:21,528 --> 00:59:22,798
Gosh.

1628
00:59:23,329 --> 00:59:25,198
This is my first time here.

1629
00:59:25,199 --> 00:59:26,269
I bet.

1630
00:59:26,738 --> 00:59:29,608
(They quietly wait in line.)

1631
00:59:29,809 --> 00:59:32,008
We have to be quiet inside.

1632
00:59:32,438 --> 00:59:33,709
Could they get scared?

1633
00:59:35,209 --> 00:59:36,308
Gosh.

1634
00:59:36,309 --> 00:59:38,849
(They marvel quietly as they enter.)

1635
00:59:40,418 --> 00:59:42,487
- It's so quiet. - Let's be quiet.

1636
00:59:42,488 --> 00:59:44,018
- Over there. - We could scare them.

1637
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:45,519
They're over there.

1638
00:59:48,889 --> 00:59:50,559
(Gasping)

1639
00:59:52,059 --> 00:59:53,199
There they are.

1640
00:59:55,898 --> 00:59:57,967
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1641
00:59:57,968 --> 00:59:59,938
- This is my first time seeing them. - Me too.

1642
01:00:01,338 --> 01:00:05,209
(They automatically join the crowd of people taking photos.)

1643
01:00:07,849 --> 01:00:09,909
The one eating the bamboo is Rui Bao.

1644
01:00:10,209 --> 01:00:11,248
(Rui Bao, the older twin, Hui Bao, the younger twin)

1645
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:12,777
The one sleeping is Hui Bao.

1646
01:00:12,778 --> 01:00:13,877
I see.

1647
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,748
How cute.

1648
01:00:15,749 --> 01:00:17,187
- Aren't they so cute, Dae Myeung? - Yes.

1649
01:00:17,188 --> 01:00:18,389
Goodness.

1650
01:00:18,889 --> 01:00:21,087
- Is the leg stuck in the tree okay? - They're big.

1651
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,627
- It's okay. - Shouldn't we take it out for her?

1652
01:00:22,628 --> 01:00:23,728
- No, she's okay. - Doesn't she look stuck?

1653
01:00:23,729 --> 01:00:26,928
She's using her leg to catch herself...

1654
01:00:26,929 --> 01:00:28,728
- from falling. - I see.

1655
01:00:28,729 --> 01:00:30,528
- Is she eating that? - Yes.

1656
01:00:30,699 --> 01:00:32,138
- She's eating. - Hanging from the tree.

1657
01:00:32,139 --> 01:00:33,438
And the other one is sleeping.

1658
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:34,869
That's so funny.

1659
01:00:36,108 --> 01:00:37,708
- How cute. - She's so cute.

1660
01:00:37,709 --> 01:00:40,309
They can sleep for five hours on a tree.

1661
01:00:41,849 --> 01:00:43,277
(Chubby)

1662
01:00:43,278 --> 01:00:44,778
They're really cute.

1663
01:00:46,048 --> 01:00:47,418
They're funny.

1664
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:51,718
- It's like seeing a celebrity. - I know.

1665
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,389
They're stars.

1666
01:00:53,488 --> 01:00:54,987
(His wish comes true.)

1667
01:00:54,988 --> 01:00:56,058
They're stars.

1668
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:58,627
Gosh. This is what they look like.

1669
01:00:58,628 --> 01:00:59,758
Gosh.

1670
01:01:00,258 --> 01:01:01,798
- Gosh. - The mom is eating too.

1671
01:01:03,128 --> 01:01:06,098
The mom has to take care of the twins,

1672
01:01:06,099 --> 01:01:07,468
so she gets famished.

1673
01:01:07,568 --> 01:01:09,039
- She's always hungry. - I see.

1674
01:01:09,309 --> 01:01:11,508
She is always looking for food.

1675
01:01:11,909 --> 01:01:13,338
Ai Bao is so pretty.

1676
01:01:13,738 --> 01:01:15,209
She's always gorgeous.

1677
01:01:15,979 --> 01:01:17,848
I don't get tired of watching them all day.

1678
01:01:17,849 --> 01:01:18,949
- Me, neither. - I know.

1679
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:21,119
I wouldn't either.

1680
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,587
They're going on the slide.

1681
01:01:22,588 --> 01:01:25,217
Is that a slide?

1682
01:01:25,218 --> 01:01:26,218
Awesome.

1683
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:27,317
(Tumbling down)

1684
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:30,159
- How cute. - So cute.

1685
01:01:30,528 --> 01:01:31,558
(Smiling)

1686
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:32,898
She's so funny.

1687
01:01:33,959 --> 01:01:36,568
(He's become a fan of the pandas.)

1688
01:01:36,898 --> 01:01:40,039
I can't stop watching them.

1689
01:01:40,398 --> 01:01:42,408
So when there wasn't a time limit,

1690
01:01:42,409 --> 01:01:44,268
- some people came in the morning. - And they stayed all day?

1691
01:01:44,269 --> 01:01:45,607
- All day? - Yes.

1692
01:01:45,608 --> 01:01:46,938
I don't blame them.

1693
01:01:48,008 --> 01:01:49,908
Just staring at pandas.

1694
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:51,548
- Yes. - That's right.

1695
01:01:52,449 --> 01:01:53,717
Do you want to see the dad?

1696
01:01:53,718 --> 01:01:55,187
- The dad? - I see.

1697
01:01:55,188 --> 01:01:56,289
That's the dad.

1698
01:01:56,818 --> 01:01:58,059
Let's go meet the father.

1699
01:01:58,488 --> 01:02:00,417
What's interesting...

1700
01:02:00,418 --> 01:02:03,257
is that you can tell he's the dad. Right?

1701
01:02:03,258 --> 01:02:04,498
He looks firmer.

1702
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:06,198
- Doesn't he look like the dad? - Yes.

1703
01:02:06,199 --> 01:02:07,805
- He's just sitting there. - That's interesting.

1704
01:02:07,829 --> 01:02:10,068
How does he sit like a dad?

1705
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:11,398
You're right.

1706
01:02:12,639 --> 01:02:13,938
He's enjoying his food.

1707
01:02:14,909 --> 01:02:16,908
Anyone can tell he's the dad.

1708
01:02:16,909 --> 01:02:19,069
(They take a bunch of panda photos with their phones.)

1709
01:02:19,378 --> 01:02:22,909
Thanks to you, we got to see the pandas today.

1710
01:02:23,249 --> 01:02:24,778
They're so cute.

1711
01:02:25,878 --> 01:02:27,217
(A short but impactful panda encounter)

1712
01:02:27,218 --> 01:02:29,318
I can't stop myself from buying a stuffed panda.

1713
01:02:29,488 --> 01:02:32,018
- Have a nice day. - Have a nice day.

1714
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,888
(They are led to the souvenir shop at the exit.)

1715
01:02:33,889 --> 01:02:36,488
- It's right at the exit. - There's no way not to buy it.

1716
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,658
How would you stop yourself after seeing the cute pandas?

1717
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,139
- You can't help but buy it. - Right?

1718
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:43,528
- I like this. - How could I not buy this?

1719
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:45,737
- After seeing the pandas. - I want to carry it home like that.

1720
01:02:45,738 --> 01:02:47,374
Could you not buy this after seeing the pandas?

1721
01:02:47,398 --> 01:02:50,067
- You want to carry it home. - It's so cute.

1722
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:51,409
I want one at home.

1723
01:02:51,679 --> 01:02:53,007
(Really?)

1724
01:02:53,008 --> 01:02:54,748
- No, it's okay. - Take one home.

1725
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:55,809
No, it's okay.

1726
01:02:56,409 --> 01:02:58,519
You can't leave it at home and toss rings at it.

1727
01:02:59,479 --> 01:03:01,389
- Look at that. - This is really cute.

1728
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:04,487
- It's so cute. - It's really cute.

1729
01:03:04,488 --> 01:03:05,618
It's so cute.

1730
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:07,900
I would've bought one if we were finished with the shoot.

1731
01:03:07,988 --> 01:03:08,988
Take one.

1732
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,087
(Lifting)

1733
01:03:10,088 --> 01:03:11,329
(Laughing)

1734
01:03:11,858 --> 01:03:14,027
- It's so cute. - Gosh.

1735
01:03:14,028 --> 01:03:15,998
(Smiling)

1736
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:17,868
It's like they're asking us to take them home.

1737
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:19,538
They're begging us to take them home.

1738
01:03:19,539 --> 01:03:20,568
(Holding it tight)

1739
01:03:21,369 --> 01:03:23,129
I can't stop myself after seeing the pandas.

1740
01:03:23,668 --> 01:03:25,478
(Laughing)

1741
01:03:25,479 --> 01:03:27,979
- You look like them. - Dae Myeung looks like a panda.

1742
01:03:29,648 --> 01:03:31,178
(Smiling)

1743
01:03:31,179 --> 01:03:32,449
- Jong Min. - Yes?

1744
01:03:33,818 --> 01:03:36,018
(Soon, three pandas are in their arms.)

1745
01:03:36,019 --> 01:03:37,619
- Then should we? - What?

1746
01:03:38,289 --> 01:03:39,358
Buy them?

1747
01:03:39,588 --> 01:03:40,687
Should we?

1748
01:03:40,688 --> 01:03:42,829
- Should we each get one? - Yes, let's buy them.

1749
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:44,857
That's right.

1750
01:03:44,858 --> 01:03:46,828
- Hello. - Hello. Three pandas.

1751
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:48,467
I have to buy them. I can't help it.

1752
01:03:48,468 --> 01:03:50,067
- Are you paying? - Of course.

1753
01:03:50,068 --> 01:03:51,998
- I'll buy it for you. - They're expensive, Jae Suk.

1754
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,068
It's okay. What?

1755
01:03:54,568 --> 01:03:56,437
- They really are expensive. - Wait.

1756
01:03:56,438 --> 01:03:57,937
- It's okay. Just buy it. - They're really expensive.

1757
01:03:57,938 --> 01:03:59,658
- No, it's okay. - You treated us to lunch.

1758
01:03:59,778 --> 01:04:00,937
- Three pandas. - Okay.

1759
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:03,578
(He gifts the Suyu-ri brothers stuffed animals.)

1760
01:04:03,579 --> 01:04:06,278
There was no way we weren't buying them.

1761
01:04:07,579 --> 01:04:09,147
- Bye. - Have a nice day.

1762
01:04:09,148 --> 01:04:10,518
- Have a nice day. - Bye.

1763
01:04:10,519 --> 01:04:12,358
- Thank you. - Have a nice day.

1764
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:17,789
(Cheerful)

1765
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:21,627
The cheerful music makes you cheerful.

1766
01:04:21,628 --> 01:04:23,527
- It makes you cheerful. - It's because you have the pandas.

1767
01:04:23,528 --> 01:04:24,699
- Yes. - Yes, I'm cheerful.

1768
01:04:25,468 --> 01:04:27,639
We should get going. I'll see you next time.

1769
01:04:28,468 --> 01:04:29,968
- Thank you. - Of course.

1770
01:04:30,409 --> 01:04:32,277
- Thank you. - Thank you so much.

1771
01:04:32,278 --> 01:04:34,008
See you. Stay healthy.

1772
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,749
- See you again. - Stay healthy.

1773
01:04:35,878 --> 01:04:37,547
- Thank you. - It's like the panda is playing.

1774
01:04:37,548 --> 01:04:38,548
Right?

1775
01:04:40,278 --> 01:04:42,487
- Goodness. - They're so cute.

1776
01:04:42,488 --> 01:04:44,218
- They're really cute. - They really are.

1777
01:04:46,358 --> 01:04:49,459
- That's your wedding gift. - Gosh.

1778
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:51,288
What? This is my wedding gift?

1779
01:04:52,628 --> 01:04:55,928
It's your wedding gift.

1780
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:57,898
Okay.

1781
01:04:58,438 --> 01:05:00,598
- You've given me so much lately. - No.

1782
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:03,507
Dae Myeung, Jae Suk actually bought me this phone too.

1783
01:05:03,508 --> 01:05:05,378
- Really? - He gave it to me as a gift.

1784
01:05:05,709 --> 01:05:09,377
We've known each other for over 20 years.

1785
01:05:09,378 --> 01:05:11,098
So I can't buy a new one even if I want to.

1786
01:05:11,619 --> 01:05:13,019
Because he bought it for me.

1787
01:05:13,218 --> 01:05:15,289
I plan to get him a new one when his contract ends.

1788
01:05:17,648 --> 01:05:19,918
I haven't received a stuffed animal gift...

1789
01:05:20,088 --> 01:05:21,987
for the past decade or so.

1790
01:05:21,988 --> 01:05:24,958
When you visit an amusement park,

1791
01:05:24,959 --> 01:05:28,369
- you need to take home a souvenir. - That's right.

1792
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:31,167
Although they cost quite a lot,

1793
01:05:31,168 --> 01:05:33,539
- you should buy one. - Thank you so much, Jae Suk.

1794
01:05:35,209 --> 01:05:36,639
Where do we have to go?

1795
01:05:36,769 --> 01:05:38,277
It's next to the Safari.

1796
01:05:38,278 --> 01:05:39,854
- Next to the Safari? - Is that the Safari?

1797
01:05:39,878 --> 01:05:41,948
We have to go down this way to get to the Safari.

1798
01:05:41,949 --> 01:05:43,149
What's this? It's a waterfall.

1799
01:05:43,378 --> 01:05:45,619
- It's a tiger. - It's a tiger.

1800
01:05:45,949 --> 01:05:47,317
- Unbelievable. - It's a tiger.

1801
01:05:47,318 --> 01:05:48,918
I've never seen a tiger from this close.

1802
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:50,119
Gosh.

1803
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:52,558
It's so majestic.

1804
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,688
Gosh, it's a tiger.

1805
01:05:54,358 --> 01:05:55,388
(It looks majestic even in the snow.)

1806
01:05:55,389 --> 01:05:58,627
- It looks majestic. - Look at it on the snow.

1807
01:05:58,628 --> 01:06:00,828
It's stunning. It's lying on the snow.

1808
01:06:00,829 --> 01:06:02,397
- That's awesome. - Don't they get cold?

1809
01:06:02,398 --> 01:06:04,167
Tigers don't disappoint.

1810
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:05,368
It's huge.

1811
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:07,337
(They fall in love with the tiger after the pandas.)

1812
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,238
The tiger is so majestic.

1813
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:11,678
It's so cool.

1814
01:06:11,679 --> 01:06:13,237
It's looking at us.

1815
01:06:13,238 --> 01:06:14,878
- Hey. - It's striking a pose.

1816
01:06:15,709 --> 01:06:16,877
(Fan service)

1817
01:06:16,878 --> 01:06:18,008
It's stunning.

1818
01:06:18,418 --> 01:06:20,448
It's almost time. We have to go.

1819
01:06:20,449 --> 01:06:22,518
Yes, we should go. I keep getting distracted.

1820
01:06:22,519 --> 01:06:24,487
(Where is the second spare time they are rushing to?)

1821
01:06:24,488 --> 01:06:27,688
It's Baek Ju Hyeon and Min Suk Ja.

1822
01:06:28,088 --> 01:06:31,758
"We hear the sound of barcodes being scanned all day..."

1823
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,558
"at this place we work..."

1824
01:06:33,559 --> 01:06:36,699
"with the Gen MZ casts with a mother's heart."

1825
01:06:37,398 --> 01:06:41,269
"It's been 20 years since we started and ended our days with the park."

1826
01:06:41,468 --> 01:06:45,608
"Would you like to share the stories of your lives..."

1827
01:06:45,878 --> 01:06:48,639
"with people that take care of the magical place from unseen places?"

1828
01:06:49,378 --> 01:06:50,708
They've worked here for 20 years.

1829
01:06:50,709 --> 01:06:52,269
- That's a long time. - Where are they?

1830
01:06:54,278 --> 01:06:55,987
- This must be it. - "The cast lounge."

1831
01:06:55,988 --> 01:06:57,288
- "The cast lounge?" - Yes, this is it.

1832
01:06:57,289 --> 01:06:58,289
It is?

1833
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:03,958
Hello. Are Baek Ju Hyeon and Min Suk Ja here?

1834
01:07:03,959 --> 01:07:05,298
- They're in the stage costume room. - In the stage costume room.

1835
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:07,459
- The stage costume room? - The stage costume room?

1836
01:07:07,558 --> 01:07:09,468
They must be in charge of the costumes.

1837
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:11,398
- Hello. - Hello.

1838
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,067
- Are... - Hello.

1839
01:07:14,068 --> 01:07:16,909
- Baek Ju Hyeon and Min Suk Ja here? - Nice to meet you.

1840
01:07:17,268 --> 01:07:18,307
(Raising her hand)

1841
01:07:18,308 --> 01:07:20,238
- Nice to meet you. - Are you Min Suk Ja?

1842
01:07:20,438 --> 01:07:22,608
- I'm Baek Ju Hyeon. - I see.

1843
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:23,978
Baek Ju Hyeon.

1844
01:07:25,049 --> 01:07:27,078
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

1845
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,464
(The second Whenever Guests Baek Ju Hyeon and Min Suk Ja)

1846
01:07:28,488 --> 01:07:30,448
This must be the costume room.

1847
01:07:30,449 --> 01:07:32,188
- Yes. - I see.

1848
01:07:32,488 --> 01:07:35,288
The casts of Everland...

1849
01:07:35,289 --> 01:07:39,699
borrow and return their costumes here at the stage costume room.

1850
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:42,628
This is the stage costume room?

1851
01:07:42,629 --> 01:07:44,998
Yes, there are three stage costume rooms.

1852
01:07:44,999 --> 01:07:46,568
This is the one at the East Entrance.

1853
01:07:46,938 --> 01:07:49,438
There are two more at the Main Entrance and Caribbean Bay.

1854
01:07:49,568 --> 01:07:51,437
What kind of costumes do you have?

1855
01:07:51,438 --> 01:07:53,408
At this one,

1856
01:07:53,409 --> 01:07:55,708
we mostly have uniforms for the staff at the zoo.

1857
01:07:55,709 --> 01:07:56,777
The zoo?

1858
01:07:56,778 --> 01:07:58,855
We have uniforms for the staff selling snacks near the zoo...

1859
01:07:58,879 --> 01:08:00,477
and the sledding park...

1860
01:08:00,478 --> 01:08:02,347
- when it opens. - I see.

1861
01:08:02,348 --> 01:08:05,118
We also have uniforms for the Amazon Express and T Express.

1862
01:08:05,119 --> 01:08:06,718
- Oh, the uniforms. - Yes.

1863
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:08,017
- For the staff. - Yes, we have the staff uniforms.

1864
01:08:08,018 --> 01:08:09,057
We have all of them.

1865
01:08:09,058 --> 01:08:10,658
You're talking about the outfits of the cast members, right?

1866
01:08:10,659 --> 01:08:12,258
- Yes. - They are all borrowed...

1867
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:13,858
and returned to this place.

1868
01:08:13,999 --> 01:08:15,527
So you mend clothes here as well?

1869
01:08:15,528 --> 01:08:18,999
There are so many people with talent...

1870
01:08:19,169 --> 01:08:21,067
at Everland.

1871
01:08:21,068 --> 01:08:22,408
- There are a lot of them. - Right.

1872
01:08:22,409 --> 01:08:24,168
Especially for the Amazon ride,

1873
01:08:24,169 --> 01:08:27,108
- A lot of famous people are there. - they do a lot of dancing.

1874
01:08:27,278 --> 01:08:29,879
- Their buttons pop out. - I see.

1875
01:08:30,009 --> 01:08:33,618
Their pants rip as well.

1876
01:08:33,619 --> 01:08:36,817
That is when we mend buttons...

1877
01:08:36,818 --> 01:08:39,557
and sew clothes with the sewing machine.

1878
01:08:39,558 --> 01:08:40,959
We mend zippers as well.

1879
01:08:41,159 --> 01:08:43,159
- You take care of these things. - Yes.

1880
01:08:43,329 --> 01:08:45,175
How long has it been since you have worked here?

1881
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,858
It has been over 20 years.

1882
01:08:48,299 --> 01:08:50,469
She has worked here for over 20 years.

1883
01:08:50,928 --> 01:08:52,267
(A true veteran)

1884
01:08:52,268 --> 01:08:53,839
It has been over 30 years for me.

1885
01:08:54,738 --> 01:08:56,767
(Amazed)

1886
01:08:56,768 --> 01:08:58,307
So that was why you didn't say it first.

1887
01:08:58,308 --> 01:09:00,009
(Correct)

1888
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:03,408
It wouldn't have been easy to work in the same place for many years.

1889
01:09:03,409 --> 01:09:07,078
But Everland is a great place to work at.

1890
01:09:07,079 --> 01:09:10,187
There are many things to see here as well.

1891
01:09:10,188 --> 01:09:13,158
I think that's what's keeping me here.

1892
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:14,289
(Devotion of 30 years)

1893
01:09:14,659 --> 01:09:16,487
When you work here,

1894
01:09:16,488 --> 01:09:18,828
there are a lot of young people.

1895
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:20,328
It feels great,

1896
01:09:20,329 --> 01:09:21,498
- and it makes me feel young. - There's a young energy.

1897
01:09:21,499 --> 01:09:22,798
Right. It makes you feel young.

1898
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:25,137
I imagine that it would make you feel that way.

1899
01:09:25,138 --> 01:09:26,698
They seem like your sons and daughters,

1900
01:09:26,699 --> 01:09:27,868
- right? - Right.

1901
01:09:27,869 --> 01:09:31,508
- Right. - The ones I was close to...

1902
01:09:31,509 --> 01:09:33,607
came to me when they were about to quit and said,

1903
01:09:33,608 --> 01:09:35,708
"Thank you so much for everything, ma'am."

1904
01:09:35,709 --> 01:09:37,978
"I'll be back after serving my military duties."

1905
01:09:38,549 --> 01:09:40,517
There were some that wrote handwritten letters as well.

1906
01:09:40,518 --> 01:09:43,448
They got me a bunch of candy as well.

1907
01:09:43,449 --> 01:09:45,258
There were times when they did that for me.

1908
01:09:45,259 --> 01:09:48,527
There were times when I gave them pocket money...

1909
01:09:48,528 --> 01:09:51,527
- I see. - to treat themselves to a meal.

1910
01:09:51,528 --> 01:09:53,299
I just wish to...

1911
01:09:53,629 --> 01:09:55,829
stay here for a long time.

1912
01:09:55,999 --> 01:09:58,169
- I don't want to get fired! - She doesn't...

1913
01:09:58,938 --> 01:10:00,138
She doesn't want to get fired.

1914
01:10:00,768 --> 01:10:02,638
- There's nothing else you wish for. - Right.

1915
01:10:02,768 --> 01:10:04,737
I just wish to stay here and be healthy.

1916
01:10:04,738 --> 01:10:05,839
And stay healthy.

1917
01:10:06,209 --> 01:10:07,938
- If you could stay here, - Right.

1918
01:10:08,108 --> 01:10:09,708
There's nothing else you would wish for.

1919
01:10:10,449 --> 01:10:12,079
Those are great words to hear.

1920
01:10:13,818 --> 01:10:14,987
She wishes to be here forever.

1921
01:10:14,988 --> 01:10:16,288
(I wish to be here forever.)

1922
01:10:16,289 --> 01:10:18,659
What do the two of you do in your spare time?

1923
01:10:19,058 --> 01:10:21,927
With the ladies that are here,

1924
01:10:21,928 --> 01:10:23,487
I chat.

1925
01:10:23,488 --> 01:10:25,759
I watch Whenever Possible as well.

1926
01:10:26,629 --> 01:10:28,097
- Whenever Possible? - Gosh.

1927
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:31,698
She quietly says the things...

1928
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:34,097
we want to hear from her.

1929
01:10:34,098 --> 01:10:36,308
When it's spring,

1930
01:10:36,369 --> 01:10:39,137
she goes out to collect mountain greens often.

1931
01:10:39,138 --> 01:10:40,578
- Around this area? - Right.

1932
01:10:40,579 --> 01:10:44,079
- I tag along when she goes. - Right.

1933
01:10:44,108 --> 01:10:46,677
I enjoy hiking,

1934
01:10:46,678 --> 01:10:49,317
so I go hiking with my hiking club.

1935
01:10:49,318 --> 01:10:51,289
- You're in a hiking club? - Yes.

1936
01:10:51,818 --> 01:10:53,158
How long have you been in the hiking club?

1937
01:10:53,159 --> 01:10:55,228
It has been over 20 years in the hiking club.

1938
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,057
You do something for a long time once you start.

1939
01:10:57,058 --> 01:10:58,058
Right.

1940
01:10:58,059 --> 01:10:59,857
(Doing it for 20 years is a given when something is started.)

1941
01:10:59,858 --> 01:11:02,128
We're all here to visit the two of you.

1942
01:11:02,129 --> 01:11:03,598
With the previous Whenever Guest,

1943
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:06,499
we cleared all three rounds.

1944
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:08,308
Let's start with the game.

1945
01:11:10,738 --> 01:11:13,108
- Would you pick 1 for Round 1? - Pick 1?

1946
01:11:13,308 --> 01:11:15,348
- What do I do? - Break it in half.

1947
01:11:16,509 --> 01:11:17,948
Will you read it for us?

1948
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,494
- It's hard to read. - What do I do with this?

1949
01:11:19,518 --> 01:11:21,518
- What's wrong? - The words are too small to read.

1950
01:11:21,749 --> 01:11:22,818
Should I read it?

1951
01:11:23,249 --> 01:11:24,749
Here you are.

1952
01:11:24,848 --> 01:11:25,857
I'll read it.

1953
01:11:25,858 --> 01:11:27,158
- He can read it for us. - Right.

1954
01:11:27,159 --> 01:11:29,928
"My whole body is exhausted from managing winter clothes."

1955
01:11:30,058 --> 01:11:34,027
"Two sets of massagers for the calf, neck, and shoulders."

1956
01:11:34,028 --> 01:11:35,527
- Gosh! - What?

1957
01:11:35,528 --> 01:11:37,668
- A massager? - Is that good?

1958
01:11:37,669 --> 01:11:39,097
Yes! I love it!

1959
01:11:39,098 --> 01:11:41,168
(Cheering)

1960
01:11:41,169 --> 01:11:43,107
We really need that.

1961
01:11:43,108 --> 01:11:44,307
Please do well for us.

1962
01:11:44,308 --> 01:11:45,508
(2 massager sets for the exhausted body)

1963
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:47,278
- Please succeed. - Got it.

1964
01:11:47,778 --> 01:11:48,847
We'll try our best.

1965
01:11:48,848 --> 01:11:50,778
(Roar! 4-Character Quiz)

1966
01:11:50,808 --> 01:11:52,248
(Listen to the first 2 characters of a 4-character word...)

1967
01:11:52,249 --> 01:11:55,887
(and say the last two characters.)

1968
01:11:55,888 --> 01:11:57,949
(Round 1:4-Character Idiom)

1969
01:11:58,219 --> 01:12:00,187
For example, two birds...

1970
01:12:00,188 --> 01:12:01,289
- One stone. - One stone.

1971
01:12:01,388 --> 01:12:03,558
- I see. - It's a four-character idiom.

1972
01:12:04,028 --> 01:12:05,597
One, two, three, two, one.

1973
01:12:05,598 --> 01:12:07,027
- You have to return to number one. - It has to come back to me.

1974
01:12:07,028 --> 01:12:08,028
That's how we succeed?

1975
01:12:08,029 --> 01:12:09,898
- It has to return to him? - Yes.

1976
01:12:10,629 --> 01:12:12,097
Do well, Jong Min! Let's go!

1977
01:12:12,098 --> 01:12:13,567
Oh, right.

1978
01:12:13,568 --> 01:12:15,237
Why did you call out Jong Min only?

1979
01:12:15,238 --> 01:12:17,078
(She called out Jong Min as she felt worried.)

1980
01:12:17,209 --> 01:12:18,368
He did a lot of these games in "2 Days 1 Night."

1981
01:12:18,369 --> 01:12:19,378
Right.

1982
01:12:19,379 --> 01:12:20,437
- Right. - That was why I rooted for him.

1983
01:12:20,438 --> 01:12:22,879
- I learned a lot on TV. - Right.

1984
01:12:23,049 --> 01:12:25,008
We'll give it a try. We'll begin with...

1985
01:12:25,009 --> 01:12:26,248
- our first try. - It'll be simple.

1986
01:12:26,249 --> 01:12:27,718
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1987
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:29,347
- Round One. Here we go! - Right.

1988
01:12:29,348 --> 01:12:33,459
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

1989
01:12:33,759 --> 01:12:35,688
(It starts with Dae Myeung.)

1990
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,658
- Busy publicly... - Busy personally.

1991
01:12:37,659 --> 01:12:39,129
- Survival of... - The fittest.

1992
01:12:39,928 --> 01:12:41,329
- To make... - Ends meet.

1993
01:12:41,459 --> 01:12:42,727
- Narrow escape... - From death.

1994
01:12:42,728 --> 01:12:44,227
(Narrow escape from death)

1995
01:12:44,228 --> 01:12:46,998
(Dae Myeung is the only one left.)

1996
01:12:46,999 --> 01:12:47,999
Quick as...

1997
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,469
(Quick as...)

1998
01:12:49,784 --> 01:12:50,823
Quick as...

1999
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:52,159
(Quick as...)

2000
01:12:52,168 --> 01:12:54,237
- Quick as... - A flash.

2001
01:12:54,238 --> 01:12:55,578
- Yes! - Yes!

2002
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,877
We did it!

2003
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,107
- Quick as... - A flash.

2004
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:01,448
(The clear Round 1 quick as a flash.)

2005
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:03,618
(A standing ovation)

2006
01:13:04,387 --> 01:13:05,516
(They succeed right away in their first attempt.)

2007
01:13:05,517 --> 01:13:07,016
- We did it right away. - You didn't expect this, right?

2008
01:13:07,017 --> 01:13:09,858
- What were you expecting from us? - Thank you.

2009
01:13:10,028 --> 01:13:12,086
We were amazing as the people from Suyu-ri.

2010
01:13:12,087 --> 01:13:13,556
- Suyu-ri power. - Right!

2011
01:13:13,557 --> 01:13:15,057
Team Suyu-ri is on fire right now.

2012
01:13:15,227 --> 01:13:17,266
- We pass Round One! - Yes!

2013
01:13:17,267 --> 01:13:18,897
(They get the 2 sets of massagers.)

2014
01:13:18,898 --> 01:13:20,466
This feels great!

2015
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:21,636
(She feels great.)

2016
01:13:21,637 --> 01:13:23,467
I was surprised by myself.

2017
01:13:24,368 --> 01:13:27,006
- Will you go with Round Two? - Go!

2018
01:13:27,007 --> 01:13:28,476
- Go! - In 1, 2, 3,

2019
01:13:28,477 --> 01:13:29,707
- Here we go! - Okay.

2020
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:31,188
Let's pick the present for Round Two.

2021
01:13:31,877 --> 01:13:33,617
I'll pick the present for Round Two.

2022
01:13:33,618 --> 01:13:35,077
(What is the second present after the massager?)

2023
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:38,118
- What is it? - "Even when I'm picking greens..."

2024
01:13:38,387 --> 01:13:39,447
What is this?

2025
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,488
- We'll read it for you. - I'm sorry. Gosh.

2026
01:13:41,557 --> 01:13:43,157
- Gosh. - Make it bigger for them.

2027
01:13:43,158 --> 01:13:44,557
- Please read it for us. - Right.

2028
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:45,788
Gosh, I'm sorry.

2029
01:13:45,789 --> 01:13:48,797
"Even when I'm picking greens, I can't..."

2030
01:13:50,398 --> 01:13:52,568
I can see the words, but it's hard to read.

2031
01:13:53,437 --> 01:13:56,038
"Even when I'm picking greens, I can't give up on looking great."

2032
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:57,607
"Two Gucci sunglasses."

2033
01:13:57,608 --> 01:13:59,306
(2 Gucci sunglasses)

2034
01:13:59,307 --> 01:14:00,976
- They're high-end sunglasses. - Right.

2035
01:14:00,977 --> 01:14:02,097
They're high-end sunglasses.

2036
01:14:02,238 --> 01:14:03,976
- Gosh! - Really?

2037
01:14:03,977 --> 01:14:05,807
- Really? Yes! - Gucci?

2038
01:14:06,248 --> 01:14:07,377
Are you serious?

2039
01:14:07,847 --> 01:14:08,976
Such amazing presents are given?

2040
01:14:08,977 --> 01:14:10,087
Are you serious?

2041
01:14:10,318 --> 01:14:12,148
I'll use them when I go hiking.

2042
01:14:12,717 --> 01:14:14,357
- You can wear them for hiking. - Right.

2043
01:14:14,358 --> 01:14:15,586
You can open them.

2044
01:14:15,587 --> 01:14:17,527
- Really? - My goodness.

2045
01:14:17,528 --> 01:14:18,657
(Laughing)

2046
01:14:18,658 --> 01:14:19,788
Try them on.

2047
01:14:20,658 --> 01:14:21,757
You can try them on.

2048
01:14:22,358 --> 01:14:24,427
(A perfect match)

2049
01:14:25,498 --> 01:14:27,966
They look great on you.

2050
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,537
I will make sure to wear them when I go hiking.

2051
01:14:29,538 --> 01:14:30,707
(The two ladies of the wardrobe department...)

2052
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,737
(look delighted.)

2053
01:14:31,738 --> 01:14:33,136
(Round 2)

2054
01:14:33,137 --> 01:14:35,336
(Four-character daily words)

2055
01:14:35,337 --> 01:14:36,577
Daily words.

2056
01:14:36,578 --> 01:14:37,877
Isn't this easier?

2057
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:40,716
- This would be harder. - I think this will be different.

2058
01:14:40,717 --> 01:14:41,947
- Really? - No!

2059
01:14:41,948 --> 01:14:43,418
- Gosh. - Shall we go for it?

2060
01:14:43,788 --> 01:14:45,317
- All right. - But...

2061
01:14:45,318 --> 01:14:46,686
I think it'll be harder than expected.

2062
01:14:46,687 --> 01:14:48,716
You only go once. Please switch seats with me.

2063
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,717
Okay.

2064
01:14:49,718 --> 01:14:51,127
- May we switch seats? - Yes.

2065
01:14:51,427 --> 01:14:53,997
We'll make our attempt for Round Two.

2066
01:14:53,998 --> 01:14:54,998
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2067
01:14:54,999 --> 01:14:56,197
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2068
01:14:56,198 --> 01:14:57,198
The sunglasses.

2069
01:14:57,199 --> 01:14:58,327
- We'll go for it. - The sunglasses.

2070
01:14:58,328 --> 01:15:00,368
- Here it comes. - Here we go. It's our second try.

2071
01:15:01,898 --> 01:15:03,408
- Safety... - First.

2072
01:15:03,668 --> 01:15:05,238
- Foam... - Cleenser.

2073
01:15:05,307 --> 01:15:06,437
- Incorrect. - What?

2074
01:15:06,568 --> 01:15:08,607
- It's foam cleanser. - What's "cleenser?"

2075
01:15:08,608 --> 01:15:09,708
- My gosh! - What was that?

2076
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:12,007
- Jae Suk. - Jae Suk?

2077
01:15:12,908 --> 01:15:14,247
("Cleenser" came out as he felt nervous.)

2078
01:15:14,248 --> 01:15:16,148
- Cleenser was ridiculous. - No.

2079
01:15:16,278 --> 01:15:17,547
Cleenser?

2080
01:15:19,448 --> 01:15:21,317
- Ma'am, that was... - Gosh.

2081
01:15:21,318 --> 01:15:22,886
Wasn't that close enough?

2082
01:15:22,887 --> 01:15:24,386
It's pronounced that way in other dialects.

2083
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:26,158
- Really? - I'm from Seoul.

2084
01:15:27,028 --> 01:15:28,657
(I'm from Suyu-ri.)

2085
01:15:28,658 --> 01:15:31,397
- It has to be exactly right. - Foam cleansing. Okay.

2086
01:15:31,398 --> 01:15:32,897
I didn't pay attention to the pronunciation.

2087
01:15:32,898 --> 01:15:34,668
All right. It's our third try.

2088
01:15:34,937 --> 01:15:35,937
Here it comes.

2089
01:15:35,938 --> 01:15:37,806
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

2090
01:15:37,807 --> 01:15:39,437
- St... - Ress.

2091
01:15:40,437 --> 01:15:42,077
- Home pa... - What?

2092
01:15:42,078 --> 01:15:43,546
- Incorrect! - What did you say?

2093
01:15:43,547 --> 01:15:45,547
- Home page. - Home page.

2094
01:15:45,778 --> 01:15:47,578
- You sounded... - But he understood me.

2095
01:15:47,877 --> 01:15:48,948
What?

2096
01:15:50,587 --> 01:15:51,648
What?

2097
01:15:53,087 --> 01:15:54,516
Oh, you didn't understand him.

2098
01:15:54,517 --> 01:15:55,918
We're on the same side!

2099
01:15:56,488 --> 01:15:57,957
"Home pa?"

2100
01:15:57,958 --> 01:16:01,596
It's okay!

2101
01:16:01,597 --> 01:16:03,867
- We have to do well here. - It's harder than I thought.

2102
01:16:03,868 --> 01:16:04,897
It's harder than I thought.

2103
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:06,667
- Let's focus. - Let's go!

2104
01:16:06,668 --> 01:16:07,737
Let's go!

2105
01:16:07,738 --> 01:16:08,897
(There needs to be a change in atmosphere.)

2106
01:16:08,898 --> 01:16:10,207
Do you want to sit here, Jong Min?

2107
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:11,208
No!

2108
01:16:12,168 --> 01:16:14,537
- I think I'll get it wrong. - No.

2109
01:16:14,538 --> 01:16:16,078
- Jae Suk. - Give it a try.

2110
01:16:16,377 --> 01:16:17,676
(Jong Min gets pushed to become number 2.)

2111
01:16:17,677 --> 01:16:19,306
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2112
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:21,117
- Let's go! - We can do this!

2113
01:16:21,118 --> 01:16:22,748
- Let's go! - We had a great start.

2114
01:16:23,788 --> 01:16:24,917
- All right. - Here it comes.

2115
01:16:24,918 --> 01:16:25,918
- Right. - Right.

2116
01:16:25,919 --> 01:16:29,086
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

2117
01:16:29,087 --> 01:16:30,528
- Morning... - Discount.

2118
01:16:30,858 --> 01:16:32,227
- Account... - Transfer.

2119
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,858
- Customer... - Welcome them?

2120
01:16:35,727 --> 01:16:36,796
- What is it for customer? - Customer satisfaction!

2121
01:16:36,797 --> 01:16:38,667
- Customer... - Welcome them?

2122
01:16:38,668 --> 01:16:39,726
(Customer welcome them?)

2123
01:16:39,727 --> 01:16:41,537
- What is it for customer? - Customer satisfaction!

2124
01:16:41,538 --> 01:16:42,668
Customer center!

2125
01:16:42,898 --> 01:16:44,637
- Customer satisfaction! - Customer center!

2126
01:16:44,668 --> 01:16:46,337
My gosh.

2127
01:16:46,807 --> 01:16:48,407
Customer satisfaction works too.

2128
01:16:48,408 --> 01:16:49,537
(Customer needs, customer response, customer management, etc.)

2129
01:16:49,538 --> 01:16:51,077
There were so many that could've worked, Jae Suk!

2130
01:16:51,078 --> 01:16:52,248
(Scolding him)

2131
01:16:52,507 --> 01:16:53,516
Jae Suk!

2132
01:16:53,517 --> 01:16:54,846
(He can't raise his head.)

2133
01:16:54,847 --> 01:16:56,716
- I didn't expect this from him. - Customer center.

2134
01:16:56,717 --> 01:16:59,448
But it is hard.

2135
01:17:00,318 --> 01:17:01,617
This wasn't hard at all.

2136
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:02,618
Right.

2137
01:17:03,158 --> 01:17:05,186
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2138
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,687
We have to get the sunglasses.

2139
01:17:07,458 --> 01:17:09,634
- Should we use the coupon now? - We have a lot of tries left.

2140
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:10,796
- Let's use it now. - Use what?

2141
01:17:10,797 --> 01:17:13,497
"Customer satisfaction." She got the answers right away.

2142
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:14,997
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2143
01:17:14,998 --> 01:17:16,937
- I'll step out. - What if I do a bad job?

2144
01:17:17,208 --> 01:17:18,667
I don't think I should play right now.

2145
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:19,936
- Please give me an easy one. - Right.

2146
01:17:19,937 --> 01:17:22,057
Just do as you did just now. "Customer satisfaction."

2147
01:17:22,278 --> 01:17:23,547
Would you like to practice?

2148
01:17:23,648 --> 01:17:25,007
- Practice? Yes. - Yes.

2149
01:17:25,278 --> 01:17:26,677
- Wi... - Jay.

2150
01:17:26,918 --> 01:17:27,918
- Sorry? - Is that right?

2151
01:17:27,919 --> 01:17:29,148
Who is Wi Jay?

2152
01:17:30,217 --> 01:17:32,516
- Wi-Fi! - "Wi Jay?"

2153
01:17:32,517 --> 01:17:34,488
- "Wi Jay?" - Wi-Fi!

2154
01:17:34,788 --> 01:17:36,257
You weren't trying to say YG, right?

2155
01:17:37,227 --> 01:17:38,886
Dress shirt works too?

2156
01:17:38,887 --> 01:17:40,357
Wasn't that right, though?

2157
01:17:40,358 --> 01:17:41,557
What's "Wi Jay?"

2158
01:17:41,858 --> 01:17:43,998
It wasn't because I didn't know. It was just because.

2159
01:17:44,767 --> 01:17:45,966
It wasn't because she didn't know.

2160
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:47,337
Let's get together for a cheer.

2161
01:17:47,868 --> 01:17:48,897
In 1, 2, 3.

2162
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:49,898
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2163
01:17:50,507 --> 01:17:52,538
- I think she'll do well, though. - I'll do well.

2164
01:17:53,108 --> 01:17:54,437
Give me an easy one.

2165
01:17:55,477 --> 01:17:56,738
- Here it comes. - Okay.

2166
01:17:57,748 --> 01:17:59,278
- Ganggang... - Suweollae.

2167
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:01,477
- Incorrect! - It's "sullae."

2168
01:18:01,618 --> 01:18:03,047
- Ganggang... - Suweollae.

2169
01:18:03,217 --> 01:18:05,387
- Incorrect! - Wait. It's sullae.

2170
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:08,686
(Without being able to open her mouth, )

2171
01:18:08,687 --> 01:18:10,386
(the coupon is used.)

2172
01:18:10,387 --> 01:18:12,347
We got confused as this came off all of a sudden.

2173
01:18:13,358 --> 01:18:14,498
It's Ganggangsullae.

2174
01:18:15,698 --> 01:18:17,398
I was going to say Ganggang Night Club.

2175
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:18,868
"Ganggang Night Club?"

2176
01:18:19,498 --> 01:18:21,178
- What? - She said, "Ganggang Night Club."

2177
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:24,806
(Ganggang Night Club?)

2178
01:18:24,807 --> 01:18:26,708
- My goodness! - Ganggang Night Club!

2179
01:18:27,877 --> 01:18:30,476
(Wi Jay at Ganggang Night Club)

2180
01:18:30,477 --> 01:18:32,108
Can you give her one more chance?

2181
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:35,117
All she did was sit there.

2182
01:18:35,118 --> 01:18:37,047
- What have I done? - Ganggang...

2183
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:38,917
No. It's okay.

2184
01:18:38,918 --> 01:18:40,086
(Rules are rules. The coupon round is over.)

2185
01:18:40,087 --> 01:18:41,618
I'm so sorry!

2186
01:18:42,057 --> 01:18:43,927
- Gosh. - What have I done?

2187
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:46,828
- It's okay. - We only have four tries left.

2188
01:18:47,257 --> 01:18:49,497
- We passed Round One so quickly. - Right.

2189
01:18:49,498 --> 01:18:51,096
- I didn't expect this. - You should go first.

2190
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:52,327
Right. You should come here.

2191
01:18:52,328 --> 01:18:53,836
- Okay. - Gosh.

2192
01:18:53,837 --> 01:18:54,837
(Jong Min ends up at the start.)

2193
01:18:54,838 --> 01:18:56,537
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2194
01:18:56,538 --> 01:18:58,237
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2195
01:18:58,238 --> 01:19:00,807
- Please! - We can do this!

2196
01:19:00,908 --> 01:19:02,037
We have to pass Round Two at least.

2197
01:19:02,038 --> 01:19:03,176
We must.

2198
01:19:03,177 --> 01:19:04,707
- He's so cold. - Gosh.

2199
01:19:04,708 --> 01:19:06,577
- He doesn't even wait. - Not at all.

2200
01:19:06,578 --> 01:19:08,778
(They're already at try number 7 with the sharp calls.)

2201
01:19:09,318 --> 01:19:10,618
- Hand... - Cream.

2202
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:13,047
- Vocal... - Nodules.

2203
01:19:13,858 --> 01:19:15,418
- Up... - Date.

2204
01:19:16,017 --> 01:19:17,828
- As... - Phalt.

2205
01:19:18,187 --> 01:19:19,886
- As... - Phalt.

2206
01:19:19,887 --> 01:19:23,457
(There's one question left!)

2207
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,497
Xy...

2208
01:19:24,498 --> 01:19:27,567
(Xy...)

2209
01:19:27,568 --> 01:19:29,068
We have to pass Round Two at least.

2210
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:31,937
- Xy... - Toil.

2211
01:19:32,038 --> 01:19:33,707
What? Xylitol!

2212
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,907
Why?

2213
01:19:34,908 --> 01:19:36,336
Toil. What?

2214
01:19:36,337 --> 01:19:37,408
Xylitol!

2215
01:19:40,318 --> 01:19:42,677
(Crying out in despair)

2216
01:19:42,877 --> 01:19:44,547
Why?

2217
01:19:45,448 --> 01:19:47,216
- Xylitol! - Xylitol!

2218
01:19:47,217 --> 01:19:48,557
What's xytoil?

2219
01:19:48,988 --> 01:19:50,727
What's xytoil?

2220
01:19:51,158 --> 01:19:53,858
- Right. - I got it mixed up.

2221
01:19:54,998 --> 01:19:57,198
(A huge mistake)

2222
01:19:57,597 --> 01:19:59,027
We're almost there.

2223
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:00,836
- Let's do this! - We're almost there.

2224
01:20:00,837 --> 01:20:03,708
It's hard as the word is given out all of a sudden.

2225
01:20:04,038 --> 01:20:05,837
They're watching us from the side too.

2226
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:09,037
- Gosh. Can we switch seats? - Sure. I'll go.

2227
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:11,046
This is a lot harder than I thought.

2228
01:20:11,047 --> 01:20:12,107
Right?

2229
01:20:12,108 --> 01:20:13,578
As each word is given out...

2230
01:20:13,648 --> 01:20:15,318
We only have two tries left.

2231
01:20:15,648 --> 01:20:16,818
You will make it.

2232
01:20:17,047 --> 01:20:18,987
- We have two tries left. - We have to pass this round.

2233
01:20:18,988 --> 01:20:20,517
I think you guys will make it.

2234
01:20:20,658 --> 01:20:21,686
- Right. - You guys will make it.

2235
01:20:21,687 --> 01:20:23,618
- But... - We can do this.

2236
01:20:23,887 --> 01:20:25,686
- Let's gather up. - Right. Let's go!

2237
01:20:25,687 --> 01:20:27,096
- We can do this. - In 1, 2, 3.

2238
01:20:27,097 --> 01:20:28,198
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2239
01:20:28,358 --> 01:20:29,556
We came this far for this?

2240
01:20:29,557 --> 01:20:31,766
We can do this. We've gained the experience.

2241
01:20:31,767 --> 01:20:32,796
Let's go!

2242
01:20:32,797 --> 01:20:34,113
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2243
01:20:34,137 --> 01:20:37,108
(They desperately want the sunglasses and massager.)

2244
01:20:37,767 --> 01:20:39,868
- Dark... - Circle.

2245
01:20:40,238 --> 01:20:42,007
- Olive... - Oil.

2246
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:43,877
- Fine... - Dust.

2247
01:20:44,347 --> 01:20:45,648
- Arm... - Pit.

2248
01:20:46,677 --> 01:20:47,777
- Arm... - Pit.

2249
01:20:47,778 --> 01:20:50,217
(They manage to get four questions right again!)

2250
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,086
Red...

2251
01:20:53,087 --> 01:20:57,756
(Red...)

2252
01:20:57,757 --> 01:20:58,828
Red...

2253
01:20:59,788 --> 01:21:00,796
Sub pick?

2254
01:21:00,797 --> 01:21:02,556
What was it? Red?

2255
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,198
- Red... - Sub pick?

2256
01:21:04,368 --> 01:21:06,127
- Incorrect! - What was it? Red?

2257
01:21:06,528 --> 01:21:07,538
Why?

2258
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,466
(Jae Suk!)

2259
01:21:09,467 --> 01:21:11,307
- Red? - Red Velvet.

2260
01:21:11,807 --> 01:21:13,506
- Red carpet. - Gosh.

2261
01:21:13,507 --> 01:21:14,907
(Red Velvet, Red carpet, red ocean, red wine, red card)

2262
01:21:14,908 --> 01:21:16,348
- It's hard. - We were almost there.

2263
01:21:16,608 --> 01:21:18,047
It's hard.

2264
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:21,448
Gosh. I can't seem to...

2265
01:21:21,748 --> 01:21:23,147
make fun of him anymore.

2266
01:21:23,148 --> 01:21:24,686
We came so close.

2267
01:21:24,687 --> 01:21:25,847
It's so hard.

2268
01:21:26,818 --> 01:21:30,017
I can feel my heart burn up.

2269
01:21:31,757 --> 01:21:34,226
- You'll do well in the end. - It's our last attempt.

2270
01:21:34,227 --> 01:21:35,498
We can't go to Round Three.

2271
01:21:35,898 --> 01:21:38,467
We had a great start.

2272
01:21:38,828 --> 01:21:40,226
(We did great in Round 1.)

2273
01:21:40,227 --> 01:21:43,197
Gosh, this is harder than using the body.

2274
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:44,966
- We will do our best until the end. - This is harder.

2275
01:21:44,967 --> 01:21:46,237
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

2276
01:21:46,238 --> 01:21:48,376
All right. This is our tenth and last try.

2277
01:21:48,377 --> 01:21:49,876
- Let's gather up. - Let's gather up.

2278
01:21:49,877 --> 01:21:51,607
- All right. In 1, 2, 3. - Jae Suk!

2279
01:21:51,608 --> 01:21:52,977
- Let's go! - Let's go! Please!

2280
01:21:53,347 --> 01:21:54,347
Let's go!

2281
01:21:54,348 --> 01:21:56,376
This is the last try.

2282
01:21:56,377 --> 01:21:58,337
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the last try.)

2283
01:21:58,988 --> 01:22:00,087
This is the last try.

2284
01:22:02,618 --> 01:22:04,528
- Inexperienced... - Driver.

2285
01:22:05,328 --> 01:22:06,887
- Charis... - Ma.

2286
01:22:07,498 --> 01:22:08,557
Di...

2287
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:10,627
Dong Myeong.

2288
01:22:11,427 --> 01:22:13,267
What? What's "di?"

2289
01:22:13,498 --> 01:22:14,538
Di...

2290
01:22:15,568 --> 01:22:16,637
Dong Myeong.

2291
01:22:17,467 --> 01:22:19,207
What? What's "di?"

2292
01:22:19,208 --> 01:22:20,936
- Diet. - Oh, diet.

2293
01:22:20,937 --> 01:22:27,748
(Diet, diary, "Die Hard," dynamic, direct)

2294
01:22:30,177 --> 01:22:31,948
Gosh! What do we do?

2295
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:43,297
(The presents are all gone.)

2296
01:22:44,368 --> 01:22:47,266
What a bummer!

2297
01:22:47,267 --> 01:22:48,797
Why are you looking at me?

2298
01:22:49,637 --> 01:22:51,168
Why are you looking at me?

2299
01:22:53,538 --> 01:22:55,637
Gosh! You're taking them back?

2300
01:22:58,007 --> 01:22:59,778
Please give them to us.

2301
01:22:59,877 --> 01:23:01,278
What do we do?

2302
01:23:02,148 --> 01:23:03,176
That was close.

2303
01:23:03,177 --> 01:23:04,248
(Feeling restless)

2304
01:23:10,318 --> 01:23:12,458
Gosh, I'm getting goosebumps!

2305
01:23:13,627 --> 01:23:16,127
(He has never felt this before.)

2306
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:18,668
Gosh, we thought we were going to make it.

2307
01:23:19,927 --> 01:23:20,997
It's okay.

2308
01:23:20,998 --> 01:23:22,636
The sunglasses...

2309
01:23:22,637 --> 01:23:24,466
- It's okay. - It's okay.

2310
01:23:24,467 --> 01:23:25,467
I feel terrible.

2311
01:23:25,468 --> 01:23:28,777
(We shouldn't have made them put them on.)

2312
01:23:28,778 --> 01:23:29,977
They look great on you.

2313
01:23:30,847 --> 01:23:32,876
(Di Dong Myeong is left in shock.)

2314
01:23:32,877 --> 01:23:34,578
- What do we do? - Gosh.

2315
01:23:34,918 --> 01:23:36,248
Thank you.

2316
01:23:36,377 --> 01:23:39,086
- We're so sorry. - Thank you.

2317
01:23:39,087 --> 01:23:41,217
- Don't feel sorry. - Gosh. We had a great time.

2318
01:23:41,387 --> 01:23:43,516
It was great just to be able...

2319
01:23:43,517 --> 01:23:45,857
- to see your faces. - We're so sorry.

2320
01:23:45,858 --> 01:23:48,357
We'll feel bad if you feel that way.

2321
01:23:48,358 --> 01:23:49,556
- We're so sorry. - No.

2322
01:23:49,557 --> 01:23:51,028
- We're so sorry. - It's fine.

2323
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:53,498
Gosh, they looked great on them.

2324
01:23:54,467 --> 01:23:55,966
- We'll get going then. - Right.

2325
01:23:55,967 --> 01:23:57,136
(Their bodies and hearts are put on a cold wave watch.)

2326
01:23:57,137 --> 01:23:59,267
We should've passed that round. Gosh.

2327
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,538
Right.

2328
01:24:02,377 --> 01:24:04,007
We should've passed that round.

2329
01:24:04,748 --> 01:24:06,868
I feel so bad. Do you usually feel this bad for this?

2330
01:24:07,047 --> 01:24:09,377
- Yes. - It's usually like this, right?

2331
01:24:09,847 --> 01:24:11,686
Do we get criticized for this too?

2332
01:24:11,687 --> 01:24:12,748
Gosh.

2333
01:24:12,988 --> 01:24:14,588
Will that happen after this goes on air?

2334
01:24:14,858 --> 01:24:16,586
Well, I guess we can get criticized for this.

2335
01:24:16,587 --> 01:24:18,387
Stay off the Internet for a while...

2336
01:24:18,557 --> 01:24:20,187
- and go abroad. - What?

2337
01:24:20,328 --> 01:24:22,358
I'm here as a guest. Why do I have to feel so bad?

2338
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:23,698
It can't be helped.

2339
01:24:24,328 --> 01:24:26,797
That's why I'm going to get off the Internet from now on.

2340
01:24:27,597 --> 01:24:30,168
Really? I feel so bad. What do I do?

2341
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:34,477
I'll check the last place we have to go to.

2342
01:24:35,377 --> 01:24:36,807
Gosh, that was so disappointing.

2343
01:24:37,078 --> 01:24:38,408
This is the last place.

2344
01:24:38,677 --> 01:24:41,976
Where is it? We have around 5 minutes until 3pm.

2345
01:24:41,977 --> 01:24:45,086
Right. We have to be there by 3:30pm.

2346
01:24:45,087 --> 01:24:46,187
By 3:30pm?

2347
01:24:46,618 --> 01:24:48,556
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

2348
01:24:48,557 --> 01:24:52,227
We passed all 3 rounds for the 1st spare time.

2349
01:24:52,788 --> 01:24:54,828
Right. How many times did you get it wrong earlier?

2350
01:24:57,267 --> 01:24:58,498
But...

2351
01:24:58,698 --> 01:25:01,297
how could you get it wrong for the last question?

2352
01:25:01,837 --> 01:25:03,897
It would've ended if you had gotten it right before that.

2353
01:25:03,898 --> 01:25:05,136
There was "Die Hard."

2354
01:25:05,137 --> 01:25:06,367
(Red Sub Pick and Di Dong Myeong get into a quarrel.)

2355
01:25:06,368 --> 01:25:07,936
- The last one... - Forget it.

2356
01:25:07,937 --> 01:25:10,648
Get off the Internet for a while...

2357
01:25:11,278 --> 01:25:12,477
and go abroad.

2358
01:25:13,148 --> 01:25:15,546
- Got it? - I might really die.

2359
01:25:15,547 --> 01:25:16,547
(Worried)

2360
01:25:17,347 --> 01:25:19,647
(We have to do well in the last spare time.)

2361
01:25:19,648 --> 01:25:22,087
- We need to freshen things up. - Gosh.

2362
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:24,226
Right? We all look down right now.

2363
01:25:24,227 --> 01:25:26,527
Why don't we charge ourselves with some sugar...

2364
01:25:26,528 --> 01:25:28,126
- and get refreshed? - Let's do that.

2365
01:25:28,127 --> 01:25:29,557
- Let's have some coffee. - What?

2366
01:25:29,727 --> 01:25:30,998
Coffee again?

2367
01:25:31,198 --> 01:25:33,266
What? What are you saying?

2368
01:25:33,267 --> 01:25:34,397
We had coffee.

2369
01:25:34,398 --> 01:25:35,737
We failed because of you!

2370
01:25:35,738 --> 01:25:36,897
(Most answers wrong versus last answer wrong)

2371
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:39,137
- Gosh. - You got it wrong so many times.

2372
01:25:39,337 --> 01:25:40,807
Hold on. Milk ice cream?

2373
01:25:41,038 --> 01:25:42,078
Milk?

2374
01:25:42,977 --> 01:25:45,108
- Milk ice cream? - Milk ice cream?

2375
01:25:45,507 --> 01:25:46,948
Milk ice cream?

2376
01:25:47,007 --> 01:25:48,648
I think that will freshen us up.

2377
01:25:48,748 --> 01:25:50,277
- Milk ice cream? - Milk ice cream!

2378
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:51,638
- That doesn't sound bad. - Right?

2379
01:25:52,017 --> 01:25:53,216
(They're in perfect order only for these moments.)

2380
01:25:53,217 --> 01:25:54,257
Excuse me.

2381
01:25:54,788 --> 01:25:56,086
What is the half-half cone?

2382
01:25:56,087 --> 01:25:57,216
It's chocolate and milk together.

2383
01:25:57,217 --> 01:25:59,363
- We'll get the half-half cone then. - The half-half cone.

2384
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:00,828
- That's great. - Right?

2385
01:26:01,127 --> 01:26:02,398
I'll help you with the payment.

2386
01:26:04,368 --> 01:26:05,466
(The cards don't come out easily.)

2387
01:26:05,467 --> 01:26:06,596
No one wants to pay now.

2388
01:26:06,597 --> 01:26:08,237
- I'll pay. No. - I'll pay.

2389
01:26:08,238 --> 01:26:10,668
- Gosh. Jong Min should pay then. - Jong Min should pay.

2390
01:26:10,937 --> 01:26:12,737
- Diet Jong Min should pay. - Jong Min should pay.

2391
01:26:12,738 --> 01:26:14,506
- I'm Diet Jong Min? - You should pay.

2392
01:26:14,507 --> 01:26:16,177
Since you made a big mistake.

2393
01:26:16,807 --> 01:26:18,567
- Please insert your card in front. - Right.

2394
01:26:18,847 --> 01:26:20,607
I happened to get it wrong for the last one.

2395
01:26:21,177 --> 01:26:23,448
Why did you get it wrong for the last one?

2396
01:26:24,187 --> 01:26:25,517
Thank you!

2397
01:26:25,948 --> 01:26:27,287
- It's so cute. - It's so cute.

2398
01:26:27,288 --> 01:26:28,358
(Impressed)

2399
01:26:29,118 --> 01:26:31,658
Everything here makes you feel better.

2400
01:26:32,127 --> 01:26:33,386
(They get refreshed right away.)

2401
01:26:33,387 --> 01:26:34,773
- My goodness. - It looks like a pudding.

2402
01:26:34,797 --> 01:26:35,898
Gosh!

2403
01:26:36,127 --> 01:26:37,767
- How does it taste? - It tastes so good.

2404
01:26:40,328 --> 01:26:41,667
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2405
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:42,796
It's milk ice cream.

2406
01:26:42,797 --> 01:26:44,108
(Eating ice cream in the snow)

2407
01:26:46,368 --> 01:26:47,507
- Is it good? - Gosh!

2408
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:50,017
It makes you feel better as soon as you take a bite.

2409
01:26:50,408 --> 01:26:51,477
- Really? - Yes.

2410
01:26:51,948 --> 01:26:53,176
The spoons...

2411
01:26:53,177 --> 01:26:55,447
Do you have your spoons? We all got one.

2412
01:26:55,448 --> 01:26:56,517
Enjoy your ice cream.

2413
01:26:58,788 --> 01:27:00,787
The snow is eaten with the ice cream.

2414
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:02,487
You have to have ice cream on a snowy day.

2415
01:27:02,488 --> 01:27:04,017
(The Suyu-ri Trio is happy.)

2416
01:27:05,127 --> 01:27:07,998
The soft-serve ice cream is so smooth and soft.

2417
01:27:08,198 --> 01:27:10,926
I feel so happy to be at an amusement park on a snowy day.

2418
01:27:10,927 --> 01:27:12,267
- But... - Really.

2419
01:27:12,727 --> 01:27:15,937
"From little birds weighing 30g that are the size of your palm..."

2420
01:27:16,368 --> 01:27:19,337
"to huge elephants the size of four-ton trucks."

2421
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:22,908
"I go around the zoo with a doctor's bag in hand."

2422
01:27:23,238 --> 01:27:26,477
"After a busy morning, when it becomes 3pm,"

2423
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:29,148
"both animals and people become drowsy."

2424
01:27:29,717 --> 01:27:33,087
"Please give our drowsy trio some energy!"

2425
01:27:33,818 --> 01:27:35,757
Hang on. I think it's somewhere near here.

2426
01:27:38,158 --> 01:27:39,958
"Zooland Medical Center."

2427
01:27:40,528 --> 01:27:42,427
- This must be it. - "Zooland Medical Center?"

2428
01:27:42,627 --> 01:27:44,567
- Is this... - They have a place like this.

2429
01:27:44,568 --> 01:27:45,568
(Zooland Medical Center?)

2430
01:27:48,498 --> 01:27:50,136
Oh, this must be an animal hospital.

2431
01:27:50,137 --> 01:27:51,937
- This is so fascinating. - Hello.

2432
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:53,707
- Hello. - Hello.

2433
01:27:53,708 --> 01:27:56,537
Are you the three people who wrote to Whenever Possible?

2434
01:27:56,538 --> 01:27:58,176
- Yes, we are. - Oh, hello.

2435
01:27:58,177 --> 01:27:59,724
- Gosh, it's nice to meet you. - Hello.

2436
01:27:59,748 --> 01:28:01,516
Shin Ki Yong, Shin Hyun Ju,

2437
01:28:01,517 --> 01:28:03,046
- and Yang Jun Young. - That's right.

2438
01:28:03,047 --> 01:28:05,217
- It's nice to meet you. - Hello.

2439
01:28:05,418 --> 01:28:07,317
So, is this the place...

2440
01:28:07,318 --> 01:28:09,516
- where you treat animals? - Yes, this is an animal hospital.

2441
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:11,586
- Oh, so this is an animal hospital. - I see.

2442
01:28:11,587 --> 01:28:13,086
(They take care of countless animals' health at this hospital.)

2443
01:28:13,087 --> 01:28:15,126
That's right. There are lots of animals here.

2444
01:28:15,127 --> 01:28:16,327
Right.

2445
01:28:16,328 --> 01:28:19,528
Could you introduce what kind of work you do here?

2446
01:28:19,767 --> 01:28:21,436
This is an animal hospital...

2447
01:28:21,437 --> 01:28:23,898
where we treat animals at Everland.

2448
01:28:24,168 --> 01:28:26,707
And we are the vets who work here.

2449
01:28:26,708 --> 01:28:29,708
- The three of you are vets. - Yes, that's right.

2450
01:28:29,877 --> 01:28:32,976
Then how long have you been working here?

2451
01:28:32,977 --> 01:28:35,476
I've been here since 2015,

2452
01:28:35,477 --> 01:28:37,017
so it's been about nine years.

2453
01:28:37,177 --> 01:28:39,147
I've been here since 2018,

2454
01:28:39,148 --> 01:28:40,787
so it's my seventh year now.

2455
01:28:40,788 --> 01:28:41,886
Oh, you're in your seventh year.

2456
01:28:41,887 --> 01:28:44,527
I also started in 2018, but I joined 6 months later.

2457
01:28:44,528 --> 01:28:47,057
- So, this is also my seventh year. - You're the youngest.

2458
01:28:47,257 --> 01:28:49,226
Then is it just the three of you who work here?

2459
01:28:49,227 --> 01:28:52,168
No, there are seniors and colleagues of mine too.

2460
01:28:52,668 --> 01:28:54,867
- There's a picture over there. - There are five...

2461
01:28:54,868 --> 01:28:57,096
- Oh, it's the five of you. - Yes.

2462
01:28:57,097 --> 01:28:59,607
The person in the middle is the director, right?

2463
01:28:59,608 --> 01:29:02,506
- Yes, the director of the hospital. - The director of the hospital.

2464
01:29:02,507 --> 01:29:03,936
He's watching us now too.

2465
01:29:03,937 --> 01:29:05,977
(I'm watching you.)

2466
01:29:06,177 --> 01:29:10,017
By the way you're standing in the photo,

2467
01:29:10,248 --> 01:29:12,418
I can tell how this place...

2468
01:29:12,717 --> 01:29:15,318
- I can tell. - is organized.

2469
01:29:15,958 --> 01:29:17,887
- It's precise. - It is, right?

2470
01:29:18,757 --> 01:29:22,158
So, there are monkeys and giraffes here.

2471
01:29:22,257 --> 01:29:23,557
Do they all get treated here?

2472
01:29:23,757 --> 01:29:25,096
The ones that can come in,

2473
01:29:25,097 --> 01:29:26,897
- we usually treat them here. - You treat them here.

2474
01:29:26,898 --> 01:29:29,568
And the larger animals, we treat them on-site.

2475
01:29:29,668 --> 01:29:31,738
- Like the elephants. - Yes, that's right.

2476
01:29:32,307 --> 01:29:35,176
(Animal hospital: a check-up of a skunk)

2477
01:29:35,177 --> 01:29:37,408
(Getting an X-ray taken with both paws up)

2478
01:29:38,007 --> 01:29:40,976
(On-site: Treating an elephant's joints)

2479
01:29:40,977 --> 01:29:43,147
(Our adorable Ha Nee is getting ready.)

2480
01:29:43,148 --> 01:29:45,488
(On-site: A seal's ECG exam)

2481
01:29:46,788 --> 01:29:47,788
How pretty.

2482
01:29:47,789 --> 01:29:49,618
(On-site: Treating a camel's eye)

2483
01:29:49,658 --> 01:29:51,357
(While Le Bong is focused on a yummy treat, )

2484
01:29:51,358 --> 01:29:53,056
(they administer the eye drop.)

2485
01:29:53,057 --> 01:29:54,186
(Laughing)

2486
01:29:54,187 --> 01:29:56,747
It doesn't hurt. We don't want to give you the wrong impression.

2487
01:29:56,797 --> 01:29:58,528
These are just eye drops.

2488
01:29:59,297 --> 01:30:01,237
Oh, I see. I'm guessing...

2489
01:30:01,238 --> 01:30:04,936
the animals see you often and recognize the three of you.

2490
01:30:04,937 --> 01:30:07,467
- Oh, yes. They really do. - They do.

2491
01:30:07,507 --> 01:30:08,937
They don't like it when we show up.

2492
01:30:09,108 --> 01:30:11,306
- They usually get along, - That's right.

2493
01:30:11,307 --> 01:30:13,976
And they train well with the zookeepers,

2494
01:30:13,977 --> 01:30:16,078
but when we get there, they tense up right away.

2495
01:30:16,217 --> 01:30:17,777
Because they give them shots and stuff.

2496
01:30:17,818 --> 01:30:20,418
The tigers start hissing at us and don't come near us.

2497
01:30:20,547 --> 01:30:22,287
- Actually... - They go far away.

2498
01:30:22,288 --> 01:30:25,527
- Really. - In the case of smarter primates,

2499
01:30:25,528 --> 01:30:27,627
they spit water at us when we show up.

2500
01:30:28,358 --> 01:30:29,897
- They spit at us. - They're just like humans.

2501
01:30:29,898 --> 01:30:31,027
- To our faces. - They spit at you?

2502
01:30:31,028 --> 01:30:32,226
- They spit on our faces. - They really do.

2503
01:30:32,227 --> 01:30:34,168
- Oh, not water but saliva? - Yes.

2504
01:30:34,568 --> 01:30:36,136
- They spit at us. - Oh, so you'd go away?

2505
01:30:36,137 --> 01:30:37,237
- Yes. - That's incredible.

2506
01:30:37,238 --> 01:30:38,806
Gosh, that's unbelievable.

2507
01:30:38,807 --> 01:30:40,006
They recognize you like kids do.

2508
01:30:40,007 --> 01:30:42,936
What kind of animals come here often during the winter?

2509
01:30:42,937 --> 01:30:46,407
In winter, the animals that usually live outdoors,

2510
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:48,876
like giraffes or monkeys...

2511
01:30:48,877 --> 01:30:51,586
It's harder for them to go outside due to the temperature,

2512
01:30:51,587 --> 01:30:53,787
so they get into fights a lot while they're indoors.

2513
01:30:53,788 --> 01:30:55,858
I think that's when they have to see me often.

2514
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:57,787
They're similar to people.

2515
01:30:57,788 --> 01:31:00,387
When they are active outdoors,

2516
01:31:00,488 --> 01:31:02,697
they can relieve their stress, but they can't do that.

2517
01:31:02,698 --> 01:31:04,226
- Because they're cooped up inside. - Yes, and they're getting angry.

2518
01:31:04,227 --> 01:31:06,374
- They're getting stressed out. - Their stress levels go up.

2519
01:31:06,398 --> 01:31:08,738
How is it to work here?

2520
01:31:09,097 --> 01:31:12,967
- So many things happen here. - Yes.

2521
01:31:13,038 --> 01:31:15,237
For example, there are some animals, like Fu Bao,

2522
01:31:15,238 --> 01:31:17,007
that get national attention.

2523
01:31:17,137 --> 01:31:19,806
So, it's good but nerve-racking in a way.

2524
01:31:19,807 --> 01:31:22,278
I think that's how I feel as I work day-to-day.

2525
01:31:22,377 --> 01:31:24,077
When do you feel the most nervous?

2526
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:25,618
Right now...

2527
01:31:25,748 --> 01:31:27,418
Well, this kind of situation is also...

2528
01:31:27,618 --> 01:31:30,687
I've never seen famous people before, so I was really surprised.

2529
01:31:30,788 --> 01:31:32,457
An actor I like is here too.

2530
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:34,497
- Oh, really? - I'm a huge fan. I was surprised.

2531
01:31:34,498 --> 01:31:36,726
- I'm such a huge fan. - I watched you in bed last night.

2532
01:31:36,727 --> 01:31:38,127
- In bed? - Oh, what did you watch?

2533
01:31:38,198 --> 01:31:39,697
I love "Hospital Playlist."

2534
01:31:39,698 --> 01:31:41,997
Oh, they're doctors too.

2535
01:31:41,998 --> 01:31:43,367
- That's right. - I can relate.

2536
01:31:43,368 --> 01:31:45,306
- That's awesome. - They're all doctors.

2537
01:31:45,307 --> 01:31:46,337
- Thank you. - Yes.

2538
01:31:46,837 --> 01:31:50,107
So, you watched Dae Myeung and got to meet him today.

2539
01:31:50,108 --> 01:31:51,806
- Oh, dear. - My eyes widened.

2540
01:31:51,807 --> 01:31:53,006
(It's the fans' lucky day.)

2541
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,447
- You must enjoy medical dramas. - Yes.

2542
01:31:55,448 --> 01:31:58,117
Usually, what do you do during this time of day?

2543
01:31:58,118 --> 01:32:01,357
Usually, we go on rounds in the morning,

2544
01:32:01,358 --> 01:32:04,157
have lunch, go on rounds in the afternoon,

2545
01:32:04,158 --> 01:32:06,687
and come back to the hospital to do our tasks here.

2546
01:32:06,958 --> 01:32:08,528
Before that,

2547
01:32:09,328 --> 01:32:12,398
we get together and talk about our treatments.

2548
01:32:12,668 --> 01:32:14,226
And we talk behind others' backs too.

2549
01:32:14,227 --> 01:32:16,537
Since we have about 30 minutes...

2550
01:32:16,538 --> 01:32:18,466
Are you talking behind the animals' backs or people's?

2551
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:20,837
Normally, there's no reason to be mad at animals.

2552
01:32:21,877 --> 01:32:24,177
- I'm sure. - There aren't many people here.

2553
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,046
There aren't that many people who work here.

2554
01:32:28,047 --> 01:32:30,277
And this time on Fridays is...

2555
01:32:30,278 --> 01:32:31,947
when the director has a meeting.

2556
01:32:31,948 --> 01:32:33,817
So, this is a great moment for us.

2557
01:32:33,818 --> 01:32:36,617
So, the time when the director isn't around...

2558
01:32:36,618 --> 01:32:38,557
is a precious hour.

2559
01:32:38,828 --> 01:32:41,556
Still, in any job, there are moments like that.

2560
01:32:41,557 --> 01:32:43,557
"I'm glad I chose this job."

2561
01:32:43,727 --> 01:32:46,028
When do you feel that sense of achievement?

2562
01:32:46,427 --> 01:32:49,237
When sick animals are cured...

2563
01:32:49,238 --> 01:32:51,667
and get along with the other animals.

2564
01:32:51,668 --> 01:32:54,477
I think that's when I feel the greatest sense of achievement.

2565
01:32:54,608 --> 01:32:56,936
A place like the zoo...

2566
01:32:56,937 --> 01:33:00,207
- can't exactly replicate nature. - That's right.

2567
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:04,077
They're increasingly losing natural habitats in the wild,

2568
01:33:04,078 --> 01:33:06,447
and I believe that zoos...

2569
01:33:06,448 --> 01:33:10,086
play the part of letting people know that we're living together...

2570
01:33:10,087 --> 01:33:11,687
with these animals in nature.

2571
01:33:11,958 --> 01:33:15,027
I'm sure we all have more questions.

2572
01:33:15,028 --> 01:33:16,796
Do the employees here...

2573
01:33:16,797 --> 01:33:20,627
get a discount on the rides in the park?

2574
01:33:20,898 --> 01:33:22,796
- I'm sure you do, right? - Yes.

2575
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:26,336
Yes, the employees get annual passes.

2576
01:33:26,337 --> 01:33:27,567
- Oh, you do. - Annual passes.

2577
01:33:27,568 --> 01:33:28,908
But we don't really come often.

2578
01:33:30,837 --> 01:33:32,676
- I'm sure you don't. - Because...

2579
01:33:32,677 --> 01:33:34,777
- you don't go to your workplace. - Right.

2580
01:33:34,778 --> 01:33:36,124
- It must be tiring. - On your day off...

2581
01:33:36,148 --> 01:33:37,148
If they told you to come to the broadcasting station,

2582
01:33:37,149 --> 01:33:38,469
- would you go? - No, I wouldn't.

2583
01:33:38,717 --> 01:33:40,248
I'd go somewhere else on my day off.

2584
01:33:40,347 --> 01:33:41,787
- Why would you? - When someone you know goes,

2585
01:33:41,788 --> 01:33:44,158
"Give me a tour of the broadcasting station..."

2586
01:33:44,358 --> 01:33:46,118
- But you don't really want to. - Of course.

2587
01:33:46,158 --> 01:33:48,027
In last week's episode,

2588
01:33:48,028 --> 01:33:50,297
- there was a vet. - Yes.

2589
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:52,226
But you didn't succeed.

2590
01:33:52,227 --> 01:33:53,827
- Oh, right. - Yes, so...

2591
01:33:53,828 --> 01:33:55,436
- The vet in Hannam-dong. - Yes.

2592
01:33:55,437 --> 01:33:58,307
- The Everland day pass... - We couldn't give it to him.

2593
01:33:58,467 --> 01:33:59,637
If he needs one...

2594
01:34:01,608 --> 01:34:03,007
Oh, that's great.

2595
01:34:03,437 --> 01:34:05,647
We could connect them to each other.

2596
01:34:05,648 --> 01:34:07,818
I'm sure he's a senior if I find some connections.

2597
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:11,017
You're all vets too.

2598
01:34:11,217 --> 01:34:12,948
This is great.

2599
01:34:13,448 --> 01:34:16,186
Nice. Anyway, let's do a good job today.

2600
01:34:16,187 --> 01:34:17,563
- We should wrap things up well. - All right.

2601
01:34:17,587 --> 01:34:18,926
Let's see what we have for Round One.

2602
01:34:18,927 --> 01:34:20,427
- Dae Myeung. - Yes.

2603
01:34:20,528 --> 01:34:23,556
"Let's all enjoy coffee together. A 300-dollar coffee gift card."

2604
01:34:23,557 --> 01:34:24,796
(A 300-dollar coffee gift card)

2605
01:34:24,797 --> 01:34:27,697
- A 300-dollar coffee gift card. - A 300-dollar coffee gift card.

2606
01:34:27,698 --> 01:34:29,336
(The mission with a 300-dollar coffee gift card on the line)

2607
01:34:29,337 --> 01:34:31,306
(Pop, pop! Balloon Cannon)

2608
01:34:31,307 --> 01:34:33,737
(Shoot a table tennis ball with a balloon cannon...)

2609
01:34:33,738 --> 01:34:36,907
(and make the paper cup goal stand up.)

2610
01:34:36,908 --> 01:34:39,078
(Round 1:1 out of 3 has to score a goal.)

2611
01:34:39,377 --> 01:34:41,516
- Oh, you shoot and make it stand? - Oh, like this...

2612
01:34:41,517 --> 01:34:42,546
(The paper cup goal, Shoot the cannon from here)

2613
01:34:42,547 --> 01:34:44,467
How do you make it stand? Does it actually work?

2614
01:34:45,988 --> 01:34:47,987
- Oh, you put that in there. - Oh, you put it in.

2615
01:34:47,988 --> 01:34:49,357
(You put the table tennis ball in the balloon.)

2616
01:34:49,358 --> 01:34:50,418
Yes, that's it.

2617
01:34:51,158 --> 01:34:52,626
(You shoot the cannon and score a goal.)

2618
01:34:52,627 --> 01:34:54,287
- Gosh, this is hard. - It could go in,

2619
01:34:54,288 --> 01:34:56,134
- but I don't think it'll stand. - Gosh, this is...

2620
01:34:56,158 --> 01:34:58,528
You come up with all sorts of games. Seriously.

2621
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,997
We need to know how it works.

2622
01:35:00,998 --> 01:35:02,718
(They practice to figure out how it works.)

2623
01:35:03,337 --> 01:35:04,437
Gosh, this is...

2624
01:35:07,977 --> 01:35:09,738
- It's hard to aim. Try it. - To aim?

2625
01:35:10,908 --> 01:35:12,547
Gosh, this isn't easy.

2626
01:35:15,217 --> 01:35:16,618
Oh, kind of like that?

2627
01:35:18,587 --> 01:35:20,046
(The cup went up a bit.)

2628
01:35:20,047 --> 01:35:22,386
- Shoot it lightly. - Indeed.

2629
01:35:22,387 --> 01:35:24,067
Oh, shooting it hard isn't the best thing.

2630
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:28,327
What? Oh, it has to go in.

2631
01:35:28,328 --> 01:35:30,427
It has to go in, so you can't shoot it too strong.

2632
01:35:30,557 --> 01:35:31,926
You can't shoot it too hard.

2633
01:35:31,927 --> 01:35:34,127
(It's only a success if the ball is in the cup.)

2634
01:35:34,297 --> 01:35:35,937
We just have to make it go in.

2635
01:35:36,467 --> 01:35:37,868
This is so creative.

2636
01:35:38,238 --> 01:35:40,837
There are cute animals on the paper cups too.

2637
01:35:42,708 --> 01:35:43,737
Gosh, this is...

2638
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:46,277
(Jae Suk can't even get it near the cup.)

2639
01:35:46,278 --> 01:35:47,677
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2640
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:50,278
- Good luck. - It's okay.

2641
01:35:51,748 --> 01:35:53,788
- Gosh, just a little... - Jae Suk. Are you okay?

2642
01:35:56,057 --> 01:35:57,158
Are you okay?

2643
01:35:57,587 --> 01:35:58,727
What do you mean, am I okay?

2644
01:35:59,988 --> 01:36:01,508
You mean, I'm doing really bad, right?

2645
01:36:02,927 --> 01:36:04,557
(Dae Myeung practices too.)

2646
01:36:06,998 --> 01:36:08,638
- Hey, you... - You can't shoot too hard.

2647
01:36:10,837 --> 01:36:12,408
(It slid right in!)

2648
01:36:12,807 --> 01:36:14,676
(Dae Myeung got the hang of it.)

2649
01:36:14,677 --> 01:36:16,157
Kind of like you're rolling the ball.

2650
01:36:16,538 --> 01:36:18,578
(As if you're rolling the ball!)

2651
01:36:21,818 --> 01:36:24,138
- I learned from watching you. - You can't shoot too hard.

2652
01:36:25,347 --> 01:36:27,918
- Yes, that's it. - Hey, you got it!

2653
01:36:28,257 --> 01:36:29,757
(Just now)

2654
01:36:32,158 --> 01:36:34,958
(All of them succeeded in a row!)

2655
01:36:35,297 --> 01:36:36,926
- Yes, that's right. - My gosh!

2656
01:36:36,927 --> 01:36:39,197
- Wasn't that Round Three? - This is how good we are.

2657
01:36:39,198 --> 01:36:40,568
Wasn't that Round Three?

2658
01:36:40,868 --> 01:36:42,596
We just have to get in the zone.

2659
01:36:42,597 --> 01:36:43,966
- That's it. I get it now. - That was amazing.

2660
01:36:43,967 --> 01:36:45,767
- We got it. - Let's go!

2661
01:36:45,967 --> 01:36:47,108
Then, right away,

2662
01:36:47,738 --> 01:36:49,376
let's go for our first try.

2663
01:36:49,377 --> 01:36:51,278
- Just 1 has to succeed, right? - Yes, just 1.

2664
01:36:51,608 --> 01:36:52,976
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

2665
01:36:52,977 --> 01:36:54,277
- Let's go! - Here we go!

2666
01:36:54,278 --> 01:36:55,278
Here we go.

2667
01:36:55,448 --> 01:36:56,676
- Dae Myeung, you go 1st. - Dae Myeung 1st?

2668
01:36:56,677 --> 01:36:58,288
- I'll go first. - Okay. Nice.

2669
01:36:58,448 --> 01:37:00,288
- I think he'll get it right away. - Oh, nice.

2670
01:37:00,918 --> 01:37:01,988
Yes, nice.

2671
01:37:05,458 --> 01:37:07,998
(As if you're rolling the ball)

2672
01:37:08,427 --> 01:37:11,467
(Remember. Think of it as rolling the ball.)

2673
01:37:14,998 --> 01:37:16,836
(Goal!)

2674
01:37:16,837 --> 01:37:18,368
- Success! - Success!

2675
01:37:21,267 --> 01:37:22,707
(They succeed in Round 1 with a single try!)

2676
01:37:22,708 --> 01:37:24,477
In one shot!

2677
01:37:24,608 --> 01:37:25,948
No way.

2678
01:37:26,547 --> 01:37:29,748
(They win the 300-dollar coffee gift card.)

2679
01:37:30,047 --> 01:37:32,546
- Yes! - Okay!

2680
01:37:32,547 --> 01:37:33,747
(The sharpshooter's perfect control of power)

2681
01:37:33,748 --> 01:37:35,118
How did you do that?

2682
01:37:35,318 --> 01:37:37,186
- He's the best. - He's our favorite, indeed.

2683
01:37:37,187 --> 01:37:38,686
- He's our favorite, indeed. - Hey, we've got this.

2684
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:39,847
I'm sure they were surprised.

2685
01:37:40,028 --> 01:37:41,828
Oh, we're good. Let's go.

2686
01:37:42,227 --> 01:37:43,427
We're all good. We did well.

2687
01:37:43,727 --> 01:37:45,097
Dae Myeung did a good job.

2688
01:37:45,297 --> 01:37:46,466
- It's a success. - He did well.

2689
01:37:46,467 --> 01:37:48,597
So, Round Two.

2690
01:37:48,738 --> 01:37:50,667
- Round Two. Go? - Go.

2691
01:37:50,668 --> 01:37:52,636
We really have to focus. We did the same thing earlier.

2692
01:37:52,637 --> 01:37:53,907
Honestly, it would be weird not to go for it at this point.

2693
01:37:53,908 --> 01:37:57,207
- But at 1st... - At 1st, we got through Round 1,

2694
01:37:57,208 --> 01:37:58,748
and we got the other ten tries wrong.

2695
01:37:59,108 --> 01:38:00,447
You never know.

2696
01:38:00,448 --> 01:38:02,818
(Di Dong Myeong gets nervous.)

2697
01:38:03,248 --> 01:38:05,148
(What is the prize for Round 2?)

2698
01:38:05,418 --> 01:38:07,546
"On mornings when you're tired from a lack of sleep,"

2699
01:38:07,547 --> 01:38:09,186
"this will reduce your time getting ready."

2700
01:38:09,187 --> 01:38:11,957
"Three sets of Braun Electric Shavers."

2701
01:38:11,958 --> 01:38:13,158
Electric shavers.

2702
01:38:13,757 --> 01:38:14,927
Electric shavers.

2703
01:38:15,297 --> 01:38:16,974
- These are very expensive. - They're perfect for them.

2704
01:38:16,998 --> 01:38:18,197
They're very expensive.

2705
01:38:18,198 --> 01:38:20,278
- I was going to buy that. - If we get this right...

2706
01:38:20,328 --> 01:38:22,168
I need it too. I have to shave twice a day.

2707
01:38:23,538 --> 01:38:24,836
(Round 2)

2708
01:38:24,837 --> 01:38:27,238
(The cup gets longer.)

2709
01:38:27,837 --> 01:38:29,708
- It gets longer? - The cup?

2710
01:38:31,408 --> 01:38:33,007
It must be harder to stand.

2711
01:38:33,148 --> 01:38:35,777
Then we'd have to shoot harder.

2712
01:38:35,778 --> 01:38:37,017
A little harder, right?

2713
01:38:37,118 --> 01:38:39,748
- We'd have to shoot a little... - Harder, right?

2714
01:38:40,047 --> 01:38:41,216
Is it just 1 out of 3...

2715
01:38:41,217 --> 01:38:42,586
- that has to succeed too? - Yes.

2716
01:38:42,587 --> 01:38:43,788
Oh, then...

2717
01:38:44,118 --> 01:38:45,278
- Jong Min, practice. - Okay.

2718
01:38:51,797 --> 01:38:54,027
(The cup didn't stand.)

2719
01:38:54,028 --> 01:38:55,698
- It doesn't stand. - It's too...

2720
01:38:56,437 --> 01:38:57,667
It's totally different from earlier.

2721
01:38:57,668 --> 01:38:59,007
It's different from the last one.

2722
01:39:00,408 --> 01:39:02,208
(Shouting)

2723
01:39:02,337 --> 01:39:04,847
I mean... That wasn't even close.

2724
01:39:06,377 --> 01:39:07,647
Let's just pretend that it was.

2725
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,094
(They catch him being overly dramatic.)

2726
01:39:09,118 --> 01:39:10,518
Okay. You have to put a spin on it.

2727
01:39:11,648 --> 01:39:13,688
There has to be a backspin when it goes in the cup.

2728
01:39:14,318 --> 01:39:15,917
How do you control that?

2729
01:39:15,918 --> 01:39:17,078
(Stating his opinion quietly)

2730
01:39:17,658 --> 01:39:19,288
(Practicing the backspin)

2731
01:39:23,898 --> 01:39:24,967
(The ball is spinning?)

2732
01:39:25,398 --> 01:39:26,498
- Did you succeed? - Yes.

2733
01:39:26,668 --> 01:39:28,597
- What? - Well, you know...

2734
01:39:28,637 --> 01:39:29,797
I went like this.

2735
01:39:33,568 --> 01:39:35,238
(He succeeds twice in a row.)

2736
01:39:35,278 --> 01:39:36,407
All right.

2737
01:39:36,408 --> 01:39:37,577
(The backspin strategy is working!)

2738
01:39:37,578 --> 01:39:38,708
Round Two.

2739
01:39:39,347 --> 01:39:41,347
Let's begin our second try.

2740
01:39:41,918 --> 01:39:43,618
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2741
01:39:43,717 --> 01:39:44,886
- Jong Min first. - Let's go.

2742
01:39:44,887 --> 01:39:46,117
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2743
01:39:46,118 --> 01:39:47,617
- Are we going for it? - Hey, you're our ace.

2744
01:39:47,618 --> 01:39:48,918
You should go first. Okay.

2745
01:39:49,187 --> 01:39:50,516
- Are we each trying it once? - Yes.

2746
01:39:50,517 --> 01:39:51,587
(Jae Suk tries first.)

2747
01:39:55,528 --> 01:39:57,158
(Jae Suk fails.)

2748
01:39:57,528 --> 01:39:59,467
Okay, well... I knew you'd fail.

2749
01:40:01,198 --> 01:40:02,437
- I expected it. - I mean...

2750
01:40:02,868 --> 01:40:04,237
- I expected it. - All right.

2751
01:40:04,238 --> 01:40:06,506
(The second try: Jae Suk, fail)

2752
01:40:06,507 --> 01:40:07,507
(Next, it's the sharpshooter.)

2753
01:40:07,508 --> 01:40:09,778
- Oh, nice. - It'd be great if you scored again.

2754
01:40:15,418 --> 01:40:17,317
(He got the cup to stand, but the ball went out.)

2755
01:40:17,318 --> 01:40:18,747
(The second try: Jae Suk, fail, Dae Myeung, fail)

2756
01:40:18,748 --> 01:40:19,886
- All right. - Okay, it's me.

2757
01:40:19,887 --> 01:40:22,217
- Jong Min, just like earlier. - Just like that.

2758
01:40:22,587 --> 01:40:23,587
Okay.

2759
01:40:23,588 --> 01:40:25,628
There has to be a backspin when it goes in the cup.

2760
01:40:25,958 --> 01:40:27,157
You can do it.

2761
01:40:27,158 --> 01:40:28,328
(We believe in the backspin.)

2762
01:40:32,427 --> 01:40:34,226
(The ball was too weak.)

2763
01:40:34,227 --> 01:40:35,567
- You went too forward. - Did I?

2764
01:40:35,568 --> 01:40:37,697
He went too forward. How about he moves back a bit?

2765
01:40:37,698 --> 01:40:38,807
But you already played.

2766
01:40:38,967 --> 01:40:40,136
No, but he should come back...

2767
01:40:40,137 --> 01:40:41,877
Then I'll go even farther up now.

2768
01:40:44,538 --> 01:40:47,408
- Well, then... - But this is bad.

2769
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:49,347
Gosh, this is hard.

2770
01:40:49,948 --> 01:40:52,618
Hey, this is harder than I thought.

2771
01:40:52,717 --> 01:40:54,247
Round Two is definitely harder.

2772
01:40:54,248 --> 01:40:56,517
- It is harder. - Round Two is harder.

2773
01:40:56,658 --> 01:40:59,157
You used up all of the dice chances, right?

2774
01:40:59,158 --> 01:41:00,187
Right.

2775
01:41:01,057 --> 01:41:02,757
Oh, you know our show very well.

2776
01:41:03,597 --> 01:41:05,997
We used the bonus round, but we lost it ridiculously.

2777
01:41:05,998 --> 01:41:07,497
Would you like to try?

2778
01:41:07,498 --> 01:41:09,436
- Just for practice. - You can try.

2779
01:41:09,437 --> 01:41:12,336
Because you have to know how hard this is to...

2780
01:41:12,337 --> 01:41:14,217
- Even if we fail, you can... - Just to try it.

2781
01:41:14,337 --> 01:41:16,676
You want us to know how hard it is so we don't resent you?

2782
01:41:16,677 --> 01:41:18,317
(He knows exactly what they're thinking.)

2783
01:41:18,408 --> 01:41:20,328
- Let's bet on tomorrow's coffee. - Try it once.

2784
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:22,017
It's really hard.

2785
01:41:24,547 --> 01:41:26,086
(He succeeds right away.)

2786
01:41:26,087 --> 01:41:27,087
Oh, my.

2787
01:41:27,887 --> 01:41:30,858
(Oh, my?)

2788
01:41:31,158 --> 01:41:32,328
It's pretty easy.

2789
01:41:32,828 --> 01:41:34,587
You did so well.

2790
01:41:35,057 --> 01:41:36,227
How did you do that?

2791
01:41:36,898 --> 01:41:38,627
How did he do that on his first try?

2792
01:41:38,767 --> 01:41:40,668
- Oh, this is fun. - It's fun.

2793
01:41:40,727 --> 01:41:41,766
- Anyway, at first... - It's fun, isn't it?

2794
01:41:41,767 --> 01:41:42,847
- Yes. - It's a lot of fun.

2795
01:41:42,937 --> 01:41:44,936
- With prizes on the line... - Hey, this is...

2796
01:41:44,937 --> 01:41:46,467
- It would be fun. - Yes, it's fun.

2797
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:48,537
After they leave, let's play this too.

2798
01:41:48,538 --> 01:41:49,578
Okay.

2799
01:41:50,278 --> 01:41:52,077
- All right. - We still have lots of tries.

2800
01:41:52,078 --> 01:41:54,307
- We have lots of tries left. - Yes.

2801
01:41:54,448 --> 01:41:56,077
- Dae Myeung, let's go. - Let's go.

2802
01:41:56,078 --> 01:41:57,078
All right.

2803
01:41:57,079 --> 01:41:58,386
- Then will you try first? - Yes, Jae Suk.

2804
01:41:58,387 --> 01:42:00,118
The third try.

2805
01:42:00,318 --> 01:42:02,318
- We have to give them the shavers. - The shavers.

2806
01:42:06,587 --> 01:42:07,657
That was close.

2807
01:42:07,658 --> 01:42:08,756
(The ball bounced off the edge.)

2808
01:42:08,757 --> 01:42:11,197
- All right. We're almost there. - It'll work.

2809
01:42:11,198 --> 01:42:12,898
(The third try: Jae Suk, fail)

2810
01:42:14,398 --> 01:42:15,698
Darn it!

2811
01:42:15,967 --> 01:42:16,998
Here I go.

2812
01:42:17,597 --> 01:42:18,637
You can do it.

2813
01:42:21,038 --> 01:42:23,136
- It was too weak. - You have to hit it harder.

2814
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,176
- It was weak. - I should've had more confidence.

2815
01:42:24,177 --> 01:42:25,407
- You should've. - I thought it might bounce out.

2816
01:42:25,408 --> 01:42:26,677
I thought it might bounce out.

2817
01:42:27,977 --> 01:42:30,477
(The only one remaining is the sharpshooter.)

2818
01:42:35,818 --> 01:42:37,556
- That was too strong. - Darn it.

2819
01:42:37,557 --> 01:42:39,087
(He was close, but he failed.)

2820
01:42:39,587 --> 01:42:40,727
Darn it!

2821
01:42:40,958 --> 01:42:42,657
It just had to go inside.

2822
01:42:42,658 --> 01:42:43,997
(They fail on the third try.)

2823
01:42:43,998 --> 01:42:45,626
- It's fine. Relax. - We believe in you.

2824
01:42:45,627 --> 01:42:46,667
Yes, really.

2825
01:42:46,668 --> 01:42:48,368
I can't tell what the proper strength is.

2826
01:42:49,767 --> 01:42:51,167
- Jae Suk! - That was practice.

2827
01:42:51,168 --> 01:42:52,306
You got what it feels like, right?

2828
01:42:52,307 --> 01:42:53,537
(It was for practice, but their success rate keeps going up.)

2829
01:42:53,538 --> 01:42:54,907
- There. - Should we go for it right away?

2830
01:42:54,908 --> 01:42:56,836
- Just like what you just did? - All right. Let's go for it.

2831
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:58,684
- Just like what you did. - This is our fourth try.

2832
01:42:58,708 --> 01:43:00,188
- Right away. Let's go. - Right away.

2833
01:43:00,377 --> 01:43:01,847
- The fourth try. - You can do it.

2834
01:43:02,418 --> 01:43:04,448
(He just has to do what he did during practice.)

2835
01:43:07,818 --> 01:43:09,617
- Darn it! - Oh, that was close.

2836
01:43:09,618 --> 01:43:10,687
(He hit the edge again!)

2837
01:43:11,318 --> 01:43:13,586
(In the end, )

2838
01:43:13,587 --> 01:43:16,127
(they blow the fourth try too.)

2839
01:43:16,597 --> 01:43:17,726
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

2840
01:43:17,727 --> 01:43:19,997
(They fail the fifth try too.)

2841
01:43:19,998 --> 01:43:20,998
I'm out of breath.

2842
01:43:21,597 --> 01:43:23,698
(The table tennis ball is playing hard to get.)

2843
01:43:24,597 --> 01:43:27,107
(They fail the sixth try.)

2844
01:43:27,108 --> 01:43:28,238
I can't breathe.

2845
01:43:30,507 --> 01:43:31,948
Why am I doing this all of a sudden?

2846
01:43:33,377 --> 01:43:35,176
(They lose their senses whenever they go for it.)

2847
01:43:35,177 --> 01:43:36,618
This is so frustrating.

2848
01:43:37,318 --> 01:43:40,686
(They fail the seventh try too.)

2849
01:43:40,687 --> 01:43:44,217
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2850
01:43:45,257 --> 01:43:46,626
- It bounced off. - Now, we have...

2851
01:43:46,627 --> 01:43:48,347
- two tries left. - We have two tries left.

2852
01:43:49,958 --> 01:43:52,126
- It must be so hard. - Right.

2853
01:43:52,127 --> 01:43:53,773
(The 3 are at a loss for words from the 7 consecutive failures.)

2854
01:43:53,797 --> 01:43:55,837
- Gosh, we can't do this. - We're becoming solemn.

2855
01:43:56,068 --> 01:43:58,568
- We can't go home like this. - Gosh, this is...

2856
01:43:58,837 --> 01:44:00,767
I don't want to go home feeling bad like this.

2857
01:44:00,967 --> 01:44:03,636
I think these games are so annoying.

2858
01:44:03,637 --> 01:44:04,936
- No, but this is... - It seems...

2859
01:44:04,937 --> 01:44:06,617
- It's so close but out of reach. - Right.

2860
01:44:06,877 --> 01:44:08,517
Hang on. Let me practice once.

2861
01:44:13,418 --> 01:44:15,857
- Gosh, that must be too hard too. - Yes, the strength is...

2862
01:44:15,858 --> 01:44:18,357
(They must find the right power.)

2863
01:44:18,358 --> 01:44:19,726
- Darn it. - Oh, no.

2864
01:44:19,727 --> 01:44:21,056
(To help their never-ending practice, )

2865
01:44:21,057 --> 01:44:25,168
(they pick up the balls.)

2866
01:44:25,528 --> 01:44:27,967
Okay, let's try this...

2867
01:44:28,368 --> 01:44:30,097
- I really want to succeed. - Seriously.

2868
01:44:31,168 --> 01:44:32,407
(The ball keeps bouncing off.)

2869
01:44:32,408 --> 01:44:34,048
- It'll work. - I really want to succeed.

2870
01:44:34,408 --> 01:44:35,708
They're getting there.

2871
01:44:36,738 --> 01:44:38,778
- Hey, I got it. - You got it?

2872
01:44:39,778 --> 01:44:42,217
Jong Min, lift it slightly...

2873
01:44:42,578 --> 01:44:44,216
and let it go in on a bounce.

2874
01:44:44,217 --> 01:44:45,217
On a bounce?

2875
01:44:45,218 --> 01:44:47,988
(The strategy is to let the ball bounce once and become weaker.)

2876
01:44:52,057 --> 01:44:53,487
(The strategy worked!)

2877
01:44:53,488 --> 01:44:54,957
- It worked. - I got the hang of it.

2878
01:44:54,958 --> 01:44:56,598
- Let's go for it. - The slight bounce...

2879
01:44:56,828 --> 01:44:58,727
- Right away. - Okay. Let's go for it now.

2880
01:44:59,097 --> 01:45:00,398
Starting with Dae Myeung.

2881
01:45:00,568 --> 01:45:01,767
The ninth try.

2882
01:45:02,297 --> 01:45:03,398
The ninth try.

2883
01:45:03,767 --> 01:45:05,136
Let's go for it.

2884
01:45:05,137 --> 01:45:06,408
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

2885
01:45:06,668 --> 01:45:08,436
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2886
01:45:08,437 --> 01:45:09,907
(We will succeed on the ninth try!)

2887
01:45:09,908 --> 01:45:11,208
- We can do it. - Here we go.

2888
01:45:21,618 --> 01:45:24,288
(The video isn't paused.)

2889
01:45:26,627 --> 01:45:28,287
(He got the cup to stand up but the ball bounced out again.)

2890
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:29,297
I'm out of breath.

2891
01:45:30,998 --> 01:45:32,828
You almost held it for a minute.

2892
01:45:33,927 --> 01:45:35,443
- I thought I might stop breathing. - Seriously...

2893
01:45:35,467 --> 01:45:36,636
You almost ran out of breath...

2894
01:45:36,637 --> 01:45:38,937
- So... I am dizzy. - Aren't you dizzy?

2895
01:45:40,168 --> 01:45:41,708
We were holding our breath too.

2896
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:44,937
- I'm dizzy. - You took a long time to shoot.

2897
01:45:45,377 --> 01:45:46,577
I did get a feel for it.

2898
01:45:46,578 --> 01:45:47,747
- Do you want to go first? - Okay.

2899
01:45:47,748 --> 01:45:48,777
(Next is Jae Suk, not Jong Min who got a feel for it.)

2900
01:45:48,778 --> 01:45:50,017
Since you're the ace...

2901
01:45:53,087 --> 01:45:55,487
(Bounce and goal)

2902
01:45:55,488 --> 01:45:56,687
You can do it.

2903
01:45:56,958 --> 01:45:58,458
Like this.

2904
01:45:59,387 --> 01:46:00,658
Let's end it with this.

2905
01:46:02,858 --> 01:46:04,097
(It bounces on the table...)

2906
01:46:04,797 --> 01:46:05,868
Darn it.

2907
01:46:07,097 --> 01:46:08,198
Darn it.

2908
01:46:08,538 --> 01:46:09,568
My gosh.

2909
01:46:10,668 --> 01:46:12,007
Jae Suk, you're seriously bad.

2910
01:46:13,168 --> 01:46:15,377
I mean, you're not even...

2911
01:46:15,837 --> 01:46:17,278
What's seriously bad?

2912
01:46:19,708 --> 01:46:21,648
- It went too low and bounced. - Yes.

2913
01:46:21,847 --> 01:46:23,017
You hit the table.

2914
01:46:23,148 --> 01:46:24,477
Please!

2915
01:46:24,677 --> 01:46:26,077
- This is my wish. - You can do it!

2916
01:46:26,517 --> 01:46:28,618
- Let's go. - Let's go!

2917
01:46:29,618 --> 01:46:31,958
(Jong Min succeeded with the bounce.)

2918
01:46:33,727 --> 01:46:35,756
(It hit the table...)

2919
01:46:35,757 --> 01:46:37,057
(and went into the cup.)

2920
01:46:38,028 --> 01:46:41,144
(Will they finally succeed this time?)

2921
01:46:44,569 --> 01:46:46,209
Oh, I controlled my strength pretty well.

2922
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:47,409
That was so close.

2923
01:46:47,539 --> 01:46:48,938
It goes in but comes back out.

2924
01:46:48,939 --> 01:46:50,310
I know. Gosh, this is hard.

2925
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:54,679
- Gosh, this is frustrating. - Oh, my goodness.

2926
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:57,179
- Gosh, this is frustrating. - I'm getting heated up.

2927
01:46:57,180 --> 01:46:58,248
(His face is getting warm from feeling frustrated.)

2928
01:46:58,249 --> 01:46:59,520
It's burning up.

2929
01:47:01,249 --> 01:47:02,896
- My gosh. - This is the final, tenth try.

2930
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,090
It's our last try again.

2931
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:05,819
Gosh, hang on.

2932
01:47:07,829 --> 01:47:09,090
I should practice more.

2933
01:47:11,199 --> 01:47:12,930
I want to do this, no matter what it takes.

2934
01:47:13,329 --> 01:47:14,930
Please, just once.

2935
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:18,169
(We can't let it end like this.)

2936
01:47:18,170 --> 01:47:19,499
I'm seriously going crazy.

2937
01:47:20,340 --> 01:47:21,640
This is driving me crazy.

2938
01:47:22,569 --> 01:47:24,538
Oh, I can't let it bounce like that.

2939
01:47:24,539 --> 01:47:27,078
(The ball won't move as they wish.)

2940
01:47:27,079 --> 01:47:30,680
(Their hearts are burning up.)

2941
01:47:31,449 --> 01:47:33,519
(Practice, )

2942
01:47:33,520 --> 01:47:35,549
(and more practice)

2943
01:47:35,550 --> 01:47:36,648
That's too strong.

2944
01:47:36,649 --> 01:47:39,159
I don't know when it might go in, but please, just once...

2945
01:47:41,460 --> 01:47:42,858
- Hey! - Jae Suk!

2946
01:47:42,859 --> 01:47:45,028
- How is it? Did you find it? - Shall we go for it?

2947
01:47:45,029 --> 01:47:46,999
(Did he get the hang of it?)

2948
01:47:48,029 --> 01:47:50,099
(Then, Dae Myeung also succeeds.)

2949
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,839
- We got it. - Right away...

2950
01:47:51,840 --> 01:47:53,399
- Let's go for it. - Let's go.

2951
01:47:53,670 --> 01:47:56,369
- Right away. - Okay, let's go for it right now.

2952
01:47:56,609 --> 01:47:58,279
We seriously practiced...

2953
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:00,179
We practiced for like 20 minutes just now.

2954
01:48:00,180 --> 01:48:01,479
(They practiced madly for about 20 minutes.)

2955
01:48:01,480 --> 01:48:02,579
The final...

2956
01:48:03,409 --> 01:48:04,920
We'll do our best.

2957
01:48:05,380 --> 01:48:07,448
- The tenth try. Here we go! - Here we go!

2958
01:48:07,449 --> 01:48:08,850
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2959
01:48:09,489 --> 01:48:10,989
Shall I go first?

2960
01:48:11,289 --> 01:48:12,358
- Yes, you should go first. - Jong Min.

2961
01:48:12,359 --> 01:48:13,595
- You're the best. - I'll end it with this one shot.

2962
01:48:13,619 --> 01:48:14,730
It was a pleasure.

2963
01:48:16,529 --> 01:48:18,528
Yes, it was a pleasure for me too. It was nice to meet you.

2964
01:48:18,529 --> 01:48:19,799
- Me too. - Suyu-ri, let's go.

2965
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:21,528
- Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

2966
01:48:21,529 --> 01:48:23,569
(Let's show them the miracle of Suyu-ri!)

2967
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:26,670
- You can do it. - I can do it.

2968
01:48:27,039 --> 01:48:28,369
All right. Here I go.

2969
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:36,409
(He fails after making the cup stand.)

2970
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:42,149
(Now, Jong Min is done, and there are only two players left.)

2971
01:48:43,489 --> 01:48:44,489
Here I go.

2972
01:48:45,159 --> 01:48:46,688
- I'll go first. - You can do it, Dae Myeung.

2973
01:48:46,689 --> 01:48:48,129
- Gosh, you just... - Do what you think is right.

2974
01:48:48,130 --> 01:48:49,329
Just do what you want to do.

2975
01:48:49,489 --> 01:48:51,460
Guys, it was a pleasure to join you today.

2976
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:54,829
Please.

2977
01:48:57,999 --> 01:48:59,399
(Shutting his eyes)

2978
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:05,879
(Even Dae Myeung fails.)

2979
01:49:05,880 --> 01:49:08,510
Last, it's Jae Suk. It's your turn to do it.

2980
01:49:11,180 --> 01:49:13,248
(The final savior, Jae Suk)

2981
01:49:13,249 --> 01:49:14,890
- I can use any cup, right? - Yes.

2982
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:17,118
Let's go, Jae Suk. This is our last chance.

2983
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:18,420
It's all up to you.

2984
01:49:20,390 --> 01:49:22,489
- This is... - A hero rises in turbulent times.

2985
01:49:24,130 --> 01:49:26,729
(They failed painfully 8 times in a row.)

2986
01:49:26,730 --> 01:49:30,529
(If a hero is to be born, now is the time.)

2987
01:49:39,909 --> 01:49:41,210
Darn it!

2988
01:49:43,350 --> 01:49:44,619
Darn it!

2989
01:49:47,590 --> 01:49:53,590
(They fail the final try as well.)

2990
01:49:56,560 --> 01:49:57,799
You worked hard.

2991
01:49:57,800 --> 01:49:59,760
(You worked hard.)

2992
01:50:04,029 --> 01:50:06,109
I think we could get it if we had five more chances.

2993
01:50:06,239 --> 01:50:07,239
Seriously.

2994
01:50:07,240 --> 01:50:09,408
(They can't let it go easily.)

2995
01:50:09,409 --> 01:50:10,409
Just five more tries...

2996
01:50:12,239 --> 01:50:14,719
I think I could do it in five more tries. I got a feel for it.

2997
01:50:15,380 --> 01:50:17,148
(What?)

2998
01:50:17,149 --> 01:50:19,319
- Nine tries... - Why is it working now?

2999
01:50:20,579 --> 01:50:23,189
I have to pull on it just a bit and hit it lightly.

3000
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:25,110
I only figured it out on the tenth try.

3001
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:30,999
Hey, how could you figure that out after the game is over?

3002
01:50:32,159 --> 01:50:34,329
- It's so... - Gosh, what do we do?

3003
01:50:35,230 --> 01:50:36,868
Pull it a little and hit it lightly.

3004
01:50:36,869 --> 01:50:37,998
(It's such a shame that they failed.)

3005
01:50:37,999 --> 01:50:39,170
Gosh, for Round One...

3006
01:50:40,869 --> 01:50:42,509
You should hang it on the wall...

3007
01:50:42,510 --> 01:50:45,010
- and remember us when you see it. - You can resent us.

3008
01:50:46,239 --> 01:50:47,550
- Thank you. - We're sorry.

3009
01:50:47,779 --> 01:50:50,948
I was able to make great memories with my juniors...

3010
01:50:50,949 --> 01:50:53,819
who worked hard with me for the past year.

3011
01:50:54,649 --> 01:50:55,890
I'll buy you coffee.

3012
01:50:56,850 --> 01:50:57,988
Whenever possible,

3013
01:50:57,989 --> 01:51:00,536
- let's take care of our health! - Let's take care of our health!

3014
01:51:00,560 --> 01:51:02,590
- Dae Myeung, you worked hard. - No.

3015
01:51:03,329 --> 01:51:04,329
It would've been nice...

3016
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:05,698
- to succeed at the end. - I know.

3017
01:51:05,699 --> 01:51:07,429
(It feels a bit sad, but we filled our spare time well.)

3018
01:51:07,430 --> 01:51:09,270
Gosh, I didn't know this show was so tough.

3019
01:51:10,569 --> 01:51:11,600
My goodness.

3020
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:15,220
(It's easy to control a friend who has a big build.)

3021
01:51:15,340 --> 01:51:17,640
(Today's Whenever Friend is uncontrollable?)

3022
01:51:18,010 --> 01:51:20,038
(The exhausting friend, Cha Tae Hyun)

3023
01:51:20,039 --> 01:51:21,799
(The friend with a big build, Kim Jong Kook)

3024
01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:23,549
(Jong Kook usually doesn't do this, )

3025
01:51:23,550 --> 01:51:25,255
(but he finds this guy to be too much to handle.)

3026
01:51:25,279 --> 01:51:26,549
(Is your upper body just for show?)

3027
01:51:26,550 --> 01:51:27,990
(This insult is too much to handle.)

3028
01:51:28,050 --> 01:51:29,688
(This attack with facts is too much to handle.)

3029
01:51:29,689 --> 01:51:31,036
(You don't have to meet someone who hasn't been married before.)

3030
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,118
(Too much to handle)

3031
01:51:32,119 --> 01:51:33,720
(I'll deal with it myself.)

3032
01:51:33,920 --> 01:51:35,729
(They're not fighting.)

3033
01:51:35,730 --> 01:51:36,889
(It's a show of affection.)

3034
01:51:36,890 --> 01:51:39,129
(Buying coffee)

3035
01:51:39,130 --> 01:51:40,899
(A tumbler, This one too.)

3036
01:51:40,999 --> 01:51:42,869
(Making him spend money)

3037
01:51:43,199 --> 01:51:45,140
(Please give him hard questions.)

3038
01:51:45,470 --> 01:51:47,368
(We're on the same team. Why ask for hard questions?)

3039
01:51:47,369 --> 01:51:49,609
(Teasing his own teammate)

3040
01:51:49,810 --> 01:51:51,810
(But why did I come with him?)

3041
01:51:52,439 --> 01:51:54,108
(They have perfect chemistry...)

3042
01:51:54,109 --> 01:51:56,710
(when they're complaining.)

3043
01:51:57,720 --> 01:51:58,956
(Just think that you're here to have fun, Tae Hyun.)

3044
01:51:58,980 --> 01:52:00,779
(Jong Kook, this is nothing.)

3045
01:52:00,989 --> 01:52:02,318
(They have perfect chemistry...)

3046
01:52:02,319 --> 01:52:03,889
(when they're doing badly too.)

3047
01:52:03,890 --> 01:52:05,489
(You two are the problem right now!)

3048
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:07,689
(Tired)

3049
01:52:08,460 --> 01:52:10,288
(A loud and tiring day...)

3050
01:52:10,289 --> 01:52:12,659
(with best friends)

3051
01:52:13,329 --> 01:52:16,340
(Whenever Possible)
