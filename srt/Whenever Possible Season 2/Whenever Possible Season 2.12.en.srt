1
00:00:06,733 --> 00:00:08,171
(Today's spare time, Mok-dong)

2
00:00:08,172 --> 00:00:11,573
We have a friend who will drain us today.

3
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:14,712
- I feel at ease. - Really?

4
00:00:14,713 --> 00:00:16,472
It's my body that'll feel uncomfortable.

5
00:00:17,213 --> 00:00:19,513
But I feel emotionally at ease with them coming.

6
00:00:19,882 --> 00:00:21,483
Actually,

7
00:00:23,112 --> 00:00:25,423
the bigger guy is rather easier to control.

8
00:00:26,553 --> 00:00:28,721
But the other friend is very tiresome.

9
00:00:28,722 --> 00:00:31,193
I actually find him more comfortable.

10
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:34,633
He handles you when I stay still.

11
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:37,603
It'll get exhausting with him here.

12
00:00:38,302 --> 00:00:40,533
To think it's the final episode of the season.

13
00:00:40,773 --> 00:00:43,402
- Gosh, time really flies. - Goodness.

14
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:46,472
- For real. It's already... - Time really flies.

15
00:00:47,002 --> 00:00:50,042
By the way, why have we gathered so early in the morning?

16
00:00:50,542 --> 00:00:54,012
It's because of the Whenever Guest, right?

17
00:00:54,082 --> 00:00:55,682
Our time adjusts according to theirs.

18
00:00:55,813 --> 00:00:57,333
You talked behind my back, didn't you?

19
00:00:59,052 --> 00:01:00,383
I didn't.

20
00:01:01,192 --> 00:01:04,222
You would've talked behind my back for the early shoot, right?

21
00:01:04,562 --> 00:01:06,362
- "Because of Jae Suk..." - Well...

22
00:01:06,363 --> 00:01:08,061
- No. - Really, you...

23
00:01:08,062 --> 00:01:10,662
That's not true. Our Whenever Friends today...

24
00:01:10,663 --> 00:01:14,332
- They're morning people. - are morning people.

25
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,672
Aren't they?

26
00:01:15,833 --> 00:01:17,842
What you want to truly say...

27
00:01:18,003 --> 00:01:20,442
is that the Whenever Friends are quite old, right?

28
00:01:20,443 --> 00:01:21,641
(Setting the shoot schedule to the old friends?)

29
00:01:21,642 --> 00:01:24,281
Their eyes would open automatically at 6am.

30
00:01:24,282 --> 00:01:25,883
Yes.

31
00:01:26,012 --> 00:01:28,682
- Didn't we find the nicer word, - Yes.

32
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,652
"slow focusing?"

33
00:01:31,053 --> 00:01:32,552
- "Slow get up." - Yes, slow...

34
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:33,752
(While recalling the ending season...)

35
00:01:33,753 --> 00:01:35,322
Let's do this!

36
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:36,353
This is...

37
00:01:36,523 --> 00:01:38,163
- Is this the place? - Is it?

38
00:01:38,693 --> 00:01:40,531
(Singing)

39
00:01:40,532 --> 00:01:42,232
It's a coffee shop.

40
00:01:42,663 --> 00:01:44,561
(The two old guys enter with a folksy reaction.)

41
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,663
- About two days. - They're here.

42
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,573
Goodness.

43
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,802
- Hey. - Hi, Kim Thug.

44
00:01:50,803 --> 00:01:52,072
Here you are.

45
00:01:52,073 --> 00:01:53,443
Okay!

46
00:01:54,113 --> 00:01:56,311
- Hey. - Okay!

47
00:01:56,312 --> 00:01:57,312
Hi.

48
00:01:57,982 --> 00:02:00,951
(Today's Whenever Friends, Cha Tae Hyun and Kim Jong Kook)

49
00:02:00,952 --> 00:02:03,112
- Come over here. - This way.

50
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,281
Yes.

51
00:02:04,282 --> 00:02:05,921
(Coming out to greet him)

52
00:02:05,922 --> 00:02:09,021
The number you have dialed does not exist.

53
00:02:09,022 --> 00:02:10,291
(The experienced Whenever Friend is relaxed.)

54
00:02:10,292 --> 00:02:12,991
- Okay. Coffee. - Jong Kook.

55
00:02:12,992 --> 00:02:14,491
- Good. - Nice.

56
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:15,861
- Gosh. - Okay.

57
00:02:15,862 --> 00:02:18,563
Why have you dressed up, unlike in "Running Man?"

58
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:22,201
I'm on this show as a guest.

59
00:02:22,202 --> 00:02:23,671
- Jong Kook. - It's different.

60
00:02:23,672 --> 00:02:25,102
- You even got your hair done. - I'll do it.

61
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,142
Of course.

62
00:02:26,573 --> 00:02:27,612
Where do we sit?

63
00:02:28,112 --> 00:02:29,942
Where do we sit?

64
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:31,241
We're guests. Where do we sit?

65
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:32,782
- Where do I sit? - Over there.

66
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:33,982
(Complaint resolved)

67
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:36,882
(Happy)

68
00:02:36,883 --> 00:02:38,481
- Jong Kook. You got your hair done. - I...

69
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:40,081
I'm on a different show.

70
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:41,592
I couldn't come here like a mess.

71
00:02:41,593 --> 00:02:43,223
- You've got manners. - Of course.

72
00:02:43,792 --> 00:02:45,222
- "Running Man" is different. - These pants...

73
00:02:45,223 --> 00:02:46,223
Goodness.

74
00:02:46,224 --> 00:02:48,331
The energy is different from the very beginning.

75
00:02:48,332 --> 00:02:49,361
Exactly.

76
00:02:49,362 --> 00:02:51,761
- Bread! - Goodness.

77
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,301
- We even got bread. - Thank you.

78
00:02:53,302 --> 00:02:56,202
We're going to have sugar spikes first thing in the morning.

79
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,302
- With bread, you know? - Come on.

80
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,583
Must you spoil the mood? I was about to take a bite.

81
00:03:01,742 --> 00:03:02,873
Okay.

82
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,211
- Jong Kook. This is yours. - Did you have breakfast?

83
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:06,611
- I did. - It's egg mayonnaise.

84
00:03:06,612 --> 00:03:09,581
I'm happy with eggs. It's eggs on salt bread.

85
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,352
- Aren't you fine with this one? - Yes.

86
00:03:11,353 --> 00:03:13,152
- He doesn't eat salt. - No, I do.

87
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:15,392
A moderate amount of salt helps pump up the body.

88
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,192
The body needs salt.

89
00:03:17,193 --> 00:03:18,861
It's for your morning pump.

90
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:20,563
- Yes. - Goodness.

91
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:22,391
- Salt is a must. - How tiring.

92
00:03:22,392 --> 00:03:25,062
- It's good. - Sodium isn't bad for you.

93
00:03:25,063 --> 00:03:28,272
- In your daily life... - Just eat it!

94
00:03:28,373 --> 00:03:30,032
- If... - Put it in your mouth!

95
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,403
- If you rarely work out... - Just put it in your mouth!

96
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:35,842
- If you rarely work out daily, - Dig in.

97
00:03:35,843 --> 00:03:38,011
You need to cut down.

98
00:03:38,012 --> 00:03:40,541
- For those who work out regularly, - Gosh.

99
00:03:40,542 --> 00:03:43,182
A moderate amount of salt helps pump up the body.

100
00:03:43,183 --> 00:03:44,822
- It's good. - Goodness.

101
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,822
But why did I come with him?

102
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:48,152
- What? - Why together?

103
00:03:48,153 --> 00:03:49,951
The episode with you...

104
00:03:49,952 --> 00:03:51,562
- as a guest was a hit. - Yes.

105
00:03:51,563 --> 00:03:53,592
But inviting you alone again would be awkward.

106
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:54,663
Bingo.

107
00:03:54,792 --> 00:03:56,491
That's why I was invited too.

108
00:03:56,492 --> 00:03:58,201
- I had... - Goodness.

109
00:03:58,202 --> 00:03:59,933
I had another suspicion.

110
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:03,003
- I'm worn out. - The shoot is early in the morning.

111
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:05,372
So I thought a Whenever Friend canceled last minute.

112
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:06,502
(A no-show by the Whenever Friend)

113
00:04:06,503 --> 00:04:08,541
The guest didn't want to come here...

114
00:04:08,542 --> 00:04:09,912
- We had this conversation. - this morning.

115
00:04:09,913 --> 00:04:11,081
Jae Suk and I had the same conversation.

116
00:04:11,082 --> 00:04:12,342
Why are we gathering so early in the morning?

117
00:04:12,343 --> 00:04:14,981
If you use one of your members carelessly, in the future...

118
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:16,212
That's not it.

119
00:04:16,553 --> 00:04:17,622
Don't use your members so carelessly.

120
00:04:17,623 --> 00:04:19,252
- Today's Whenever Guest... - Yes?

121
00:04:19,253 --> 00:04:21,591
- has time early in the day. - Is that so?

122
00:04:21,592 --> 00:04:23,293
That's none of my business.

123
00:04:23,892 --> 00:04:25,362
That's none of my business, is it?

124
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:26,891
The Whenever Guest had an early spare time,

125
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,692
but there weren't celebrities who could come early.

126
00:04:29,693 --> 00:04:31,213
- That's none of my business. - You...

127
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:34,002
How could they wake up this early in the morning?

128
00:04:34,003 --> 00:04:35,632
That little...

129
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:36,672
(The infuriating duo)

130
00:04:36,673 --> 00:04:37,743
How annoying.

131
00:04:39,202 --> 00:04:41,873
I went to bed not long ago after playing soccer.

132
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,983
I woke up after a few hours and came here.

133
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:46,542
It's like I never slept.

134
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:47,552
Yesterday was Thursday,

135
00:04:47,553 --> 00:04:49,113
- so you played soccer. - I did.

136
00:04:49,253 --> 00:04:52,123
- Did everyone attend yesterday? - Jonathan didn't come again.

137
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:54,692
- Why do you keep bullying Jonathan? - Don't...

138
00:04:54,693 --> 00:04:55,822
- be mean. - He...

139
00:04:55,823 --> 00:04:58,293
promised to come but didn't show up.

140
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,232
As the one running a soccer club, such things...

141
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:04,701
- Yes. The numbers have been set. - Exactly.

142
00:05:04,702 --> 00:05:06,761
- Thinking you can be absent... - How many came yesterday?

143
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:08,101
Many came yesterday.

144
00:05:08,102 --> 00:05:09,972
What's the problem then?

145
00:05:10,202 --> 00:05:12,341
One member not showing up isn't a big deal.

146
00:05:12,342 --> 00:05:13,802
Isn't it cold to play right now?

147
00:05:13,803 --> 00:05:14,971
It was cold yesterday.

148
00:05:14,972 --> 00:05:16,772
- So... - But you get hot as you run.

149
00:05:16,873 --> 00:05:19,043
Yeon Seok. He doesn't have much time left.

150
00:05:20,012 --> 00:05:22,253
- Do you mean his cartilage? - He'll have to quit soon.

151
00:05:22,512 --> 00:05:25,112
- He won't be able to run one day. - "Do you mean his cartilage?"

152
00:05:25,522 --> 00:05:27,022
It won't be my cartilage.

153
00:05:27,352 --> 00:05:30,193
I won't be able to play soccer once I'm married. Isn't that the usual?

154
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,192
Right? I can't work out at that hour, can I?

155
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:35,132
- Can I? - Why would you bring up marriage?

156
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:36,933
I'm already old enough to get married.

157
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:39,531
Do you still intend to get married?

158
00:05:39,532 --> 00:05:42,331
- Bring it up when you start dating. - Of course, I intend to.

159
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,771
Didn't you say you had a girlfriend in LA?

160
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:46,242
- No. - He has a kid in LA.

161
00:05:46,243 --> 00:05:47,612
- He has a kid? - Yes.

162
00:05:47,613 --> 00:05:49,211
(Not responding to rumors anymore)

163
00:05:49,212 --> 00:05:50,982
I heard he was about to become a grandpa.

164
00:05:50,983 --> 00:05:53,043
(I heard he was about to become a grandpa.)

165
00:05:53,543 --> 00:05:54,912
(Choking)

166
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,482
He's becoming a grandpa?

167
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,322
(Laughing)

168
00:05:58,323 --> 00:05:59,652
He's insane.

169
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:01,422
- He already has kids? - Because of you,

170
00:06:01,423 --> 00:06:03,192
- Are you married? - elderly people...

171
00:06:03,193 --> 00:06:05,391
really believe it.

172
00:06:05,392 --> 00:06:06,392
And many at that.

173
00:06:06,393 --> 00:06:08,661
(The source of the rumors)

174
00:06:08,662 --> 00:06:11,531
Jong Kook is fine with everyone else...

175
00:06:11,532 --> 00:06:13,532
- but finds him a handful. - He's a handful.

176
00:06:14,073 --> 00:06:17,233
Tae Hyun doesn't know what to say and what not to.

177
00:06:17,373 --> 00:06:18,401
(Laughing)

178
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:19,701
The rumors...

179
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,312
They've had this chemistry for almost 30 years.

180
00:06:21,313 --> 00:06:22,542
A chemistry of 30 years.

181
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:25,011
- He's like my first-ever friend. - Exactly.

182
00:06:25,012 --> 00:06:26,081
After my debut in 1995.

183
00:06:26,082 --> 00:06:27,802
- The first celebrity friend, right? - Yes.

184
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:30,081
He'll become a grandpa at the end of the year.

185
00:06:30,082 --> 00:06:31,221
That's enough.

186
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,552
(Wiping)

187
00:06:32,553 --> 00:06:33,883
How sweet of you.

188
00:06:34,123 --> 00:06:36,852
Do you not take care of your eyes, Jong Kook?

189
00:06:37,293 --> 00:06:39,662
I don't, but I've become farsighted.

190
00:06:39,892 --> 00:06:42,192
- We don't call it farsighted. - What do you call it?

191
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,692
- Slow focusing. - Slow focusing.

192
00:06:43,693 --> 00:06:45,101
- "Slow focusing?" - Yes.

193
00:06:45,102 --> 00:06:47,161
- Not bad, right? - I like it. Slow focusing.

194
00:06:47,162 --> 00:06:49,172
- Not bad, right? - Is it different?

195
00:06:49,173 --> 00:06:50,901
- It is. - Has this been brought up before?

196
00:06:50,902 --> 00:06:52,002
Slow focusing.

197
00:06:52,003 --> 00:06:53,572
- The nuance. - It feels different.

198
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:55,612
I heard there was a procedure for presbyopia.

199
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:57,341
- There is one. - I went to an eye doctor...

200
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:58,902
- for a checkup. - What was the result?

201
00:06:58,943 --> 00:07:00,182
The doctor told me the following.

202
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,983
Presbyopia is like a flying arrow.

203
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:06,452
The procedure can be done when the arrow hits the target.

204
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:08,952
The doctor put it in difficult words.

205
00:07:09,293 --> 00:07:10,961
- So... - How is this difficult?

206
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:12,922
- When it hits the target... - Presbyopia gets worse, right?

207
00:07:12,923 --> 00:07:15,091
Rather than doing it while it's getting worse,

208
00:07:15,092 --> 00:07:16,562
- it should be done at the endpoint. - In short...

209
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:19,062
When the farsightedness can't get any worse...

210
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,601
Get my permission before drinking mine.

211
00:07:21,602 --> 00:07:23,901
- We can order another coffee. - I mixed yours in mine.

212
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:26,902
- I didn't drink yours. - Everyone, they're not fighting.

213
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:28,971
- It's just... - We're not.

214
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,542
- It can cause a misunderstanding. - Exactly.

215
00:07:30,543 --> 00:07:32,503
- They're showing affection. - Showing affection.

216
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:33,943
You still looked into it.

217
00:07:35,483 --> 00:07:37,081
- Of course, I would. - Yes.

218
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:38,423
Jong Kook...

219
00:07:38,683 --> 00:07:40,622
has changed a lot after suffering from gout.

220
00:07:40,623 --> 00:07:41,721
- Yes. - Did you have gout?

221
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:44,091
I'm fine now. I've gotten a lot better.

222
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,162
Does it get better?

223
00:07:45,262 --> 00:07:47,531
- If you look after yourself. - By taking care of yourself.

224
00:07:47,532 --> 00:07:48,592
It does.

225
00:07:49,392 --> 00:07:50,961
Jong Kook shouldn't drink beer.

226
00:07:50,962 --> 00:07:52,362
Beer is...

227
00:07:52,363 --> 00:07:54,502
I didn't get gout despite drinking so much.

228
00:07:54,503 --> 00:07:56,432
- Come on. - But you quit drinking, didn't you?

229
00:07:56,433 --> 00:07:59,442
I had no plans to quit drinking. But suddenly,

230
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:02,172
I stopped craving it and stopped drinking it.

231
00:08:02,173 --> 00:08:03,471
- That can happen? - Is that how you quit?

232
00:08:03,472 --> 00:08:07,081
I just naturally stopped drinking. There was no resolution.

233
00:08:07,082 --> 00:08:08,982
Did you suddenly stop craving it after decades of drinking?

234
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,282
- Right? - Is that possible?

235
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:12,851
- It turned out to be possible. - Jung Min...

236
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:15,553
I carry around alcohol-free beverages.

237
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:18,099
- Why? - You drink alcohol-free beverages?

238
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,423
I should still attend gatherings.

239
00:08:20,592 --> 00:08:22,092
Or should I always stay at home?

240
00:08:22,462 --> 00:08:24,201
Should I? When I'm already at home...

241
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:25,362
- because I have no work? - But...

242
00:08:25,363 --> 00:08:27,101
he drinks about 5 to 6 cans...

243
00:08:27,102 --> 00:08:28,932
of the alcohol-free beverage.

244
00:08:28,933 --> 00:08:31,502
Drinking that makes me feel like I'm drinking alcoholic beverages.

245
00:08:31,503 --> 00:08:33,902
- Is that so? - I have fun for about 3 to 4 hours.

246
00:08:33,903 --> 00:08:36,741
- He looks drunk. Seriously. - Right?

247
00:08:36,742 --> 00:08:38,943
It's a blessing that Jong Kook came today.

248
00:08:39,112 --> 00:08:40,881
Because Jong Kook is here...

249
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:42,351
Had it only been him, we would've been anxious.

250
00:08:42,352 --> 00:08:43,812
Tae Hyun is very...

251
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,352
Being with Tae Hyun puts me at ease.

252
00:08:45,752 --> 00:08:48,221
- Right? - Tae Hyun's the one...

253
00:08:48,222 --> 00:08:49,491
who helped people discover Yeon Seok.

254
00:08:49,492 --> 00:08:50,552
- Yeon Seok? - Yes.

255
00:08:50,553 --> 00:08:53,221
You know Yeon Seok's "When the Phone Rings?"

256
00:08:53,222 --> 00:08:54,992
It's hot among the old ladies.

257
00:08:55,533 --> 00:08:56,562
Oh, that?

258
00:08:56,563 --> 00:08:58,802
Bring Yeon Seok up, and the old ladies go wild.

259
00:08:58,803 --> 00:09:00,601
- But why? - Is it that kind of a story?

260
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:03,331
It wouldn't work with just anyone.

261
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:06,672
People like you and I never make it on their online community board.

262
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,313
What about us among the old ladies?

263
00:09:08,872 --> 00:09:10,072
The old ladies...

264
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,143
- They have a league of their own. - Seriously.

265
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:14,881
But Jong Kook has a different path, you know?

266
00:09:14,882 --> 00:09:17,081
He's popular among fitness enthusiasts.

267
00:09:17,082 --> 00:09:18,652
(A weighty path Jong Kook is taking)

268
00:09:18,653 --> 00:09:20,721
- When Jong Kook hits the streets, - Right.

269
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,621
People who look like exercise buffs...

270
00:09:22,622 --> 00:09:24,022
- That's true. - only have eyes on Jong Kook.

271
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:25,163
The fitness enthusiasts...

272
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:27,422
(A sincere bicipital cheer)

273
00:09:27,423 --> 00:09:28,932
- You can easily tell... - Fitness enthusiasts...

274
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:30,131
- a fitness enthusiast. - Totally.

275
00:09:30,132 --> 00:09:31,402
- They're easy to notice. - Yes.

276
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:33,262
- They cheer each other on. - Exactly. Cheer...

277
00:09:33,263 --> 00:09:34,802
- and touch each other. - And touch.

278
00:09:34,803 --> 00:09:36,502
- And the reaction. - Right.

279
00:09:36,632 --> 00:09:37,952
"Do you do lower body exercises?"

280
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,172
"It seems like you do." Something like this.

281
00:09:40,173 --> 00:09:42,871
The other party loves it when Jong Kook does this.

282
00:09:42,872 --> 00:09:44,241
- Totally. - Goodness.

283
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:45,642
- Gosh. - Goodness.

284
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:47,081
(The fitness enthusiasts' link)

285
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:50,852
Fitness enthusiasts commune and chat.

286
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:52,282
It's time to check the spare time.

287
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:53,682
- Okay. - Let's check it.

288
00:09:53,683 --> 00:09:54,892
- We chatted away. - Chatting...

289
00:09:54,893 --> 00:09:56,721
We almost missed the spare time because of you two.

290
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,693
I'm not too sure if we had a chat or a fight.

291
00:09:59,293 --> 00:10:01,293
- What? Where are we going today? - We...

292
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:03,062
- Now... - What's that?

293
00:10:03,063 --> 00:10:04,402
We must check out our Whenever Guest.

294
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:06,002
Our business cards have...

295
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,371
We have to get there by 9:20am.

296
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:09,572
Let's hurry.

297
00:10:09,573 --> 00:10:10,972
- By 9:20am? - "Kim Ye Rin."

298
00:10:11,173 --> 00:10:13,273
- Ye Rin. - We only have 15 minutes left.

299
00:10:13,403 --> 00:10:14,642
"Kim Ye Rin."

300
00:10:14,643 --> 00:10:17,042
- Ye Rin. - Ye Rin. It's a lady.

301
00:10:17,043 --> 00:10:20,111
"From Monday to Friday, I take the first train to work."

302
00:10:20,112 --> 00:10:21,351
(The first train?)

303
00:10:21,352 --> 00:10:24,182
"We feel relieved after cheering up..."

304
00:10:24,183 --> 00:10:27,693
"the workers going to work..."

305
00:10:28,393 --> 00:10:31,591
"and the housewives' mornings..."

306
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:34,263
"with our incredibly cheerful morning call."

307
00:10:34,393 --> 00:10:35,792
What does she do?

308
00:10:35,793 --> 00:10:38,131
"Please recharge my team's dopamine."

309
00:10:38,132 --> 00:10:40,762
She must do something in the morning...

310
00:10:40,763 --> 00:10:42,072
- with office workers, - What is her job?

311
00:10:42,073 --> 00:10:43,802
- like working out. - Like...

312
00:10:43,803 --> 00:10:45,471
- a morning exercise? - Aerobics?

313
00:10:45,472 --> 00:10:47,241
- Aerobics? - Something like that.

314
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,812
- It must be aerobics. - Really?

315
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:51,211
We don't have time. Roll it, Jong Kook.

316
00:10:51,212 --> 00:10:54,283
People who exercise before work must be admired.

317
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,282
- Seriously. - You're right.

318
00:10:56,283 --> 00:10:58,222
Here I go. In 1, 2, 3.

319
00:10:58,752 --> 00:10:59,882
As long as it's not a zero.

320
00:11:00,582 --> 00:11:01,653
What's the number?

321
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,452
- No. - Gosh.

322
00:11:04,252 --> 00:11:05,292
You can't use your foot.

323
00:11:05,293 --> 00:11:07,092
- No. - Hey.

324
00:11:07,693 --> 00:11:10,032
- No. - Again.

325
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,631
- For real? - I'm rolling it again.

326
00:11:11,632 --> 00:11:12,762
- I'm sorry. - It was one before.

327
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:14,501
- It's become a habit. - Again.

328
00:11:14,502 --> 00:11:15,902
Do it again since he kicked it.

329
00:11:15,903 --> 00:11:18,341
- We have to throw it together. - Together.

330
00:11:18,342 --> 00:11:20,043
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

331
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,573
I've fallen into that habit.

332
00:11:24,783 --> 00:11:25,842
Okay!

333
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:27,981
- What is it? - You can't change it.

334
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:29,053
Okay!

335
00:11:29,783 --> 00:11:32,522
- I knew it. I told you. - See that?

336
00:11:32,523 --> 00:11:33,581
(Laughing)

337
00:11:33,582 --> 00:11:35,322
- See that? - It needed teamwork.

338
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:38,322
- As expected, they're different. - You two are amazing.

339
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:40,193
- You are different. - Okay.

340
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:42,992
- They are indeed incredible. - The coupons.

341
00:11:43,393 --> 00:11:45,101
- You've got to act like the boss. - Gosh.

342
00:11:45,102 --> 00:11:46,231
We got three coupons.

343
00:11:46,232 --> 00:11:48,372
Let's go. We're running out of time.

344
00:11:48,702 --> 00:11:50,672
A car has been prepared for us today.

345
00:11:50,673 --> 00:11:51,903
- Really? - Yes.

346
00:11:51,972 --> 00:11:53,341
What a nice car.

347
00:11:53,342 --> 00:11:54,443
It's pretty.

348
00:11:54,742 --> 00:11:56,272
White is indeed the best.

349
00:11:56,273 --> 00:11:57,842
It's a nice car.

350
00:11:58,183 --> 00:11:59,442
Where do we sit?

351
00:11:59,443 --> 00:12:00,881
- Take the backseat. - Come here.

352
00:12:00,882 --> 00:12:02,652
Get in the backseat.

353
00:12:02,653 --> 00:12:04,782
- I'll take the passenger's seat. - Gosh.

354
00:12:04,783 --> 00:12:06,122
(Today's driver)

355
00:12:06,553 --> 00:12:08,193
- Seat belts. - This is...

356
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:10,923
I haven't ridden one in a while.

357
00:12:11,923 --> 00:12:12,962
(Closing)

358
00:12:13,793 --> 00:12:16,032
- This right here. - What?

359
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:18,032
Only luxurious cars have this function.

360
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:19,462
This is great.

361
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:21,172
Even the front doors do that.

362
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:22,802
- All doors have that function. - Yes, all doors.

363
00:12:22,803 --> 00:12:24,672
- Luxurious cars sure are different. - Goodness.

364
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:26,142
The door closes smoothly.

365
00:12:26,143 --> 00:12:28,173
"Mokdongseo-ro..."

366
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:30,173
- Is it 161? - Yes, 161.

367
00:12:31,242 --> 00:12:33,212
- It's nearby. - We're close.

368
00:12:33,913 --> 00:12:35,481
Okay, let's go.

369
00:12:35,482 --> 00:12:36,582
Yes.

370
00:12:36,712 --> 00:12:38,351
We're taking two new babies.

371
00:12:38,352 --> 00:12:39,423
Good.

372
00:12:40,023 --> 00:12:41,251
Do you play golf?

373
00:12:41,252 --> 00:12:43,221
- No. - I did in the past.

374
00:12:43,222 --> 00:12:44,251
You did?

375
00:12:44,252 --> 00:12:47,062
When Coach Pak Se Ri was on this show, she mentioned Jong Kook and...

376
00:12:47,063 --> 00:12:48,492
Did she talk badly about me again?

377
00:12:48,693 --> 00:12:50,632
No, she didn't.

378
00:12:51,362 --> 00:12:52,602
I'm sure she did.

379
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:56,732
You were on a show with Jong Kook, right?

380
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:58,143
He's terrible.

381
00:12:59,842 --> 00:13:01,342
From what I see,

382
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:04,073
Jong Kook's athletic skills aren't as good as his strength.

383
00:13:05,082 --> 00:13:06,082
Something like that.

384
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:09,153
Only a few in Korea can dare to say that...

385
00:13:09,352 --> 00:13:11,012
Jong Kook's athletic skills...

386
00:13:11,013 --> 00:13:12,251
aren't that good.

387
00:13:12,252 --> 00:13:13,322
(The golf legend's general review)

388
00:13:13,323 --> 00:13:15,852
Here's what Coach Pak told us.

389
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:17,961
"Unlike other sports,"

390
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:21,831
"golf is one where you hit a dead ball."

391
00:13:21,832 --> 00:13:24,162
- That's right. - Those words were so cool.

392
00:13:24,163 --> 00:13:26,402
- Hitting a dead ball. - In weightlifting,

393
00:13:26,403 --> 00:13:27,831
- we have the deadlift. - Right.

394
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:29,302
- It has a similar meaning. - How so?

395
00:13:29,303 --> 00:13:30,501
- Dead means it's not alive. - No, so...

396
00:13:30,502 --> 00:13:31,772
You lift what's dead.

397
00:13:31,773 --> 00:13:33,802
Isn't it called that as you feel dead after a lower body exercise?

398
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:35,672
You feel dead, but no. "Dead" means...

399
00:13:35,673 --> 00:13:38,481
"dead weight." You're lifting the dead weight.

400
00:13:38,482 --> 00:13:39,981
The exercise was named like so.

401
00:13:39,982 --> 00:13:41,012
Yes, deadlift.

402
00:13:41,013 --> 00:13:44,152
How can you take Coach Pak's comment about...

403
00:13:44,153 --> 00:13:46,121
being bad at golf to deadlifting?

404
00:13:46,122 --> 00:13:48,052
This is how a conversation flows...

405
00:13:48,053 --> 00:13:50,152
- when it comes to sports. - You lift what's dead.

406
00:13:50,153 --> 00:13:52,423
The final goal is to get home, isn't it?

407
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:55,533
The older you get, the more weightlifting you must do.

408
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:57,193
That's what I tell others.

409
00:13:57,293 --> 00:13:59,131
I do that too. The stairs one.

410
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:00,302
- Stairs? - The stepmill?

411
00:14:00,303 --> 00:14:01,902
- Hold on. Isn't this the place? - After that...

412
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:03,732
- It's SBS. - Is it SBS?

413
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:05,772
- It's just SBS. - Cycling...

414
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,073
- What? - What's going on?

415
00:14:07,273 --> 00:14:09,512
- It's SBS. - This is SBS.

416
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:11,382
We're shooting at SBS.

417
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,612
- Are we in Mok-dong? - What's...

418
00:14:15,013 --> 00:14:17,413
- Mok-dong... - Or is it a restaurant?

419
00:14:17,653 --> 00:14:19,722
The gym here has closed.

420
00:14:20,452 --> 00:14:21,553
Hi.

421
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:23,722
The gym here has closed.

422
00:14:24,153 --> 00:14:25,793
Is this not the place? Wait.

423
00:14:25,962 --> 00:14:27,462
- He's Yoo Jae Suk. - Hi.

424
00:14:28,832 --> 00:14:30,032
If you don't recognize Yoo Jae Suk,

425
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:31,263
we have Kim Jong Kook here.

426
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,803
- Yeon Seok. - Yes?

427
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,002
He's not...

428
00:14:36,573 --> 00:14:38,543
- opening it after seeing you. - I know.

429
00:14:38,702 --> 00:14:41,413
He was going to open it but stopped to ask who I was.

430
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:43,211
- All right. - Okay.

431
00:14:43,212 --> 00:14:45,643
- Let's get off. - Okay.

432
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:48,783
Is this "Running Man?" You guys are so loud.

433
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:50,611
This is how Jong Kook and I work.

434
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,152
- Okay! - Liven up the mood.

435
00:14:52,153 --> 00:14:55,221
(Starting with Jong Kook's signature cheer)

436
00:14:55,222 --> 00:14:56,222
- Nice. - Jong Kook.

437
00:14:56,923 --> 00:14:58,192
Nice.

438
00:14:58,193 --> 00:14:59,862
- It's been a while. - Hold on.

439
00:15:00,063 --> 00:15:01,461
What are we doing at SBS?

440
00:15:01,462 --> 00:15:04,392
- The gym here is still open, right? - Yes.

441
00:15:04,393 --> 00:15:06,361
- There's a gym here? - Yes, there is.

442
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:08,072
Right. But they closed down the gym in the Sangam building.

443
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,231
- Really? They did? - Yes, they closed it down.

444
00:15:10,232 --> 00:15:12,072
- Really? - The personal trainer...

445
00:15:12,073 --> 00:15:15,471
who worked in the Sangam branch used to be in my fan club.

446
00:15:15,472 --> 00:15:17,012
- Really? - Yes. I met him a long time ago.

447
00:15:17,013 --> 00:15:19,013
- So you've used the gym in here? - You know...

448
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:20,782
- I did once for a show. - We...

449
00:15:20,783 --> 00:15:21,912
- We... - I've used the gym once.

450
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:23,351
- We can't use the gym, though. - Right.

451
00:15:23,352 --> 00:15:24,751
Hey, a Shake Shack is here.

452
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:26,152
- My gosh. - There's a Shake Shack here?

453
00:15:26,153 --> 00:15:27,381
- Right. And Starbucks too. - Yes.

454
00:15:27,382 --> 00:15:29,621
- Hey, they revamped this place. - My goodness.

455
00:15:29,622 --> 00:15:31,961
(They are busy checking out the revamped building.)

456
00:15:31,962 --> 00:15:33,721
- So both of them are new. - I've never seen this.

457
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:35,262
- There's a Starbucks branch too. - Hold on.

458
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:36,263
- Let me check where we're going. - This is crazy.

459
00:15:36,264 --> 00:15:37,838
- I think it was on the 11th floor. - What does she do?

460
00:15:37,862 --> 00:15:40,102
Hold on. Let me check where we're going.

461
00:15:40,502 --> 00:15:42,578
- I think it was on the 11th floor. - What does she do?

462
00:15:42,602 --> 00:15:45,172
- Room 5 on the 11th floor. - The 11th floor?

463
00:15:45,173 --> 00:15:47,001
- The 11th floor? - What's on the 11th floor?

464
00:15:47,002 --> 00:15:48,848
- The gym is in the basement. - The 11th floor. This way.

465
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:50,042
Then it can't be the gym. Right?

466
00:15:50,043 --> 00:15:51,111
- So... - No.

467
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:53,112
- Is it an editing room? - The vibe... Wait.

468
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:55,611
Maybe, she works on a radio show early in the morning.

469
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,052
She energizes people in the morning.

470
00:15:57,313 --> 00:15:58,881
- He has a point. - What do you think?

471
00:15:58,882 --> 00:16:01,552
- A radio show in the morning. - Those morning shows?

472
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:02,792
- You're right. - Or the traffic segments?

473
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:03,922
Right. Something like that.

474
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:06,662
- Who's the morning DJ for SBS? - A long time ago,

475
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:08,231
- we listened to the radio a lot. - Well...

476
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:09,662
- You know? - "Kim Young Chul's Power FM."

477
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:11,662
- Hello. - My gosh, is it Young Chul then?

478
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:12,762
- No, probably not. - It can't be him.

479
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:14,402
- Wasn't it a woman? - It could be his director.

480
00:16:14,403 --> 00:16:16,149
- A director. Yes, that's possible. - Or a writer.

481
00:16:16,173 --> 00:16:17,871
Young Chul can't join us when we're already chatty.

482
00:16:17,872 --> 00:16:19,519
- My gosh, back in the day... - Shall we go?

483
00:16:19,543 --> 00:16:20,642
- The 11th floor. - My goodness.

484
00:16:20,643 --> 00:16:22,643
- Yes! Right. - When you were 20.

485
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:25,242
- Hold on. This place... - So...

486
00:16:25,683 --> 00:16:27,581
- Hey. - Right.

487
00:16:27,582 --> 00:16:28,812
- It is a radio show. - What?

488
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:29,981
- We were right. - See?

489
00:16:29,982 --> 00:16:31,251
- Room Five. - The morning radio.

490
00:16:31,252 --> 00:16:33,522
- Gosh, a morning radio show. - I used to be on many radio shows.

491
00:16:33,523 --> 00:16:34,652
- You know? - That's why...

492
00:16:34,653 --> 00:16:35,822
- Yes. - she told us to come now.

493
00:16:35,823 --> 00:16:36,991
- Yes, after the show. - I was on many radio shows.

494
00:16:36,992 --> 00:16:38,022
(Current time, 9:19am)

495
00:16:38,023 --> 00:16:41,222
- Gosh, it's Lee Sook Young. - I used to be on many radio shows.

496
00:16:41,893 --> 00:16:43,091
That's So Yu Jin.

497
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:44,131
(Familiar voices of SBS)

498
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,432
- Wait. Her name was "Sook Young?" - Hwa Jung...

499
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:47,601
- You didn't know? - All this time,

500
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:48,772
I thought it was Soo Kyung.

501
00:16:48,773 --> 00:16:51,872
- And actually, Sook Young... - Yes?

502
00:16:51,943 --> 00:16:53,802
- was an announcer at KBS. - Right.

503
00:16:53,803 --> 00:16:54,972
- Really? - Yes.

504
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,642
- So... - But she worked here for 20 years?

505
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:57,772
- She did the show for 20 years. - That's amazing.

506
00:16:57,773 --> 00:16:58,912
Goodness, 20 years.

507
00:16:58,913 --> 00:17:00,993
- Hwa Jung did it for 20 years too. - Choi Hwa Jung.

508
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:02,312
- That's amazing. - Let's go inside.

509
00:17:02,313 --> 00:17:04,052
- Our spare time... - Isn't Haha hosting a radio show?

510
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:05,722
- He is. - Isn't his show on SBS?

511
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:07,022
- That's on KBS. - KBS?

512
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,023
- I see. - It's on KBS?

513
00:17:08,024 --> 00:17:09,691
- Didn't he do a show at SBS before? - Room Five.

514
00:17:09,692 --> 00:17:11,992
- Where do we have to go? Room 5? - Room 5.

515
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,361
- Room Five. - Then does it mean...

516
00:17:13,362 --> 00:17:14,462
There's another one here.

517
00:17:14,463 --> 00:17:16,431
- Broadcasting... - Choi Baek Ho.

518
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:17,562
Choi Baek Ho.

519
00:17:17,563 --> 00:17:19,932
- Right here. Young Chul. - He's a longtime DJ too.

520
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:21,572
- Is it Young Chul? - Young Chul?

521
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,253
(They see Young Chul in the Hall of Fame.)

522
00:17:23,402 --> 00:17:25,101
- Is it him? Jae Suk. - It can't be Young Chul.

523
00:17:25,102 --> 00:17:26,772
If it's Young Chul, let's just leave.

524
00:17:26,773 --> 00:17:28,312
I think it might be him.

525
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,072
- But given the time... It's 9am. - Here's the thing.

526
00:17:30,073 --> 00:17:31,441
- It's 9am now. - The time...

527
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:32,812
- His show begins at 7am. - Really?

528
00:17:32,813 --> 00:17:34,012
- Jae Suk. If it's him... - It starts that early?

529
00:17:34,013 --> 00:17:35,181
Or will we meet someone from the next show?

530
00:17:35,182 --> 00:17:36,553
Won't it be really loud?

531
00:17:36,713 --> 00:17:37,752
- He starts his show that early? - No?

532
00:17:37,753 --> 00:17:39,351
But having Young Chul on top of you two...

533
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:40,651
- Yes. It'll be too much to handle. - Gosh.

534
00:17:40,652 --> 00:17:41,921
- It's too much even for me. - I hear laughter.

535
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,453
- Where is it coming from? - I...

536
00:17:43,823 --> 00:17:45,722
- I think it's Young Chul. - Wait. Is this the place?

537
00:17:45,723 --> 00:17:47,622
- They sound so happy. - This is Room Five.

538
00:17:47,993 --> 00:17:49,692
- I see, Room Five. - Kim Ye Rin.

539
00:17:49,832 --> 00:17:51,391
- What? - I think it's Young Chul.

540
00:17:51,392 --> 00:17:52,902
Come on.

541
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,503
- Come on. Young Chul. - He can't join us.

542
00:17:55,902 --> 00:17:57,902
- Young Chul. - It's me!

543
00:17:59,342 --> 00:18:00,901
(Groaning)

544
00:18:00,902 --> 00:18:03,141
- You were right. - Hello.

545
00:18:03,142 --> 00:18:04,783
- Hello. - Hello.

546
00:18:05,342 --> 00:18:07,081
(Feeling dizzy)

547
00:18:07,082 --> 00:18:08,181
- My gosh, Young Chul. - Come in.

548
00:18:08,182 --> 00:18:10,282
- It's nice to see you. - Well...

549
00:18:10,283 --> 00:18:12,253
- Hey, Young Chul. - So...

550
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:14,322
Young Chul, your show is over.

551
00:18:14,323 --> 00:18:15,351
- By the way... - So I was waiting for you.

552
00:18:15,352 --> 00:18:16,391
- Hey. - We knew it might be him.

553
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:18,621
- Everyone, including Jong Kook... - Hello.

554
00:18:18,622 --> 00:18:20,892
What? Who is this? Isn't this Goo Dong Mae?

555
00:18:22,162 --> 00:18:23,661
- It's "When the Phone Rings" now. - "When the Phone Rings."

556
00:18:23,662 --> 00:18:25,431
The number you have dialed is not in service.

557
00:18:25,432 --> 00:18:27,762
No, that's not what the drama is about.

558
00:18:27,763 --> 00:18:28,878
The number you have dialed...

559
00:18:28,902 --> 00:18:30,601
- But you're not the Whenever Guest. - This is...

560
00:18:30,602 --> 00:18:33,303
- Her name was Kim Ye Rin. - Is he the Whenever Guest?

561
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:35,983
- I see. The director? - She's the director of the show.

562
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:38,212
- Hello. - Hello.

563
00:18:38,213 --> 00:18:39,841
- Someone else wrote to our show. - Yes.

564
00:18:39,842 --> 00:18:41,381
- He wasn't the Whenever Guest. - It wasn't me.

565
00:18:41,382 --> 00:18:43,411
- What a relief. - My goodness. What a relief.

566
00:18:43,412 --> 00:18:44,513
I was surprised.

567
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,823
- You surprised me. - You surprised me.

568
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:51,622
(Kim Ye Rin, the first Whenever Guest)

569
00:18:51,823 --> 00:18:53,691
So you guys work together?

570
00:18:53,692 --> 00:18:56,391
That's right. We were done with the show and chatting.

571
00:18:56,392 --> 00:18:57,732
(They were chatting after the show.)

572
00:18:57,733 --> 00:18:59,331
It wasn't that you couldn't leave because of Young Chul?

573
00:18:59,332 --> 00:19:01,332
Well, I wouldn't say that.

574
00:19:03,033 --> 00:19:04,993
- By the way, the vibe... - She sounded cautious.

575
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:06,401
- Aren't you the youngest? - Yes, I am the youngest director.

576
00:19:06,402 --> 00:19:07,572
- I see. Really? - I see.

577
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:08,911
- Are you the youngest director? - Yes.

578
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:11,012
- Has it been 2 years? - It's been 1 year.

579
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:12,681
It was recent. My gosh, she just joined then.

580
00:19:12,682 --> 00:19:14,013
She's the assistant director.

581
00:19:14,342 --> 00:19:16,252
- He's the main director. - The man next to you?

582
00:19:16,253 --> 00:19:18,111
- I see. It's you. Hello. - Hello.

583
00:19:18,112 --> 00:19:19,151
(Director Park Hyung Ju)

584
00:19:19,152 --> 00:19:20,782
- I see. - Gosh, the radio show...

585
00:19:20,783 --> 00:19:22,292
Your radio show is very popular. Right?

586
00:19:22,293 --> 00:19:23,391
- It has the highest ratings on SBS. - His show is the best.

587
00:19:23,392 --> 00:19:25,192
- Really? - Is that true?

588
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:27,362
- Is this true? - That's right.

589
00:19:27,523 --> 00:19:29,062
We've been in the top for three years.

590
00:19:29,063 --> 00:19:31,361
- Right. - That's why you're acting...

591
00:19:31,362 --> 00:19:33,262
like a big shot because you're successful here.

592
00:19:33,263 --> 00:19:36,072
Right. The head of the department told me I was the pillar.

593
00:19:36,073 --> 00:19:37,572
(He's the pillar of SBS Radio.)

594
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:39,371
- Right. - You know, I always say this...

595
00:19:39,372 --> 00:19:40,641
- about Young Chul. - Yes?

596
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:42,871
I really want to see him when he's not around.

597
00:19:42,872 --> 00:19:44,371
- I see. Really? - But when we meet...

598
00:19:44,372 --> 00:19:45,652
- Five minutes is enough. - Yes.

599
00:19:46,842 --> 00:19:47,881
(His self-evaluation is crystal clear.)

600
00:19:47,882 --> 00:19:49,813
- Five minutes. - Five minutes.

601
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:51,651
- Five minutes. - After being with him...

602
00:19:51,652 --> 00:19:53,522
for five minutes, I want to leave.

603
00:19:53,523 --> 00:19:54,992
He actually calls me when he misses me.

604
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:56,921
- Right. I do because I miss him. - Really?

605
00:19:56,922 --> 00:19:59,361
He calls me and says, "Young Chul, I have a headache."

606
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:00,421
(He complains of a headache after 5 minutes.)

607
00:20:00,422 --> 00:20:01,993
He always says he has a headache.

608
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,062
- That's like a prank. - All right. Bye now.

609
00:20:05,063 --> 00:20:06,102
Yes.

610
00:20:06,432 --> 00:20:08,601
- Ye Rin is our Whenever Guest. - Right.

611
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:09,802
- Right. - It's Ye Rin.

612
00:20:09,803 --> 00:20:11,532
- She's our Whenever Guest. - Right.

613
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,972
- All right. Young Chul. - Five minutes.

614
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:14,442
- Yes? - He's leaving.

615
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:16,572
- What's going on? - Bye.

616
00:20:16,573 --> 00:20:17,573
Go.

617
00:20:18,142 --> 00:20:22,483
- Bye. - Bye.

618
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:24,252
- Bye. I'll call you. - Bye.

619
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:25,881
- See you later. - See you next week.

620
00:20:25,882 --> 00:20:27,252
My gosh.

621
00:20:27,253 --> 00:20:29,292
- It's been a while since I met him. - Right.

622
00:20:29,293 --> 00:20:32,891
We're meeting with the staff members of "Kim Young Chul's Power FM."

623
00:20:32,892 --> 00:20:34,222
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

624
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:35,762
- Hello. - Welcome.

625
00:20:35,763 --> 00:20:37,062
Ye Rin, you were the one...

626
00:20:37,063 --> 00:20:38,502
- who wrote to our show, correct? - Yes. It was me.

627
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,732
- I see. - My gosh.

628
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:41,431
We heard about you briefly earlier.

629
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:42,871
So you started this job only a year ago?

630
00:20:42,872 --> 00:20:46,002
Yes. And I recently joined this team too.

631
00:20:46,003 --> 00:20:48,072
- How is it, working on the show... - Really?

632
00:20:48,073 --> 00:20:49,912
As the director?

633
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,712
Young Chul is exactly the same.

634
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:54,841
He's as talkative as I've seen on TV.

635
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:56,483
I was really surprised.

636
00:20:56,612 --> 00:20:58,181
So I get to work...

637
00:20:58,182 --> 00:21:00,121
with a lot of energy in the morning. So it's great.

638
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,552
So you were hired as the director of radio shows?

639
00:21:01,553 --> 00:21:02,651
- Yes. - Right.

640
00:21:02,652 --> 00:21:04,452
I'm sure you could have applied to be a director for TV shows.

641
00:21:04,453 --> 00:21:05,661
- But is there a reason... - Right.

642
00:21:05,662 --> 00:21:06,861
You applied to work on radio shows?

643
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,191
Radio shows air every day...

644
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:10,331
and become a part of people's daily routine.

645
00:21:10,332 --> 00:21:12,032
- Right. - It's fun to listen to stories...

646
00:21:12,033 --> 00:21:13,532
from all walks of life.

647
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:15,072
There are simple pleasures from it.

648
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,702
And radio shows are so heartwarming.

649
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:18,743
- Right. - The listeners too.

650
00:21:18,872 --> 00:21:20,171
I love the vibe you get...

651
00:21:20,172 --> 00:21:21,472
- from the old-school way of things. - That's it.

652
00:21:21,473 --> 00:21:23,872
- Retro vibes are trendy now. - Right.

653
00:21:24,013 --> 00:21:26,212
Ye Rin. What made you decide...

654
00:21:26,213 --> 00:21:27,841
- to write to our show? - Right.

655
00:21:27,842 --> 00:21:30,911
Our show airs early in the morning. So once we're done,

656
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:32,581
it's iffy to have a meal given the time.

657
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,952
- We have some spare time... - Right. It's quite early.

658
00:21:33,953 --> 00:21:35,322
Before we have to record.

659
00:21:35,323 --> 00:21:37,992
We always talk to Young Chul a lot.

660
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:40,322
It's really fun to talk to Young Chul.

661
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:41,522
- Are you sure about that? - But...

662
00:21:41,523 --> 00:21:42,891
after listening to him for five days straight,

663
00:21:42,892 --> 00:21:44,792
I thought we might need a different kind of energy.

664
00:21:44,793 --> 00:21:46,002
- Since it's just us here... - I see.

665
00:21:46,003 --> 00:21:48,472
Why don't you introduce yourselves? What's your name, Director?

666
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,331
I'm the main director of "Kim Young Chul's Power FM."

667
00:21:51,332 --> 00:21:52,702
My name is Park Hyung Ju.

668
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,042
- I see. Park Hyung Ju. - Yes.

669
00:21:54,043 --> 00:21:55,163
- Nice to meet you. - Go on.

670
00:21:55,473 --> 00:21:57,742
I'm the youngest writer. My name is Yu In Hwa.

671
00:21:57,743 --> 00:21:59,712
- Writer Yu In Hwa. - Yu In Hwa.

672
00:21:59,713 --> 00:22:01,441
I'm Choi Ji Eun.

673
00:22:01,442 --> 00:22:03,911
- Are you the main writer? - Yes, there are two main writers.

674
00:22:03,912 --> 00:22:05,851
I'm the younger one. She's the older one.

675
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:08,591
- I see. Right there. - She's in the back.

676
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:11,091
- She let you have the front seat. - Gosh.

677
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:12,222
- She did. - As expected.

678
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,062
I'm the secondary writer. My name is Lee Hye Yeon.

679
00:22:14,063 --> 00:22:15,303
(Secondary Writer Lee Hye Yeon)

680
00:22:16,162 --> 00:22:18,562
I'm Writer Kim Jong Sun.

681
00:22:18,563 --> 00:22:19,962
- I see. - How long have you been working...

682
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,401
on this show?

683
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:24,131
- I joined the team three years ago. - I see.

684
00:22:24,132 --> 00:22:25,702
- What other shows... - But I've been in this department.

685
00:22:25,703 --> 00:22:27,472
I did "Park So Hyun's Love Game."

686
00:22:27,473 --> 00:22:28,911
- I see. So Hyun. - Yes.

687
00:22:28,912 --> 00:22:31,441
- I was also on "Cultwo Show." - I see. "Cultwo Show."

688
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:34,013
- My gosh, she wasn't shy about it. - Right.

689
00:22:34,142 --> 00:22:36,812
- She promoted herself. - She ought to.

690
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,581
- I bet there were other shows too. - Right.

691
00:22:38,582 --> 00:22:40,381
- But she named the big ones. - "Cultwo Show."

692
00:22:40,382 --> 00:22:41,953
How long have you been a writer?

693
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:44,391
- It's been over 20 years. - That's a long time.

694
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:46,691
Basically, she's Yoo Jae Suk among writers of radio shows.

695
00:22:46,692 --> 00:22:47,692
- Right. - My gosh.

696
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:50,562
Since you've been working in this field for 20 years,

697
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:52,861
you must see some differences compared to the old days.

698
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:54,439
What's the biggest difference you see now?

699
00:22:54,463 --> 00:22:57,601
A long time ago, there were no text messages coming in live.

700
00:22:57,602 --> 00:23:00,072
- Right. Letters. - We mostly received letters.

701
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:01,141
- Or posts on the forum. - And postcards.

702
00:23:01,142 --> 00:23:02,182
- Yes, postcards. - Right.

703
00:23:02,543 --> 00:23:03,772
During the live broadcast,

704
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:05,512
we'll get text messages from social media.

705
00:23:05,513 --> 00:23:07,911
Or we get messages through the app. With the technology,

706
00:23:07,912 --> 00:23:10,152
- we can communicate much better. - It's a recent thing.

707
00:23:10,582 --> 00:23:14,453
(The listeners can participate in the live communication.)

708
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:16,552
- How was it back in your day? - A long time ago,

709
00:23:16,553 --> 00:23:17,769
I used to record it with reels.

710
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:20,023
- Right, they used tapes. - Reels?

711
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:25,132
(Tae Hyun hosted "FM Popular Songs" in 1999 at KBS.)

712
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:30,372
(They used to record the shows with reel-to-reel tapes.)

713
00:23:30,832 --> 00:23:32,841
- Right. - But that's when SBS started...

714
00:23:32,842 --> 00:23:34,472
digital radio shows for the first time.

715
00:23:34,473 --> 00:23:37,743
I was like, "Oh, my! There are digital radio shows?"

716
00:23:37,842 --> 00:23:40,611
"So they don't have to record every minute for two hours?"

717
00:23:40,612 --> 00:23:42,351
- "That's crazy." - Right.

718
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:43,381
What is your name?

719
00:23:43,382 --> 00:23:45,581
I'm in charge of Young Chul's voice.

720
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:46,651
- What? - I'm the sound engineer.

721
00:23:46,652 --> 00:23:48,222
- I see. You're the sound engineer. - I see.

722
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:49,722
You have a great body.

723
00:23:49,723 --> 00:23:51,452
- I'm not sure if you remember. - Yes?

724
00:23:51,453 --> 00:23:54,292
- Last year, you coached me briefly. - Yes?

725
00:23:54,293 --> 00:23:55,362
- What? - Right?

726
00:23:55,533 --> 00:23:56,631
- I told you. - I remember you!

727
00:23:56,632 --> 00:23:58,132
- The radio show! - My gosh!

728
00:23:58,263 --> 00:24:00,601
- I remember you. The radio show! - My gosh!

729
00:24:00,602 --> 00:24:02,171
- You do? Right. - I remember you.

730
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:04,049
- It was over there, right? - On DinDin's show.

731
00:24:04,073 --> 00:24:06,073
- Look at them communing. - Yes. Your body...

732
00:24:06,203 --> 00:24:07,671
- Look at them communing. - Didn't I tell you?

733
00:24:07,672 --> 00:24:08,772
- I told you, right? - Look at them communing.

734
00:24:08,773 --> 00:24:09,841
- They're communing. - Yes, they are.

735
00:24:09,842 --> 00:24:11,641
- You've got a great body. - Like "Avatar."

736
00:24:11,642 --> 00:24:13,019
- His figure improved. - He's feeling the muscles.

737
00:24:13,043 --> 00:24:14,782
- The gym rats are interacting. - Right.

738
00:24:14,783 --> 00:24:16,452
- He inserted his tentacles. - Yes.

739
00:24:16,453 --> 00:24:17,712
- Even his hairstyle is suitable. - Thank you.

740
00:24:17,713 --> 00:24:19,852
- That's common at the gym. - Right.

741
00:24:20,453 --> 00:24:21,522
- So... - They're communing.

742
00:24:21,523 --> 00:24:23,243
- there was a connection. - I remember him.

743
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:28,122
(The gym rats commune instead of flirting.)

744
00:24:28,422 --> 00:24:29,931
- Gosh, I knew he was one of us. - You know what?

745
00:24:29,932 --> 00:24:31,792
- I noticed him a while ago. - Yes.

746
00:24:31,793 --> 00:24:33,002
- He kept doing this. - Really?

747
00:24:33,003 --> 00:24:34,463
(Peeking)

748
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:36,472
- Come here, Tae Hyun. - Come here.

749
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:40,172
(Staring)

750
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:44,073
(He couldn't conceal his trembling pectoral muscles.)

751
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:48,012
(Are you happy to see him in person?)

752
00:24:48,013 --> 00:24:49,081
(Chuckling)

753
00:24:49,082 --> 00:24:52,253
(He's happy to have met his favorite star.)

754
00:24:53,553 --> 00:24:54,921
So he's a typical fan...

755
00:24:54,922 --> 00:24:56,922
- of Jong Kook's YouTube channel. - This is crazy.

756
00:24:57,023 --> 00:24:59,522
- That's how his subscribers react. - Right.

757
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:00,661
And Jong Kook also feels out their muscles.

758
00:25:00,662 --> 00:25:02,032
- "My gosh, your body..." - Right.

759
00:25:02,033 --> 00:25:03,191
(Jong Kook greets back with a feel.)

760
00:25:03,192 --> 00:25:05,362
- They communed right away. - His figure improved.

761
00:25:05,432 --> 00:25:07,463
He totally leveled up.

762
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:10,472
- Just because he has more muscles. - Thank you.

763
00:25:10,473 --> 00:25:12,641
- Actually, Shin Ho... - Yes?

764
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:14,272
Was supposed to take a day off today.

765
00:25:14,273 --> 00:25:16,072
- Because Jong Kook was coming? - He canceled his request.

766
00:25:16,073 --> 00:25:18,411
- Because Jong Kook was coming? - We had to meet no matter what.

767
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:20,732
Taking a day off isn't so special. This is my day off now.

768
00:25:20,942 --> 00:25:22,622
- Right. Meeting good people... - My gosh!

769
00:25:22,882 --> 00:25:24,081
- Jong Kook. - My gosh.

770
00:25:24,082 --> 00:25:25,581
(Their 2nd connection)

771
00:25:25,582 --> 00:25:27,182
Gosh, his back muscles. Goodness.

772
00:25:28,523 --> 00:25:30,452
- You checked his back muscles? - My gosh.

773
00:25:30,453 --> 00:25:32,522
- I told you, didn't I? - This is great.

774
00:25:32,523 --> 00:25:33,861
- Thank you. - It makes men attractive.

775
00:25:33,862 --> 00:25:35,662
- "Thank you." - Seriously. It's a big charm.

776
00:25:35,832 --> 00:25:37,162
He said, "Thank you."

777
00:25:37,563 --> 00:25:39,262
- Keep working out regularly. - Great.

778
00:25:39,263 --> 00:25:40,861
Great. His figure improved a lot.

779
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,272
- Well... Yes. - My gosh.

780
00:25:42,273 --> 00:25:44,131
Ye Rin. Since the show airs...

781
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,772
early in the morning, you must come...

782
00:25:46,773 --> 00:25:48,542
- to work even earlier. - Right.

783
00:25:48,543 --> 00:25:49,841
- Right. - It must not be easy...

784
00:25:49,842 --> 00:25:50,911
to do that every week.

785
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:52,611
- Does your show air at 7am? - Yes.

786
00:25:52,612 --> 00:25:53,941
- You must be here by 6am then. - Yes.

787
00:25:53,942 --> 00:25:55,381
- We must be here by 6am. - You must be here before it starts.

788
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:57,212
- Then you must wake up before 5am. - My gosh.

789
00:25:57,213 --> 00:25:58,411
- Yes. - My gosh.

790
00:25:58,412 --> 00:25:59,952
- That's really early. - I'm sure we all wake up...

791
00:25:59,953 --> 00:26:01,881
- earlier than that. - Right. Around 4am.

792
00:26:01,882 --> 00:26:04,651
- I have to be at work by 4:30am. - My gosh.

793
00:26:04,652 --> 00:26:07,091
- So I can prepare for the show. - Right.

794
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:08,421
- To prepare for everything. - To make sure it runs smoothly.

795
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:10,361
You probably have to review some stuff...

796
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:11,591
- for the show as well. - Right.

797
00:26:11,592 --> 00:26:14,161
I have to take the first bus, but I always miss it.

798
00:26:14,162 --> 00:26:15,371
Then how do you get to work?

799
00:26:15,372 --> 00:26:18,202
I take a taxi. But I made a rule for myself.

800
00:26:18,203 --> 00:26:19,779
That I would only take the taxi once a week.

801
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:21,171
But I always fail.

802
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:22,932
Just this week, I took the taxi three times.

803
00:26:23,543 --> 00:26:25,072
- I had to take a taxi today too. - You failed?

804
00:26:25,073 --> 00:26:27,081
- I woke up late today. - Where do you live?

805
00:26:27,082 --> 00:26:28,983
Then Shin Ho, when do you work out?

806
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:30,852
Come on, Jong Kook.

807
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:32,782
Why are you asking him a question?

808
00:26:32,783 --> 00:26:35,222
- He wakes up early in the morning. - What is this?

809
00:26:35,223 --> 00:26:37,992
I was curious about his schedule. Like when he works out.

810
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:39,522
You seem very interested in Shin Ho.

811
00:26:39,523 --> 00:26:41,822
- Seriously. - He has a unique schedule.

812
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:44,361
I was wondering about his workout schedule...

813
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,262
- after seeing a huge improvement. - How he improved that much?

814
00:26:46,263 --> 00:26:48,101
- Since I come to work early, - Right.

815
00:26:48,102 --> 00:26:50,002
- I can get off early too. - I see.

816
00:26:50,003 --> 00:26:51,631
- So I go to the gym... - As soon as you finish?

817
00:26:51,632 --> 00:26:53,202
- as soon as I finish. - My gosh.

818
00:26:53,203 --> 00:26:55,712
- I start with pull-down exercises. - I love it.

819
00:26:55,713 --> 00:26:57,813
Shin Ho. Talk about that on his channel.

820
00:26:58,682 --> 00:27:00,881
- I can't tolerate this anymore. - All right. Fine.

821
00:27:00,882 --> 00:27:02,181
I also have a question.

822
00:27:02,182 --> 00:27:04,351
So I've met everyone on your team today.

823
00:27:04,352 --> 00:27:06,552
After meeting you all, I noticed that your ages vary.

824
00:27:06,553 --> 00:27:08,581
- Based on the age differences... - The generational gap.

825
00:27:08,582 --> 00:27:10,722
- There might be a gap among you. - Right. There might be.

826
00:27:10,723 --> 00:27:12,443
Ye Rin, whom are you close to on your team?

827
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:15,562
It looks like we planned the outfits together.

828
00:27:15,563 --> 00:27:16,631
Right.

829
00:27:16,632 --> 00:27:18,262
- You're closest to her. - The pink outfits.

830
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,631
- The youngest writer? - We're around the same age too...

831
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:21,702
- within our team. - I see.

832
00:27:21,703 --> 00:27:23,331
So when I joined the team,

833
00:27:23,332 --> 00:27:26,171
I was the last one to join. The team was already assembled.

834
00:27:26,172 --> 00:27:27,972
When she looked at me, she had this gaze.

835
00:27:27,973 --> 00:27:29,513
- "Gosh, I'm saved." - "I'm saved."

836
00:27:30,372 --> 00:27:32,411
- "At last." - "She's around my age."

837
00:27:32,412 --> 00:27:34,242
- Yes. You'll have things in common. - That's how she looked at me.

838
00:27:34,243 --> 00:27:35,552
- She talked to me then. - Right.

839
00:27:35,553 --> 00:27:37,012
I asked for her number first.

840
00:27:37,013 --> 00:27:38,982
- Really? - Because she's around your age?

841
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:40,022
- Yes. - I bet.

842
00:27:40,023 --> 00:27:41,782
They're working together as a team.

843
00:27:41,783 --> 00:27:42,952
And it's a huge difference to have someone...

844
00:27:42,953 --> 00:27:44,292
- Of course. - around your age.

845
00:27:44,293 --> 00:27:47,822
Personally, I thought Ye Rin and I were the closest on the team.

846
00:27:47,823 --> 00:27:50,161
- We're close. - Gosh, she's disappointed.

847
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:52,203
- That's understandable. - No.

848
00:27:52,362 --> 00:27:54,131
- You're all close. - Right.

849
00:27:54,132 --> 00:27:56,002
- Right. - You're all close.

850
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,401
You must also notice this dynamic within the team. Right?

851
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,341
I thought we were really close.

852
00:28:00,342 --> 00:28:01,901
(Now, this becomes a love square.)

853
00:28:01,902 --> 00:28:03,411
- Amid this, Hyung Ju was like, - Right.

854
00:28:03,412 --> 00:28:04,542
"What about me?"

855
00:28:04,543 --> 00:28:05,581
She definitely said...

856
00:28:05,582 --> 00:28:07,111
- I was like her dad. - Hold on.

857
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:08,611
- We're all very close. - You know what?

858
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:10,452
You have to understand this, though.

859
00:28:10,453 --> 00:28:13,421
- Right. Yes, they're different. - Parents and friends are different.

860
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:14,782
- I can't drop the honorifics. - They're different.

861
00:28:14,783 --> 00:28:16,252
- Right. - You can't drop the honorifics?

862
00:28:16,253 --> 00:28:18,121
- But you guys bond as a team. - You can't do that.

863
00:28:18,122 --> 00:28:20,121
- But it's the same with us. - Right.

864
00:28:20,122 --> 00:28:21,921
- When we film TV shows, - Yes.

865
00:28:21,922 --> 00:28:23,591
- the age groups vary a lot. - Right.

866
00:28:23,592 --> 00:28:25,131
- But peers are more comfortable. - Of course.

867
00:28:25,132 --> 00:28:26,562
- We're so comfortable today. - Totally.

868
00:28:26,563 --> 00:28:28,871
- We can understand each other well. - Right.

869
00:28:28,872 --> 00:28:30,671
- Now that we're here, - Yes.

870
00:28:30,672 --> 00:28:32,502
We'll play some games, Ye Rin.

871
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,972
- We came at the perfect time. - Totally.

872
00:28:34,973 --> 00:28:37,411
- I hope we can give you... - What's this?

873
00:28:37,412 --> 00:28:39,111
Many good presents through our games.

874
00:28:39,112 --> 00:28:40,282
- Read it, please. - What is it?

875
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,081
"The youngest directors and writers became VIP taxi passengers..."

876
00:28:42,082 --> 00:28:43,111
"with the early morning schedule."

877
00:28:43,112 --> 00:28:44,982
"Two T-money cards, each charged with two hundred dollars."

878
00:28:44,983 --> 00:28:46,982
(2 transportation cards, each charged with 200 dollars)

879
00:28:46,983 --> 00:28:48,022
The transportation cards.

880
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:49,522
- This is great. - Oh, my.

881
00:28:49,523 --> 00:28:51,651
- My gosh, I love it. - This is great.

882
00:28:51,652 --> 00:28:53,012
(The youngest members of the show)

883
00:28:53,223 --> 00:28:54,762
The taxi fares add up, you know?

884
00:28:54,763 --> 00:28:56,831
- They can use them on taxis too? - Right.

885
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:59,362
- That will last 2 months. - It will last 2 months?

886
00:28:59,803 --> 00:29:01,431
- Great. - But we must succeed...

887
00:29:01,432 --> 00:29:03,902
- to be able to gift them. - Right. We must succeed for sure.

888
00:29:04,703 --> 00:29:06,242
I hope it's an easy game.

889
00:29:06,243 --> 00:29:08,702
(Guess Who: Singers)

890
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:12,382
(Round 1: Correctly guess the names of 4 singers in a row.)

891
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:13,842
(They must guess the names within 3 seconds.)

892
00:29:13,843 --> 00:29:14,982
- I'm not so good at this. - What is this?

893
00:29:14,983 --> 00:29:16,111
We have to guess the names with the pictures?

894
00:29:16,112 --> 00:29:17,782
- Yes. Four in a row... - Gosh, this is hard.

895
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,722
Oh, no. When they show us the pictures,

896
00:29:19,723 --> 00:29:21,322
- you can't... - It's weird.

897
00:29:21,323 --> 00:29:22,822
You recognize the person, but it's hard to say the name.

898
00:29:22,823 --> 00:29:23,952
- Right. It's hard. - Yes.

899
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:27,062
The names of new idol groups are difficult to remember.

900
00:29:27,063 --> 00:29:28,762
- That's hard. - Will there be idol groups too?

901
00:29:28,763 --> 00:29:30,292
- Probably. - Yes. They're singers too.

902
00:29:30,293 --> 00:29:31,853
- My gosh. That's... - They're singers.

903
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,302
- My gosh. - Gosh, idol groups...

904
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:35,263
All right. This is our first try.

905
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:36,532
- Round 1. - Round 1.

906
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:37,848
- Let's begin right away. - Will Tae Hyun start?

907
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:39,141
- Okay. - Let's do this.

908
00:29:39,142 --> 00:29:41,401
- Let's go. - Let's go.

909
00:29:41,402 --> 00:29:43,141
You must guess them in three seconds after we show the pictures.

910
00:29:43,142 --> 00:29:44,812
- Great. - Gosh, this one is hard.

911
00:29:44,813 --> 00:29:46,413
- This is nerve-racking. And... - Ready.

912
00:29:47,743 --> 00:29:48,743
Go.

913
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:50,452
- In 1, 2... - Kim Bum Soo.

914
00:29:50,453 --> 00:29:52,352
- That one was easy. - That's easy.

915
00:29:52,422 --> 00:29:54,453
- This is easy. - Ready. Go.

916
00:29:55,152 --> 00:29:56,553
In 1, 2, 3.

917
00:29:56,723 --> 00:29:58,253
- BoA. - My gosh.

918
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,861
- Two, three. - BoA.

919
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:01,191
(He runs out of time.)

920
00:30:01,192 --> 00:30:02,592
- This... - Come on. Her picture...

921
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,133
- This... - Come on. Her picture...

922
00:30:04,233 --> 00:30:06,302
- But he was right. - You must give me an old photo!

923
00:30:06,303 --> 00:30:07,783
- Like when she sang "NO.1!" - Right.

924
00:30:08,063 --> 00:30:10,033
- That's her recent picture! - Gosh.

925
00:30:10,533 --> 00:30:11,631
- Hey. - What is this?

926
00:30:11,632 --> 00:30:13,272
- How could you not recognize her? - That's BoA.

927
00:30:13,273 --> 00:30:14,302
Anyone can guess that's BoA.

928
00:30:14,303 --> 00:30:16,043
You must give me an old photo of her!

929
00:30:16,473 --> 00:30:18,212
- Think about it in BoA's shoes. - Where's her old photo?

930
00:30:18,213 --> 00:30:20,242
- They can't present an old photo. - That was...

931
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:22,081
- This is such a recent picture. - But it's still BoA.

932
00:30:22,082 --> 00:30:23,581
- Think about it in her perspective. - What is this?

933
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:26,151
What about you? Would you be happy if they used your old photo?

934
00:30:26,152 --> 00:30:30,222
- I look better in my old photos. - Hey. Over there.

935
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:31,999
- Everyone, including the writers... - What was that?

936
00:30:32,023 --> 00:30:33,063
I mean...

937
00:30:33,463 --> 00:30:35,222
- Did you recognize her? Be honest. - That one was easy.

938
00:30:35,223 --> 00:30:36,262
- Did you recognize her? - How could you not?

939
00:30:36,263 --> 00:30:37,563
That was so easy.

940
00:30:38,293 --> 00:30:39,703
- I mean... - Hey, you come here.

941
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:41,632
- You go 1st. - I'll go 1st.

942
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:42,772
No, listen.

943
00:30:42,773 --> 00:30:44,431
- How could he not recognize her? - That was easy.

944
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:45,572
- What was that? - The photo...

945
00:30:45,573 --> 00:30:47,401
It was basically a giveaway.

946
00:30:47,402 --> 00:30:48,543
But the photo...

947
00:30:50,412 --> 00:30:52,712
- I haven't met her recently. - You...

948
00:30:52,713 --> 00:30:55,353
Then do you think he got it right because he met Bum Soo recently?

949
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:57,351
Did he get it right because he met Bum Soo recently?

950
00:30:57,352 --> 00:30:59,052
- Bum Soo... - Hey, he's been looking...

951
00:30:59,053 --> 00:31:00,823
- like the Almighty lately. - Listen.

952
00:31:01,283 --> 00:31:03,252
You know, as for Bum Soo, that's his typical face.

953
00:31:03,253 --> 00:31:05,523
You see that face a lot in many of his pictures.

954
00:31:06,122 --> 00:31:08,121
- All right. - And giving us profile pictures...

955
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:11,361
that look much better than they do in person can be risky.

956
00:31:11,362 --> 00:31:14,562
Hey! Celebrities must look good in the pictures.

957
00:31:14,563 --> 00:31:15,802
- You know... - Old photos...

958
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:17,043
- Gosh. - You know what he did?

959
00:31:17,303 --> 00:31:18,431
He was so close to saying her name.

960
00:31:18,432 --> 00:31:19,642
- "BoA." - "BoA."

961
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:21,272
It was a buzzer beater.

962
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:23,371
- All right. Let's go. - Okay.

963
00:31:23,372 --> 00:31:25,292
- Good luck. - We must win the present for them.

964
00:31:25,372 --> 00:31:27,012
- We'll do better. - Gosh, Round One...

965
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:28,782
- We must pass Round One quickly. - All right. Let's go.

966
00:31:28,783 --> 00:31:30,823
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go. - In 1, 2, 3. Here we go.

967
00:31:31,152 --> 00:31:32,452
- Let's do a good job. - This is your second try.

968
00:31:32,453 --> 00:31:33,552
- Ready. - I'm going first, right?

969
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:35,122
- Yes. Ready. Go. - Yes.

970
00:31:35,652 --> 00:31:36,992
In 1, 2, 3.

971
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,621
- Young Ji! - Yes.

972
00:31:38,622 --> 00:31:39,793
- Young Ji. - My gosh.

973
00:31:40,223 --> 00:31:42,743
- Gosh, I was confused for a second. - Goodness. That was hard.

974
00:31:42,862 --> 00:31:45,132
- I couldn't guess BoA's name. - Ready. Go.

975
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,462
- In 1, 2... - Jay Park.

976
00:31:47,463 --> 00:31:48,463
- Hold on. - That's it.

977
00:31:48,464 --> 00:31:50,073
You gave him such an easy one.

978
00:31:50,503 --> 00:31:52,341
- What is this? Jay Park? - Hey.

979
00:31:52,342 --> 00:31:53,441
- What are you saying? - Jay Park.

980
00:31:53,442 --> 00:31:54,442
- Okay. - Okay.

981
00:31:54,443 --> 00:31:55,712
- All right. Let's go. - Great.

982
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:56,911
- Let's pass Round One. - Do well.

983
00:31:56,912 --> 00:31:58,012
- Let's go. - It's about the spots.

984
00:31:58,013 --> 00:31:59,642
Ready. Go.

985
00:32:00,243 --> 00:32:01,512
- In one... - Lee Seung Chul.

986
00:32:01,513 --> 00:32:03,482
- My gosh. - Seung Chul. Okay.

987
00:32:03,483 --> 00:32:05,151
- What if we pass Round One? - Great.

988
00:32:05,152 --> 00:32:06,952
- We'll pass it. - Only mine was hard.

989
00:32:06,953 --> 00:32:08,522
- Seung Chul is easy to guess. - Mine won't be hard, right?

990
00:32:08,523 --> 00:32:09,523
- Ready... - Mine won't be hard, right?

991
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:11,484
- Other questions are always easier. - Ready. Go.

992
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:13,161
- In 1, 2, 3. - Lee Juck!

993
00:32:13,162 --> 00:32:14,592
(That's correct.)

994
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:16,431
Lee Juck!

995
00:32:16,432 --> 00:32:18,533
(Everyone answers it correctly.)

996
00:32:20,102 --> 00:32:21,901
(He's especially excited.)

997
00:32:21,902 --> 00:32:24,572
- We completed Round One. - Yes!

998
00:32:24,573 --> 00:32:25,641
(They pass Round 1 only after 2 tries.)

999
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:26,702
We did it.

1000
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:28,102
- Nice. - Yes!

1001
00:32:28,402 --> 00:32:29,712
- Nice. - We passed Round One.

1002
00:32:29,713 --> 00:32:31,841
- We could've passed it earlier. - My gosh. That was easy.

1003
00:32:31,842 --> 00:32:34,312
- That was easy. - Take a taxi.

1004
00:32:34,313 --> 00:32:35,341
That was easy.

1005
00:32:35,342 --> 00:32:36,982
- Ye Rin can take taxis... - Yes.

1006
00:32:36,983 --> 00:32:38,851
For two months.

1007
00:32:38,852 --> 00:32:40,682
(Take taxis as many times as you want.)

1008
00:32:41,283 --> 00:32:42,921
- All right. - Great.

1009
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:45,121
- We passed Round One quickly. - Great.

1010
00:32:45,122 --> 00:32:46,762
- In my opinion, we could have... - No way.

1011
00:32:46,763 --> 00:32:48,023
Passed Round 1 on our 1st try.

1012
00:32:50,993 --> 00:32:53,002
- Hey. - Let's be honest.

1013
00:32:53,003 --> 00:32:54,962
- BoA... - If you didn't stutter...

1014
00:32:54,963 --> 00:32:56,131
He stuttered.

1015
00:32:56,132 --> 00:32:58,332
- Gosh, I can't believe he did that. - BoA...

1016
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:00,542
- My gosh. I need to watch TV. - Seriously.

1017
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:02,003
We passed Round One.

1018
00:33:02,473 --> 00:33:04,411
If you want to keep going to Round Two,

1019
00:33:04,412 --> 00:33:05,441
you can say, "Go."

1020
00:33:05,442 --> 00:33:08,213
You must choose to either keep going or stop.

1021
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,052
- In 1, 2, 3. - Go.

1022
00:33:10,053 --> 00:33:12,253
- Go. - Okay.

1023
00:33:12,483 --> 00:33:14,182
Of course. She must keep going.

1024
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:16,552
What is it?

1025
00:33:16,553 --> 00:33:18,191
"After the nerve-racking live broadcast in the morning,"

1026
00:33:18,192 --> 00:33:19,522
"go shopping to relieve your stress."

1027
00:33:19,523 --> 00:33:21,262
"Department store gift certificate for 700 dollars."

1028
00:33:21,263 --> 00:33:22,691
(Round 2 prize)

1029
00:33:22,692 --> 00:33:24,331
- Seven hundred dollars? - Seven hundred dollars.

1030
00:33:24,332 --> 00:33:25,939
- Seven hundred dollars. - This is awesome.

1031
00:33:25,963 --> 00:33:27,243
- Ji Eun. - That's a big amount.

1032
00:33:27,432 --> 00:33:29,072
(Screaming)

1033
00:33:29,073 --> 00:33:30,831
You can come to work in a taxi.

1034
00:33:30,832 --> 00:33:32,872
Then go to the department store.

1035
00:33:33,372 --> 00:33:34,742
That's great.

1036
00:33:34,743 --> 00:33:35,841
(Instead of a team gathering, they'll go shopping as a team.)

1037
00:33:35,842 --> 00:33:38,013
Gosh, that's a big amount. I like it.

1038
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:39,381
- She... - This is great.

1039
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:41,081
- Go to the department store. - She loves shopping.

1040
00:33:41,082 --> 00:33:42,812
Her hobby is shopping.

1041
00:33:42,813 --> 00:33:44,052
- Great. - She likes shopping.

1042
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:45,181
- Shopping is great. - That's great.

1043
00:33:45,182 --> 00:33:46,421
That's a good cardio exercise.

1044
00:33:46,422 --> 00:33:47,723
Gosh. Stop it.

1045
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:49,222
- You know... - Come on.

1046
00:33:49,223 --> 00:33:50,421
How could you connect that to cardio?

1047
00:33:50,422 --> 00:33:51,921
- It has nothing to do with cardio. - Gosh.

1048
00:33:51,922 --> 00:33:53,161
Seriously. It's an effective cardio workout.

1049
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:54,492
Why would you bring that up now?

1050
00:33:54,493 --> 00:33:55,691
- Gosh. - If you don't walk a lot...

1051
00:33:55,692 --> 00:33:58,162
Then climb the escalator like a stepmill.

1052
00:33:58,733 --> 00:34:01,202
People actually do that. They just go in reverse.

1053
00:34:01,203 --> 00:34:02,601
(That's a great idea.)

1054
00:34:02,602 --> 00:34:03,972
What's the game for Round Two?

1055
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:06,202
(Round 2: Guess the names of the singers...)

1056
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:08,743
(and the names of their groups.)

1057
00:34:09,042 --> 00:34:10,242
- My gosh. - This is hard.

1058
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:12,881
- Groups? Then they're idol groups. - Give us more than three seconds.

1059
00:34:12,882 --> 00:34:14,082
- You'll still get three seconds. - This is hard.

1060
00:34:14,083 --> 00:34:15,243
I said no.

1061
00:34:15,583 --> 00:34:17,211
- Hey. - Including the names of the groups?

1062
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:19,182
- It's not enough time to answer. - Three seconds...

1063
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:20,381
- We can't say all that. - Look.

1064
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:21,521
Kim Jong Kook of Turbo.

1065
00:34:21,522 --> 00:34:22,893
I can't say it that fast.

1066
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:26,022
By the way, we have many tries left.

1067
00:34:26,123 --> 00:34:27,461
And we can use the coupons.

1068
00:34:27,462 --> 00:34:29,061
- This is hard. - Let's try it.

1069
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:30,631
- Do I go first? - We can change the order.

1070
00:34:30,632 --> 00:34:31,762
- Let's change it. - How?

1071
00:34:31,763 --> 00:34:33,061
- Yeon Seok, you know idol groups. - Yeon Seok, you go first.

1072
00:34:33,062 --> 00:34:35,162
- I don't know that many groups. - You're younger than us.

1073
00:34:35,163 --> 00:34:36,203
- Right. - Right.

1074
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:38,302
- But Yeon Seok is... - It's iffy to go last...

1075
00:34:38,303 --> 00:34:39,771
- and get it wrong. - But you're a singer.

1076
00:34:39,772 --> 00:34:41,541
- Can you go last? - Yeon Seok doesn't know.

1077
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:42,811
He doesn't know that many movies either.

1078
00:34:42,812 --> 00:34:44,512
- I'm not good at this. - Really?

1079
00:34:44,513 --> 00:34:45,642
He doesn't even know that many dramas.

1080
00:34:45,643 --> 00:34:47,182
- Really? - I'm not good at this.

1081
00:34:47,183 --> 00:34:49,211
You know what? We're all working...

1082
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:51,082
in show business.

1083
00:34:51,083 --> 00:34:54,282
But it feels different to be watching us film the show, right?

1084
00:34:54,283 --> 00:34:56,151
- This isn't common for radio shows. - They don't do that.

1085
00:34:56,152 --> 00:34:57,222
- Games are rare on radio shows. - Right.

1086
00:34:57,223 --> 00:34:58,223
You guys are having fun.

1087
00:34:58,224 --> 00:35:00,262
- We usually make the quizzes. - Right.

1088
00:35:00,263 --> 00:35:01,361
- We have to guess them now. - We must guess them now.

1089
00:35:01,362 --> 00:35:02,691
- Right. - So being on the receiving end...

1090
00:35:02,692 --> 00:35:03,692
This is so fun.

1091
00:35:04,292 --> 00:35:06,333
- Here we go. - This won't be easy.

1092
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,731
Yeon Seok, you're up.

1093
00:35:07,732 --> 00:35:09,372
- Here I go. - Do well. Focus!

1094
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:10,373
Ready. Go.

1095
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,572
- In 1, 2, 3. - Who is this?

1096
00:35:12,573 --> 00:35:13,841
- Incorrect! - Tablo.

1097
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:14,902
Tablo of Epik High!

1098
00:35:15,973 --> 00:35:16,973
Come on!

1099
00:35:17,312 --> 00:35:18,611
- In 1, 2, 3. - Who is this?

1100
00:35:18,612 --> 00:35:19,912
- Incorrect! - Tablo.

1101
00:35:19,913 --> 00:35:21,042
Tablo of Epik High!

1102
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:24,481
(Sighing)

1103
00:35:24,482 --> 00:35:26,453
Don't you know "Aren't you tired?"

1104
00:35:26,783 --> 00:35:28,382
- Aren't you tired? - Aren't you tired?

1105
00:35:28,982 --> 00:35:30,522
(Aren't you tired?)

1106
00:35:30,723 --> 00:35:32,052
Oh, Tablo of Epik High.

1107
00:35:32,053 --> 00:35:34,622
- But this... Right, the picture. - The picture...

1108
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:36,833
- Right. - looks kind of different...

1109
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:39,202
- It's not Tablo's signature photo. - Doesn't it kind of look...

1110
00:35:39,203 --> 00:35:41,262
- This is too... - It should be a signature picture.

1111
00:35:41,263 --> 00:35:43,332
- But... - Do you understand my BoA thing?

1112
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,572
Wait, BoA was...

1113
00:35:45,573 --> 00:35:47,142
- It was kind of like that. - I thought...

1114
00:35:47,143 --> 00:35:49,472
- BoA was unacceptable. - it was Kyu Hyun for a second.

1115
00:35:49,473 --> 00:35:50,941
No, I could've guessed this one.

1116
00:35:50,942 --> 00:35:53,311
- I should've been there. - You should go first, then.

1117
00:35:53,312 --> 00:35:55,242
- I'll go first again. - Why does Tablo...

1118
00:35:55,243 --> 00:35:56,582
- look like Mr. Bogus here? - Oh, gosh.

1119
00:35:56,583 --> 00:35:58,611
- Exactly. - Tablo kind of looks like Bogus.

1120
00:35:58,612 --> 00:35:59,882
- He really does. - Yes.

1121
00:35:59,982 --> 00:36:01,981
- Tablo looks... - Anyway,

1122
00:36:01,982 --> 00:36:03,553
- we failed our third try. - Oh, no.

1123
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:04,892
We still have...

1124
00:36:04,893 --> 00:36:06,722
- Let's try one more time, - We still have many tries.

1125
00:36:06,723 --> 00:36:08,323
- and then use the bonus coupon. - Okay.

1126
00:36:08,362 --> 00:36:09,532
Okay. Let's go!

1127
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:10,662
Okay. Here we go.

1128
00:36:10,663 --> 00:36:12,362
Ready. Go.

1129
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:14,731
- In 1, 2... - Who is this?

1130
00:36:14,732 --> 00:36:16,631
(Group name, Name)

1131
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,702
Who is this?

1132
00:36:17,703 --> 00:36:20,103
("Who is this?")

1133
00:36:20,473 --> 00:36:22,102
- Come on. - Who is this?

1134
00:36:22,103 --> 00:36:24,441
- Jisoo! BLACKPINK! - Come on!

1135
00:36:24,442 --> 00:36:25,612
- In 1, 2... - Who is this?

1136
00:36:26,413 --> 00:36:28,041
(BLACKPINK's Jisoo, a global star)

1137
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,782
- Jisoo! - BLACKPINK!

1138
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,453
- Come on. That's Jisoo! - BLACKPINK!

1139
00:36:32,513 --> 00:36:34,322
- "DDU-DU DDU-DU." - Oh, it's Jisoo.

1140
00:36:34,323 --> 00:36:36,393
I knew it. I did.

1141
00:36:36,592 --> 00:36:38,692
I knew it. I did.

1142
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:40,762
- That's obviously Jisoo. - The picture is...

1143
00:36:40,763 --> 00:36:41,892
That's a recent picture.

1144
00:36:41,893 --> 00:36:44,091
You could've chosen one of her onstage.

1145
00:36:44,092 --> 00:36:45,131
"Onstage."

1146
00:36:45,132 --> 00:36:47,402
- I can't tell by this picture. - Tae Hyun.

1147
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:49,773
Your "DDU-DU DDU-DU" dance looked like Shim Sin's dance.

1148
00:36:50,402 --> 00:36:51,472
Isn't this "DDU-DU DDU-DU?"

1149
00:36:51,473 --> 00:36:52,802
This isn't it.

1150
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:54,441
- It's not? - That was Shim Sin's dance.

1151
00:36:54,442 --> 00:36:56,812
Of course, I know you, Jisoo.

1152
00:36:57,243 --> 00:36:59,111
- Goodness. - If it was a picture of her...

1153
00:36:59,112 --> 00:37:01,811
- onstage, I would've known. - That was Jisoo of BLACKPINK.

1154
00:37:01,812 --> 00:37:04,111
(How could you get BLACKPINK wrong?)

1155
00:37:04,112 --> 00:37:06,122
- Come to the end. - You're hopeless.

1156
00:37:06,123 --> 00:37:07,452
- Hold on. Yeon Seok... - Jong Kook.

1157
00:37:07,453 --> 00:37:09,152
You didn't know Epik High!

1158
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:12,962
- Epik High... - You got BoA wrong.

1159
00:37:13,592 --> 00:37:15,021
How could you not know BLACKPINK...

1160
00:37:15,022 --> 00:37:16,291
I can't say anything because of BoA.

1161
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:17,832
Should we use a coupon?

1162
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:18,833
But Jisoo was so...

1163
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:20,832
- If so... - We need to change up the mood.

1164
00:37:20,833 --> 00:37:22,731
- Let's use a coupon on Ye Rin. - Jae Suk.

1165
00:37:22,732 --> 00:37:24,771
- If so... - I'll sit out.

1166
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:26,501
- No. - Ye Rin.

1167
00:37:26,502 --> 00:37:28,442
It's not necessarily you who will sit out.

1168
00:37:28,573 --> 00:37:31,242
- Ye Rin will pick one person. - You can pick.

1169
00:37:31,243 --> 00:37:33,012
Just stare at one person.

1170
00:37:33,013 --> 00:37:34,782
- "You, get out." - Like that.

1171
00:37:34,783 --> 00:37:35,783
In one...

1172
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:37,652
(Staring)

1173
00:37:38,453 --> 00:37:39,953
- Okay! - So obvious.

1174
00:37:40,553 --> 00:37:42,251
- So obvious. - Nice.

1175
00:37:42,252 --> 00:37:43,521
Which turn should Ye Rin be?

1176
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:44,522
She should go first.

1177
00:37:44,523 --> 00:37:45,751
Ye Rin, let's go.

1178
00:37:45,752 --> 00:37:47,762
- To make it fun... - Let's go.

1179
00:37:47,763 --> 00:37:49,933
- We used the bonus coupon. - You can sit there.

1180
00:37:49,993 --> 00:37:51,992
Go there and get some advice.

1181
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:53,163
Okay.

1182
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,061
- Wait. - DJ Kook.

1183
00:37:55,062 --> 00:37:57,131
So, Ye Rim...

1184
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:58,631
- "Ye Rin." - Ye Rin.

1185
00:37:58,632 --> 00:38:00,671
- I'll keep my eye on you. - By the way, Shin Ho.

1186
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:01,872
- Yes? - What was that?

1187
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:03,772
Why are you looking at his back muscles?

1188
00:38:04,373 --> 00:38:05,672
When you sat down, he went...

1189
00:38:07,982 --> 00:38:09,283
Get a shot of my lats.

1190
00:38:09,513 --> 00:38:11,652
- Why are you communing here? - What is this?

1191
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:14,083
- What are you doing? - Amazing.

1192
00:38:14,982 --> 00:38:16,622
- Oh, my. - His back...

1193
00:38:16,623 --> 00:38:17,852
He was touching Jong Kook's back.

1194
00:38:17,853 --> 00:38:19,791
Jong Kook was also saying, "Hey, touch my back."

1195
00:38:19,792 --> 00:38:21,961
He suddenly opened up his back muscles like this.

1196
00:38:21,962 --> 00:38:23,562
Of course, I should.

1197
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:24,862
So impressive.

1198
00:38:26,132 --> 00:38:27,401
- Seriously. - "Hey, touch my back."

1199
00:38:27,402 --> 00:38:29,771
- He's different. - He opened up his back muscles.

1200
00:38:29,772 --> 00:38:31,901
They became even broader when he did that.

1201
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:33,841
Okay. Nice.

1202
00:38:33,842 --> 00:38:34,972
Let's cheer for Ye Rin.

1203
00:38:34,973 --> 00:38:37,472
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1204
00:38:37,473 --> 00:38:38,611
Okay. Let's go.

1205
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,842
- Let's go! - Please.

1206
00:38:40,243 --> 00:38:41,311
- Let's go! - Please.

1207
00:38:41,312 --> 00:38:43,312
Ready. Go.

1208
00:38:44,152 --> 00:38:46,522
- In 1, 2, 3. Incorrect! - Eun Ji Won. Oh, no!

1209
00:38:46,652 --> 00:38:48,651
- Right? It's so... - Eun Ji Won of SECHSKIES!

1210
00:38:48,652 --> 00:38:49,892
He's not from my generation.

1211
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:52,123
- In 1, 2, 3. Incorrect! - Eun Ji Won. Oh, no!

1212
00:38:52,652 --> 00:38:54,922
- In 1, 2, 3. Incorrect! - Eun Ji Won. Oh, no!

1213
00:38:55,092 --> 00:38:56,592
(Scoffing)

1214
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,561
Eun Ji Won of SECHSKIES!

1215
00:38:58,562 --> 00:39:00,302
He's not from my generation.

1216
00:39:00,303 --> 00:39:01,501
He's not from Ye Rin's generation.

1217
00:39:01,502 --> 00:39:03,572
- Come on. - Am I from BLACKPINK's generation?

1218
00:39:03,573 --> 00:39:04,901
- I mean... - Why did you give...

1219
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:06,603
- Ye Rin that question? - Exactly.

1220
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,401
Still, I saw him on "2 Days 1 Night."

1221
00:39:08,402 --> 00:39:09,472
She just knows him as a variety show personality.

1222
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:11,619
- Eun Ji Won of "2 Days 1 Night?" - Yes, that's what I know him from.

1223
00:39:11,643 --> 00:39:12,783
That's also right.

1224
00:39:12,942 --> 00:39:14,412
- Eun Ji Won of "2 Days 1 Night." - His group...

1225
00:39:14,413 --> 00:39:16,282
- But... - Ye Rin.

1226
00:39:16,283 --> 00:39:17,751
You get why I didn't get Jisoo, right?

1227
00:39:17,752 --> 00:39:19,421
- It's hard. - It's hard, right?

1228
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,722
- That's what I was saying. - It's so hard.

1229
00:39:20,723 --> 00:39:22,381
- It was hard. - It was.

1230
00:39:22,382 --> 00:39:24,022
- It's too hard. - It's okay.

1231
00:39:24,123 --> 00:39:25,643
- We'll make up for it. - SECHSKIES...

1232
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:27,461
- Okay. - Let's try again.

1233
00:39:27,462 --> 00:39:29,962
I see Jong Kook doesn't want to go first.

1234
00:39:31,163 --> 00:39:32,662
- I'm third. Okay. Nice. - Okay.

1235
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:33,861
Let's try it like this.

1236
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:35,102
- Let's go! - SECHSKIES.

1237
00:39:35,103 --> 00:39:36,203
Ready.

1238
00:39:36,933 --> 00:39:39,131
- This is the fifth try. - Focus!

1239
00:39:39,132 --> 00:39:40,902
- We just need you to focus. - Got it.

1240
00:39:40,973 --> 00:39:42,072
- All right. - In 1, 2, 3.

1241
00:39:42,073 --> 00:39:43,172
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1242
00:39:45,473 --> 00:39:47,342
Ready. Go.

1243
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:49,582
- In one... - Lee Je Hoon of Cool!

1244
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:50,952
- That wasn't easy. - Let's go!

1245
00:39:50,953 --> 00:39:52,211
Nice. There we go.

1246
00:39:52,212 --> 00:39:54,322
- You had to know that one. - I had to know that one.

1247
00:39:54,323 --> 00:39:57,053
- Okay. - Yoo Jae Suk!

1248
00:39:57,123 --> 00:39:58,291
- That was fast. - Okay!

1249
00:39:58,292 --> 00:39:59,521
- You have to be fast. - We can do it!

1250
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,021
- The second turn. Ready. - Focus, Yeon Seok.

1251
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:03,332
- You just have to glance at it. - Ready. Go.

1252
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:04,433
Say the group name first.

1253
00:40:04,493 --> 00:40:06,731
- In 1, 2... - KARINA! aespa!

1254
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:07,802
There we go.

1255
00:40:07,803 --> 00:40:09,303
(Correct)

1256
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,802
KARINA! aespa!

1257
00:40:10,803 --> 00:40:11,872
There we go.

1258
00:40:11,873 --> 00:40:13,341
(Exhilarating)

1259
00:40:13,342 --> 00:40:15,062
- You have to get KARINA. - That was great.

1260
00:40:15,342 --> 00:40:17,012
- That was great. - Yoo Yeon Seok!

1261
00:40:17,013 --> 00:40:18,872
(Jong Kook's rival, Yeon Seok, got a right answer first.)

1262
00:40:18,873 --> 00:40:20,111
How did you get KARINA?

1263
00:40:20,112 --> 00:40:21,282
How could I not know KARINA?

1264
00:40:21,283 --> 00:40:23,182
I know her, but I couldn't tell by that picture.

1265
00:40:23,183 --> 00:40:25,111
- KARINA of aespa. - So we just have to shout...

1266
00:40:25,112 --> 00:40:26,552
- something out first. - Exactly.

1267
00:40:26,553 --> 00:40:28,082
- First... - I also...

1268
00:40:28,083 --> 00:40:29,282
- Next. - Jong Kook.

1269
00:40:29,283 --> 00:40:30,823
- Jong Kook. Focus. - Hold on.

1270
00:40:30,993 --> 00:40:33,222
- Say the member's name first. - Just...

1271
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,521
- No. - Member or group,

1272
00:40:34,522 --> 00:40:36,332
- whatever you think of first. - Just shout it out.

1273
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:37,333
Just shout something out.

1274
00:40:37,334 --> 00:40:39,734
- But I really don't know. - You just need to say something.

1275
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,532
- Okay. Let's go. - Here we go.

1276
00:40:41,533 --> 00:40:43,473
Ready.

1277
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:45,702
Go.

1278
00:40:45,703 --> 00:40:48,302
(Group name, Name)

1279
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:49,303
- In 1, 2... - Hey.

1280
00:40:49,304 --> 00:40:51,672
(This is easy!)

1281
00:40:52,513 --> 00:40:54,682
- In 1, 2, 3. - Who is this?

1282
00:40:54,683 --> 00:40:56,751
- SEVENTEEN! - Who is this?

1283
00:40:56,752 --> 00:40:58,852
- Who is this? - SEVENTEEN!

1284
00:40:58,853 --> 00:41:01,552
(Group name: SEVENTEEN, Name: Mingyu)

1285
00:41:01,553 --> 00:41:02,892
- Mingyu. - That's Mingyu?

1286
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:04,323
Mingyu of SEVENTEEN.

1287
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:06,762
- Mingyu... - How can you not know SEVENTEEN?

1288
00:41:06,763 --> 00:41:07,961
Mingyu...

1289
00:41:07,962 --> 00:41:09,762
I know Mingyu well.

1290
00:41:09,763 --> 00:41:11,162
- He's from Anyang too. - Seungkwan and Hoshi.

1291
00:41:11,163 --> 00:41:12,231
We're close.

1292
00:41:12,232 --> 00:41:14,731
(Mingyu, as I said before, is from Anyang.)

1293
00:41:14,732 --> 00:41:15,763
Our Anyang boy.

1294
00:41:16,902 --> 00:41:18,001
- So why... - Don't misunderstand, Mingyu.

1295
00:41:18,002 --> 00:41:19,103
Look at this picture.

1296
00:41:19,672 --> 00:41:21,041
Mingyu, look at this.

1297
00:41:21,042 --> 00:41:22,603
Isn't this obviously Mingyu?

1298
00:41:22,842 --> 00:41:24,441
- Mingyu... - You should've said...

1299
00:41:24,442 --> 00:41:25,542
SEVENTEEN first.

1300
00:41:26,073 --> 00:41:28,882
I didn't think Mingyu was so...

1301
00:41:29,442 --> 00:41:32,151
I think Jong Kook needs to go first.

1302
00:41:32,152 --> 00:41:33,521
- This is hard. - Yes. Come to the front.

1303
00:41:33,522 --> 00:41:34,881
- Because... - Come to the front.

1304
00:41:34,882 --> 00:41:36,892
No. Just go at the very end.

1305
00:41:36,893 --> 00:41:39,422
Since we keep getting stuck when it's your turn...

1306
00:41:40,323 --> 00:41:42,022
We need to continue the game, at least.

1307
00:41:42,493 --> 00:41:44,832
- You were happy to see him. - If so, let's use it one more time.

1308
00:41:44,833 --> 00:41:46,361
- I think that'd be better. - Let's use it one more time.

1309
00:41:46,362 --> 00:41:47,603
- Just one more time. - Okay.

1310
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:49,361
- I think it'll be hard. - Because Jong Kook could...

1311
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:53,001
Who do you wish would sit out?

1312
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:54,142
Stare at him.

1313
00:41:54,143 --> 00:41:55,501
(You don't even need to ask.)

1314
00:41:55,502 --> 00:41:57,541
- Okay, Ye Rin. - Come to the end, Ye Rin.

1315
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:58,912
- You can go last. - Because...

1316
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:00,311
- It's okay. - She didn't even stare at him.

1317
00:42:00,312 --> 00:42:01,841
- What if I get it wrong? - Let's go!

1318
00:42:01,842 --> 00:42:03,352
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1319
00:42:03,353 --> 00:42:04,453
Let's go, Ye Rin.

1320
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:06,582
(Laughing)

1321
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:08,553
Are you the new DJ?

1322
00:42:09,922 --> 00:42:11,723
"Iron Man Power FM."

1323
00:42:11,853 --> 00:42:13,413
- "Iron Man Power." - "Iron Man Power."

1324
00:42:13,692 --> 00:42:15,561
- "Iron Man Power FM." Yes. - That does fit.

1325
00:42:15,562 --> 00:42:18,131
- On the treadmill in the morning. - Yes.

1326
00:42:18,132 --> 00:42:20,262
- For all of the gym-goers... - He really is "Iron Man Power."

1327
00:42:20,263 --> 00:42:21,731
- in the country. - Yes.

1328
00:42:21,732 --> 00:42:23,572
- Starting with a healthy meal. - Exactly.

1329
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:25,001
- Okay. - It's possible. Okay!

1330
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:26,572
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

1331
00:42:26,573 --> 00:42:27,942
- Let's go! - Okay!

1332
00:42:28,243 --> 00:42:29,772
(Let's please get it this time.)

1333
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:31,172
Ready.

1334
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:33,143
Go.

1335
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:35,441
- In 1, 2... - Wait. 2PM!

1336
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:37,182
(Group name: 2PM, Name)

1337
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,783
- Ong... I said Ong. - Oh, no.

1338
00:42:38,982 --> 00:42:40,382
Ok Taec Yeon, you fool!

1339
00:42:40,922 --> 00:42:41,981
2PM!

1340
00:42:41,982 --> 00:42:43,522
- Ong... I said Ong. - Oh, no.

1341
00:42:43,792 --> 00:42:45,192
Ok Taec Yeon, you fool!

1342
00:42:45,792 --> 00:42:47,192
Ok Taec Yeon, you fool!

1343
00:42:47,792 --> 00:42:49,122
How could you not know that?

1344
00:42:49,123 --> 00:42:51,392
- As soon as I saw the picture... - We wasted a bonus coupon.

1345
00:42:51,393 --> 00:42:52,532
(Tae Hyun is in despair.)

1346
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:54,809
- I thought this might happen. - How could you not know him?

1347
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,602
- Do I have to go back? - That's obviously Taec Yeon.

1348
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:57,671
She didn't even get to say anything.

1349
00:42:57,672 --> 00:42:59,102
- Who is Ong? - Seriously.

1350
00:42:59,103 --> 00:43:01,441
This is what happened. I was going to say Ok, but then...

1351
00:43:01,442 --> 00:43:03,172
- Hey! - Why did you only say Ong?

1352
00:43:03,272 --> 00:43:04,811
Taec Yeon is Ok Taec Yeon...

1353
00:43:04,812 --> 00:43:07,212
Exactly. It would've been fine if I had only said Taec Yeon.

1354
00:43:07,243 --> 00:43:08,582
- I just needed to say Taec Yeon. - Hey.

1355
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,812
Taec Yeon was a bit easy.

1356
00:43:09,953 --> 00:43:12,033
(He had the most number of incorrect answers today.)

1357
00:43:12,252 --> 00:43:14,553
This was easy. Honestly, I saw it,

1358
00:43:14,723 --> 00:43:17,393
- and I knew it right away, but... - You two are the problem.

1359
00:43:17,652 --> 00:43:19,892
- Is he trying to be funny? - You two are...

1360
00:43:19,893 --> 00:43:21,222
Ok Taec Yeon was a bit easy.

1361
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:22,961
The important thing is that we used the bonus coupon,

1362
00:43:22,962 --> 00:43:24,663
but Ye Rin didn't get to say a word.

1363
00:43:25,263 --> 00:43:27,102
- Do I have to go back? - We're in trouble.

1364
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,433
This is...

1365
00:43:28,962 --> 00:43:31,102
- We're supposed to energize them... - I'm sorry.

1366
00:43:31,103 --> 00:43:32,671
During their spare time.

1367
00:43:32,672 --> 00:43:34,502
But our main writer is almost in despair.

1368
00:43:35,442 --> 00:43:36,812
I'm sorry, Ye Rin.

1369
00:43:37,312 --> 00:43:38,872
- All right. - Taec Yeon was easy.

1370
00:43:38,873 --> 00:43:40,341
- Ok Taec Yeon was easy. - I seriously think...

1371
00:43:40,342 --> 00:43:42,111
if we don't pass here,

1372
00:43:42,112 --> 00:43:43,852
- we'll really be in trouble. - We'll definitely get it.

1373
00:43:43,853 --> 00:43:45,211
- Don't worry. - Let's do a cheer.

1374
00:43:45,212 --> 00:43:46,682
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1375
00:43:46,683 --> 00:43:47,722
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1376
00:43:47,723 --> 00:43:48,881
We need to get it now.

1377
00:43:48,882 --> 00:43:50,922
This is our seventh try.

1378
00:43:51,092 --> 00:43:52,352
- Ready. - This is hard.

1379
00:43:52,353 --> 00:43:54,361
(They're already down to 4 tries.)

1380
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:56,122
This is our seventh try.

1381
00:43:56,123 --> 00:43:57,132
Ready.

1382
00:43:57,763 --> 00:43:59,292
- Ready. - This is hard.

1383
00:43:59,632 --> 00:44:00,662
You need to look from afar.

1384
00:44:00,663 --> 00:44:01,861
- It was harder up close. - Really?

1385
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:02,901
Let's look from afar.

1386
00:44:02,902 --> 00:44:04,142
We need to change our strategy.

1387
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:07,341
Ready. Go.

1388
00:44:07,342 --> 00:44:10,572
(Group name, Name)

1389
00:44:10,573 --> 00:44:12,342
- In one... - Joon! god!

1390
00:44:12,473 --> 00:44:13,683
- Okay! - Okay.

1391
00:44:14,342 --> 00:44:15,982
- In one... - Joon! god!

1392
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,382
- Okay! - Okay.

1393
00:44:17,652 --> 00:44:19,582
See? That's obviously Joon.

1394
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,881
They practically gave it to us.

1395
00:44:20,882 --> 00:44:22,722
- You should use pictures like that. - They gave it to us.

1396
00:44:22,723 --> 00:44:24,092
They gave it to us.

1397
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:27,061
Second question. Ready. Go.

1398
00:44:27,062 --> 00:44:28,361
(Group name, Name)

1399
00:44:28,362 --> 00:44:29,791
- One... - Jang Won Young of IVE!

1400
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:30,792
There we go.

1401
00:44:31,433 --> 00:44:32,762
Jang Won Young of IVE!

1402
00:44:32,763 --> 00:44:33,802
There we go.

1403
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:35,202
(Answering smoothly like flowing water)

1404
00:44:35,203 --> 00:44:36,932
- There we go. - It was IVE?

1405
00:44:36,933 --> 00:44:39,033
- You didn't know, did you? - That was an easy one.

1406
00:44:39,172 --> 00:44:41,372
He didn't know this one either.

1407
00:44:41,373 --> 00:44:43,211
- I realized a bit later. - See?

1408
00:44:43,212 --> 00:44:44,611
I realized a bit later. But I did.

1409
00:44:44,612 --> 00:44:45,612
- Let's go. - Okay.

1410
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:47,441
I was late earlier because I was thinking of Ok.

1411
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:49,582
Ready. Go.

1412
00:44:49,583 --> 00:44:50,711
(Group name, Name)

1413
00:44:50,712 --> 00:44:52,553
- In 1, 2... - Sandara Park!

1414
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:54,222
- Incorrect! - Gosh!

1415
00:44:54,223 --> 00:44:55,282
It's 2NE1!

1416
00:44:55,283 --> 00:44:56,722
(Out of time)

1417
00:44:56,723 --> 00:44:58,251
It's 2NE1!

1418
00:44:58,252 --> 00:44:59,323
Sandara Park!

1419
00:44:59,893 --> 00:45:00,922
- Incorrect! - Gosh!

1420
00:45:02,292 --> 00:45:03,462
- No. - No.

1421
00:45:04,092 --> 00:45:05,191
- Incorrect. - Come on.

1422
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:06,231
It's 2NE1.

1423
00:45:06,232 --> 00:45:07,402
(Feeling frustrated)

1424
00:45:07,703 --> 00:45:09,231
- It's 2NE1. - It's 2NE1.

1425
00:45:09,232 --> 00:45:10,872
- Hey! - We go to the same hair salon.

1426
00:45:10,873 --> 00:45:11,973
Come on.

1427
00:45:12,772 --> 00:45:15,171
I honestly didn't know it was Sandara Park.

1428
00:45:15,172 --> 00:45:17,041
- Come on. - You should've shown us...

1429
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:18,611
- Sandara Park with her hair up. - That's right.

1430
00:45:18,612 --> 00:45:20,682
You should've shown us a photo with her hair up.

1431
00:45:20,683 --> 00:45:21,941
- Seriously. - That's Sandara Park.

1432
00:45:21,942 --> 00:45:23,912
- How did you get it right? - How did you get it right?

1433
00:45:23,913 --> 00:45:26,082
- We're the same age. - Really?

1434
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,981
- We also go to the same hair salon. - It's hard to recognize her...

1435
00:45:27,982 --> 00:45:29,052
in a photo like that.

1436
00:45:29,053 --> 00:45:31,052
Assuming that we succeed,

1437
00:45:31,053 --> 00:45:33,622
- Yes? - we can't go on to Round Three.

1438
00:45:33,623 --> 00:45:35,791
- No, we can't. - We should pass Round Two.

1439
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:37,933
- Yes, we should. - We have to give them 700 dollars.

1440
00:45:38,092 --> 00:45:40,131
- We have to do really well. - We can't afford to lose it.

1441
00:45:40,132 --> 00:45:41,838
- That's right. - We have to give it to them.

1442
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:44,333
Ye Rin, should we go in this order one more time?

1443
00:45:44,902 --> 00:45:46,333
I don't know anymore.

1444
00:45:47,342 --> 00:45:49,248
- Do you hate all of us? - You all seem the same.

1445
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:51,432
- You hate us all, don't you? - You all seem the same.

1446
00:45:51,513 --> 00:45:53,142
- Do you want us to disappear? - You're all the same.

1447
00:45:53,143 --> 00:45:55,143
We ruined your life...

1448
00:45:55,312 --> 00:45:57,182
and stressed you out. Right?

1449
00:45:57,183 --> 00:45:59,152
- Extreme stress. - Yes, extreme stress.

1450
00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:01,421
(He is extremely nervous.)

1451
00:46:01,422 --> 00:46:02,651
Let's begin.

1452
00:46:02,652 --> 00:46:04,021
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

1453
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:05,692
- Jong Kook, get ready. - Okay.

1454
00:46:05,893 --> 00:46:08,163
- Go slowly and give us time. - That's right.

1455
00:46:09,723 --> 00:46:11,861
Pretend you're here to have fun, Tae Hyun.

1456
00:46:11,862 --> 00:46:12,992
- Jong Kook. - Tae Hyun.

1457
00:46:12,993 --> 00:46:14,861
This is nothing, Jong Kook.

1458
00:46:14,862 --> 00:46:16,732
Hey, look.

1459
00:46:17,002 --> 00:46:18,901
Pretend you're at home watching TV.

1460
00:46:18,902 --> 00:46:20,572
You're at home watching TV.

1461
00:46:20,573 --> 00:46:21,972
- That's right. - You went too far.

1462
00:46:21,973 --> 00:46:23,271
- How could you get that wrong? - Come on.

1463
00:46:23,272 --> 00:46:25,772
- Once you sit here... - Hey.

1464
00:46:25,873 --> 00:46:27,542
Can you see from there?

1465
00:46:27,712 --> 00:46:29,381
- Focus. I think that's too far. - Why can't you get it right?

1466
00:46:29,382 --> 00:46:31,251
You're just watching TV.

1467
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:33,052
- You're at home on your sofa. - This is good.

1468
00:46:33,053 --> 00:46:35,052
- Hold it out. - You're at home watching TV...

1469
00:46:35,053 --> 00:46:36,452
- for the first time in a while. - He's really good at home.

1470
00:46:36,453 --> 00:46:38,352
- I really am. - He gets it right at home.

1471
00:46:38,353 --> 00:46:40,392
- Why can't you get that right? - Pretend you're on your sofa.

1472
00:46:40,393 --> 00:46:42,362
- Okay, let's go. - Relax.

1473
00:46:42,462 --> 00:46:43,591
- Ready. - Okay.

1474
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,933
- Go. - Ready. Go.

1475
00:46:45,732 --> 00:46:46,901
In 1, 2, 3.

1476
00:46:48,952 --> 00:46:50,320
- In 1, 2, 3. - Lee Ji Hye.

1477
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:51,892
- Lee Ji Hye, Sharp. - Sharp.

1478
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:54,722
- In 1, 2, 3. - Lee Ji Hye, Sharp.

1479
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:56,261
(He got it right.)

1480
00:46:56,932 --> 00:46:58,590
(Confident)

1481
00:46:58,591 --> 00:46:59,932
- Okay! - Nice.

1482
00:47:00,401 --> 00:47:02,531
Good job.

1483
00:47:03,162 --> 00:47:04,201
(Laughing)

1484
00:47:04,202 --> 00:47:06,530
Didn't they tell him?

1485
00:47:06,531 --> 00:47:07,602
(Confessing)

1486
00:47:08,142 --> 00:47:09,840
No, I didn't hear anything.

1487
00:47:09,841 --> 00:47:11,972
- What? - We heard everything.

1488
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:14,880
- No. - I heard it from here.

1489
00:47:14,881 --> 00:47:16,381
I'm sorry. We'll try that again.

1490
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:18,082
- Okay. - Did you hear it?

1491
00:47:18,281 --> 00:47:19,610
- We were off to a good start. - Jong Kook.

1492
00:47:19,611 --> 00:47:21,721
You aren't focusing, Jong Kook.

1493
00:47:21,722 --> 00:47:23,590
You aren't focusing. Come closer.

1494
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:25,121
- As soon as he sat there, - Wait a minute.

1495
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:26,452
He squinted his eyes.

1496
00:47:26,792 --> 00:47:28,791
(Slow focusing)

1497
00:47:28,792 --> 00:47:30,360
- Okay. - You know what?

1498
00:47:30,361 --> 00:47:32,260
The crew members are all human...

1499
00:47:32,261 --> 00:47:33,662
just like us.

1500
00:47:33,932 --> 00:47:36,331
I'm sure they often have quizzes on the radio.

1501
00:47:36,332 --> 00:47:37,932
And they go, "You can't tell him, okay?"

1502
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:39,772
They're the production crew.

1503
00:47:40,972 --> 00:47:42,170
- Here we go. - Relax.

1504
00:47:42,171 --> 00:47:43,740
- Relax. - Yes, I'm at home.

1505
00:47:43,741 --> 00:47:45,018
- Relax. - Pretend you're watching TV.

1506
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:47,141
It's okay to get it wrong. Relax.

1507
00:47:47,142 --> 00:47:48,610
(I'm at home. I am relaxed.)

1508
00:47:48,611 --> 00:47:50,981
- It's okay to get it wrong. - This is nothing.

1509
00:47:50,982 --> 00:47:52,011
Ready.

1510
00:47:52,281 --> 00:47:53,852
- Relax. - Go.

1511
00:47:57,752 --> 00:47:59,050
(Endless effort to control his mind)

1512
00:47:59,051 --> 00:48:00,121
Ready.

1513
00:48:00,122 --> 00:48:02,022
- Relax. - Go.

1514
00:48:02,562 --> 00:48:04,662
- In 1, 2, 3. - Relax. Tei.

1515
00:48:05,261 --> 00:48:06,431
"Tei?"

1516
00:48:06,432 --> 00:48:07,761
(Name: Tei)

1517
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:10,171
- Tei. - Tei?

1518
00:48:11,801 --> 00:48:12,831
Tei?

1519
00:48:12,832 --> 00:48:14,441
(Frustrated)

1520
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:15,571
Tei?

1521
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:17,611
Tei?

1522
00:48:20,011 --> 00:48:21,211
It's Du Jun.

1523
00:48:21,412 --> 00:48:23,982
- Highlight. - Where did "Tei" come from?

1524
00:48:24,511 --> 00:48:25,581
Come on.

1525
00:48:25,582 --> 00:48:28,320
(Where did "Tei" come from?)

1526
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:29,951
It's Du Jun.

1527
00:48:29,952 --> 00:48:32,651
- Highlight. - Give me another chance.

1528
00:48:33,292 --> 00:48:34,491
Tei?

1529
00:48:35,191 --> 00:48:36,222
It's okay.

1530
00:48:36,522 --> 00:48:37,562
Tei?

1531
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:39,490
I can really...

1532
00:48:39,491 --> 00:48:43,261
- Why did he say "Tei?" - Please.

1533
00:48:43,401 --> 00:48:44,801
Seriously.

1534
00:48:45,732 --> 00:48:48,571
Tei was never part of a group.

1535
00:48:48,741 --> 00:48:50,101
(This is the saddest plea for mercy as he can barely kneel.)

1536
00:48:50,102 --> 00:48:51,441
- Why not? - He never was.

1537
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,111
- Please. Du Jun! - Hey!

1538
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,151
I only saw you while playing soccer and didn't recognize you.

1539
00:48:57,852 --> 00:49:00,420
- I'll switch seats. - Tei is a solo singer.

1540
00:49:00,421 --> 00:49:02,458
Please give me another chance and let us start at our eighth try.

1541
00:49:02,482 --> 00:49:04,651
- That was weird. - You play soccer together?

1542
00:49:04,691 --> 00:49:05,990
- You play soccer together? - We often met to play soccer.

1543
00:49:05,991 --> 00:49:08,221
I'm used to seeing him in a uniform.

1544
00:49:08,222 --> 00:49:09,420
Let's switch seats.

1545
00:49:09,421 --> 00:49:11,332
- I can't go first. - Move.

1546
00:49:11,591 --> 00:49:13,332
- Why was I going first? - Move.

1547
00:49:13,432 --> 00:49:15,630
- Du Jun, I don't recognize you. - Look.

1548
00:49:15,631 --> 00:49:17,701
- I don't recognize him. - Look at the faces...

1549
00:49:17,702 --> 00:49:19,271
of the production crew.

1550
00:49:19,272 --> 00:49:21,002
This is too difficult.

1551
00:49:21,642 --> 00:49:22,872
Doesn't he look like Tei?

1552
00:49:22,972 --> 00:49:24,010
(Disappointed)

1553
00:49:24,011 --> 00:49:26,312
If we don't succeed, we should use the coupon...

1554
00:49:26,441 --> 00:49:28,581
- on our last try, right? - Yes, we should.

1555
00:49:28,582 --> 00:49:30,210
- We have one last bonus coupon. - Yes, we do.

1556
00:49:30,211 --> 00:49:31,851
If we don't succeed this time, we have to use it.

1557
00:49:31,852 --> 00:49:33,920
- Let's use it on our last try. - Okay.

1558
00:49:33,921 --> 00:49:35,728
- Let's succeed this time. - Use the bonus coupon.

1559
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:37,550
- Let's succeed this time. - Let's go.

1560
00:49:37,551 --> 00:49:39,321
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1561
00:49:39,421 --> 00:49:40,791
- Seriously. - Please.

1562
00:49:40,792 --> 00:49:41,920
- Jong Kook. - Yes, let's do this.

1563
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:43,661
- Since you made them laugh a lot, - Okay.

1564
00:49:43,662 --> 00:49:45,661
- turn on your documentary mode now. - Please ask me something I know.

1565
00:49:45,662 --> 00:49:47,661
- Why is this so difficult? - Let's do it.

1566
00:49:47,662 --> 00:49:48,861
Was it always this difficult?

1567
00:49:49,002 --> 00:49:51,130
Since there are several members on "Running Man,"

1568
00:49:51,131 --> 00:49:53,472
we often failed before my turn.

1569
00:49:54,301 --> 00:49:56,541
- But I... - If we fail on that show,

1570
00:49:56,542 --> 00:49:58,170
- it's us that don't get to eat. - That's right.

1571
00:49:58,171 --> 00:49:59,171
That's right.

1572
00:49:59,172 --> 00:50:00,911
- But someone else pays for it here. - That's a huge burden.

1573
00:50:00,912 --> 00:50:02,210
- I know. - Of course.

1574
00:50:02,211 --> 00:50:03,311
- All right. - I'm not too sure about this.

1575
00:50:03,312 --> 00:50:04,551
Here we go.

1576
00:50:04,952 --> 00:50:06,710
Don't worry about it.

1577
00:50:06,711 --> 00:50:07,821
- Ready. - Relax.

1578
00:50:07,952 --> 00:50:09,482
Don't pay attention.

1579
00:50:09,682 --> 00:50:10,722
Ready.

1580
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:12,951
- Let's relax for now. - Wait.

1581
00:50:12,952 --> 00:50:14,360
- Relax. - Relax.

1582
00:50:14,361 --> 00:50:15,690
- Ready. - Relax.

1583
00:50:15,691 --> 00:50:16,721
Look at it.

1584
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,908
- I'll pretend I'm at home. - I don't think I'll get my turn.

1585
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:19,932
Go.

1586
00:50:20,502 --> 00:50:22,361
- This is easy. - Junjin. SHINHWA.

1587
00:50:22,702 --> 00:50:24,670
(Correct)

1588
00:50:24,671 --> 00:50:25,731
That was easy.

1589
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:27,471
- That wasn't easy. - It was easy.

1590
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:28,501
That was perfect for him.

1591
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:30,502
- SHINHWA wasn't easy. - That was perfect for him.

1592
00:50:30,542 --> 00:50:31,610
Next.

1593
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,911
- Ready. - Relax.

1594
00:50:32,912 --> 00:50:34,392
- Scroll through your phone. - Relax.

1595
00:50:34,582 --> 00:50:36,582
- Ready. - Relax.

1596
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,780
- Ready. Go. - Relax.

1597
00:50:38,781 --> 00:50:39,811
Let's see.

1598
00:50:39,812 --> 00:50:41,951
- In one... - Lee Hyo Ri. Fin.K.L.

1599
00:50:41,952 --> 00:50:42,952
(Correct)

1600
00:50:42,953 --> 00:50:44,351
This is how it should go.

1601
00:50:44,352 --> 00:50:46,961
- That was good. - Just relax.

1602
00:50:47,191 --> 00:50:48,690
- That was good. - What's going on?

1603
00:50:48,691 --> 00:50:50,931
- It's hard to get that wrong. - That's right.

1604
00:50:50,932 --> 00:50:53,067
- It's hard to get that wrong. - It's hard to get that wrong.

1605
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,931
It isn't something you should be that proud of.

1606
00:50:54,932 --> 00:50:57,170
- Just relax. - This is a good difficulty level.

1607
00:50:57,171 --> 00:50:58,201
- This is nothing. - Relax.

1608
00:50:58,202 --> 00:50:59,400
- Pretend you're at home. - This is not difficult.

1609
00:50:59,401 --> 00:51:01,170
- Let's see how it goes. - Junjin was a good one,

1610
00:51:01,171 --> 00:51:02,871
- It's nothing. - and so was Lee Hyo Ri.

1611
00:51:02,872 --> 00:51:04,340
- That wasn't bad. - Just relax.

1612
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:05,412
Ready.

1613
00:51:05,611 --> 00:51:06,982
- I'll pretend I'm at home. - Go.

1614
00:51:07,381 --> 00:51:08,511
Let's see who it is.

1615
00:51:08,912 --> 00:51:09,982
Kim Jong Min.

1616
00:51:11,711 --> 00:51:13,982
- KOYOTE. - Nice!

1617
00:51:14,252 --> 00:51:15,451
- KOYOTE. - Nice!

1618
00:51:15,452 --> 00:51:17,820
(Even Yeon Seok gets the right answer.)

1619
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:19,090
Why are you marveling?

1620
00:51:19,091 --> 00:51:20,221
That was an easy question.

1621
00:51:20,222 --> 00:51:21,260
- No, it wasn't. - That was super easy.

1622
00:51:21,261 --> 00:51:22,521
That was easy.

1623
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:23,931
- It was easy. - Jong Kook.

1624
00:51:23,932 --> 00:51:24,932
He's the last one.

1625
00:51:24,933 --> 00:51:27,860
- Kim Jong Kook. - Kim Jong Kook.

1626
00:51:27,861 --> 00:51:29,201
- Round Two. - Kim Jong Kook.

1627
00:51:29,202 --> 00:51:30,831
All right. You got this.

1628
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:32,871
- The questions are easier. - Please.

1629
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:34,840
- Please. - Go slowly.

1630
00:51:34,841 --> 00:51:36,601
- Please. - The questions are easier.

1631
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:39,141
(Whether they'll get the cards and gift certificate or not...)

1632
00:51:39,142 --> 00:51:40,840
(is up to Jong Kook now.)

1633
00:51:40,841 --> 00:51:42,510
- Relax. - We have to give them the presents.

1634
00:51:42,511 --> 00:51:44,451
- We can easily do it. - Look.

1635
00:51:44,452 --> 00:51:47,321
- Junjin, Lee Hyo Ri, Kim Jong Min. - Lee Hyo Ri, Kim Jong Min.

1636
00:51:47,452 --> 00:51:49,351
I think I'll get someone that goes with that flow.

1637
00:51:49,352 --> 00:51:50,920
- I think... - Maybe Moon Hee Joon.

1638
00:51:50,921 --> 00:51:52,121
It's about time we had someone from H.O.T.

1639
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:53,291
That could be a problem.

1640
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:54,320
- Focus. - Or DJ DOC.

1641
00:51:54,321 --> 00:51:56,561
If you're focused on that and a different group pops up,

1642
00:51:56,562 --> 00:51:58,667
- It could be a modern idol star. - your head will go blank.

1643
00:51:58,691 --> 00:52:00,067
It could be an idol star who's popular nowadays.

1644
00:52:00,091 --> 00:52:02,731
Don't expect it to be an old idol star.

1645
00:52:02,732 --> 00:52:04,170
- You could be flustered. - Yes, you could be flustered.

1646
00:52:04,171 --> 00:52:05,372
It could be someone now.

1647
00:52:05,472 --> 00:52:07,071
- Okay. - You can do this.

1648
00:52:07,241 --> 00:52:08,601
- Focus. - Focus.

1649
00:52:08,602 --> 00:52:10,271
- She said, "Please." - Please.

1650
00:52:10,272 --> 00:52:11,570
You pass Round Two if you get this right.

1651
00:52:11,571 --> 00:52:12,940
- This is our ninth try. - Relax.

1652
00:52:12,941 --> 00:52:13,941
Ready.

1653
00:52:14,182 --> 00:52:15,781
Why is everyone cupping their ears?

1654
00:52:16,312 --> 00:52:17,851
- You're cupping your ear. - Just in case.

1655
00:52:17,852 --> 00:52:19,110
- You can't tell him the answer. - Okay.

1656
00:52:19,111 --> 00:52:21,481
- Ready. Go. - I'll get it right.

1657
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:25,551
(Group name, Name)

1658
00:52:25,952 --> 00:52:27,820
(Someone that will get you in trouble...)

1659
00:52:27,821 --> 00:52:29,222
(if you don't know shows up.)

1660
00:52:29,722 --> 00:52:32,231
(Junjin, Lee Hyo Ri, Kim Jong Min, and...)

1661
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:33,760
(V!)

1662
00:52:33,761 --> 00:52:35,900
(Group name, Name)

1663
00:52:35,901 --> 00:52:37,531
- In one... - V.

1664
00:52:39,002 --> 00:52:40,300
- BTS. - Yes!

1665
00:52:40,301 --> 00:52:42,772
(Correct)

1666
00:52:43,171 --> 00:52:44,671
V. BTS.

1667
00:52:45,611 --> 00:52:47,211
- We did it. - Jong Kook.

1668
00:52:47,482 --> 00:52:48,841
V. BTS.

1669
00:52:49,312 --> 00:52:53,820
(Jong Kook did it!)

1670
00:52:53,821 --> 00:52:55,682
- We did it. - Nice.

1671
00:52:58,122 --> 00:52:59,150
Thank you.

1672
00:52:59,151 --> 00:53:01,261
- Tae Hyung! - Jong Kook, you did it.

1673
00:53:01,562 --> 00:53:03,690
- Nice. - Thank you, Tae Hyung!

1674
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:04,961
(Thank you, Tae Hyung.)

1675
00:53:05,091 --> 00:53:07,062
- Tae Hyung! - That could've gone badly.

1676
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:09,062
- We did it. - We did it.

1677
00:53:09,761 --> 00:53:12,771
- Tae Hyung! - Kim Jong Kook.

1678
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:14,240
- That was difficult. - Kim Jong Kook.

1679
00:53:14,241 --> 00:53:15,400
- He could've gotten it wrong. - Kim Jong Kook.

1680
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:16,872
- You did it. - Kim Jong Kook.

1681
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:19,741
- You could've been in trouble. - Tae Hyung!

1682
00:53:20,412 --> 00:53:22,341
I'm seriously shocked.

1683
00:53:23,312 --> 00:53:25,351
Go or stop? In 1, 2, 3.

1684
00:53:25,352 --> 00:53:26,711
- Stop. - Okay!

1685
00:53:27,582 --> 00:53:29,622
With this,

1686
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:32,251
we are able to give Ye Rin...

1687
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:34,360
a T-money card charged with 400 dollars...

1688
00:53:34,361 --> 00:53:36,521
and a department store certificate worth 700 dollars.

1689
00:53:36,522 --> 00:53:39,361
(Transportation card and department store gift certificate)

1690
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:43,901
(What song would you choose to fit today's spare time?)

1691
00:53:44,102 --> 00:53:45,831
"One Man" by Kim Jong Kook.

1692
00:53:45,832 --> 00:53:48,740
I'd like to ask you to play "One Man" by Kim Jong Kook...

1693
00:53:48,741 --> 00:53:50,240
as we remember the man who got the most wrong answers.

1694
00:53:50,241 --> 00:53:52,211
- The man who doesn't know songs. - Right.

1695
00:53:52,542 --> 00:53:55,840
- Whenever possible, cheer up. - Cheer up.

1696
00:53:55,841 --> 00:53:59,482
(Whenever possible, cheer up.)

1697
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:01,751
(The man who was almost scared to death)

1698
00:54:01,752 --> 00:54:03,021
- I screamed too much. - That was close.

1699
00:54:03,022 --> 00:54:04,521
- I screamed too much. - Have a nice day.

1700
00:54:04,522 --> 00:54:06,121
- Have a nice day. - I was more nervous than I thought.

1701
00:54:06,122 --> 00:54:08,261
I screamed too much, and my throat hurts.

1702
00:54:09,062 --> 00:54:11,261
- Seriously. - "BoA" was hilarious.

1703
00:54:11,361 --> 00:54:13,360
(Laughing)

1704
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:15,062
"Tei" was the worst.

1705
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,372
I admit it was the worst.

1706
00:54:17,732 --> 00:54:18,901
Why did you say, "Tei?"

1707
00:54:20,901 --> 00:54:23,271
It's a relief that we succeeded.

1708
00:54:23,272 --> 00:54:25,111
- It really is. - Seriously.

1709
00:54:25,272 --> 00:54:26,711
You know what?

1710
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:29,340
I saw myself yelling out, "V," as if I were possessed.

1711
00:54:29,341 --> 00:54:30,811
That's right.

1712
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:32,351
It would've been bad if you had gotten that wrong.

1713
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,681
- I know. - Gosh.

1714
00:54:33,682 --> 00:54:36,082
- If you got it wrong... - I must've seen death approaching.

1715
00:54:36,151 --> 00:54:37,151
- At that moment... - Right.

1716
00:54:37,152 --> 00:54:38,891
You would've been in trouble if you had said, "Jung Kook."

1717
00:54:38,892 --> 00:54:41,191
He had a sword held to his neck.

1718
00:54:41,261 --> 00:54:43,661
I almost said, "Jung Kook."

1719
00:54:43,662 --> 00:54:45,291
(The memory is chilling.)

1720
00:54:45,292 --> 00:54:47,201
We should go meet...

1721
00:54:47,202 --> 00:54:49,601
- our second Whenever Guest. - What time is it?

1722
00:54:49,602 --> 00:54:50,971
It's at 12:30pm.

1723
00:54:50,972 --> 00:54:52,670
- Then we should have lunch. - Yes, we have some time left.

1724
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,701
We should have lunch.

1725
00:54:53,702 --> 00:54:56,371
What should we eat?

1726
00:54:56,372 --> 00:54:57,440
Anything.

1727
00:54:57,441 --> 00:54:58,610
(They have to pick a menu, but they are tired and don't care.)

1728
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:00,471
- Should we eat downstairs? - Jong Kook.

1729
00:55:00,472 --> 00:55:01,510
- He doesn't care. - No.

1730
00:55:01,511 --> 00:55:02,681
- Let's go. - What?

1731
00:55:02,682 --> 00:55:03,710
I'm okay with anything.

1732
00:55:03,711 --> 00:55:05,951
- Still, we shouldn't stay... - Yes?

1733
00:55:05,952 --> 00:55:08,320
- at the broadcasting station. - Don't you just eat anything?

1734
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:10,481
- Let's go somewhere else. - Yes.

1735
00:55:10,482 --> 00:55:12,621
Tae Hyun knew Dongbuichon-dong well...

1736
00:55:12,622 --> 00:55:14,121
- and recommended restaurants. - That's right.

1737
00:55:14,122 --> 00:55:15,760
- We're in Mok-dong. - I wonder what's in Mok-dong.

1738
00:55:15,761 --> 00:55:16,820
Good restaurants?

1739
00:55:16,821 --> 00:55:18,460
I don't know this area well.

1740
00:55:18,461 --> 00:55:20,292
Then we should just go somewhere close.

1741
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:22,531
- I like how you think. - Right.

1742
00:55:22,901 --> 00:55:24,232
Am I wrong?

1743
00:55:24,702 --> 00:55:26,601
I'm sure there are restaurants nearby.

1744
00:55:26,602 --> 00:55:28,602
What do you usually have for lunch?

1745
00:55:29,241 --> 00:55:31,070
- Jong Kook. - I eat everything.

1746
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,471
I have anything with protein.

1747
00:55:32,472 --> 00:55:34,240
- Jong Kook... - You don't eat soup, do you?

1748
00:55:34,241 --> 00:55:35,510
- I do. - You do?

1749
00:55:35,511 --> 00:55:37,311
- I add extra meat to soups. - He likes gukbap.

1750
00:55:37,312 --> 00:55:39,182
- He adds extra meat. - Gukbap sounds good.

1751
00:55:39,312 --> 00:55:40,380
Gukbap is tasty.

1752
00:55:40,381 --> 00:55:41,521
What is that over there?

1753
00:55:41,522 --> 00:55:42,820
- It looks like a restaurant. - It's the shape of a rice bowl.

1754
00:55:42,821 --> 00:55:43,952
What is that place?

1755
00:55:44,491 --> 00:55:46,551
- It's a rice bowl. - What is it?

1756
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:48,121
Maybe it's a poke place.

1757
00:55:48,122 --> 00:55:50,061
Poke doesn't sound bad.

1758
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:51,690
- It has a lot of protein. - It's healthy.

1759
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:53,061
- It's healthy. - That sounds good.

1760
00:55:53,062 --> 00:55:54,561
He's happy as long as you give him protein.

1761
00:55:54,562 --> 00:55:56,522
There are several Korean beef restaurants nearby.

1762
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:58,501
Korean beef? That doesn't sound right.

1763
00:55:58,502 --> 00:56:00,030
- It sounds heavy. - Yes.

1764
00:56:00,031 --> 00:56:01,471
- It's too heavy for lunch. - Right.

1765
00:56:01,671 --> 00:56:02,872
Beef cutlet.

1766
00:56:03,642 --> 00:56:05,441
- Okay. - "Mok-dong SBS branch."

1767
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:09,210
- It's in this building? - That sounds great.

1768
00:56:09,211 --> 00:56:10,811
- It sounds good. - I love it.

1769
00:56:10,812 --> 00:56:12,311
This building has all the good restaurants.

1770
00:56:12,312 --> 00:56:13,681
- It's in this building. - Yes.

1771
00:56:13,682 --> 00:56:15,351
- It sounds good. - Beef cutlet.

1772
00:56:15,352 --> 00:56:16,621
- It sounds tasty. - "Mok-dong SBS branch."

1773
00:56:16,622 --> 00:56:18,291
- Should we give it a try? - Let's try it.

1774
00:56:18,292 --> 00:56:19,951
Can we just cross the street and find out what that is?

1775
00:56:19,952 --> 00:56:21,352
- Okay, let's check it out. - That?

1776
00:56:21,562 --> 00:56:23,490
- Okay. - We can walk.

1777
00:56:23,491 --> 00:56:25,460
- The rice bowl. - It really must be poke.

1778
00:56:25,461 --> 00:56:26,591
I was curious.

1779
00:56:27,861 --> 00:56:29,661
- "Balance in a bowl." - "Balance in a bowl."

1780
00:56:29,832 --> 00:56:32,372
It's for a diet.

1781
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:34,541
What? Freshwater eel over rice?

1782
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:36,271
- What's that? - Eel sounds good.

1783
00:56:36,272 --> 00:56:38,792
- Freshwater eel over rice? - And the restaurant isn't crowded.

1784
00:56:38,841 --> 00:56:39,940
Wait a second.

1785
00:56:39,941 --> 00:56:41,110
I love empty restaurants.

1786
00:56:41,111 --> 00:56:42,541
I like both eel and poke.

1787
00:56:42,542 --> 00:56:43,911
What do you think of eel over rice?

1788
00:56:43,912 --> 00:56:45,210
- That sounds good. - It sounds good.

1789
00:56:45,211 --> 00:56:47,251
- Then let's have it. - Great.

1790
00:56:47,252 --> 00:56:48,280
- The restaurant isn't crowded. - Come here.

1791
00:56:48,281 --> 00:56:49,598
- Let's have eel over rice. - I like eel.

1792
00:56:49,622 --> 00:56:51,650
- Are you open? - We open at 11am.

1793
00:56:51,651 --> 00:56:53,050
- They open at 11am. - What time do they open?

1794
00:56:53,051 --> 00:56:54,690
- At 11am? Then it's fine. - What time is it?

1795
00:56:54,691 --> 00:56:55,792
It's 10 minutes to 11am.

1796
00:56:56,091 --> 00:56:57,190
It's 9 minutes to 11am.

1797
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:58,291
- Nine minutes? - Yes.

1798
00:56:58,292 --> 00:57:00,130
- We can wait. - We can wait for nine minutes.

1799
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:01,331
Yes, we can wait.

1800
00:57:01,332 --> 00:57:04,231
- Since we have time, - You know...

1801
00:57:04,232 --> 00:57:06,631
let's have you film a message.

1802
00:57:06,732 --> 00:57:08,240
- A message? - You're still doing that?

1803
00:57:08,241 --> 00:57:09,971
- What message? - You're still doing that?

1804
00:57:09,972 --> 00:57:11,440
- We already did it. - Yes, we did.

1805
00:57:11,441 --> 00:57:12,441
Who is it for?

1806
00:57:12,442 --> 00:57:13,642
Hello.

1807
00:57:13,772 --> 00:57:15,111
Let's see.

1808
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:16,741
- Let's see. - Should we sit here?

1809
00:57:16,982 --> 00:57:18,351
Here?

1810
00:57:18,352 --> 00:57:19,710
This is nice.

1811
00:57:19,711 --> 00:57:21,582
- Come here, Yeon Seok. - Okay.

1812
00:57:21,781 --> 00:57:23,050
What do I have to say?

1813
00:57:23,051 --> 00:57:25,651
- Move out of the way, Jong Kook. - Are you taking a video?

1814
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:28,161
We can have the freshwater eel set.

1815
00:57:28,162 --> 00:57:30,562
It's for Hyundai High School's festival.

1816
00:57:30,691 --> 00:57:32,090
- I see. - We did it.

1817
00:57:32,091 --> 00:57:33,792
- We already did it. - I see.

1818
00:57:33,892 --> 00:57:35,461
- It's for my older kid. - Soo...

1819
00:57:35,761 --> 00:57:36,860
- It's called Harvest Festival. - For Soo Chan?

1820
00:57:36,861 --> 00:57:38,601
- Don't say his name. - No?

1821
00:57:38,602 --> 00:57:40,101
No, he might not like it.

1822
00:57:40,102 --> 00:57:41,741
- Harvest Festival? - Yes.

1823
00:57:41,801 --> 00:57:43,071
- Teenagers are... - Quiet.

1824
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:45,670
You're at a restaurant.

1825
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:46,711
Quiet!

1826
00:57:47,011 --> 00:57:48,940
- Go. - Hi, I'm Yoo Yeon Seok.

1827
00:57:48,941 --> 00:57:50,641
I heard you were having a festival.

1828
00:57:50,642 --> 00:57:52,751
I hope you have a fun...

1829
00:57:52,752 --> 00:57:54,721
and enjoyable time.

1830
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,522
Happy Harvest Festival.

1831
00:57:57,452 --> 00:57:58,690
What brings you here?

1832
00:57:58,691 --> 00:57:59,851
What?

1833
00:57:59,852 --> 00:58:02,161
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1834
00:58:02,162 --> 00:58:04,391
- If I were to be born again, - We already recorded our part.

1835
00:58:04,392 --> 00:58:06,891
I will apply to Hyundai High School.

1836
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:08,631
- Okay. Let's go. - Let's go.

1837
00:58:08,901 --> 00:58:10,661
(Satisfied father)

1838
00:58:10,662 --> 00:58:11,671
Excuse me.

1839
00:58:12,372 --> 00:58:14,271
Can we have four bowls of freshwater eel over rice?

1840
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:16,232
(They order 4 bowls of freshwater eel over rice.)

1841
00:58:16,772 --> 00:58:17,972
This is nice.

1842
00:58:18,071 --> 00:58:20,371
I'm so tired.

1843
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,912
I overworked my brain.

1844
00:58:22,781 --> 00:58:25,101
I always lose my voice after doing a shoot with Jong Kook.

1845
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:26,911
He talks too much.

1846
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:28,320
I do not.

1847
00:58:28,321 --> 00:58:30,892
I lose my voice answering him.

1848
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,090
Isn't doing shows with him exhausting, Jae Suk?

1849
00:58:33,091 --> 00:58:34,391
- Why would it be exhausting? - I have one every week.

1850
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:35,392
Right?

1851
00:58:35,393 --> 00:58:37,191
You two are exhausting.

1852
00:58:38,432 --> 00:58:40,561
- I don't wear people out. - How old...

1853
00:58:40,562 --> 00:58:41,701
did the youngest director say she was?

1854
00:58:41,702 --> 00:58:42,831
- She was really young. - I was surprised to hear her age.

1855
00:58:42,832 --> 00:58:44,001
She was born in 1996.

1856
00:58:44,002 --> 00:58:45,400
- Born in 1996? - Born in 1996.

1857
00:58:45,401 --> 00:58:48,800
- Then she's 30. - That's right.

1858
00:58:48,801 --> 00:58:50,701
She's 28 in international age.

1859
00:58:50,702 --> 00:58:52,740
- Thirty isn't... - I didn't realize how old she was.

1860
00:58:52,741 --> 00:58:54,911
- a young age. - No, it isn't.

1861
00:58:54,912 --> 00:58:57,481
If you listen to the song "Around Thirty..."

1862
00:58:57,482 --> 00:58:59,951
by Kim Kwang Seok,

1863
00:58:59,952 --> 00:59:02,280
- That's right. - it sounds like he's old.

1864
00:59:02,281 --> 00:59:04,550
When we were young, 30 seemed much older.

1865
00:59:04,551 --> 00:59:05,722
- You're right. - Totally.

1866
00:59:06,051 --> 00:59:09,360
- It's similar to 40 nowadays. - Yes, it is.

1867
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:10,760
I think it would be similar to mid-40s nowadays.

1868
00:59:10,761 --> 00:59:11,932
It's similar to 40.

1869
00:59:12,191 --> 00:59:14,461
Even 40 passed like it was nothing.

1870
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:16,630
You know...

1871
00:59:16,631 --> 00:59:18,332
What is 50 like?

1872
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:20,572
- Fifty? - Do you feel yourself suddenly age?

1873
00:59:20,602 --> 00:59:21,741
Fifty is like...

1874
00:59:22,502 --> 00:59:23,571
Did you feel different?

1875
00:59:23,972 --> 00:59:25,011
It's not a good feeling.

1876
00:59:25,912 --> 00:59:27,240
- "It's not a good feeling?" - "Not a good feeling?"

1877
00:59:27,241 --> 00:59:28,610
- You must've felt it. - But it's different for everyone.

1878
00:59:28,611 --> 00:59:30,411
- That's right. - But you feel it as you age.

1879
00:59:30,412 --> 00:59:31,780
- That's right. - Andropause hits.

1880
00:59:31,781 --> 00:59:33,582
What are we next year?

1881
00:59:33,952 --> 00:59:35,751
- Are we 49 or 50 next year? - We're 49.

1882
00:59:35,752 --> 00:59:37,251
Is that international age...

1883
00:59:37,252 --> 00:59:38,391
- or Korean age? - It's international age.

1884
00:59:38,392 --> 00:59:39,420
We originally would've been 50.

1885
00:59:39,421 --> 00:59:40,451
- We would've been 50? - Yes.

1886
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:41,690
- You're 50 now. - That's right.

1887
00:59:41,691 --> 00:59:42,998
- We would've been 50 next year. - You're 50.

1888
00:59:43,022 --> 00:59:44,732
What are you waiting for?

1889
00:59:45,461 --> 00:59:46,860
What are you waiting for...

1890
00:59:46,861 --> 00:59:48,030
- when you're almost 50? - Hey.

1891
00:59:48,031 --> 00:59:49,501
- I should get married. - Why don't we hold...

1892
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,761
your 50th birthday today?

1893
00:59:51,631 --> 00:59:53,371
- We're already 50? - How old are you?

1894
00:59:53,372 --> 00:59:54,871
- Are you 40? - Have that.

1895
00:59:54,872 --> 00:59:55,940
- Have some coke. - It's not that.

1896
00:59:55,941 --> 00:59:57,940
- Have some coke. - First of all...

1897
00:59:57,941 --> 00:59:59,440
We aren't 50 yet.

1898
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:01,081
I'll tell you what 50 is like.

1899
01:00:01,082 --> 01:00:02,780
- Congratulations. - We aren't 50 yet.

1900
01:00:02,781 --> 01:00:04,110
- You're joining the 50s club. - Look.

1901
01:00:04,111 --> 01:00:05,852
- If you turn 50, - Congratulations.

1902
01:00:06,281 --> 01:00:09,351
Your body doesn't feel it immediately...

1903
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:11,391
- since you went from 49 to 50. - Right.

1904
01:00:11,392 --> 01:00:13,951
But you'll definitely realize that some things are different.

1905
01:00:13,952 --> 01:00:14,960
Like what?

1906
01:00:14,961 --> 01:00:17,161
Didn't you feel it when you turned 40?

1907
01:00:17,162 --> 01:00:18,291
- That's right, - You feel it.

1908
01:00:18,292 --> 01:00:20,260
But there wasn't a significant difference.

1909
01:00:20,261 --> 01:00:21,701
Turning 50 must feel different.

1910
01:00:21,702 --> 01:00:25,602
Having a family and children in your 50s...

1911
01:00:25,772 --> 01:00:27,300
and being single in your 50s...

1912
01:00:27,301 --> 01:00:28,641
- seem different. - It's very different.

1913
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:29,772
You have no one.

1914
01:00:30,441 --> 01:00:31,571
You have no one.

1915
01:00:32,241 --> 01:00:33,912
Why are you making that face?

1916
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:35,581
Did you have to give me...

1917
01:00:35,582 --> 01:00:37,411
- such a pathetic look? - Since I have no one yet.

1918
01:00:37,412 --> 01:00:40,110
- You have plenty of time. - That's just a personal choice.

1919
01:00:40,111 --> 01:00:42,380
- You still have time. - You know what?

1920
01:00:42,381 --> 01:00:43,951
I'm okay being single.

1921
01:00:43,952 --> 01:00:46,851
But seeing all my friends get married and have children,

1922
01:00:46,852 --> 01:00:48,320
- I start feeling different. - That's right.

1923
01:00:48,321 --> 01:00:51,561
It feels like I'm wasting time by myself.

1924
01:00:51,562 --> 01:00:53,662
- He's okay now. - Yes, I am.

1925
01:00:53,832 --> 01:00:56,308
You don't have to marry someone who's never been married before.

1926
01:00:56,332 --> 01:00:57,601
- Listen. - Well...

1927
01:00:57,602 --> 01:00:59,901
I'm not exactly...

1928
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,670
- against it. - But...

1929
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,411
But I won't pursue divorcees on purpose.

1930
01:01:04,412 --> 01:01:05,911
You should start dating first.

1931
01:01:05,912 --> 01:01:07,880
- Of course. - Another good thing...

1932
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:10,141
is that there are so many TV shows that help you get married nowadays.

1933
01:01:10,142 --> 01:01:11,581
- He can't go on one. - He was even a host.

1934
01:01:11,582 --> 01:01:13,280
I'm still a host.

1935
01:01:13,281 --> 01:01:15,021
- We're filming the 2nd season. - It's on its 2nd season?

1936
01:01:15,022 --> 01:01:16,181
You can go straight from a host...

1937
01:01:16,182 --> 01:01:17,221
to a participant.

1938
01:01:17,222 --> 01:01:18,791
The other people's ages are...

1939
01:01:18,792 --> 01:01:20,960
- He has to go on it. - You aren't the right age...

1940
01:01:20,961 --> 01:01:22,022
for the show, right?

1941
01:01:22,122 --> 01:01:24,261
What would be the right age range for me then?

1942
01:01:25,091 --> 01:01:28,630
The ages of the people on the show vary.

1943
01:01:28,631 --> 01:01:30,161
- Is that so? - Wouldn't he be really popular...

1944
01:01:30,162 --> 01:01:31,332
on "I Am Solo?"

1945
01:01:31,832 --> 01:01:32,900
Hey.

1946
01:01:32,901 --> 01:01:34,171
(Getting angry)

1947
01:01:34,272 --> 01:01:35,541
I'll take care of myself.

1948
01:01:35,542 --> 01:01:37,271
(Yeong Cheol of Season 76 ends up getting angry.)

1949
01:01:37,272 --> 01:01:38,510
Or there's one...

1950
01:01:38,511 --> 01:01:40,240
- hosted by Joo Byung Jin. - You know what?

1951
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:42,682
- "Never Late for Love." - He's single but not alone.

1952
01:01:42,841 --> 01:01:45,281
Didn't you see the numerous people who work out love him?

1953
01:01:45,482 --> 01:01:47,650
- I'm not lonely yet. - Of course not.

1954
01:01:47,651 --> 01:01:48,981
Why don't you start a new show?

1955
01:01:48,982 --> 01:01:51,090
You can call it "Single Gym Rat."

1956
01:01:51,091 --> 01:01:52,851
- "Single Gym Rat." - What do you think?

1957
01:01:52,852 --> 01:01:54,562
- They'll all be fit. - "Single Gym Rat?"

1958
01:01:54,792 --> 01:01:56,920
You get closer...

1959
01:01:56,921 --> 01:01:58,630
- while spotting each other. - That's possible.

1960
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:00,791
Instead of using the arrow of love, you can have barbells of love.

1961
01:02:00,792 --> 01:02:02,001
- That's enough. - That's good.

1962
01:02:02,002 --> 01:02:03,960
- Isn't that a good idea? - Yes, it is.

1963
01:02:03,961 --> 01:02:05,501
Okay, add 2kg.

1964
01:02:05,502 --> 01:02:06,900
(A matchmaking program that will make the gyms buzz with excitement)

1965
01:02:06,901 --> 01:02:09,261
You have to hold a barbell with one hand to choose someone.

1966
01:02:09,571 --> 01:02:10,801
Or else you aren't allowed to.

1967
01:02:11,042 --> 01:02:12,711
You need strong forearm muscles.

1968
01:02:13,142 --> 01:02:14,272
That's a good idea.

1969
01:02:14,511 --> 01:02:17,082
- What is one thing... - That's an idea.

1970
01:02:17,852 --> 01:02:20,380
That you absolutely need in a person...

1971
01:02:20,381 --> 01:02:23,051
and one thing you definitely cannot tolerate?

1972
01:02:23,821 --> 01:02:25,550
That sounds too extreme.

1973
01:02:25,551 --> 01:02:27,291
- I wouldn't say that. - He doesn't think like that.

1974
01:02:27,292 --> 01:02:29,791
- He could have dealbreakers. - But I do have this.

1975
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:33,030
I want someone who supports the things I love to do.

1976
01:02:33,031 --> 01:02:34,331
That's so vague.

1977
01:02:34,332 --> 01:02:37,431
Let's say there is something that makes her happy.

1978
01:02:37,432 --> 01:02:38,800
- You'd respect that? - Yes.

1979
01:02:38,801 --> 01:02:41,941
He doesn't want someone interfering with his workouts.

1980
01:02:42,002 --> 01:02:43,300
- Of course, you have that. - That's it.

1981
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:44,510
- I'm trying to say... - That's what he means.

1982
01:02:44,511 --> 01:02:45,740
"Don't say anything about my workouts."

1983
01:02:45,741 --> 01:02:48,380
- It's off-limits. - This is what I often say.

1984
01:02:48,381 --> 01:02:51,710
Marriage definitely requires sacrifices.

1985
01:02:51,711 --> 01:02:55,380
But let the other person have the one thing they really need.

1986
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:57,921
What if your wife loved fishing, working out, and drinking?

1987
01:02:58,491 --> 01:02:59,921
- My wife? - Or your girlfriend.

1988
01:03:01,191 --> 01:03:02,590
- Are you mad? - No, but...

1989
01:03:02,591 --> 01:03:03,721
He's upset.

1990
01:03:03,722 --> 01:03:05,130
My wife?

1991
01:03:05,131 --> 01:03:06,631
Why would...

1992
01:03:06,961 --> 01:03:09,078
- Why would she live like that? - Are you mad? Our food is here.

1993
01:03:09,102 --> 01:03:10,301
Why would she live like that?

1994
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,310
- Thank you. - The regular ones are for them.

1995
01:03:12,610 --> 01:03:13,649
Thank you.

1996
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:15,780
- Thank you. Gosh, it looks good. - Is there a reason to be that busy?

1997
01:03:15,781 --> 01:03:16,851
Gosh!

1998
01:03:17,051 --> 01:03:18,220
You know how to eat this, right?

1999
01:03:18,221 --> 01:03:19,851
It looks amazing.

2000
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:21,419
You should eat it as it is first.

2001
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,019
- Really? - Just eat it as it is?

2002
01:03:23,020 --> 01:03:24,629
Just eat it as it is,

2003
01:03:24,630 --> 01:03:26,729
and then mix some of these.

2004
01:03:26,730 --> 01:03:28,030
- Right. - Have the ochazuke...

2005
01:03:28,031 --> 01:03:29,407
with the dried laver and green onions.

2006
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:31,399
- Add these in. - Okay.

2007
01:03:31,400 --> 01:03:32,999
- Jae Suk... - Just eat it as it is first.

2008
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,340
Jae Suk doesn't like hearing those things.

2009
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,640
He turns a deaf ear to these things.

2010
01:03:38,641 --> 01:03:40,840
"I get it." This is what he says.

2011
01:03:43,210 --> 01:03:44,950
My gosh.

2012
01:03:44,951 --> 01:03:47,380
(He takes a bite as it is first.)

2013
01:03:48,121 --> 01:03:50,321
- Just eat it as it is 1st. - Just eat it as it is 1st.

2014
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,420
- Right. - That happens.

2015
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,189
Aren't I right?

2016
01:03:54,190 --> 01:03:57,490
(He's really satisfied with the buckwheat soba too.)

2017
01:03:57,491 --> 01:03:58,690
It's delicious.

2018
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:00,531
- It's delicious, right? - It's so good.

2019
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:01,859
- Right. - It's so good.

2020
01:04:01,860 --> 01:04:03,399
- Just eat it as it is first. - Right.

2021
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,100
Should I try eating it the way Yeon Seok told me to?

2022
01:04:05,101 --> 01:04:07,870
Yes. Add some of this in.

2023
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:09,100
Add some of this.

2024
01:04:09,101 --> 01:04:11,169
- Have the ochazuke... - Thank you.

2025
01:04:11,170 --> 01:04:12,640
- with the dried laver... - It's here.

2026
01:04:12,641 --> 01:04:14,180
- and green onions. - Where?

2027
01:04:14,181 --> 01:04:15,780
You eat them together.

2028
01:04:15,781 --> 01:04:17,781
- Just a little bit of it. - What is this?

2029
01:04:17,911 --> 01:04:21,220
It's like a broth.

2030
01:04:21,221 --> 01:04:23,551
- How much do I add in? - Just enough to soak it.

2031
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:24,820
Just enough to soak it.

2032
01:04:24,821 --> 01:04:26,649
It's like how we have rice with water.

2033
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,721
It's delicious.

2034
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,721
It's delicious, right? It does look good.

2035
01:04:29,960 --> 01:04:31,080
You don't have to add a lot.

2036
01:04:32,991 --> 01:04:34,229
I think it's better not to add a lot.

2037
01:04:34,230 --> 01:04:35,260
(Nodding)

2038
01:04:35,261 --> 01:04:37,201
- It will feel different. - It's delicious.

2039
01:04:37,831 --> 01:04:39,430
- It's moist. - It's delicious.

2040
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:41,499
It's much better to follow what people say.

2041
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,039
It's delicious. There's a reason to listen.

2042
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:46,270
- Of course. - But I hate listening.

2043
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:49,580
How do you know everything?

2044
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:51,110
I had no idea.

2045
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:52,781
It's good.

2046
01:04:52,782 --> 01:04:54,419
- I finished the whole bowl. - Gosh.

2047
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,450
(Everyone is satisfied with their lunch.)

2048
01:04:55,451 --> 01:04:57,590
Do you still play games to decide who pays?

2049
01:04:58,190 --> 01:04:59,621
- We do. - We do.

2050
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:02,020
This will be even more intense.

2051
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,459
Aren't there more pictures left?

2052
01:05:03,460 --> 01:05:06,129
The size of the pickled ginger is hard to tell.

2053
01:05:06,130 --> 01:05:08,260
- Let's go with that. - Determine the size of the ginger.

2054
01:05:08,261 --> 01:05:09,559
- Let's go with that. - The size?

2055
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:12,430
So we'll choose a piece and spread them out here.

2056
01:05:12,431 --> 01:05:13,500
- Okay. - Okay.

2057
01:05:13,601 --> 01:05:15,140
(Jong Kook will go first.)

2058
01:05:15,141 --> 01:05:16,200
- Okay. - No looking through them.

2059
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:17,269
It's done once you pick one.

2060
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:18,539
- No looking through them? - No.

2061
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:19,540
- It's done once you pick one. - No looking through them?
- No. - No.

2062
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:22,240
- Take the one on top? - Right.

2063
01:05:22,241 --> 01:05:23,310
Okay. Fine.

2064
01:05:23,540 --> 01:05:25,110
- I can lift it up. - Right.

2065
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,410
You got too many of them.

2066
01:05:27,411 --> 01:05:28,519
I have to spread it out.

2067
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,580
How can you do that? You have to pick one of them.

2068
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:32,789
- I can take this one. - What's that?

2069
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:33,820
This is one piece.

2070
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:35,120
(Spreading)

2071
01:05:35,121 --> 01:05:37,189
- No! You have to leave it alone! - It's spreading.

2072
01:05:37,190 --> 01:05:38,559
- Leave it alone. - Leave it alone.

2073
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:39,930
It's this one!

2074
01:05:39,931 --> 01:05:43,129
- It's not this one! - It's this one!

2075
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:44,770
- This is another piece. - It's this one!

2076
01:05:44,871 --> 01:05:46,130
- Gosh. - It's that.

2077
01:05:46,301 --> 01:05:48,240
- This one is mine. - This is the one you picked!

2078
01:05:48,241 --> 01:05:50,169
- How did you get such a big one? - That's yours.

2079
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:51,769
- You got one. - Okay.

2080
01:05:51,770 --> 01:05:54,479
(It already looks small from a distance.)

2081
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,140
That's yours. Put it down.

2082
01:05:56,141 --> 01:05:57,379
- Put it down! - That's yours!

2083
01:05:57,380 --> 01:05:59,280
Put it down! Okay.

2084
01:05:59,281 --> 01:06:00,680
Gosh.

2085
01:06:00,681 --> 01:06:01,950
Spread it out. There's more of it.

2086
01:06:01,951 --> 01:06:03,320
- Spread it. - There's more. Spread it out.

2087
01:06:03,321 --> 01:06:04,991
- There's more? That's it. - That's it.

2088
01:06:05,121 --> 01:06:06,591
- Gosh! - It's hard to pick them.

2089
01:06:07,091 --> 01:06:08,220
This one is long.

2090
01:06:08,591 --> 01:06:09,790
Doesn't it look long?

2091
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,860
- Right. - This one.

2092
01:06:11,291 --> 01:06:13,059
- Yes! - No. You have to get that off.

2093
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:14,330
- You have to get that off. - Gosh.

2094
01:06:14,331 --> 01:06:16,130
- No. It's part of it. - Come here.

2095
01:06:16,131 --> 01:06:17,929
It's going to come off!

2096
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:19,030
- It's that. - This is one piece.

2097
01:06:19,031 --> 01:06:20,399
- No way. - What's wrong with you?

2098
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:22,269
- This is one piece? - Come on!

2099
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:26,139
- It's going to tear apart! - Don't make it longer.

2100
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,240
- Come on! - Don't make it longer.

2101
01:06:27,241 --> 01:06:29,040
- Leave it alone. - It's longer.

2102
01:06:29,041 --> 01:06:30,639
- It's over. - Okay.

2103
01:06:30,640 --> 01:06:32,149
- This is it. - It won't be easy...

2104
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,050
to find a smaller one than Jae Suk's.

2105
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:35,850
This one should be bigger.

2106
01:06:36,050 --> 01:06:37,180
Go for it.

2107
01:06:37,581 --> 01:06:39,290
Check if it's one piece.

2108
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:40,519
Let us see it.

2109
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,120
- That's not one piece. - It is.

2110
01:06:42,121 --> 01:06:43,790
- Let's see it. - It wasn't one piece for mine too.

2111
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:44,791
It's this one.

2112
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:46,790
I have to hold onto this one without the smaller ones.

2113
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:48,900
- It's not that one. - Why are you tearing it apart?

2114
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:51,206
- Let's see it. - Why are you tearing it apart?

2115
01:06:51,230 --> 01:06:52,630
It's much bigger than Jae Suk's piece.

2116
01:06:52,631 --> 01:06:54,700
- Gosh! - Okay!

2117
01:06:54,701 --> 01:06:56,701
It's hard to find a smaller one than mine.

2118
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,470
Thank you for the meal.

2119
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:00,986
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you for the meal.

2120
01:07:01,010 --> 01:07:02,240
He's so warmhearted.

2121
01:07:02,241 --> 01:07:03,939
He lost on purpose to pay for us.

2122
01:07:03,940 --> 01:07:06,109
Gosh, I really didn't want to pay this time.

2123
01:07:06,110 --> 01:07:07,849
- Come on. - It was a bit expensive.

2124
01:07:07,850 --> 01:07:09,120
I really enjoyed it, though.

2125
01:07:09,121 --> 01:07:10,979
- Did you enjoy your meal? - It was amazing.

2126
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:12,189
It was great.

2127
01:07:12,214 --> 01:07:13,475
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2128
01:07:14,390 --> 01:07:15,490
We should have some coffee.

2129
01:07:15,491 --> 01:07:16,759
Should we have some from the bakery?

2130
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,291
That's not a bad idea.

2131
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:19,560
- An iced Americano... - Hey.

2132
01:07:19,561 --> 01:07:20,761
From the bakery would be nice.

2133
01:07:20,961 --> 01:07:23,560
- Yes? - Lunch was expensive.

2134
01:07:24,970 --> 01:07:26,900
This was enough to cover a team dinner.

2135
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,700
- It was really expensive. - Was it expensive?

2136
01:07:29,701 --> 01:07:30,899
- How much? - It was a team dinner.

2137
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,109
It must've cost over 200 dollars.

2138
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:34,939
- It wasn't that much. - Around 150 dollars?

2139
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:36,509
Gosh.

2140
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:37,809
The eel was expensive.

2141
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:38,910
- But it was good. - It was good.

2142
01:07:38,911 --> 01:07:39,979
It was good.

2143
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,780
Food that is nutritious and valuable is fine.

2144
01:07:42,781 --> 01:07:44,420
- There's no need to feel bad. - It just has to taste good.

2145
01:07:44,421 --> 01:07:46,889
Right. You can't be frugal on food.

2146
01:07:46,890 --> 01:07:48,620
- Let's cross the road again. - Again?

2147
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:50,821
Are we going back to SBS?

2148
01:07:51,060 --> 01:07:53,059
- We can have some coffee there. - Yes.

2149
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:54,160
You're right.

2150
01:07:54,161 --> 01:07:56,030
- Right. - We can have some coffee there.

2151
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,371
- We can get recharged. - Coffee sounds nice.

2152
01:07:58,970 --> 01:07:59,970
(They head back to SBS.)

2153
01:07:59,971 --> 01:08:01,500
We'll have some coffee.

2154
01:08:01,501 --> 01:08:03,770
Or should we take them to go and sit somewhere?

2155
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:05,070
Should we do that?

2156
01:08:05,071 --> 01:08:06,769
- We can sit somewhere else. - We can sit here with the coffee.

2157
01:08:06,770 --> 01:08:08,109
We should sit somewhere around there.

2158
01:08:08,110 --> 01:08:10,240
- We can take them to go. - I'll pay for the coffee.

2159
01:08:10,241 --> 01:08:11,609
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2160
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,009
I should pay for the coffee.

2161
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:15,620
- You should. - Right.

2162
01:08:15,621 --> 01:08:17,850
I should pay for the coffee. Okay.

2163
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:21,560
- I want a cafe latte. - I have the app on my phone.

2164
01:08:22,421 --> 01:08:24,259
- I want it to be light. - Right.

2165
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:26,360
I added in a lot of money in the app too.

2166
01:08:26,991 --> 01:08:29,059
- What kind of latte? - I want a latte.

2167
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:30,530
- Would you like a hot latte? - Yes.

2168
01:08:30,531 --> 01:08:31,969
Please make it light.

2169
01:08:31,970 --> 01:08:33,030
It usually has one shot in it.

2170
01:08:33,031 --> 01:08:34,330
- That will be enough. - Would you like half a shot?

2171
01:08:34,331 --> 01:08:36,070
- No. One shot will be enough. - Right.

2172
01:08:36,071 --> 01:08:38,639
- I would like a cafe latte as well. - A cafe latte?

2173
01:08:38,640 --> 01:08:41,040
- I'll get this too. - I'll have a grande size.

2174
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,240
- Okay. - Gosh.

2175
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:43,241
- Are you getting this too? - May I?

2176
01:08:43,242 --> 01:08:44,280
Go for it.

2177
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:46,649
- May I get some coffee beans? - Go for it, Yeon Seok.

2178
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:48,281
- Sure, Yeon Seok. - Gosh.

2179
01:08:48,421 --> 01:08:51,250
- Go for it, Yeon Seok. - No. It's okay.

2180
01:08:51,251 --> 01:08:53,320
- Just get it. - Just get it.

2181
01:08:53,321 --> 01:08:55,259
- Come on. We'll get this too. - Really?

2182
01:08:55,260 --> 01:08:56,760
- Of course. - I'll get this too.

2183
01:08:57,360 --> 01:08:59,090
(Tumbler)

2184
01:08:59,091 --> 01:09:00,160
- Are you okay? - Of course.

2185
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:02,160
- You look mad. - No.

2186
01:09:02,161 --> 01:09:04,001
I should use my card.

2187
01:09:04,430 --> 01:09:06,630
- What about your coffee? - A latte.

2188
01:09:06,631 --> 01:09:08,570
You're getting a latte too? You all are getting lattes.

2189
01:09:08,571 --> 01:09:10,939
(Sneaking away)

2190
01:09:10,940 --> 01:09:12,547
- I should get it when he's buying. - I'll get an iced Americano.

2191
01:09:12,571 --> 01:09:13,939
Is the grande the smallest size?

2192
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,710
- No. It's in the middle. - No. Venti is the biggest one.

2193
01:09:15,711 --> 01:09:17,351
- Jong Kook! - I'll have the middle size.

2194
01:09:17,381 --> 01:09:18,450
- Grande. - Is that cute?

2195
01:09:18,451 --> 01:09:19,451
(It's a purse!)

2196
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:22,080
- Is that cute? Pass it here. - No.

2197
01:09:22,081 --> 01:09:24,120
- No. - Get it for Na Eun.

2198
01:09:24,121 --> 01:09:26,019
- No. It's really pretty. - Or get it for your wife.

2199
01:09:26,020 --> 01:09:28,290
- Pass it here. - But...

2200
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,120
- Why are you getting a purse? - Pass it here.

2201
01:09:30,121 --> 01:09:31,729
I don't have anything else to spend my money on. Pass it here.

2202
01:09:31,730 --> 01:09:34,530
- Gosh. - Is there one in the box for this?

2203
01:09:34,531 --> 01:09:36,099
"One in the box?"

2204
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:37,130
We'll get one.

2205
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,200
- Right. It's cute and fluffy. - I'll get it for Na Eun.

2206
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:41,440
(Na Eun's purse gets ordered as well.)

2207
01:09:44,911 --> 01:09:46,469
- Why did we get so much? - How much?

2208
01:09:46,470 --> 01:09:47,790
(They are surprised by the bill.)

2209
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,411
It's 127 dollars.

2210
01:09:51,281 --> 01:09:53,009
- You ordered four drinks, - Right.

2211
01:09:53,010 --> 01:09:54,679
- a tumbler, coffee beans, - Right.

2212
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,380
- and the purse, right? - Yes.

2213
01:09:56,381 --> 01:09:57,950
Do you need a bag with a handle?

2214
01:09:57,951 --> 01:09:59,349
We just came here for some coffee.

2215
01:09:59,350 --> 01:10:00,910
- It's as much as the eel. - Excuse me.

2216
01:10:01,321 --> 01:10:02,889
- This is the total price, right? - Right.

2217
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,590
This can't be 120 dollars on its own.

2218
01:10:04,591 --> 01:10:07,591
- It's the total price. - Right.

2219
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,229
Thank you, Jong Kook.

2220
01:10:09,230 --> 01:10:10,700
Wouldn't it be hard to carry that around?

2221
01:10:10,701 --> 01:10:11,899
It's fine.

2222
01:10:11,900 --> 01:10:13,429
- We can do that. - I'll help you with the payment.

2223
01:10:13,430 --> 01:10:15,670
- Right. Should I insert it? - Yes.

2224
01:10:15,671 --> 01:10:17,040
(He ended up getting them gifts.)

2225
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:18,309
- They're loving it. - This is nice.

2226
01:10:18,310 --> 01:10:19,741
This is nice.

2227
01:10:20,371 --> 01:10:22,410
- What is that, Jae Suk? - I was out of coffee beans.

2228
01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:23,540
- What? - What is that?

2229
01:10:23,541 --> 01:10:25,910
- This? It's for Na Eun. - It's so pretty.

2230
01:10:25,911 --> 01:10:28,549
- It will be perfect for her. - It's so pretty!

2231
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:29,719
It's really pretty.

2232
01:10:29,720 --> 01:10:31,719
- She can go to school with it. - I wasn't going to buy it, but...

2233
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:32,950
- Gosh. - It's pretty.

2234
01:10:32,951 --> 01:10:34,990
It looks perfect for Na Eun.

2235
01:10:34,991 --> 01:10:36,059
It's fluffy.

2236
01:10:36,060 --> 01:10:37,120
- Right. - You chose a nice one.

2237
01:10:37,121 --> 01:10:40,359
Jong Kook was going to pay for some coffee.

2238
01:10:40,360 --> 01:10:42,501
It's similar to the price I paid.

2239
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,770
(Looking around)

2240
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,840
- What is he up to? - His card didn't work.

2241
01:10:49,841 --> 01:10:51,961
His card didn't work, so he's using a different card.

2242
01:10:52,871 --> 01:10:56,210
He's not used to spending a lot of money.

2243
01:10:56,211 --> 01:10:58,911
Didn't he reach his credit limit after paying for this?

2244
01:10:59,180 --> 01:11:01,180
Gosh, this is really disappointing.

2245
01:11:02,781 --> 01:11:05,121
It's hard to get gifts for people.

2246
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:06,889
- Who is this for? - It's mine.

2247
01:11:06,890 --> 01:11:08,189
- You're using this? - No.

2248
01:11:08,190 --> 01:11:09,259
It's for your kid?

2249
01:11:09,260 --> 01:11:10,790
- It's for the youngest. - This small tumbler?

2250
01:11:10,791 --> 01:11:12,859
- Sure. It's for the youngest. - Thank you, Jong Kook.

2251
01:11:12,860 --> 01:11:14,929
- Thank you. - It's great to get you gifts.

2252
01:11:14,930 --> 01:11:17,059
- It's amazing. - Gosh.

2253
01:11:17,060 --> 01:11:18,530
We just came for some coffee.

2254
01:11:18,531 --> 01:11:20,007
He ended up paying as much as our lunch.

2255
01:11:20,031 --> 01:11:23,340
This is what happens when things go against you.

2256
01:11:23,341 --> 01:11:25,240
You make a lot of money. You should spend a bit.

2257
01:11:25,241 --> 01:11:26,470
- Right. - Right.

2258
01:11:26,571 --> 01:11:27,851
This is the joy of making money.

2259
01:11:28,680 --> 01:11:30,609
- Thank you. - You don't look happy.

2260
01:11:30,610 --> 01:11:31,750
- That's not true. - You look a bit...

2261
01:11:31,751 --> 01:11:34,350
- Not at all. I feel really happy. - Gosh.

2262
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,921
Didn't I get you AirPods the other time?

2263
01:11:38,321 --> 01:11:39,491
Right.

2264
01:11:39,890 --> 01:11:41,420
We went to a department store together.

2265
01:11:41,421 --> 01:11:42,921
- Really? - We went together.

2266
01:11:43,121 --> 01:11:45,559
When I meet up with him, I call my three kids,

2267
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,059
and the one to pick up becomes the lucky one.

2268
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:50,599
- "Hey!" - He asks if they need anything.

2269
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:51,700
(Santa Jong Kook is famous to Tae Hyun's three kids.)

2270
01:11:51,701 --> 01:11:53,871
I still don't have kids.

2271
01:11:54,001 --> 01:11:55,481
I should spend my money for his kids.

2272
01:11:56,541 --> 01:11:58,309
Will his name be called when the coffee is ready?

2273
01:11:58,310 --> 01:11:59,970
I'm always A-something.

2274
01:12:00,411 --> 01:12:01,610
A-something.

2275
01:12:02,010 --> 01:12:03,939
- Will they let us know? - Right.

2276
01:12:03,940 --> 01:12:05,309
- I'll go and check. - It must be out.

2277
01:12:05,310 --> 01:12:07,950
Thank you. Customer A-14!

2278
01:12:07,951 --> 01:12:09,781
That's me. A-something.

2279
01:12:10,121 --> 01:12:12,350
My gosh.

2280
01:12:12,621 --> 01:12:15,189
- Here's your light coffee. - Gosh.

2281
01:12:15,190 --> 01:12:16,750
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - Here you are.

2282
01:12:17,821 --> 01:12:19,830
- It's nice and warm. It's perfect. - Right.

2283
01:12:19,831 --> 01:12:21,160
Let's clink our cups.

2284
01:12:21,161 --> 01:12:23,259
- It's great after a greasy meal. - Thank you, Jong Kook.

2285
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:24,399
- It's perfect. - Thank you.

2286
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:25,501
It's nice.

2287
01:12:25,631 --> 01:12:27,769
You know how to make your own coffee, Yeon Seok.

2288
01:12:27,770 --> 01:12:28,939
- Right. - You make it yourself, right?

2289
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:31,071
You must really want to buy these when you see them.

2290
01:12:31,241 --> 01:12:32,509
Yeon Seok does everything.

2291
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:34,550
- I was out of coffee beans. - They sell them here.

2292
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:36,440
- Thank you, Jong Kook. - Don't mention it.

2293
01:12:37,381 --> 01:12:39,109
(Peeking)

2294
01:12:39,110 --> 01:12:40,870
It's my first time seeing someone buy these.

2295
01:12:42,581 --> 01:12:45,650
It's actually my first time seeing someone buy these.

2296
01:12:46,390 --> 01:12:48,019
We should get going. It's 12pm.

2297
01:12:48,020 --> 01:12:49,660
At 12:12pm,

2298
01:12:49,661 --> 01:12:52,430
a bus will come.

2299
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:55,759
If we leave at around 12:05pm,

2300
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,899
- we won't have to wait. - I see.

2301
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,099
(They should slowly head out to catch the bus.)

2302
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:00,299
We'll take the bus.

2303
01:13:00,300 --> 01:13:02,600
You take the bus after checking the time? Gosh.

2304
01:13:03,501 --> 01:13:05,740
- That's amazing. - The bus times can be checked.

2305
01:13:05,741 --> 01:13:06,870
- Really? - Yes.

2306
01:13:06,871 --> 01:13:08,109
There are six minutes left.

2307
01:13:08,110 --> 01:13:09,609
How is that possible?

2308
01:13:09,610 --> 01:13:10,679
Hello.

2309
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:12,479
- It appears in the app. - Really?

2310
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:15,080
The bus stops...

2311
01:13:15,081 --> 01:13:16,620
- They're all connected. - all have the systems.

2312
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:17,820
It shows you how many stops are left before it arrives.

2313
01:13:17,821 --> 01:13:19,019
There are four stops left.

2314
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:21,421
- Really? - Gosh, it's cold!

2315
01:13:21,520 --> 01:13:22,961
That's amazing.

2316
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,290
- The wind is really chilly. - I should close the door, right?

2317
01:13:25,291 --> 01:13:26,490
- It's windy. - It would be perfect...

2318
01:13:26,491 --> 01:13:27,790
to stay at home in a weather like this.

2319
01:13:27,791 --> 01:13:29,030
- It would be perfect. - It would be perfect.

2320
01:13:29,031 --> 01:13:30,830
I'm here because you called me.

2321
01:13:30,831 --> 01:13:32,270
I was supposed to be at home.

2322
01:13:33,171 --> 01:13:34,870
- Is this it? - Right.

2323
01:13:34,871 --> 01:13:36,500
- Is this it? - Yes.

2324
01:13:36,501 --> 01:13:37,501
Hello.

2325
01:13:37,770 --> 01:13:38,840
Gosh, it's cold.

2326
01:13:38,841 --> 01:13:40,940
- That never happened. - Really?

2327
01:13:41,581 --> 01:13:43,810
It's warm if you sit on this these days.

2328
01:13:44,041 --> 01:13:45,480
Right. It's heated.

2329
01:13:45,610 --> 01:13:47,580
- Take a seat. - It has a bottom warmer?

2330
01:13:47,581 --> 01:13:48,620
Check it out.

2331
01:13:48,621 --> 01:13:50,019
The seats are warm these days.

2332
01:13:50,020 --> 01:13:51,849
- Gosh, it's warm. - Things are so nice these days.

2333
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:53,019
Gosh, try sitting on it.

2334
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,219
- It has a bottom warmer? - It's so warm.

2335
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:55,220
(The bottom-warming bench is recommended.)

2336
01:13:55,221 --> 01:13:56,389
Check it out.

2337
01:13:56,390 --> 01:13:58,259
It's so warm. It's like the floor heating system.

2338
01:13:58,260 --> 01:14:00,031
I'm not cold. I'm just trying it out.

2339
01:14:00,091 --> 01:14:01,661
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2340
01:14:01,860 --> 01:14:04,229
- Hey, it has a bottom warmer! - It's so warm.

2341
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:05,399
- Gosh! - It's so warm.

2342
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,100
It's very warm.

2343
01:14:07,331 --> 01:14:09,439
- I didn't expect this much warmth. - It's really warm.

2344
01:14:09,440 --> 01:14:11,509
This is like the five-star bed.

2345
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:12,670
- It's a lot warmer... - Hey,

2346
01:14:12,671 --> 01:14:14,210
- isn't this like the five-star bed? - Gosh.

2347
01:14:14,211 --> 01:14:16,240
So that was why people had their hands down here.

2348
01:14:16,241 --> 01:14:18,210
My hands naturally ended up down here as well.

2349
01:14:18,211 --> 01:14:19,880
That's fascinating too.

2350
01:14:19,881 --> 01:14:21,250
Korea is amazing.

2351
01:14:21,251 --> 01:14:22,750
We're the country of the floor heating system.

2352
01:14:22,751 --> 01:14:23,821
Right.

2353
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:26,290
These sorts of things appear in...

2354
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:28,219
short-form videos of foreigners.

2355
01:14:28,220 --> 01:14:29,359
- Fascinating things in Korea. - As they're fascinated.

2356
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,961
I haven't seen this one.

2357
01:14:31,260 --> 01:14:32,889
- Foreigners should try this. - So that was why people...

2358
01:14:32,890 --> 01:14:33,960
had their hands down here.

2359
01:14:33,961 --> 01:14:35,030
- It's so warm. - Can the world...

2360
01:14:35,031 --> 01:14:36,100
be this nice to live in?

2361
01:14:36,631 --> 01:14:38,200
(Breathing heavily)

2362
01:14:38,201 --> 01:14:40,300
- Are you upset? - No.

2363
01:14:40,501 --> 01:14:42,661
Don't you think it's quite unfair? When we were young,

2364
01:14:43,100 --> 01:14:45,070
- we didn't even have benches. - Right.

2365
01:14:45,071 --> 01:14:47,139
We usually waited for the bus standing.

2366
01:14:47,140 --> 01:14:48,340
Right. I never sat down.

2367
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:49,679
I didn't expect it to be this warm.

2368
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,410
- It's really warm. - And before,

2369
01:14:51,411 --> 01:14:52,711
we used to...

2370
01:14:53,251 --> 01:14:55,380
- shake the hand warmers. - Right.

2371
01:14:55,381 --> 01:14:57,719
But these days, they are made like portable chargers.

2372
01:14:57,720 --> 01:14:59,890
- I knew that. - Come on!

2373
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,689
But that splits in half.

2374
01:15:02,690 --> 01:15:03,719
- What? - What?

2375
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:04,830
- Did you know that? - It splits in half?

2376
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:06,160
- What? - Why would it split in half?

2377
01:15:06,161 --> 01:15:07,790
- Stop lying. - Stop lying!

2378
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,631
- Seriously. - This little punk!

2379
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:12,200
- What are you doing with us? - We used the ones...

2380
01:15:12,201 --> 01:15:13,830
- that could be charged. - Right.

2381
01:15:13,831 --> 01:15:15,469
But the ones made now...

2382
01:15:15,470 --> 01:15:17,970
can be split in half and used in both pockets.

2383
01:15:18,211 --> 01:15:19,769
I had this in the past.

2384
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:21,410
- It's a hand warmer that opened... - You have to use oil.

2385
01:15:21,411 --> 01:15:22,540
And lit on fire with oil.

2386
01:15:22,541 --> 01:15:23,840
That would smell so much.

2387
01:15:23,841 --> 01:15:25,009
- Right? - You're right.

2388
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:26,881
- That's for camping. - That's for camping?

2389
01:15:27,010 --> 01:15:28,550
- I had that in the past. - Right.

2390
01:15:28,650 --> 01:15:30,420
- There it is. - It's not that one.

2391
01:15:30,421 --> 01:15:31,951
What? Is the bus here?

2392
01:15:32,390 --> 01:15:33,689
- Okay. - The T-money card.

2393
01:15:33,690 --> 01:15:35,090
Does the last person have to pay? How is it done?

2394
01:15:35,091 --> 01:15:36,960
- The last person? Okay. - I'll do it.

2395
01:15:36,961 --> 01:15:38,259
Hello. We'll pay for four people.

2396
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:39,490
Hello. We're a group of four.

2397
01:15:39,491 --> 01:15:40,491
- A group of four? - Yes.

2398
01:15:40,890 --> 01:15:42,229
- I see. - Gosh.

2399
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:43,460
I always sat in the back.

2400
01:15:43,461 --> 01:15:45,769
I'm missing the bench because it's so warm.

2401
01:15:45,770 --> 01:15:47,171
Same here.

2402
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:50,371
Then does it turn off when people aren't there?

2403
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:51,809
- No. - No. It's always on.

2404
01:15:51,810 --> 01:15:53,470
It's a bit of a waste to keep it on.

2405
01:15:55,911 --> 01:15:58,750
That kind of heating system uses more energy...

2406
01:15:58,751 --> 01:16:00,149
- when it's turned on and off. - Right.

2407
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:02,019
- Is that so? - It's better to maintain the heat.

2408
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:03,280
- Really? - Right.

2409
01:16:03,281 --> 01:16:05,950
What do you do with your heating system at home?

2410
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:07,290
- I don't use it. - He doesn't.

2411
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:08,661
- What? - I don't use it.

2412
01:16:09,161 --> 01:16:11,121
- That bench is much warmer... - I don't use it.

2413
01:16:11,461 --> 01:16:12,690
Than Jong Kook's house.

2414
01:16:13,991 --> 01:16:15,500
- What? - It's not that bad.

2415
01:16:15,501 --> 01:16:17,661
It's hard to take a step on the floor in his house.

2416
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:19,800
- It's cold as ice. - Just the living room.

2417
01:16:20,100 --> 01:16:21,977
- Just the living room. - Just the living room?

2418
01:16:22,001 --> 01:16:24,571
I can put on a long padded jacket. in the living room.

2419
01:16:25,510 --> 01:16:27,010
I can wear that.

2420
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:29,179
A long padded jacket works.

2421
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,680
Isn't that like an army barracks?

2422
01:16:32,081 --> 01:16:33,880
- Listen. - Is that even okay?

2423
01:16:33,881 --> 01:16:36,120
I don't understand why I should turn on the heating system...

2424
01:16:36,121 --> 01:16:38,149
in that big living room when I live alone.

2425
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:39,889
- Right. - I'm just alone.

2426
01:16:39,890 --> 01:16:41,389
I spend a lot of time...

2427
01:16:41,390 --> 01:16:43,560
- in my room. - But you do use the living room.

2428
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,130
I do. I spend a lot of time in the living room.

2429
01:16:45,131 --> 01:16:46,530
That is why I wear a long padded jacket.

2430
01:16:46,531 --> 01:16:47,890
(Clear answer)

2431
01:16:48,331 --> 01:16:49,799
(The invincible long padded jacket)

2432
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,500
Is that weird?

2433
01:16:51,501 --> 01:16:53,599
There's no warmth in Jong Kook's house.

2434
01:16:53,600 --> 01:16:56,240
Well, if there are more than two people living in that house,

2435
01:16:56,241 --> 01:16:58,170
it's worth turning on the heating system.

2436
01:16:58,171 --> 01:16:59,469
But I can endure it when I'm alone.

2437
01:16:59,470 --> 01:17:00,570
- I don't need to turn it on. - Hey.

2438
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:02,439
It's worth turning on if there are more than two people?

2439
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:04,880
The four of us visited your house. Why didn't you turn it on then?

2440
01:17:04,881 --> 01:17:07,581
That was because you guys came temporarily.

2441
01:17:08,621 --> 01:17:10,821
- You guys came temporarily. - Gosh.

2442
01:17:11,081 --> 01:17:13,291
Let's say your wife went on a trip.

2443
01:17:13,491 --> 01:17:15,120
What will you do with the living room?

2444
01:17:15,121 --> 01:17:16,790
- My wife went on a trip? - Right.

2445
01:17:16,791 --> 01:17:18,560
Then I should hurry up and turn it off.

2446
01:17:19,430 --> 01:17:20,490
That's obvious.

2447
01:17:20,491 --> 01:17:22,530
I'm saying this as you all might get the wrong idea.

2448
01:17:22,531 --> 01:17:24,660
Let's say there are more than two in the house after I get married.

2449
01:17:24,661 --> 01:17:27,570
Then I will definitely turn it on as we'll be living together.

2450
01:17:27,571 --> 01:17:29,571
But I'm living alone right now,

2451
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:31,099
so I don't need it at all.

2452
01:17:31,100 --> 01:17:33,070
I eat in the living room.

2453
01:17:33,071 --> 01:17:34,139
I can wear a long padded jacket.

2454
01:17:34,140 --> 01:17:35,240
- Stop it. - Why?

2455
01:17:35,241 --> 01:17:37,309
You really won't be able to get married.

2456
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,910
Stop! Stop talking!

2457
01:17:38,911 --> 01:17:40,109
I'll turn it on when I get married. What's wrong with that?

2458
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:42,451
Don't even add those conditions!

2459
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:43,849
Just lie about it.

2460
01:17:43,850 --> 01:17:45,889
Just say that your house is warm right now.

2461
01:17:45,890 --> 01:17:47,290
No. I can't do that.

2462
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:49,190
- That's why people won't visit you. - What?

2463
01:17:49,291 --> 01:17:51,059
- But he got us gifts today. - Right.

2464
01:17:51,060 --> 01:17:53,161
Is this something that is hard to understand?

2465
01:17:53,831 --> 01:17:55,859
I told you to stop.

2466
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:58,099
- Just stay still, Jong Kook. - I've been saying the same thing...

2467
01:17:58,100 --> 01:17:59,570
for ten years. Don't say these things.

2468
01:17:59,571 --> 01:18:02,470
Isn't it better to live in a studio apartment then?

2469
01:18:02,741 --> 01:18:05,170
But I have a lot of stuff in the house.

2470
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:06,309
- I see. - I need some space.

2471
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:07,870
You should get rid of things.

2472
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,341
- What? - Your clothes!

2473
01:18:09,381 --> 01:18:10,781
You don't wear all of them.

2474
01:18:10,911 --> 01:18:13,286
- You wear the same clothes. - Right. I wear the same clothes.

2475
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:16,019
There's a clothing bin in the apartment complex.

2476
01:18:16,020 --> 01:18:18,219
Rather than putting the clothes in there,

2477
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:20,019
I can give away the nice ones to the people around me.

2478
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:22,690
Gosh, people won't wear them as they're not really good clothes.

2479
01:18:22,961 --> 01:18:24,460
- They won't wear them. - Gosh.

2480
01:18:24,461 --> 01:18:27,330
There are a lot of luxury products hidden in my house.

2481
01:18:27,331 --> 01:18:29,701
- Are they clothes? - They're hidden.

2482
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,229
I have wallets too.

2483
01:18:31,230 --> 01:18:32,399
- Really? - We should visit then.

2484
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,399
- I have a lot of things. - Should we visit later?

2485
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:35,700
It's packed.

2486
01:18:35,701 --> 01:18:37,001
You can use them then.

2487
01:18:37,371 --> 01:18:39,411
Gosh. I just can't.

2488
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,710
- I can't stand myself with them. - Then...

2489
01:18:41,711 --> 01:18:44,179
you gift others luxury products, right?

2490
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:46,609
Of course. I give out nice gifts.

2491
01:18:46,610 --> 01:18:49,479
There's value when the other person likes the gift.

2492
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:51,990
But I don't want to receive them.

2493
01:18:51,991 --> 01:18:53,049
You don't want them as gifts?

2494
01:18:53,050 --> 01:18:54,990
- I would rather... - What kind of gifts...

2495
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:56,860
- would you like then? - Toothpaste,

2496
01:18:57,220 --> 01:18:58,661
- Toothpaste? - soap...

2497
01:18:58,961 --> 01:19:00,330
- Soap? - Daily necessities.

2498
01:19:00,331 --> 01:19:02,059
- Shampoo. - Daily necessities?

2499
01:19:02,060 --> 01:19:03,759
- I love these things. - Shampoo.

2500
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:05,270
I love getting those things as gifts.

2501
01:19:05,371 --> 01:19:07,000
Jong Kook likes things like...

2502
01:19:07,001 --> 01:19:08,939
- moisture removers. - I do.

2503
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:10,700
I can keep them at home...

2504
01:19:10,701 --> 01:19:12,340
and use them right away.

2505
01:19:12,341 --> 01:19:14,210
Gifts that you can use for brushing your teeth...

2506
01:19:14,211 --> 01:19:15,479
or sweeping the floor.

2507
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,810
- Those gifts? - I love those things as gifts.

2508
01:19:18,281 --> 01:19:20,681
Soo Chan will be taking the college entrance exam next year.

2509
01:19:20,951 --> 01:19:22,019
I should get him a wallet from your place.

2510
01:19:22,020 --> 01:19:25,049
Did Soo Chan go past his puberty?

2511
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:26,149
He did.

2512
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,719
He didn't even like his name being mentioned.

2513
01:19:27,720 --> 01:19:28,990
He was called, "You know who."

2514
01:19:28,991 --> 01:19:30,790
- "That guy." - "That guy."

2515
01:19:30,791 --> 01:19:32,689
Is that guy okay with his puberty now?

2516
01:19:32,690 --> 01:19:34,429
That fellow is over it now.

2517
01:19:34,430 --> 01:19:35,559
- I see. - You can't say his name.

2518
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:38,200
He is doing much better.

2519
01:19:38,201 --> 01:19:39,870
("He" is doing much better.)

2520
01:19:39,871 --> 01:19:42,270
What is his hobby these days?

2521
01:19:42,470 --> 01:19:44,240
I'm not sure what his hobby is.

2522
01:19:44,241 --> 01:19:45,440
Really?

2523
01:19:45,640 --> 01:19:48,009
Isn't he at a time when he should be working out now?

2524
01:19:48,010 --> 01:19:49,410
Great news!

2525
01:19:49,411 --> 01:19:52,150
He is going through personal training right now.

2526
01:19:52,381 --> 01:19:53,451
- Gosh! - He's doing what?

2527
01:19:53,610 --> 01:19:54,626
He is going through personal training right now.

2528
01:19:54,650 --> 01:19:56,380
- Gosh! - He's doing what?

2529
01:19:56,381 --> 01:19:57,780
- Personal training. - That's nice.

2530
01:19:57,781 --> 01:19:59,490
- He goes twice a week. - He needs to.

2531
01:19:59,491 --> 01:20:01,859
- All kids these days work out. - Right.

2532
01:20:01,860 --> 01:20:03,461
- They work out a lot. - Also,

2533
01:20:03,760 --> 01:20:06,160
he has cut his hair short.

2534
01:20:06,161 --> 01:20:07,990
- Really? - He must be willing to study now.

2535
01:20:07,991 --> 01:20:09,030
Really?

2536
01:20:09,031 --> 01:20:10,376
(Having short hair means he has the will to study?)

2537
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,799
- He must want to study for a year. - That's great to hear.

2538
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,200
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you, sir.

2539
01:20:14,201 --> 01:20:15,570
- Thank you, sir. - Thank you.

2540
01:20:15,571 --> 01:20:16,769
Thank you. Goodbye.

2541
01:20:16,770 --> 01:20:17,871
You're sitting again?

2542
01:20:18,470 --> 01:20:20,040
Gosh, it's so warm.

2543
01:20:20,041 --> 01:20:22,711
It's just like the floor heating system.

2544
01:20:23,510 --> 01:20:24,740
We have no time.

2545
01:20:24,741 --> 01:20:27,009
- We should hurry. - It's so warm.

2546
01:20:27,010 --> 01:20:29,649
- Gosh. - I didn't expect this much warmth.

2547
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:31,281
Gosh, how is that possible?

2548
01:20:31,550 --> 01:20:32,820
It's Lee Sang Heon.

2549
01:20:32,821 --> 01:20:35,690
"I go around Seoul over and over again, every day."

2550
01:20:35,961 --> 01:20:37,460
"I have been in charge of getting people..."

2551
01:20:37,461 --> 01:20:39,030
"to work and off work."

2552
01:20:39,031 --> 01:20:40,090
I'm getting an idea.

2553
01:20:40,091 --> 01:20:41,899
- A driver? - It's a driver.

2554
01:20:41,900 --> 01:20:43,200
It's the bus or subway.

2555
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:45,030
"I comfort others..."

2556
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:46,870
"with my own sentimental announcement."

2557
01:20:46,871 --> 01:20:49,200
"I also get comforted by the view of the Han River,"

2558
01:20:49,201 --> 01:20:51,041
"painted red with the sunset."

2559
01:20:51,201 --> 01:20:53,670
"I want to be charged with endorphin from Almighty Yoo..."

2560
01:20:53,671 --> 01:20:55,109
"and drive happily."

2561
01:20:55,110 --> 01:20:56,979
- Great. - It's a driver.

2562
01:20:56,980 --> 01:20:58,381
- It must be a driver. - Right.

2563
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:00,950
- Hello. - What?

2564
01:21:00,951 --> 01:21:03,680
That's it. It's in front of Exit Two across the road.

2565
01:21:04,121 --> 01:21:05,490
- Over there? - Exit Two?

2566
01:21:05,491 --> 01:21:06,820
- It must be him? - Is it him?

2567
01:21:06,821 --> 01:21:08,150
- It must be him! - What?

2568
01:21:08,451 --> 01:21:10,491
- I thought he was... - He's wearing something.

2569
01:21:10,621 --> 01:21:12,460
- fairly old. - What kind of driver is he?

2570
01:21:12,461 --> 01:21:14,490
Right! He must be the driver...

2571
01:21:14,491 --> 01:21:16,461
- of the subway. - He must be a subway driver.

2572
01:21:16,661 --> 01:21:18,400
- A subway driver! - He's right there.

2573
01:21:18,871 --> 01:21:20,307
- I think I've heard about them. - Gosh.

2574
01:21:20,331 --> 01:21:22,399
It's Lee Sang Heon.

2575
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:23,769
Are you Sang Heon?

2576
01:21:23,770 --> 01:21:24,799
Yes.

2577
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,009
- Hello. - Hello.

2578
01:21:26,010 --> 01:21:27,710
- It's great to see you. - Why are you outside?

2579
01:21:27,711 --> 01:21:29,139
I came to welcome all of you.

2580
01:21:29,140 --> 01:21:30,910
- Gosh, it's great to see you. - Gosh.

2581
01:21:30,911 --> 01:21:32,179
He's from Seoul Metro.

2582
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:33,411
Hello.

2583
01:21:34,150 --> 01:21:37,820
(Lee Sang Heon, the second Whenever Guest)

2584
01:21:37,821 --> 01:21:39,790
Do you make the announcements for the subway?

2585
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,750
I don't do that. I'm a driver.

2586
01:21:41,751 --> 01:21:42,960
- You're a driver! - You're a driver!

2587
01:21:42,961 --> 01:21:44,759
Yes. I'm a driver right now.

2588
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:46,530
- Is it your spare time right now? - Yes.

2589
01:21:46,531 --> 01:21:47,990
- It's lunchtime. - I see.

2590
01:21:47,991 --> 01:21:49,660
- Where should we go then? - Where should we go?

2591
01:21:49,661 --> 01:21:51,700
We have to enter the train depot.

2592
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:54,030
- The train depot? - You have to enter with me.

2593
01:21:54,031 --> 01:21:55,200
- Right. - So we'll move together.

2594
01:21:55,201 --> 01:21:57,000
- It's my first time seeing it! - The train depot.

2595
01:21:57,001 --> 01:21:59,210
We went to the Railroad High School before.

2596
01:21:59,211 --> 01:22:00,240
Right.

2597
01:22:00,241 --> 01:22:01,439
- The Railroad High School. - The Railroad High School.

2598
01:22:01,440 --> 01:22:02,780
- I see. - The one in Yongsan.

2599
01:22:02,781 --> 01:22:04,281
- Right. I know that school. - Right.

2600
01:22:04,440 --> 01:22:06,210
So you aren't from that kind of school?

2601
01:22:06,211 --> 01:22:09,479
I got my license and entered the company...

2602
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,580
- through a regular application. - I see.

2603
01:22:10,581 --> 01:22:12,689
There's a license for a subway driver?

2604
01:22:12,690 --> 01:22:14,490
Yes. You must have that license to enter the company.

2605
01:22:14,491 --> 01:22:15,689
- Right. - Right.

2606
01:22:15,690 --> 01:22:18,091
- So this is Sinjeong Train Depot. - Right.

2607
01:22:18,360 --> 01:22:21,359
This is Sinjeong Train Depot that is in charge of...

2608
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:23,630
- Line Two. - I see.

2609
01:22:23,631 --> 01:22:26,229
The trains rest here...

2610
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,371
- and depart from here. - This is where they depart.

2611
01:22:28,531 --> 01:22:29,740
Really? Here?

2612
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:31,299
You can think of this place as the starting point.

2613
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:34,210
Don't the trains of Line Two keeping going around?

2614
01:22:34,211 --> 01:22:36,639
They do go around, but there are two train depots.

2615
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:38,080
- Sinjeong and... - They come in and out.

2616
01:22:38,081 --> 01:22:39,081
They come in and out.

2617
01:22:39,082 --> 01:22:40,309
Where is the other train depot?

2618
01:22:40,310 --> 01:22:41,479
There's Gunja Train Depot.

2619
01:22:41,480 --> 01:22:43,580
- In Gunja-dong? - Right.

2620
01:22:43,581 --> 01:22:45,849
If you look from afar,

2621
01:22:45,850 --> 01:22:47,519
you can see the trains in each hole.

2622
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,920
- They're in there. - That's awesome.

2623
01:22:48,921 --> 01:22:50,090
- Are they in there? - Yes.

2624
01:22:50,091 --> 01:22:52,059
So all of the trains are in there.

2625
01:22:52,060 --> 01:22:54,490
Gosh, this looks like what babies would play with...

2626
01:22:54,491 --> 01:22:56,729
- Right, Thomas the train. - You know this, right? Thomas.

2627
01:22:56,730 --> 01:22:58,531
- Yes, Thomas the train. - There are so many.

2628
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:00,501
How many are there...

2629
01:23:00,631 --> 01:23:02,170
- waiting right now? - Right now, I think...

2630
01:23:02,171 --> 01:23:04,240
there are about 30 trains here.

2631
01:23:04,241 --> 01:23:06,139
- About 30? - Yes, and they'll all go out,

2632
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,280
and they're all in here during the non-rush hour.

2633
01:23:09,281 --> 01:23:10,639
Oh, they come back here.

2634
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:12,009
- There are 30 trains? - So...

2635
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,349
During rush hour, we have...

2636
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:16,219
about 90 trains on the tracks.

2637
01:23:16,220 --> 01:23:17,349
- Is that right? - From Gunja too...

2638
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:18,889
- Just Line 2? - Just Line 2.

2639
01:23:18,890 --> 01:23:20,389
(During rush hour, there are about 90 trains running on Line 2 alone.)

2640
01:23:20,390 --> 01:23:21,450
They're like this.

2641
01:23:21,451 --> 01:23:23,420
Let's move to our crew lounge...

2642
01:23:23,421 --> 01:23:25,730
in the train depot.

2643
01:23:26,131 --> 01:23:28,259
Gosh, not just anyone can come here.

2644
01:23:28,260 --> 01:23:30,300
- I know. - It's really fascinating.

2645
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,200
- Yes, this is for our crew. - Oh, the crew.

2646
01:23:33,201 --> 01:23:34,330
- Here it is. Yes. - Oh, are they resting?

2647
01:23:34,331 --> 01:23:36,041
- Hello. - Hello.

2648
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:38,240
- So, this is what it looks like. - Do we take off our shoes?

2649
01:23:38,241 --> 01:23:39,870
- It's the lounge and changing room. - What is this?

2650
01:23:39,871 --> 01:23:41,540
- Let's go to the back. - Okay.

2651
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:43,041
Gosh, this place is so...

2652
01:23:44,081 --> 01:23:45,649
It feels like a dorm.

2653
01:23:45,650 --> 01:23:47,609
- How does it work? - We have about 300 crew members...

2654
01:23:47,610 --> 01:23:49,220
- Right. - who use this space.

2655
01:23:49,451 --> 01:23:50,920
- My gosh. - Is this what it looks like?

2656
01:23:50,921 --> 01:23:51,921
My goodness.

2657
01:23:51,922 --> 01:23:53,719
We work the night shift and sleep here.

2658
01:23:53,720 --> 01:23:54,790
Oh, because you work...

2659
01:23:54,791 --> 01:23:56,559
- night and early morning shifts. - Yes.

2660
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:58,297
- Hey, there's a billiards table. - So, during rest hours...

2661
01:23:58,321 --> 01:23:59,660
- Yes, we... - It's a billiards hall.

2662
01:23:59,661 --> 01:24:00,937
Yes, this is what it looks like.

2663
01:24:00,961 --> 01:24:01,990
(There's a billiards hall at the end of the hall in the lounge.)

2664
01:24:01,991 --> 01:24:03,160
There's a billiards hall?

2665
01:24:03,161 --> 01:24:05,160
There are billiards tables and stuff.

2666
01:24:05,161 --> 01:24:07,299
- You can enjoy fun activities. - And you can read here too.

2667
01:24:07,300 --> 01:24:09,639
- Yes. - Right. There's a billiards table.

2668
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:10,841
My goodness.

2669
01:24:11,241 --> 01:24:12,840
(Staring)

2670
01:24:12,841 --> 01:24:15,439
- Jong Kook, he has a good build. - He does.

2671
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:16,740
- I know. - You must work out too.

2672
01:24:16,741 --> 01:24:17,840
You look like you work out.

2673
01:24:17,841 --> 01:24:20,509
Oh, during our breaks, most of us...

2674
01:24:20,510 --> 01:24:22,621
- work out at the gym. - I see.

2675
01:24:22,850 --> 01:24:24,120
I mean, he's slim,

2676
01:24:24,121 --> 01:24:25,991
but I can tell his muscles are...

2677
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:27,189
You're communing again.

2678
01:24:27,190 --> 01:24:28,620
- Whenever he can. - I know.

2679
01:24:28,621 --> 01:24:30,059
- Whenever possible... - Yes, you should work out...

2680
01:24:30,060 --> 01:24:32,229
- whenever possible. - Then is this your lunch break now?

2681
01:24:32,230 --> 01:24:33,889
Yes, it's lunchtime now.

2682
01:24:33,890 --> 01:24:36,899
When the crew members work,

2683
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:38,200
we have to be safe.

2684
01:24:38,201 --> 01:24:40,469
So no one bothers us during our breaks.

2685
01:24:40,470 --> 01:24:41,630
- We just rest... - Right.

2686
01:24:41,631 --> 01:24:43,240
You need guaranteed rest.

2687
01:24:43,241 --> 01:24:44,799
- The company guarantees... - Yes.

2688
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,340
- our break time. - That's right.

2689
01:24:46,341 --> 01:24:49,280
- Of course. - For the passengers' safety too.

2690
01:24:49,281 --> 01:24:51,939
Then, how many hours do you work when you go out for a shift?

2691
01:24:51,940 --> 01:24:55,479
We work two rounds in a shift.

2692
01:24:55,480 --> 01:24:58,380
The 1st round is usually between 3 to 4 hours.

2693
01:24:58,381 --> 01:25:00,320
- Three hours? - If there's a delay,

2694
01:25:00,321 --> 01:25:01,790
- it can be up to five hours. - Oh, my.

2695
01:25:01,791 --> 01:25:04,389
And the 2nd round is just 1 rotation for 1 hour and 38 minutes.

2696
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,290
- Oh, dear. That must be hard. - So, when you go out to work,

2697
01:25:06,291 --> 01:25:07,830
you work 3 to 4 hours in the 1st round.

2698
01:25:07,831 --> 01:25:09,460
- Yes, that's right. - You're onboard the whole time?

2699
01:25:09,461 --> 01:25:11,700
- Yes, we stay on the train. - Goodness, that must be hard.

2700
01:25:11,701 --> 01:25:14,000
Because during rush hour,

2701
01:25:14,001 --> 01:25:16,000
- there are lots of passengers. - Yes.

2702
01:25:16,001 --> 01:25:19,769
When you drive the train, are there two of you? Or are you alone?

2703
01:25:19,770 --> 01:25:21,211
There's one person at either end.

2704
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:23,731
- There's 1 driver and 1 conductor. - Oh, I see how it is.

2705
01:25:23,841 --> 01:25:26,480
And as he said earlier, the conductor manages the temperature...

2706
01:25:26,650 --> 01:25:28,427
- The air conditioning and heating. - and the announcements...

2707
01:25:28,451 --> 01:25:31,180
- So that's how you do it. - If you're alone for three hours,

2708
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,790
- Right. - it must be so difficult.

2709
01:25:32,791 --> 01:25:35,120
You can't listen to music as you drive, right?

2710
01:25:35,121 --> 01:25:37,559
- Our phones are blocked from use. - I'm sure they can't.

2711
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,530
- Really? Automatically? - Yes, automatically blocked.

2712
01:25:39,531 --> 01:25:40,559
- But how... - Automatically?

2713
01:25:40,560 --> 01:25:43,059
- So, during that time, - It sounds so tough.

2714
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,160
- we can't use electronics. - It must be so...

2715
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:46,229
If you worked in pairs,

2716
01:25:46,230 --> 01:25:47,790
- you could at least talk. - Oh, I see.

2717
01:25:47,900 --> 01:25:49,500
But in some ways, it could be like this.

2718
01:25:49,571 --> 01:25:51,440
You're by yourself for 3 to 4 hours.

2719
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:54,370
- So, no one bothers you. - For you and me, it's actually...

2720
01:25:54,470 --> 01:25:56,809
- No one bothers you. - I think we could do that.

2721
01:25:56,810 --> 01:25:58,510
- If no one bothers you... - Hang on.

2722
01:25:58,741 --> 01:26:02,550
The two married men seem to want to be alone.

2723
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,149
- No, that's not true! - I didn't...

2724
01:26:04,150 --> 01:26:06,389
- Do you want some time alone? - No, you're exaggerating.

2725
01:26:06,390 --> 01:26:08,450
Am I exaggerating? Is that how you feel?

2726
01:26:08,451 --> 01:26:10,320
- But... - Tae Hyun, that's not true!

2727
01:26:10,321 --> 01:26:11,321
What?

2728
01:26:11,621 --> 01:26:14,260
But I think I could do it if I had to.

2729
01:26:14,560 --> 01:26:17,330
- For a few hours... - It would be so hard for us.

2730
01:26:17,331 --> 01:26:20,200
Gosh, but if you're working 3 to 4 hours in each round,

2731
01:26:20,201 --> 01:26:21,899
- someone like you couldn't do it. - It's hard.

2732
01:26:21,900 --> 01:26:24,139
- Why not? - If you keep going to the restroom,

2733
01:26:24,140 --> 01:26:25,299
- it would be a problem. - Oh, the restroom.

2734
01:26:25,300 --> 01:26:27,217
- What do you do about the restroom? - Isn't that right?

2735
01:26:27,241 --> 01:26:28,740
- Well, there are... - I'm sure it's not a chamber pot.

2736
01:26:28,741 --> 01:26:30,080
Restrooms for us to use, but...

2737
01:26:30,081 --> 01:26:31,179
You have them on the train?

2738
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,950
Not in the trains, but in the stations.

2739
01:26:32,951 --> 01:26:35,149
- Oh, in the stations. - So you have to run back and forth.

2740
01:26:35,150 --> 01:26:36,620
- Yes, we'd have to run. - That won't work.

2741
01:26:36,621 --> 01:26:38,219
- But that won't work. - It would be hard.

2742
01:26:38,220 --> 01:26:40,149
- The other lines... - Yes?

2743
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:41,689
- have a turning point. - Right.

2744
01:26:41,690 --> 01:26:44,460
When they switch places, there's a 15-minute break.

2745
01:26:44,461 --> 01:26:46,130
- But since Line Two is a loop, - Because it's a loop.

2746
01:26:46,131 --> 01:26:48,130
- we keep going around. - You go around for three hours.

2747
01:26:48,131 --> 01:26:49,530
- Right. - Are there longer stops...

2748
01:26:49,531 --> 01:26:50,729
at certain stations?

2749
01:26:50,730 --> 01:26:52,799
We get 1 minute and 30 seconds at Seongsu Station.

2750
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,001
- Seongsu Station. - For us, that's the final stop.

2751
01:26:56,371 --> 01:26:58,740
But that's not enough time to go to the restroom.

2752
01:26:58,741 --> 01:27:01,309
The biggest difficulty for the crew members is the restroom.

2753
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:03,639
- Right. I thought it would be. - Line Two...

2754
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:06,049
Because the passengers...

2755
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,309
on that train can't have any accidents...

2756
01:27:08,310 --> 01:27:10,450
- My goodness. - You have to pay attention to that.

2757
01:27:10,451 --> 01:27:11,580
Gosh, for over three hours...

2758
01:27:11,581 --> 01:27:14,120
And think about it. They have to be underground the whole time.

2759
01:27:14,121 --> 01:27:15,149
- That's right. - I know.

2760
01:27:15,150 --> 01:27:17,059
It's not hard to work out for three hours.

2761
01:27:17,060 --> 01:27:18,060
Right.

2762
01:27:18,560 --> 01:27:20,059
- That's not hard, is it? - It's not.

2763
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,160
You can refresh yourself by going here and there, doing this and that.

2764
01:27:23,161 --> 01:27:25,969
But if you just have to stay on the treadmill for three hours...

2765
01:27:25,970 --> 01:27:27,700
- That would be hard. - Just sitting there...

2766
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:29,269
- It would feel like that. - That's right.

2767
01:27:29,270 --> 01:27:31,399
I'm sure you have a lot to pay attention to.

2768
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,939
Right. There are usually complaints...

2769
01:27:33,940 --> 01:27:36,310
from the passengers about being too hot or too cold.

2770
01:27:36,581 --> 01:27:38,309
Line Two has a lot of that in particular.

2771
01:27:38,310 --> 01:27:39,679
- Yes. - Line Two has...

2772
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:41,649
- so many passengers. - There are.

2773
01:27:41,650 --> 01:27:44,220
We have 2.5 million passengers in a day.

2774
01:27:44,350 --> 01:27:45,849
- Line Two is so busy. - My goodness.

2775
01:27:45,850 --> 01:27:47,091
Yes, Line Two is like that.

2776
01:27:47,321 --> 01:27:50,590
Actually, when we're with family at home,

2777
01:27:50,591 --> 01:27:53,259
- someone is always cold or hot. - Right.

2778
01:27:53,260 --> 01:27:55,729
When you turn on the heating in these times,

2779
01:27:55,730 --> 01:27:57,359
- some might say it's too hot. - Right.

2780
01:27:57,360 --> 01:27:58,729
- What do you do about that? - What do you do?

2781
01:27:58,730 --> 01:28:00,630
- Isn't there a set temperature? - Don't you change the settings...

2782
01:28:00,631 --> 01:28:02,099
based on the number of passengers?

2783
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:04,170
Many parts have become systematized now,

2784
01:28:04,171 --> 01:28:06,269
so we set the temperature...

2785
01:28:06,270 --> 01:28:08,840
between 21 and 24°C.

2786
01:28:08,841 --> 01:28:10,109
- All year round. - If it's in that range...

2787
01:28:10,110 --> 01:28:13,109
Gosh, it's much warmer and nicer than Jong Kook's living room.

2788
01:28:13,110 --> 01:28:15,210
- It's warmer than my living room. - It's much warmer than his house.

2789
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:16,921
I'm sure you still get complaints, though.

2790
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:19,290
- Everyone is wearing puffer coats. - That's right.

2791
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:20,920
If you're wearing clothes made for minus 10°C...

2792
01:28:20,921 --> 01:28:22,820
in 21 or 24°C, it would obviously be hot.

2793
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:23,921
That's right.

2794
01:28:24,020 --> 01:28:27,060
You know, I wear a puffer coat at home.

2795
01:28:27,560 --> 01:28:30,660
There's no reason your house or your living room should be warm.

2796
01:28:30,661 --> 01:28:32,969
But there are some people who might think...

2797
01:28:32,970 --> 01:28:35,640
- it's still cold. - Yes, there could be.

2798
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:39,370
It's odd, but I think I dozed off a lot on the loop line.

2799
01:28:39,371 --> 01:28:41,340
- Right. - I missed my stop a lot.

2800
01:28:41,341 --> 01:28:43,040
The loop is the best for sleeping.

2801
01:28:43,041 --> 01:28:44,410
I know. I think I sometimes slept,

2802
01:28:44,411 --> 01:28:45,979
- not even knowing when to wake up. - Right.

2803
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:48,550
When we check the security camera every now and then,

2804
01:28:48,980 --> 01:28:50,250
there are people who are constantly there.

2805
01:28:50,251 --> 01:28:52,820
- I think they had a few drinks... - They can't get off.

2806
01:28:52,821 --> 01:28:54,649
Several people get off at Hongik University Station with me...

2807
01:28:54,650 --> 01:28:56,961
- and go home. - Oh, really?

2808
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:59,260
Don't people usually vomit on the subway?

2809
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,429
They vomit, and...

2810
01:29:01,430 --> 01:29:04,259
It happens the most at the beginning of the year.

2811
01:29:04,260 --> 01:29:05,799
- The beginning of the year? - Yes.

2812
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:08,630
Young people who are drinking for the first time...

2813
01:29:08,631 --> 01:29:10,139
- tend to vomit quite often. - I see.

2814
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:11,899
- That could happen. - College students.

2815
01:29:11,900 --> 01:29:13,840
So, Hongik University Station is the hardest.

2816
01:29:13,841 --> 01:29:15,109
- That station... - I see.

2817
01:29:15,110 --> 01:29:17,040
Did you have an interest in...

2818
01:29:17,041 --> 01:29:19,910
or dream of working in this field since you were young?

2819
01:29:19,911 --> 01:29:22,580
My dream when I was young was...

2820
01:29:22,581 --> 01:29:23,849
to become a train driver.

2821
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:26,320
Gosh, you've achieved your dream.

2822
01:29:26,321 --> 01:29:29,189
I don't really remember it very well,

2823
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:31,859
but I was the first generation that grew up with digitization.

2824
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:34,490
So I can look up school newsletters online.

2825
01:29:34,491 --> 01:29:37,799
And when I looked, I said that I wanted to become...

2826
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,130
- a train driver every year. - A train driver.

2827
01:29:39,131 --> 01:29:41,030
- Ever since you were young. - Ever since you were young.

2828
01:29:41,031 --> 01:29:42,330
I saw that last year.

2829
01:29:42,331 --> 01:29:44,399
- Oh, really? - I didn't know that I wrote that...

2830
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:45,840
- for my dream. - The first digitized generation.

2831
01:29:45,841 --> 01:29:47,840
- They didn't have records on paper. - Right.

2832
01:29:47,841 --> 01:29:49,580
Can you look it up online?

2833
01:29:49,581 --> 01:29:50,609
I guess so.

2834
01:29:50,610 --> 01:29:52,210
I think you can if you were born on or after 1991.

2835
01:29:52,211 --> 01:29:53,250
(Born in 1972, Born in 1976)

2836
01:29:53,251 --> 01:29:55,149
- We can't look it up. - Our records aren't online.

2837
01:29:55,150 --> 01:29:56,781
You have to go to your school.

2838
01:29:56,980 --> 01:29:58,019
We have to go to our schools...

2839
01:29:58,020 --> 01:30:00,320
- and find it there. - No, if our parents kept them...

2840
01:30:00,321 --> 01:30:02,602
Why would they have kept records that weren't great news?

2841
01:30:03,821 --> 01:30:06,860
How did you end up writing to Whenever Possible?

2842
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:10,160
This is my ninth year working at the company.

2843
01:30:10,161 --> 01:30:11,759
- Nine years? - Yes, it's been nine years,

2844
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:14,899
but always living the same life and going on the same loop...

2845
01:30:14,900 --> 01:30:17,170
- It must've been so repetitive. - As I watched the first episode,

2846
01:30:17,171 --> 01:30:20,609
I thought it would give my life a boost of endorphin if you came.

2847
01:30:20,610 --> 01:30:21,610
That's right.

2848
01:30:21,611 --> 01:30:24,479
Can't you switch to a different subway line?

2849
01:30:24,480 --> 01:30:26,309
- Is that a different company? - Once we're assigned to a line,

2850
01:30:26,310 --> 01:30:28,609
we stay there until we retire.

2851
01:30:28,610 --> 01:30:29,750
- Oh, really? - Yes.

2852
01:30:29,751 --> 01:30:32,849
- So, you'll only drive on Line Two. - All my life.

2853
01:30:32,850 --> 01:30:33,889
- Yes. - Oh, my.

2854
01:30:33,890 --> 01:30:35,219
You can't switch?

2855
01:30:35,220 --> 01:30:37,719
- You can, but it's hard to do. - It must be hard.

2856
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,160
The only way you can switch is with a good reason.

2857
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:41,359
Really?

2858
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:44,799
But if you end up retiring here,

2859
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,670
- then Line Two would be... - Right.

2860
01:30:46,671 --> 01:30:49,399
Could you do something more here...

2861
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,399
and switch to another position,

2862
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,210
driving KTX trains or something?

2863
01:30:53,211 --> 01:30:56,139
Well, we are... KTX is owned by Korail.

2864
01:30:56,140 --> 01:30:57,809
- We are Seoul Metro. - It's a different company.

2865
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,109
- It's a separate company. - Yes.

2866
01:30:59,110 --> 01:31:01,880
- You'd have to apply there. - Yes, I would.

2867
01:31:01,881 --> 01:31:03,479
- This is Seoul Metro. - Yes.

2868
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,149
I think it might be nice...

2869
01:31:05,150 --> 01:31:06,889
to drive out in the open after driving underground.

2870
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:08,719
- That's true. - Line Two has...

2871
01:31:08,720 --> 01:31:10,219
quite a lot of sections above ground.

2872
01:31:10,220 --> 01:31:11,320
- That's true. - The train...

2873
01:31:11,321 --> 01:31:13,229
- Since they're different companies, - It does go up and down.

2874
01:31:13,230 --> 01:31:14,690
He drew a clear line.

2875
01:31:14,991 --> 01:31:16,899
- "That's Korail." - We all work on TV,

2876
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:18,630
but each broadcasting station works differently.

2877
01:31:18,631 --> 01:31:19,670
- Okay. - I see.

2878
01:31:19,671 --> 01:31:20,929
Yes, it's different.

2879
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:22,799
I think that topic is off-limits.

2880
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:23,800
I understand.

2881
01:31:24,140 --> 01:31:26,070
So, when you wrote to the show,

2882
01:31:26,071 --> 01:31:28,970
you said you hoped Almighty Yoo would boost your endorphin.

2883
01:31:29,071 --> 01:31:30,480
Oh, actually,

2884
01:31:31,810 --> 01:31:33,649
my father...

2885
01:31:33,650 --> 01:31:36,219
had leukemia when I was in high school.

2886
01:31:36,220 --> 01:31:37,649
- I see. - So,

2887
01:31:37,650 --> 01:31:39,490
there were treatments he could get at the hospital,

2888
01:31:39,491 --> 01:31:42,389
but other than that, the best thing for him was to laugh.

2889
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:44,590
They said he should watch lots of funny shows.

2890
01:31:44,591 --> 01:31:46,660
- "Infinite Challenge?" - He kept "Infinite Challenge" on...

2891
01:31:46,661 --> 01:31:49,399
and enjoyed watching it so much.

2892
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,099
He had his doctors,

2893
01:31:51,100 --> 01:31:53,269
- but he also had Almighty Yoo... - That's right.

2894
01:31:53,270 --> 01:31:55,070
- by his side. - That's right. How nice is that?

2895
01:31:55,071 --> 01:31:57,269
So, when I told my dad that I was meeting you,

2896
01:31:57,270 --> 01:31:59,269
he said, "We must have a connection with him."

2897
01:31:59,270 --> 01:32:01,439
- He was so happy. - And did your father recover?

2898
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:02,440
- Yes. - I'm guessing he did.

2899
01:32:02,441 --> 01:32:05,340
Goodness, that's such a relief to hear.

2900
01:32:05,341 --> 01:32:06,580
Laughter plays such a big role.

2901
01:32:06,581 --> 01:32:07,849
- Of course. - Yes.

2902
01:32:07,850 --> 01:32:10,049
- Actually, the work that we do... - We should feel good about our job.

2903
01:32:10,050 --> 01:32:12,320
- is a valuable thing. - Yes, of course.

2904
01:32:12,321 --> 01:32:16,189
I've come to learn how great it is that there are jobs...

2905
01:32:16,190 --> 01:32:18,020
- that make people laugh. - Gosh, thank you.

2906
01:32:18,421 --> 01:32:21,259
You said that you made sentimental announcements.

2907
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,899
What kind of praise did you get from a passenger?

2908
01:32:22,900 --> 01:32:24,759
So, if our passengers send in texts...

2909
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:26,799
with words of praise,

2910
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,970
I get them in a letter.

2911
01:32:28,171 --> 01:32:29,439
- Oh, really? - Really?

2912
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:31,841
I made some sentimental announcements...

2913
01:32:32,270 --> 01:32:34,439
and received some letters of praise.

2914
01:32:34,440 --> 01:32:37,210
Could you tell us an announcement if you remember any?

2915
01:32:37,211 --> 01:32:38,741
Right now?

2916
01:32:39,251 --> 01:32:41,050
- Something you remember. - I'll try.

2917
01:32:41,480 --> 01:32:42,480
Well...

2918
01:32:42,481 --> 01:32:43,679
Hello, passengers.

2919
01:32:43,680 --> 01:32:46,421
I'm Lee Sang Heon, the crew member on Train 2222.

2920
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:49,019
How has your day been today?

2921
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:51,719
I'm sure it was a happy day for some, a normal day for others,

2922
01:32:51,720 --> 01:32:54,530
and maybe even a bad day for some of you.

2923
01:32:54,531 --> 01:32:57,259
I will carry the emotions you felt today...

2924
01:32:57,260 --> 01:32:59,599
and drive you to your destination safely.

2925
01:32:59,600 --> 01:33:01,899
I hope you have a comfortable ride on this train.

2926
01:33:01,900 --> 01:33:03,140
Good job today.

2927
01:33:03,770 --> 01:33:06,610
For people having a hard day, this would make them cry.

2928
01:33:07,010 --> 01:33:09,241
- This would just make you cry. - Gosh, that's so true.

2929
01:33:09,440 --> 01:33:10,939
That's so sentimental.

2930
01:33:10,940 --> 01:33:12,410
- It would make people cry. - Even your voice is...

2931
01:33:12,411 --> 01:33:14,210
You have the voice of someone who works on the radio.

2932
01:33:14,211 --> 01:33:15,950
- You have a great voice. - Yes.

2933
01:33:15,951 --> 01:33:17,920
That was worthy of getting...

2934
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:19,120
- letters of praise - I know.

2935
01:33:19,121 --> 01:33:22,219
Yes, I think that was it. People said they were moved by this.

2936
01:33:22,220 --> 01:33:23,290
I think I saw this on social media.

2937
01:33:23,291 --> 01:33:25,320
And his comment was so nice and simple.

2938
01:33:25,321 --> 01:33:27,921
They say that some things in life could be blessings in disguise.

2939
01:33:28,230 --> 01:33:29,859
If you say that, do you know what people would say?

2940
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,031
While riding the train... "What is he talking about?"

2941
01:33:32,461 --> 01:33:33,870
(He'd get letters of complaints, not praise.)

2942
01:33:33,871 --> 01:33:35,071
- "How annoying." - I mean...

2943
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:38,099
If you try to say something too grand,

2944
01:33:38,100 --> 01:33:39,170
- it can be annoying. - Yes.

2945
01:33:39,171 --> 01:33:41,647
They say that some things in life could be blessings in disguise.

2946
01:33:41,671 --> 01:33:43,880
(His comment ends after talking about blessings in disguise.)

2947
01:33:43,881 --> 01:33:46,149
Then, today, we should really...

2948
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:47,880
Let's try a mission here.

2949
01:33:47,881 --> 01:33:49,649
- We succeeded in Round Two earlier. - Yes.

2950
01:33:49,650 --> 01:33:51,580
- We got up to Round Two. - We gave out presents.

2951
01:33:51,581 --> 01:33:53,689
Let's try to do a good job for the last time this season.

2952
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:55,790
- Finish on a good note. - Yes, we should.

2953
01:33:55,791 --> 01:33:57,389
(They start the mission after moving to a different spot.)

2954
01:33:57,390 --> 01:33:58,859
- Hello. - Hello.

2955
01:33:58,860 --> 01:34:00,666
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you so much.

2956
01:34:00,690 --> 01:34:02,060
Drive safely!

2957
01:34:02,131 --> 01:34:03,599
- You can do it! - Thank you!

2958
01:34:03,600 --> 01:34:04,600
You can do it!

2959
01:34:04,601 --> 01:34:06,100
- Happy New Year! - Bye.

2960
01:34:06,201 --> 01:34:07,229
Amen!

2961
01:34:07,230 --> 01:34:08,269
Thank you.

2962
01:34:08,270 --> 01:34:09,270
Amen!

2963
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,439
- He said, "Amen." - Yes, "Amen."

2964
01:34:12,440 --> 01:34:14,469
- Gosh, "Amen" was... - "Amen."

2965
01:34:14,470 --> 01:34:15,870
- Gosh, that was... - That was funny.

2966
01:34:15,871 --> 01:34:18,640
- They all say hi. - I felt like I was a cult leader.

2967
01:34:19,211 --> 01:34:21,251
Oh, a table tennis room? I'm good at table tennis.

2968
01:34:21,381 --> 01:34:23,380
- What? Is it table tennis? - There's a table tennis room?

2969
01:34:23,381 --> 01:34:25,156
- It's a table tennis room. - They have a table tennis room.

2970
01:34:25,180 --> 01:34:27,500
- Table tennis is so much fun. - I'm good at table tennis.

2971
01:34:27,791 --> 01:34:28,950
Gosh, table tennis.

2972
01:34:28,951 --> 01:34:31,019
- Gosh, table tennis is hard. - Is it not regular table tennis?

2973
01:34:31,020 --> 01:34:33,020
- Of course not. - It won't be plain table tennis.

2974
01:34:33,091 --> 01:34:34,630
- Are you all drivers? - Gosh, we have...

2975
01:34:34,631 --> 01:34:36,961
- Oh, my. The crew. Hello. - Hello.

2976
01:34:37,131 --> 01:34:38,599
- They're conductors. - Conductors.

2977
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,030
(The conductors came as a cheer squad.)

2978
01:34:40,031 --> 01:34:42,131
- Then, Round One. - Yes.

2979
01:34:42,230 --> 01:34:44,269
- It's a fortune cookie. - If you crack the fortune cookie...

2980
01:34:44,270 --> 01:34:46,470
for Round One, the prize will be written inside.

2981
01:34:46,671 --> 01:34:48,041
What kind of prize will it be?

2982
01:34:48,571 --> 01:34:49,581
Please read it out loud.

2983
01:34:50,881 --> 01:34:54,349
Oh, "Running is great for your biorhythm. I want to keep doing it."

2984
01:34:54,350 --> 01:34:55,780
"The must-have item for runners."

2985
01:34:55,781 --> 01:34:58,550
- "A pair of Nike running shoes." - Nike running shoes.

2986
01:34:58,781 --> 01:35:00,389
Running shoes.

2987
01:35:00,390 --> 01:35:03,620
Gosh, running is all the rage these days.

2988
01:35:03,621 --> 01:35:06,259
Are you perhaps part of a running club or something?

2989
01:35:06,260 --> 01:35:09,660
I'm not in a club, but I run with my friends and In Su here.

2990
01:35:09,661 --> 01:35:12,059
- Really? - Oh, you're a runner.

2991
01:35:12,060 --> 01:35:13,870
- Are you guys the same age? - Yes.

2992
01:35:13,871 --> 01:35:15,770
- Indeed. - Oh, really?

2993
01:35:15,800 --> 01:35:18,170
(Bottle Ping Pong)

2994
01:35:18,171 --> 01:35:20,210
(Serve a ball...)

2995
01:35:20,211 --> 01:35:22,740
(and knock off the target ball.)

2996
01:35:22,741 --> 01:35:23,880
(Round 1)

2997
01:35:23,881 --> 01:35:27,710
(Knock off 1 table tennis ball.)

2998
01:35:27,711 --> 01:35:29,479
Knock off a table tennis ball?

2999
01:35:29,480 --> 01:35:30,979
If they put it on something,

3000
01:35:30,980 --> 01:35:33,019
we must have to hit it and knock it off.

3001
01:35:33,020 --> 01:35:34,389
- Right? - This sounds hard.

3002
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:36,260
Oh, and there's a time limit too?

3003
01:35:36,791 --> 01:35:38,560
Oh, you have to knock that off?

3004
01:35:39,190 --> 01:35:40,460
It's way too hard.

3005
01:35:40,461 --> 01:35:42,059
(They succeed if they just hit 1 out of 3.)

3006
01:35:42,060 --> 01:35:43,500
You have ten balls total.

3007
01:35:43,501 --> 01:35:45,930
You just have to knock off 1 in 30 seconds.

3008
01:35:46,071 --> 01:35:48,430
- Oh, okay. - Do we split them however we want?

3009
01:35:48,701 --> 01:35:50,170
Do you have a double-sided paddle?

3010
01:35:50,171 --> 01:35:51,340
- We do. - I'll take that.

3011
01:35:51,341 --> 01:35:52,440
I want a double-sided one.

3012
01:35:52,911 --> 01:35:54,910
We're the generation of the 1988 Summer Games, you know?

3013
01:35:54,911 --> 01:35:57,780
Do you want to play a game of 2-on-2 to warm up?

3014
01:35:57,781 --> 01:35:59,040
- Warm up? - Table tennis?

3015
01:35:59,041 --> 01:36:00,710
Yeon Seok must be good at table tennis.

3016
01:36:00,711 --> 01:36:01,850
I'm pretty good.

3017
01:36:02,550 --> 01:36:05,250
- What use is warming up right now? - Try it.

3018
01:36:05,251 --> 01:36:06,650
What do we...

3019
01:36:07,350 --> 01:36:09,120
We could split the balls like 2, 3, 3, 2.

3020
01:36:09,121 --> 01:36:10,590
- Right. - Okay.

3021
01:36:10,591 --> 01:36:12,790
- Gosh, that was too... - Rather than diagonally,

3022
01:36:12,791 --> 01:36:14,031
it's better to serve straight.

3023
01:36:14,831 --> 01:36:16,559
- Darn it. - Gosh, but this is hard.

3024
01:36:16,560 --> 01:36:18,429
- It doesn't work. - Hey, this is just...

3025
01:36:18,430 --> 01:36:19,530
I think a diagonal serve is better.

3026
01:36:19,531 --> 01:36:21,729
Out of all of the missions we've had so far,

3027
01:36:21,730 --> 01:36:23,570
- I think this is the hardest. - This is hard.

3028
01:36:25,501 --> 01:36:26,509
Hey, Yeon Seok.

3029
01:36:26,510 --> 01:36:28,170
- We should split the ten balls. - Yeon Seok...

3030
01:36:28,171 --> 01:36:29,171
(It's hard.)

3031
01:36:29,172 --> 01:36:31,332
- Gosh, this is hard. - We should split the ten balls.

3032
01:36:31,741 --> 01:36:33,680
- My goodness. - Oh, this is too...

3033
01:36:34,451 --> 01:36:36,150
I can't get the hang of this.

3034
01:36:38,350 --> 01:36:39,421
My goodness!

3035
01:36:41,491 --> 01:36:42,550
Darn it.

3036
01:36:44,961 --> 01:36:46,259
But if Round One is this hard,

3037
01:36:46,260 --> 01:36:48,531
- how will we do Round Two? - Gosh, this is hard.

3038
01:36:49,060 --> 01:36:50,500
Hey, this is difficult.

3039
01:36:50,501 --> 01:36:52,730
(They can't hit the target.)

3040
01:36:52,930 --> 01:36:55,100
I don't think I'll even get the prize for Round One.

3041
01:36:55,871 --> 01:36:58,170
We can't do this, even if we each get ten balls.

3042
01:36:58,171 --> 01:37:00,140
I don't think we can do this.

3043
01:37:00,510 --> 01:37:02,711
- How do we do this? - Gosh, this is so hard.

3044
01:37:02,841 --> 01:37:04,139
This seems way too hard.

3045
01:37:04,140 --> 01:37:05,241
It makes no sense.

3046
01:37:07,180 --> 01:37:08,281
Not too hard.

3047
01:37:08,581 --> 01:37:09,820
- And stay low. - Yes, that's important.

3048
01:37:09,821 --> 01:37:10,850
Without a rebound...

3049
01:37:13,291 --> 01:37:14,651
Gosh, we haven't even hit it once?

3050
01:37:14,850 --> 01:37:16,719
- Oh, I got it. - Nice. Okay.

3051
01:37:16,720 --> 01:37:17,840
We haven't even hit it once?

3052
01:37:18,121 --> 01:37:20,091
- Oh, I got it. - Nice. Okay.

3053
01:37:20,230 --> 01:37:21,560
I found the direction.

3054
01:37:24,360 --> 01:37:26,099
- Did I just hit it too? - This is... Hey.

3055
01:37:26,100 --> 01:37:27,630
If the ball rebounds once about here,

3056
01:37:27,631 --> 01:37:29,200
- it's about the right distance. - Is that right?

3057
01:37:29,201 --> 01:37:31,099
One rebound.

3058
01:37:31,100 --> 01:37:33,911
(A rebound about here)

3059
01:37:34,211 --> 01:37:36,281
(They practice according to Jong Kook's tip.)

3060
01:37:36,940 --> 01:37:39,140
See? Right there. That's it.

3061
01:37:41,050 --> 01:37:42,081
One rebound.

3062
01:37:45,751 --> 01:37:47,390
(Yeon Seok practices without a rebound.)

3063
01:37:47,821 --> 01:37:48,921
That's harder.

3064
01:37:51,591 --> 01:37:54,161
(Bullseye!)

3065
01:37:54,461 --> 01:37:55,991
Oh, I can do this too, right?

3066
01:37:56,331 --> 01:37:57,399
No rebound.

3067
01:37:57,400 --> 01:37:58,899
No rebound? Can you do it?

3068
01:37:58,900 --> 01:38:01,299
(Yeon Seok goes with the no rebound strategy.)

3069
01:38:01,300 --> 01:38:02,331
No.

3070
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:03,671
Find the distance.

3071
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:05,571
Okay, I'm zeroing in on the target.

3072
01:38:05,970 --> 01:38:07,469
- I found the right distance. - Okay, now...

3073
01:38:07,470 --> 01:38:08,610
I found the right distance.

3074
01:38:08,711 --> 01:38:10,240
We should start trying the mission.

3075
01:38:10,241 --> 01:38:11,281
I got it. Okay.

3076
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,010
I got it. Let's try this.

3077
01:38:13,650 --> 01:38:15,380
Then, how many should we each do?

3078
01:38:15,381 --> 01:38:16,897
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

3079
01:38:16,921 --> 01:38:18,450
- Then we'll do 3 each. - Okay, 2.

3080
01:38:18,451 --> 01:38:20,121
Okay. No, you do three.

3081
01:38:20,190 --> 01:38:21,349
You hit the target.

3082
01:38:21,350 --> 01:38:23,059
- Why are you backing out? - No, I'll do two.

3083
01:38:23,060 --> 01:38:24,360
- Then I'll do three. - Good.

3084
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:25,560
Are we doing three?
Will this actually work?

3085
01:38:26,561 --> 01:38:28,859
You will try with 3, 3, 2, and 2 balls. You just need 1 out of 10.

3086
01:38:28,860 --> 01:38:30,200
- Let's get rid of the time limit. - Ten balls...

3087
01:38:30,201 --> 01:38:31,706
- We don't need a time limit. - within 30 seconds.

3088
01:38:31,730 --> 01:38:33,170
We could get rid of the time limit, couldn't we?

3089
01:38:33,171 --> 01:38:34,171
I know.

3090
01:38:34,172 --> 01:38:35,530
- The time limit is unnecessary. - Why do we...

3091
01:38:35,531 --> 01:38:37,070
- Don't you think so? - But then...

3092
01:38:37,071 --> 01:38:38,769
Gosh, you won't let any mission start easily.

3093
01:38:38,770 --> 01:38:40,211
Gosh, seriously.

3094
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:41,939
Let's just try it once!

3095
01:38:41,940 --> 01:38:43,139
- Whether it's in 30 seconds or not. - Let's try...

3096
01:38:43,140 --> 01:38:44,140
- Let's try it. - Round One.

3097
01:38:44,141 --> 01:38:45,240
- Okay. - Let's go!

3098
01:38:45,241 --> 01:38:47,149
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3099
01:38:47,150 --> 01:38:49,509
- All right. - What order are we going in?

3100
01:38:49,510 --> 01:38:51,080
- Should we go like this? - Yes, let's do this.

3101
01:38:51,081 --> 01:38:52,120
Okay, let's try this.

3102
01:38:52,121 --> 01:38:54,120
- Ready. Yes. - We just need to knock one off?

3103
01:38:54,121 --> 01:38:55,590
- Just one. You can do it, Tae Hyun. - Okay!

3104
01:38:55,591 --> 01:38:58,020
All right. I'll finish it in one try.

3105
01:38:58,121 --> 01:38:59,461
- We have 30 seconds. - Ready.

3106
01:39:03,288 --> 01:39:05,158
Hey, you should've held it in your hand.

3107
01:39:05,389 --> 01:39:06,457
Why did you keep that in your pocket?

3108
01:39:06,458 --> 01:39:07,488
All right.

3109
01:39:07,858 --> 01:39:08,929
We have no time.

3110
01:39:11,629 --> 01:39:12,669
We did it!

3111
01:39:15,662 --> 01:39:18,132
(He knocked it off!)

3112
01:39:20,908 --> 01:39:24,439
(They succeeded in a flash!)

3113
01:39:25,379 --> 01:39:27,009
- We did it! - Okay!

3114
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:30,879
- We did it! - Okay!

3115
01:39:31,979 --> 01:39:34,487
(Cheering)

3116
01:39:34,488 --> 01:39:35,857
- Yes! - Success!

3117
01:39:35,858 --> 01:39:37,219
Yes, we did it!

3118
01:39:37,759 --> 01:39:39,258
- Round One! - Yes!

3119
01:39:39,259 --> 01:39:40,758
You were so surprised, weren't you?

3120
01:39:40,759 --> 01:39:41,889
- My gosh. - Goodness.

3121
01:39:52,038 --> 01:39:53,969
- Hey. - Ahn Yeon Seok, it's been a while.

3122
01:39:54,139 --> 01:39:56,037
- Gosh, that was awesome. - Yoo One Shot.

3123
01:39:56,038 --> 01:39:57,277
- Like this. - Yoo One Shot.

3124
01:39:57,278 --> 01:39:58,747
- Hey, Ahn Yeon Seok. - Let's use this method.

3125
01:39:58,748 --> 01:40:00,277
- That was... - You haven't succeeded in a while.

3126
01:40:00,278 --> 01:40:01,378
Hey, that was great.

3127
01:40:01,379 --> 01:40:02,379
- It was... - The taste of success.

3128
01:40:02,380 --> 01:40:03,918
Let's go to Round Three!

3129
01:40:03,919 --> 01:40:05,077
- Nice. - Good.

3130
01:40:05,078 --> 01:40:06,424
- Let's go to Round Three! - Nice.

3131
01:40:06,448 --> 01:40:08,218
We succeeded in Round One for now. So,

3132
01:40:08,219 --> 01:40:09,418
you win the running shoes.

3133
01:40:09,419 --> 01:40:10,689
- Yes! - Okay!

3134
01:40:11,618 --> 01:40:13,628
- My gosh. - Hey, this is...

3135
01:40:13,629 --> 01:40:15,128
- Yeon Seok... - We should go for Round Two.

3136
01:40:15,129 --> 01:40:17,628
- Hey, Yeon Seok's method is great. - You should go for Round Two.

3137
01:40:17,629 --> 01:40:18,897
- You got it right away. - But...

3138
01:40:18,898 --> 01:40:21,027
- But the game will get harder. - That was amazing.

3139
01:40:21,028 --> 01:40:22,268
But we should go for Round Two, to be honest.

3140
01:40:22,269 --> 01:40:23,838
- There's no doubt about it. - Of course, we should go.

3141
01:40:23,839 --> 01:40:25,168
Will you go or stop?

3142
01:40:25,169 --> 01:40:26,867
- My gosh. - We should go for Round Two.

3143
01:40:26,868 --> 01:40:28,777
- Okay. - Sang Heon, In 1, 2, 3.

3144
01:40:28,778 --> 01:40:30,309
- I will go for it. - Right.

3145
01:40:30,608 --> 01:40:32,678
We have ten chances left right now.

3146
01:40:32,679 --> 01:40:33,759
- That was awesome. - Nine.

3147
01:40:34,679 --> 01:40:35,818
No, this will be...

3148
01:40:36,549 --> 01:40:38,577
"Sleeping well in a nice environment is important."

3149
01:40:38,578 --> 01:40:39,718
"Samsung..." Oh, gosh.

3150
01:40:39,719 --> 01:40:40,719
It's okay.

3151
01:40:41,288 --> 01:40:42,288
It's okay.

3152
01:40:42,858 --> 01:40:43,957
"Air purifier."

3153
01:40:43,958 --> 01:40:45,588
- Yes! - An air purifier. My gosh.

3154
01:40:45,589 --> 01:40:47,089
They bring it out right away.

3155
01:40:47,889 --> 01:40:49,027
Gosh, this is a nice one.

3156
01:40:49,028 --> 01:40:51,258
- Oh, my. That looks nice. - It's nice.

3157
01:40:51,259 --> 01:40:53,468
(Sleeping well in a nice environment is important.)

3158
01:40:53,469 --> 01:40:54,567
(Samsung air purifier)

3159
01:40:54,568 --> 01:40:56,037
- What will it be now? - But this is...

3160
01:40:56,038 --> 01:40:58,037
- I'm nervous about this. - Yes?

3161
01:40:58,038 --> 01:40:59,468
Just because we succeeded in Round One...

3162
01:40:59,469 --> 01:41:01,107
Right, Round Two might be...

3163
01:41:01,108 --> 01:41:03,978
We haven't had many good results in cases like this.

3164
01:41:03,979 --> 01:41:05,509
No, things will be good today.

3165
01:41:05,608 --> 01:41:09,318
(Round 2: Knock off 2 table tennis balls.)

3166
01:41:10,479 --> 01:41:12,464
- In 30 seconds, - The time limit's still 30 seconds?

3167
01:41:12,488 --> 01:41:14,617
- We can do this. We did it before. - Let's give Yeon Seok five balls.

3168
01:41:14,618 --> 01:41:15,918
Yes, Yeon Seok could do it.

3169
01:41:15,919 --> 01:41:17,219
- Anyway, - Okay.

3170
01:41:17,389 --> 01:41:19,759
- let's do 3 and 2 like earlier. - Okay.

3171
01:41:19,889 --> 01:41:21,588
How many do I get? Two? How many?

3172
01:41:21,589 --> 01:41:22,657
- Hey, take 1 more. - I had 2 earlier.

3173
01:41:22,658 --> 01:41:24,205
- Yeon Seok, take 1 more! - I just need 2.

3174
01:41:24,229 --> 01:41:25,989
- Yeon Seok, take 1 more. - Gosh, thank you.

3175
01:41:26,068 --> 01:41:27,827
(He's being treated like the ace for the first time.)

3176
01:41:27,828 --> 01:41:29,798
- Gosh, thank you. - Hey, this is a pretty good method.

3177
01:41:29,799 --> 01:41:31,368
Hey, that's great.

3178
01:41:33,738 --> 01:41:35,038
This is better.

3179
01:41:35,879 --> 01:41:39,107
And Yeon Seok is tall and lanky.

3180
01:41:39,108 --> 01:41:40,978
- So he can stretch out more. - Right.

3181
01:41:40,979 --> 01:41:42,678
- He has a farther reach than us. - They said it was fine.

3182
01:41:42,679 --> 01:41:44,519
He can lean in much farther.

3183
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:47,147
If you just aim well like this...

3184
01:41:47,148 --> 01:41:49,088
- Right. You're doing well. - Good.

3185
01:41:49,089 --> 01:41:50,219
- That's good. - Oh, nice.

3186
01:41:51,458 --> 01:41:53,165
- Hey, we can definitely get one. - Wasn't that a success?

3187
01:41:53,189 --> 01:41:54,259
That's good.

3188
01:41:56,599 --> 01:41:58,919
- Hey, we can definitely get one. - Wasn't that a success?

3189
01:42:00,269 --> 01:42:01,367
Wasn't that a success?

3190
01:42:01,368 --> 01:42:02,537
Hey, was that not an official try?

3191
01:42:02,538 --> 01:42:03,769
- Hey. - Let's try it.

3192
01:42:04,439 --> 01:42:07,768
(No way!)

3193
01:42:07,769 --> 01:42:09,439
Hey. We can definitely get one.

3194
01:42:09,608 --> 01:42:11,107
Why didn't you say this was an official try?

3195
01:42:11,108 --> 01:42:13,348
- But another person has to succeed. - Hey.

3196
01:42:13,349 --> 01:42:15,178
- At this rate... - No.

3197
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:17,378
- Does it have to be one each? No. - But...

3198
01:42:17,379 --> 01:42:19,049
No, he can knock off both.

3199
01:42:19,389 --> 01:42:21,294
Oh, your face looks like you're in a difficult spot.

3200
01:42:21,318 --> 01:42:22,817
Yeon Seok could do it.

3201
01:42:22,818 --> 01:42:23,957
(His lips keep curling upward.)

3202
01:42:23,958 --> 01:42:25,388
- We have lots of chances. - All right. Round Two.

3203
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:27,027
- Let's try it. Two balls. - Hey.

3204
01:42:27,028 --> 01:42:28,527
- Let's try it. - Let's make a miracle of...

3205
01:42:28,528 --> 01:42:29,697
- finishing Round 3 in 3 tries. - Let's do all 3.

3206
01:42:29,698 --> 01:42:31,098
- Let's do this. - Let's say a cheer.

3207
01:42:31,099 --> 01:42:32,327
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3208
01:42:32,328 --> 01:42:33,799
- Let's go. - In 1, 2, 3.

3209
01:42:33,969 --> 01:42:35,367
Hey, let's do this at once.

3210
01:42:35,368 --> 01:42:37,367
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

3211
01:42:37,368 --> 01:42:39,067
- Let's do this. - I'll go last.

3212
01:42:39,068 --> 01:42:40,908
- Okay. - Since I tasted success once...

3213
01:42:40,939 --> 01:42:42,138
- You take three. - How many do you have, Yeon Seok?

3214
01:42:42,139 --> 01:42:43,237
- I have 2. - I have 3.

3215
01:42:43,238 --> 01:42:44,238
- Let's give more to Yeon Seok. - You should take four.

3216
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:46,107
- You should do 4. - What, 4?

3217
01:42:46,108 --> 01:42:47,378
- I'll just do three. - No, you should do it.

3218
01:42:47,379 --> 01:42:48,699
(They give the ace more chances.)

3219
01:42:49,349 --> 01:42:50,418
- It's 2, 2, 2, and 4. - Okay, 2, 2, 2, 4.

3220
01:42:50,419 --> 01:42:52,078
- Let's go. - Ready.

3221
01:42:55,618 --> 01:42:57,158
- My gosh. - What a shame.

3222
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:59,059
- Okay. - We still have time.

3223
01:42:59,559 --> 01:43:00,688
- What a shame. - Okay.

3224
01:43:00,689 --> 01:43:01,729
- All right. - Okay.

3225
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:07,868
- I told you I got the distance! - Nice!

3226
01:43:08,939 --> 01:43:11,498
(Bullseye!)

3227
01:43:14,238 --> 01:43:17,038
(Jong Kook knocks off 1 table tennis ball!)

3228
01:43:17,509 --> 01:43:20,448
(They succeed if they just knock off one more.)

3229
01:43:21,408 --> 01:43:24,979
- I told you I got the distance! - Nice!

3230
01:43:26,948 --> 01:43:28,548
Just one more.

3231
01:43:28,549 --> 01:43:29,787
- We're so close. - Just one more.

3232
01:43:29,788 --> 01:43:31,458
(Now, only Yeon Seok, the ace, is left.)

3233
01:43:32,059 --> 01:43:34,358
(Just one more!)

3234
01:43:34,858 --> 01:43:37,198
(Please!)

3235
01:43:38,099 --> 01:43:39,367
We got it.

3236
01:43:39,368 --> 01:43:41,368
Hey, hurry. How much time do we have?

3237
01:43:41,799 --> 01:43:44,367
(The remaining time is 10 seconds.)

3238
01:43:44,368 --> 01:43:46,508
We just need to do one more.

3239
01:43:46,509 --> 01:43:47,509
Here I go.

3240
01:43:51,379 --> 01:43:52,379
Here I go.

3241
01:43:53,349 --> 01:43:56,118
(He did it!)

3242
01:44:00,988 --> 01:44:03,458
(Cheering)

3243
01:44:04,759 --> 01:44:06,857
- My gosh. - Nice!

3244
01:44:06,858 --> 01:44:08,929
Success!

3245
01:44:09,299 --> 01:44:12,868
(They clear Round 2 in 2 tries for the 1st time ever.)

3246
01:44:13,828 --> 01:44:16,839
(He did it again!)

3247
01:44:17,498 --> 01:44:19,108
(Here I go.)

3248
01:44:24,979 --> 01:44:28,778
(Haven't you seen an ace before?)

3249
01:44:30,379 --> 01:44:31,519
No way!

3250
01:44:31,818 --> 01:44:33,378
- Hey, we have eight tries left. - Hey.

3251
01:44:36,059 --> 01:44:37,889
- Amen! - Amen!

3252
01:44:38,458 --> 01:44:39,589
- Amen. - Okay.

3253
01:44:41,189 --> 01:44:43,397
- Gosh, that was awesome. - Nice.

3254
01:44:43,398 --> 01:44:45,157
- Gosh, we're going to Round Three. - Don't change it.

3255
01:44:45,158 --> 01:44:47,128
Don't change it.

3256
01:44:47,129 --> 01:44:48,367
- But Round Three... - All right!

3257
01:44:48,368 --> 01:44:50,197
- Round 2. - With that, Round 2 is...

3258
01:44:50,198 --> 01:44:51,668
- a success! - The air purifier.

3259
01:44:51,669 --> 01:44:53,867
(He wins the running shoes and air purifier!)

3260
01:44:53,868 --> 01:44:55,638
But this is seriously...

3261
01:44:55,639 --> 01:44:56,938
(In a daze)

3262
01:44:56,939 --> 01:44:58,008
I was surprised too.

3263
01:44:58,009 --> 01:44:59,478
- Gosh, you... - Hey, you're amazing.

3264
01:44:59,479 --> 01:45:01,247
- You and Jong Kook... - I said I was good at table tennis.

3265
01:45:01,248 --> 01:45:03,348
- You really are good at this. - This is your game.

3266
01:45:03,349 --> 01:45:05,018
- You're good. - And Jong Kook. You did one.

3267
01:45:05,019 --> 01:45:06,787
- I cleared one. - Nice.

3268
01:45:06,788 --> 01:45:07,888
- Yes, Jong Kook. - All right.

3269
01:45:07,889 --> 01:45:09,157
- Nice. - All right.

3270
01:45:09,158 --> 01:45:10,287
- Nice! - Good job.

3271
01:45:10,288 --> 01:45:12,458
Yoo Yeon Seok soars whenever he sees me.

3272
01:45:13,828 --> 01:45:15,487
- Hey, you're just... - That's right. Nice.

3273
01:45:15,488 --> 01:45:17,657
- Back then, the shoe at the end... - Very nice.

3274
01:45:17,658 --> 01:45:18,658
Of course.

3275
01:45:18,898 --> 01:45:21,929
(Refer to Episode 6.)

3276
01:45:22,299 --> 01:45:23,299
(Shouting)

3277
01:45:25,839 --> 01:45:27,338
(What did I say?)

3278
01:45:27,339 --> 01:45:30,009
(I told you Yeon Seok could do it!)

3279
01:45:30,778 --> 01:45:33,679
(The curse on his foot was broken when he met Tae Hyun.)

3280
01:45:33,879 --> 01:45:35,577
- Hey, you're just... - That's right. Nice.

3281
01:45:35,578 --> 01:45:37,777
- Back then, the shoe at the end... - Very nice.

3282
01:45:37,778 --> 01:45:39,088
- Of course. - But...

3283
01:45:39,089 --> 01:45:41,248
- Can we really do Round Three? - Until now,

3284
01:45:41,719 --> 01:45:43,918
we've never succeeded in Round 3 in just 3 tries.

3285
01:45:43,919 --> 01:45:45,157
This is awesome.

3286
01:45:45,158 --> 01:45:46,558
Gosh, this is really...

3287
01:45:46,559 --> 01:45:48,157
(They carefully start getting their hopes up.)

3288
01:45:48,158 --> 01:45:50,559
- We still have the coupon too. - What should we do?

3289
01:45:50,929 --> 01:45:52,258
- Should we go for it? - We have here...

3290
01:45:52,259 --> 01:45:54,027
- We have to go for it. - Should we do it?

3291
01:45:54,028 --> 01:45:55,668
- But what is... - We have to go for it.

3292
01:45:55,669 --> 01:45:57,168
- Should we go for it? - We have to go for it.

3293
01:45:57,169 --> 01:45:58,798
- Gosh, it'd be a shame not to. - I mean...

3294
01:45:58,799 --> 01:45:59,838
It does get harder.

3295
01:45:59,839 --> 01:46:01,138
- That's okay. - Did we start too early?

3296
01:46:01,139 --> 01:46:03,178
- It'll just be knocking 3 off. - It will be the 3 balls.

3297
01:46:03,179 --> 01:46:04,737
- It will be knocking three off. - We can do it.

3298
01:46:04,738 --> 01:46:06,178
- Oh, really? - We can do it.

3299
01:46:06,179 --> 01:46:08,124
It will be knocking three off. What more is there to do here?

3300
01:46:08,148 --> 01:46:09,817
- Gosh, this is just... - Let's go.

3301
01:46:09,818 --> 01:46:11,747
Go or stop? It's the final Round Three.

3302
01:46:11,748 --> 01:46:12,947
I will go for it.

3303
01:46:12,948 --> 01:46:14,148
- Go! - Go!

3304
01:46:14,618 --> 01:46:16,888
- But... - We have to go for it.

3305
01:46:16,889 --> 01:46:18,388
- There's nothing more to do. - You chose to go, right?

3306
01:46:18,389 --> 01:46:19,429
- Yes. - Yes.

3307
01:46:20,988 --> 01:46:23,497
"No electronics in the operating room."

3308
01:46:23,498 --> 01:46:25,157
"I want to be free in my spare time."

3309
01:46:25,158 --> 01:46:27,669
"The latest Galaxy tablet PC."

3310
01:46:29,238 --> 01:46:31,299
- A Galaxy Tab? - A tablet PC.

3311
01:46:33,068 --> 01:46:34,339
Gosh, a Galaxy Tab.

3312
01:46:34,639 --> 01:46:35,768
- No way. - My gosh.

3313
01:46:35,769 --> 01:46:37,439
- It's about 1,100 dollars. - My gosh.

3314
01:46:38,179 --> 01:46:39,809
Hey, you don't have to state the price.

3315
01:46:40,408 --> 01:46:42,107
- Why would you tell us that? - Gosh, this is...

3316
01:46:42,108 --> 01:46:45,647
(I want to be free in my spare time. The latest Galaxy tablet PC)

3317
01:46:45,648 --> 01:46:46,848
Gosh, how much is the total?

3318
01:46:46,849 --> 01:46:48,617
- Isn't it about 2,500 dollars? - This would be over 2,000...

3319
01:46:48,618 --> 01:46:50,258
- It's almost 2,000 dollars. - It's about 2,000 dollars.

3320
01:46:50,259 --> 01:46:51,317
- It's over 2,000 dollars. - In total.

3321
01:46:51,318 --> 01:46:52,657
- All right. - Let's do this. Let's succeed.

3322
01:46:52,658 --> 01:46:54,688
- Now, the final Round Three. - Let's do this.

3323
01:46:54,689 --> 01:46:56,657
This is the season finale.

3324
01:46:56,658 --> 01:46:58,799
- Nice. - Really, a neat win in three tries.

3325
01:46:59,059 --> 01:47:00,327
Are we ending it in three tries?

3326
01:47:00,328 --> 01:47:02,268
- If we finish this, - Let's end this.

3327
01:47:02,269 --> 01:47:03,367
- it will literally be... - Are we really doing it?

3328
01:47:03,368 --> 01:47:04,897
- If we finish this, - Let's finish it.

3329
01:47:04,898 --> 01:47:06,839
- this will seriously be... - Let's end it.

3330
01:47:06,939 --> 01:47:09,438
- All right. What's for Round 3? - In Round 3...

3331
01:47:09,439 --> 01:47:10,737
(Round 3)

3332
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:13,148
(Knock off 3 table tennis balls.)

3333
01:47:13,248 --> 01:47:14,647
- Okay. - I see.

3334
01:47:14,648 --> 01:47:16,478
- I told you. - It's not easy.

3335
01:47:16,479 --> 01:47:18,419
(Knock off all 3?)

3336
01:47:18,618 --> 01:47:20,787
It's not easy.

3337
01:47:20,788 --> 01:47:22,094
- Let's do this. - Do we get ten balls?

3338
01:47:22,118 --> 01:47:23,188
- Yes, it's the same. - Do we get ten?

3339
01:47:23,189 --> 01:47:24,418
It's not easy,

3340
01:47:24,419 --> 01:47:25,888
- It's not easy, but we'll do it. - but we can do it.

3341
01:47:25,889 --> 01:47:27,188
- It's enough. - It's not easy, but we'll do it.

3342
01:47:27,189 --> 01:47:28,189
Take two each.

3343
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:29,558
- We'll do 2 each. You take 4. - You take 4.

3344
01:47:29,559 --> 01:47:31,128
- Yes, it's perfect right now. - Four? Okay.

3345
01:47:31,129 --> 01:47:33,027
- Yeon Seok will go last. - Four.

3346
01:47:33,028 --> 01:47:35,098
Hey, Yeon Seok finally found his game.

3347
01:47:35,099 --> 01:47:36,298
(He's getting the royal treatment as the ace.)

3348
01:47:36,299 --> 01:47:37,497
For the past few weeks,

3349
01:47:37,498 --> 01:47:38,897
- Ahn Yeon Seok... - Gosh, we should...

3350
01:47:38,898 --> 01:47:40,438
- I didn't taste success very much. - Right.

3351
01:47:40,439 --> 01:47:42,008
- You're a table tennis player. - But you found your game today.

3352
01:47:42,009 --> 01:47:43,338
- Nice. - I found it in the end.

3353
01:47:43,339 --> 01:47:44,777
- Let's end it in one try. - Let's go!

3354
01:47:44,778 --> 01:47:46,448
- Let's go! - Let's go!

3355
01:47:46,549 --> 01:47:48,708
Seriously, the final...

3356
01:47:48,948 --> 01:47:50,918
- In Round 3, - Knocking off 3...

3357
01:47:50,919 --> 01:47:52,418
- we'll be writing history. - won't be easy.

3358
01:47:52,419 --> 01:47:54,648
- Yes, of course. - We're writing the show's history.

3359
01:47:55,219 --> 01:47:57,518
- Knocking off three won't be easy. - We'll be writing history.

3360
01:47:57,519 --> 01:47:58,558
Ready.

3361
01:47:58,559 --> 01:48:02,358
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

3362
01:48:02,698 --> 01:48:05,599
(Will they be able to keep up their momentum in Round 3 as well?)

3363
01:48:05,898 --> 01:48:06,898
Knocking off three won't be easy.

3364
01:48:06,899 --> 01:48:08,527
- Ready. - All right. Let's go.

3365
01:48:08,528 --> 01:48:09,538
Set.

3366
01:48:13,009 --> 01:48:14,409
It would be great if you succeeded.

3367
01:48:14,669 --> 01:48:15,789
- Is it me? Okay. - Darn it.

3368
01:48:16,738 --> 01:48:17,778
Darn it.

3369
01:48:18,339 --> 01:48:19,459
- Is it me? Okay. - Darn it.

3370
01:48:19,948 --> 01:48:21,348
It would be great if you succeeded.

3371
01:48:22,648 --> 01:48:23,678
What's up with you?

3372
01:48:23,679 --> 01:48:24,679
Okay!

3373
01:48:26,118 --> 01:48:27,518
It would be great if you succeeded.

3374
01:48:28,389 --> 01:48:29,919
- What? - What's up with you?

3375
01:48:30,389 --> 01:48:33,858
(He knocked off two balls in a flash!)

3376
01:48:34,158 --> 01:48:35,229
Okay!

3377
01:48:44,099 --> 01:48:47,169
(Now, there's only one table tennis ball left.)

3378
01:48:48,108 --> 01:48:50,277
(And the remaining player is Jae Suk...)

3379
01:48:50,278 --> 01:48:53,049
(and the ace, Yeon Seok.)

3380
01:48:57,148 --> 01:48:59,549
(We will be writing history.)

3381
01:49:00,948 --> 01:49:02,759
Hey, let's do this. Let's succeed.

3382
01:49:04,689 --> 01:49:05,719
I told you.

3383
01:49:09,559 --> 01:49:12,898
(He knocked it off!)

3384
01:49:17,339 --> 01:49:18,368
I told you.

3385
01:49:31,479 --> 01:49:33,188
(This actually worked?)

3386
01:49:33,189 --> 01:49:34,248
What was that?

3387
01:49:35,148 --> 01:49:36,457
Gosh, that was insane.

3388
01:49:36,458 --> 01:49:37,889
(The cameraman)

3389
01:49:40,189 --> 01:49:41,259
What was that?

3390
01:49:42,488 --> 01:49:46,328
(They succeeded in Round 3 in only 3 tries!)

3391
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,728
I told you so!

3392
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:49,368
I said we only needed two each!

3393
01:49:50,299 --> 01:49:53,439
(They succeeded in Round 1 on the 1st try.)

3394
01:49:54,969 --> 01:49:57,084
- See? I told you. - Hey, take it out of your pocket.

3395
01:49:57,108 --> 01:49:59,748
(They succeeded in Round 2 on the 2nd try.)

3396
01:50:00,509 --> 01:50:03,148
(And they continued with the third try.)

3397
01:50:07,019 --> 01:50:11,658
(They succeeded in all rounds on the third try!)

3398
01:50:11,858 --> 01:50:13,328
I said we only needed two each!

3399
01:50:14,389 --> 01:50:16,398
(A blissful celebration)

3400
01:50:19,368 --> 01:50:22,229
(The miracle of the table tennis room)

3401
01:50:23,169 --> 01:50:25,567
- We did it. See that? - My goodness.

3402
01:50:25,568 --> 01:50:26,608
- We did it. - All right.

3403
01:50:26,868 --> 01:50:28,237
How could they do this in just three tries?

3404
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:29,538
It's so hot. I'm sweating.

3405
01:50:29,639 --> 01:50:30,777
- No way. - That was awesome.

3406
01:50:30,778 --> 01:50:33,849
Hey, look at the staff. They're dropping their heads.

3407
01:50:34,349 --> 01:50:36,719
(The staff was flustered by their lightning-fast success.)

3408
01:50:36,979 --> 01:50:40,019
We wrote a new history of Whenever Possible!

3409
01:50:40,618 --> 01:50:42,888
We succeeded in Round 3 in just 3 tries.

3410
01:50:42,889 --> 01:50:44,488
- Success! - Success!

3411
01:50:45,189 --> 01:50:46,228
Yes!

3412
01:50:46,229 --> 01:50:47,758
Hey, this was a hard game too.

3413
01:50:47,759 --> 01:50:49,188
Knocking off all three was hard.

3414
01:50:49,189 --> 01:50:50,599
Gosh. Congratulations.

3415
01:50:50,799 --> 01:50:51,897
- I told you. - My goodness.

3416
01:50:51,898 --> 01:50:54,197
- Congratulations. - I found the perfect distance.

3417
01:50:54,198 --> 01:50:55,697
- I didn't even get a chance. - That was amazing.

3418
01:50:55,698 --> 01:50:58,468
(They succeeded without even needing the ace.)

3419
01:50:58,469 --> 01:51:01,139
Rather than thinking that I had to succeed,

3420
01:51:01,538 --> 01:51:03,638
- I knew Yeon Seok was behind me. - Right.

3421
01:51:03,639 --> 01:51:05,077
- You were relaxed. - You felt at ease.

3422
01:51:05,078 --> 01:51:07,277
I just did it, thinking that Yeon Seok was behind me.

3423
01:51:07,278 --> 01:51:09,248
Hang on. Round Four, go!

3424
01:51:09,879 --> 01:51:11,978
- Round 4, go! - Do we have a Round 4?

3425
01:51:11,979 --> 01:51:13,499
- Round Four, go! - What should we do?

3426
01:51:15,349 --> 01:51:18,058
- Gosh, this was so cool. - It was incredible.

3427
01:51:18,059 --> 01:51:19,388
We did it, but it was so cool.

3428
01:51:19,389 --> 01:51:20,457
Hey, that was nice.

3429
01:51:20,458 --> 01:51:22,058
Yes, but this was just...

3430
01:51:22,059 --> 01:51:23,539
- It was nice and clean. - It's over.

3431
01:51:23,799 --> 01:51:26,028
All right. With that, we will give Sang Heon...

3432
01:51:26,469 --> 01:51:27,998
We were so surprised ourselves.

3433
01:51:28,198 --> 01:51:29,269
But...

3434
01:51:29,498 --> 01:51:31,238
To think we'd wrap up this season...

3435
01:51:31,398 --> 01:51:33,107
on such a clean...

3436
01:51:33,108 --> 01:51:35,208
- and crisp note. - Is this okay?

3437
01:51:35,509 --> 01:51:37,084
- The last three shots... - It's the last episode.

3438
01:51:37,108 --> 01:51:38,639
Hit the three balls in order.

3439
01:51:39,139 --> 01:51:41,408
Jae Suk. Is this okay?

3440
01:51:41,549 --> 01:51:43,978
With that, you even get a tablet PC today.

3441
01:51:43,979 --> 01:51:45,147
Thank you.

3442
01:51:45,148 --> 01:51:46,988
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

3443
01:51:48,148 --> 01:51:51,357
- Jong Kook and Tae Hyun... - Yes.

3444
01:51:51,358 --> 01:51:53,487
Joined us in this season's last episode today.

3445
01:51:53,488 --> 01:51:54,558
Please say some final words.

3446
01:51:54,559 --> 01:51:55,928
My voice is hoarse now.

3447
01:51:55,929 --> 01:51:57,098
- You've lost your voice. - Yes.

3448
01:51:57,099 --> 01:52:00,327
It's been a while since I've had fun conversations on shows.

3449
01:52:00,328 --> 01:52:02,497
Talking was fun too,

3450
01:52:02,498 --> 01:52:05,068
and doing a good deed made me very happy.

3451
01:52:05,398 --> 01:52:06,707
Thank you for having me.

3452
01:52:06,708 --> 01:52:07,737
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3453
01:52:07,738 --> 01:52:09,268
- Tae Hyun. - I'll make it short.

3454
01:52:09,269 --> 01:52:10,777
Next time, I'll also bring Hyuk.

3455
01:52:10,778 --> 01:52:11,778
Okay.

3456
01:52:12,479 --> 01:52:14,448
The three of us next time. Okay.

3457
01:52:14,549 --> 01:52:17,747
We, Yeon Seok, the production crew, and I,

3458
01:52:17,748 --> 01:52:20,317
would like to thank the many people...

3459
01:52:20,318 --> 01:52:22,718
for sparing their time for us.

3460
01:52:22,719 --> 01:52:24,957
When it gets warmer,

3461
01:52:24,958 --> 01:52:27,327
we will return and greet everyone.

3462
01:52:27,328 --> 01:52:30,058
Thank you to the viewers who have been with us.

3463
01:52:30,059 --> 01:52:31,198
- Thank you. - Thank you.

3464
01:52:32,059 --> 01:52:33,428
Happy New Year.

3465
01:52:33,429 --> 01:52:34,929
- Happy New Year. - Happy New Year.
