1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,939
(EXPO Hanbit Tower commemorating Taejon Expo 1993)

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:09,110
It brings back memories.

3
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:11,078
- Have you been here? - Yes.

4
00:00:11,079 --> 00:00:12,780
- Really? - Of course.

5
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,510
Since it was in 1993,

6
00:00:16,979 --> 00:00:18,720
I was about ten years old.

7
00:00:18,979 --> 00:00:20,588
Then you would've been here.

8
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:23,350
- Yes, I've been here. - Right.

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,889
The mascots are over there. Kumdori.

10
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:29,159
From what I've heard,

11
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:32,799
Kumdori got married.

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,299
He married Kumsooni.

13
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,100
- Kumdori has a family. - Wait.

14
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,139
- He built a family. - Goodness.

15
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,499
Even Kumdori got married.

16
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:43,638
I don't have a family of my own yet.

17
00:00:43,639 --> 00:00:44,639
You're right.

18
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,779
- Kumdori is in his 30s. - Exactly.

19
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,078
(Kumdori became an adult and a father.)

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,309
Let's see.

21
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:51,618
This is the first time shooting Whenever Possible outside of Seoul.

22
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,879
Yes. It's our first shoot in the provinces.

23
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,989
It's Daejeon.

24
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,388
(Finding spare time outside of Seoul)

25
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:57,318
It only takes one and a half hours to Daejeon.

26
00:00:57,319 --> 00:00:59,019
- Right, by train. - Yes.

27
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,288
If your girlfriend is in Daejeon, you can go back and forth...

28
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:03,289
Yes?

29
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:04,735
And maintain a long-distance relationship.

30
00:01:04,759 --> 00:01:05,898
What? Do you have experience?

31
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,500
No, I'm saying you can do it.

32
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:09,068
Get yourself a girlfriend today.

33
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,799
- One like Kumsooni? - Yes, like Kumsooni.

34
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,970
- Like Kumdori. - Exactly.

35
00:01:12,069 --> 00:01:14,338
A long-distance relationship is possible.

36
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:16,239
- It is. - You can take trips on the weekend.

37
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,440
Daegu and Busan are possible too.

38
00:01:19,009 --> 00:01:20,850
Any city is possible. Even overseas.

39
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:23,580
- Overseas is a bit hard. - How come?

40
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,250
Because of the time difference.

41
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,219
A producer I know is...

42
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,088
currently in a long-distance relationship.

43
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,989
The time difference is giving him a hard time.

44
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:32,689
But love beats everything.

45
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:34,659
- He loves her too. - Is that so?

46
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,660
(He loves her too.)

47
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,929
He loves his girlfriend, but it's tough.

48
00:01:39,029 --> 00:01:41,028
- Because of the time difference? - Yes, the time difference.

49
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:42,228
(At that moment)

50
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,839
By the way, I wonder who's coming today.

51
00:01:45,169 --> 00:01:46,739
Who is our guest today?

52
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,308
- I'm sure you're curious. - Yes.

53
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:50,439
(The two MCs haven't noticed.)

54
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,809
Hi.

55
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,309
- My gosh. - What?

56
00:01:53,809 --> 00:01:55,080
- My gosh. - What?

57
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,080
- Hi. - Hi.

58
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,319
- Really. Coach. - Goodness.

59
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:00,719
- Coach. - Goodness.

60
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,349
You looked like you were simply passing by.

61
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,990
I was actually just passing by.

62
00:02:05,089 --> 00:02:06,890
- Come this way. - Hi.

63
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,490
- We... - I was passing by, you know?

64
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,598
- Coach. - Hi.

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,028
- How have you been, Coach? - Hi.

66
00:02:13,029 --> 00:02:14,330
- Hi. - Sorry?

67
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:15,598
I've been busy.

68
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,098
You are busy, aren't you?

69
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,339
I mistook you for a passerby wearing that bag.

70
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,270
I was trying to just pass by.

71
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:24,308
Do you often come here?

72
00:02:24,309 --> 00:02:25,339
- No. - No?

73
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:28,308
Don't you have a house in Daejeon?

74
00:02:28,309 --> 00:02:31,148
Yes, it's nearby. It takes about 15 minutes from here.

75
00:02:31,149 --> 00:02:32,378
- Is that so? - Really?

76
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,648
Are you currently living in Daejeon?

77
00:02:33,649 --> 00:02:35,188
No, I'm usually in Seoul.

78
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:36,520
(Honest)

79
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,490
- But... - She has a house in Daejeon.

80
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,729
- I've always wanted to meet you. - Really?

81
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,128
Have you never met her before, Yeon Seok?

82
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,428
- No. - We've never met.

83
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,459
- Really? - Yes.

84
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:47,199
- I heard you liked golf. - I do.

85
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,829
- He loves golf. - I like golfing.

86
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:50,569
I wanted to meet you, but there was no opportunity.

87
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,769
Se Ri is currently a committee member,

88
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:54,839
- the national team coach, - Yes.

89
00:02:54,939 --> 00:02:57,210
An influencer, a celebrity,

90
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,739
and a golf coach.

91
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,380
- She has many titles. - Too many titles.

92
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,209
Se Ri is...

93
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,618
- the pillar of the golf industry. - "Pillar."

94
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:05,678
Right now...

95
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:08,019
How should I address you today?

96
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,718
I prefer Coach.

97
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,558
- Coach. - Yes, it feels right.

98
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:13,390
- Coach Pak Se Ri. - Coach.

99
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:14,489
Our...

100
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,658
Magical Princess Se Ri has come

101
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:20,929
- She came to Earth from a star - Goodness.

102
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:24,139
(Se Ri)

103
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,969
I've heard that song countless times.

104
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:28,009
- In the past, - I haven't heard it in ages.

105
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:30,939
- when Se Ri was an athlete, - I've heard it numerous times.

106
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,938
The song from "Sally the Witch" played whenever she appeared.

107
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:35,079
- Yes. - Yes.

108
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,479
We grew up hearing this song.

109
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,950
- It's a familiar song. - Yes.

110
00:03:38,219 --> 00:03:39,248
- Coach. - Yes?

111
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:41,519
You're with us on Whenever Possible.

112
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:44,558
The thought of spending the day with you makes me happy.

113
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:47,059
- I'm excited. - She's a spender.

114
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,360
Coach Pak will take the lead today.

115
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,158
She has the image...

116
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,428
- of a generous person. - She's generous.

117
00:03:54,429 --> 00:03:56,629
- Coach Pak is very generous. - I see.

118
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,838
Don't worry about food.

119
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,839
- Really? - Yes.

120
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,069
I look forward to today.

121
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,169
Coach Pak knows...

122
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,509
- many must-eat places. - I'm excited.

123
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,540
We don't have to worry about our lunch today.

124
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,540
There's no need to worry about lunch.

125
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,649
Aren't you good at games, Coach Pak?

126
00:04:09,809 --> 00:04:12,348
I'm not that good, but I'm competitive.

127
00:04:12,349 --> 00:04:13,378
- Exactly. - Right.

128
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,589
(In a little while...)

129
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:16,849
I'm right.

130
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:21,589
(Coach Pak's competitiveness shocks Daejeon.)

131
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,969
(Pak Se Ri in crisis will be revealed soon.)

132
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,199
- Now then, Yeon Seok. - Yes?

133
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,898
Please tell us today's...

134
00:04:32,899 --> 00:04:34,309
- Whenever Guest. - Today...

135
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:35,908
- There are a few, yes? - Our first guest.

136
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,979
- An Sang Hui. - Sang Hui.

137
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,010
"A.S.F."

138
00:04:39,011 --> 00:04:40,909
"Analyze sudden..."

139
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,949
It's different from what I know.

140
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,718
"My job is to analyze..."

141
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,320
"the sudden smell of feces."

142
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,648
- Is it... - "The smell of feces?"

143
00:04:49,649 --> 00:04:51,419
- Is she a researcher? - Is she?

144
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,488
"With just my nose,"

145
00:04:53,489 --> 00:04:56,358
"I can differentiate cow and pig feces."

146
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:59,158
"Please gift our team, suffering from nasty smells every day,"

147
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:01,469
"a refreshing time."

148
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,538
Her job involves smelling nasty odors?

149
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,468
The place is the Odor Analytical Lab.

150
00:05:06,469 --> 00:05:07,939
"Odor Analytical Lab?"

151
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,709
To think such a place exists.

152
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,608
- It's unusual. - I've never heard of it before.

153
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:14,038
There are numerous jobs we don't know about.

154
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:15,749
- It's new to me too. - Isn't KAIST in Daejeon?

155
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,079
- It is. - KAIST is in Daejeon.

156
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,418
- Is it nearby? - Yes.

157
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20,080
- Is it in KAIST? - Is it?

158
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,449
- We should do this first. - The coupon.

159
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,848
(Time to earn today's bonus coupon)

160
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:25,460
- Coach Pak. Roll this. - Yes.

161
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,130
- Coach. - Oh, no.

162
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,158
- Coach Pak. What's with... - The number on the die...

163
00:05:31,159 --> 00:05:32,859
all of these shiny things?

164
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,999
- Isn't this an expensive watch? - Coach Pak.

165
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,798
- This one right here. - I heard...

166
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:39,499
- white was today's key color. - Yes.

167
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,009
Is it an accessory?

168
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,370
- Is that why you wore this watch? - Yes.

169
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:46,639
I thought you two would wear all white.

170
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,549
It would look awkward if I did too.

171
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,209
And I don't have many white things.

172
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,019
(An impressive white color)

173
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,148
- I prefer dark colors. - Well done.

174
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,349
- Do I throw it? - Yes.

175
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:01,329
(Adventurer Se Ri)

176
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,029
(How many coupons will they get today?)

177
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,169
- Oh, gosh. - One.

178
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,899
It's all right.

179
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:12,099
At least it's not zero. It's not.

180
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,569
Right.

181
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,538
We're going to Sungsimdang, right?

182
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:18,608
- Of course. - There's one right...

183
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:20,179
- behind us. - For real?

184
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,709
The main store...

185
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:23,249
- is downtown. - I see.

186
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,978
There's a branch store here.

187
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:26,848
We should head there first.

188
00:06:26,849 --> 00:06:28,189
- How about some warm coffee? - Shall we?

189
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:29,390
Nice, Coach Pak.

190
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:31,219
- We speak the same language. - Yes.

191
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:33,658
The weather suddenly became chilly today.

192
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,029
- I know, right? - We need coffee.

193
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,359
It's really close by.

194
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,500
It's over there.

195
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:40,898
We're already here.

196
00:06:40,899 --> 00:06:42,019
(A bakery across the street)

197
00:06:42,899 --> 00:06:44,200
Wait. Fifteen seconds.

198
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,668
Ten seconds. What do we do?

199
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,699
- Hurry. - It's not enough.

200
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,039
- Let's go. - Come on.

201
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,870
- Coach Pak. Your legs... - Be careful.

202
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,680
- Hi. - Hi.

203
00:06:51,739 --> 00:06:53,810
- Sungsimdang. - Pak Se Ri!

204
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:57,109
As expected, she's Daejeon's celebrity.

205
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:00,449
But Daejeon people aren't really expressive.

206
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,819
- Really? - Is that so?

207
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:04,658
Expression-wise, Chungcheong Province people are...

208
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:05,858
Aren't they quite different?

209
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,520
- Yes. - Goodness.

210
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,089
- So it's here. - Yes.

211
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,929
I can smell bread.

212
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,099
- You can already smell bread. - You totally can.

213
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:16,599
It's bigger now.

214
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:17,969
- It's bigger. - Right?

215
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,200
Goodness, this is no joke.

216
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,939
- The cakes are here. - Yes.

217
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,809
The store had a different place for cakes.

218
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,180
- The bread is here. - Yes.

219
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:26,609
The store has changed.

220
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:28,548
- Gosh. - What would you like?

221
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:30,148
I like this one with the bean jam.

222
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,349
- Let's have one. - Which one?

223
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:33,849
What else would you like?

224
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:36,049
- This one? - Cream puff.

225
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,120
It's delicious.

226
00:07:38,919 --> 00:07:40,059
These ones are good too.

227
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,189
- The bat? - Would you like one?

228
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,060
- Should I buy it? - Buy it.

229
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,499
(3 breads)

230
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,099
What's this? Is it a new one?

231
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,500
"Honey cheese bun." Why does it look good?

232
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:51,799
It does, right?

233
00:07:52,739 --> 00:07:54,839
- This sausage bread is a must. - Is it good?

234
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,738
It's good.

235
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,409
What's this? "Toyo bread?"

236
00:07:58,539 --> 00:07:59,609
I don't know what it is.

237
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:01,049
(Since it's new, 6 breads)

238
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,509
- A veggie croquette? - Yes.

239
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:04,079
- I'm in. - This one's tasty.

240
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,080
Let's have one.

241
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,119
- Are we set? - We can have it cut. We're set.

242
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
- It's more than enough. - Let's go.

243
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,048
- What else? - It's enough.

244
00:08:10,049 --> 00:08:11,190
I want this one.

245
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,820
I like this bread. Fresh donuts.

246
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,589
- Would you like one? - Do you want one?

247
00:08:17,729 --> 00:08:19,158
- Do you want one? - No.

248
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:20,460
- Why not? - I can't finish it.

249
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,130
Coach Pak was like, "Do you want one?"

250
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,769
Let's try slices of it. Cornbread.

251
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,798
- Eat them on your way back. - We should taste test it all.

252
00:08:26,799 --> 00:08:28,686
Put it on the tray. Are you going to take it like that?

253
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:30,038
- Don't take it like that. - Tell me faster.

254
00:08:30,039 --> 00:08:31,309
(The bread lover can't wait.)

255
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,279
Coach Pak told us to eat it on our way back.

256
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,509
- Hi. - Welcome.

257
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:36,909
Yes.

258
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,849
(Se Ri's wallet opens right away.)

259
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,319
- Thank you, Coach Pak. - Oh, my.

260
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,280
- Thank you. - And before eating them. Thank you.

261
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,920
Coach Pak paid for them.

262
00:08:45,889 --> 00:08:48,629
I don't like being slow.

263
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:50,930
We're a bit...

264
00:08:52,136 --> 00:08:54,035
- What shall I have? - Didn't you want a latte?

265
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,200
I'll order a latte.

266
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,169
(Se Ri already got a table.)

267
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,440
(Pulling up her sleeves)

268
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,509
(Getting up)

269
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,170
Is this where I get the plates?

270
00:09:05,239 --> 00:09:06,339
(Still paying)

271
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:09,508
(Even before they're done paying for the coffees, )

272
00:09:09,509 --> 00:09:14,249
(Se Ri sets up the plates and forks.)

273
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,690
What? Where's Coach Pak?

274
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,790
- Is there a room? - Hi.

275
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,888
Where is Coach Pak? There she is.

276
00:09:22,889 --> 00:09:25,129
When did Coach Pak...

277
00:09:26,129 --> 00:09:27,229
When did you...

278
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,229
- The forks... - When did you get them?

279
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:31,800
They're over there.

280
00:09:32,099 --> 00:09:34,810
- When did you set the table? - She moves fast.

281
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,469
- I'm quite impatient. - Gosh.

282
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:41,008
I bet you play golf really fast.

283
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:42,180
I'm a fast walker.

284
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,878
- This is the fried soboro bread. - Goodness.

285
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,619
We can start with a full stomach.

286
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:50,349
Isn't this too much bread?

287
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,920
All Coach Pak said was,

288
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:54,019
"Do you want one?"

289
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,430
"Do you?"

290
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:57,859
(She buys it right away.)

291
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,330
- It wasn't expensive. - I didn't see how much it was.

292
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,099
The total was 25 dollars.

293
00:10:02,629 --> 00:10:04,639
No way. You must've paid more than that.

294
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,739
This is the reason Sungsimdang is famous.

295
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,768
The breads...

296
00:10:09,769 --> 00:10:11,608
were 1.50 dollars, 2 dollars,

297
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,878
and only 1 was over 4 dollars.

298
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,709
- The loaf. - I see. That is what makes...

299
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,909
Sungsimdang more famous.

300
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,018
- It's delicious too. - It's good.

301
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,680
- It's high in quality. - It's tasty.

302
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,388
Take the leftovers with you.

303
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:23,589
(There's no end to the bread.)

304
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,718
Remember such bread exists in Daejeon.

305
00:10:25,719 --> 00:10:26,789
(Feeling proud of Daejeon)

306
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:27,959
- Gosh. - We can share it.

307
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,829
- We're having a bread festival. - Right?

308
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:30,830
A bread festival.

309
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:32,200
Coach Pak's favorite.

310
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,830
Gosh.

311
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,499
- Dig in. - Thank you.

312
00:10:38,599 --> 00:10:39,599
Go ahead.

313
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,139
Coach Pak. The cornbread is amazing.

314
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:43,809
- The loaf? - The cornbread.

315
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,780
- I'm loving it. - It's good.

316
00:10:46,609 --> 00:10:47,680
(Amazed)

317
00:10:50,009 --> 00:10:52,820
(Feeling proud)

318
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:54,749
But...

319
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:57,089
how do we eat lunch after all this?

320
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,320
Lunch is separate.

321
00:11:00,389 --> 00:11:01,589
Let's enjoy a tasty lunch.

322
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,830
- Is lunch separate? - Yes, lunch is separate.

323
00:11:04,129 --> 00:11:05,728
- This one is good too. - Coach Pak...

324
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,089
doesn't eat as much as I imagined.

325
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:09,868
She ate a little bit of everything.

326
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,070
- Exactly. - I prefer...

327
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,269
living a diverse life.

328
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:17,709
How she lives is...

329
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,809
Even food-wise, I can't eat one type.

330
00:11:19,810 --> 00:11:22,580
I like buying a variety and enjoying a bit of everything.

331
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,749
So there's always plenty of food.

332
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:29,589
What makes me feel uneasy when someone treats me to food...

333
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:32,920
is that I can only order a certain amount.

334
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,030
That's the most uncomfortable part.

335
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,888
That is the reason...

336
00:11:36,889 --> 00:11:39,629
I always hang out as a group.

337
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:42,598
Anyone would love to hang out with her.

338
00:11:42,599 --> 00:11:44,429
Earlier, Coach Pak...

339
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,969
went straight to the cashier.

340
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,468
- Right away? - Right away.

341
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:51,170
You took your time going to the cashier.

342
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,749
Coach Pak likes to take the lead.

343
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:56,550
Stop Coach Pak,

344
00:11:57,009 --> 00:11:58,479
and it'll make her sick.

345
00:11:58,749 --> 00:12:00,180
No. I like being stopped.

346
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,988
- We should let her take the lead. - It's not like...

347
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,119
I have to pay all the time.

348
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:07,190
- I like it. - Coach Pak.

349
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:08,659
I considered the situation.

350
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,988
I like it when others treat me to food.

351
00:12:09,989 --> 00:12:11,089
- Really? - Yes.

352
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,299
- Lunch will be on us. - All right.

353
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,506
(A lame chance to treat her to lunch)

354
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,890
That place isn't expensive either.

355
00:12:17,229 --> 00:12:18,839
Have you already chosen a restaurant?

356
00:12:18,999 --> 00:12:22,210
Yes. That place is really nice.

357
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,839
But wherever I go,

358
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,180
the restaurant owners treat me well.

359
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,919
There's a place famous for its spicy chicken feet.

360
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,320
I also like chicken feet.

361
00:12:34,379 --> 00:12:36,550
- Spicy chicken feet? - Yes, it's delicious.

362
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,559
I once cooked chicken feet ramyeon.

363
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,618
- I remember. - Right?

364
00:12:39,619 --> 00:12:41,089
I tried your recipe,

365
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,388
- but it was bad. - Order some...

366
00:12:43,389 --> 00:12:45,029
as takeout on your way back. It's that good.

367
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,960
- The sauce is... - You mean the chicken feet?

368
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,530
- The sauce... - Yes?

369
00:12:49,629 --> 00:12:51,768
- The place doesn't use capsaicin. - Hold on.

370
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:53,669
- They use delicious hot pepper. - Actual hot pepper?

371
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,039
Coach Pak is like a mother, sending her long-awaited kids...

372
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,180
back home after a national holiday,

373
00:12:58,609 --> 00:13:00,478
telling us to pack food.

374
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:01,550
But it's that delicious.

375
00:13:01,849 --> 00:13:03,378
I don't search for good places.

376
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,855
When I hear a certain place is delicious,

377
00:13:04,879 --> 00:13:07,050
I will go to that place nonstop.

378
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,289
- Like this. Yes. - It becomes your main target?

379
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,218
Yes. If the food is good on my first visit,

380
00:13:11,219 --> 00:13:13,219
- I exchange numbers with the owner. - Right away.

381
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,059
I give them a heads-up when visiting...

382
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,489
- their restaurant. - A heads-up.

383
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:19,729
Today's show is like...

384
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:22,729
a Daejeon gourmet traveling group with Pak Se Ri.

385
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:24,199
(Daejeon gourmet traveling group head)

386
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,299
We started the show...

387
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,769
- at Sungsimdang. - Exactly.

388
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,069
What's your MBTI, Coach?

389
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:31,580
- It's I... - "I?"

390
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,540
I don't think I'm an introvert, though.

391
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,109
Don't you gain energy...

392
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,319
- by gathering people... - Yes.

393
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,679
And enjoying food with them...

394
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,888
- on your day off? - That's an extrovert.

395
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:44,289
You're closer to an extrovert.

396
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,859
But my result says introvert.

397
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,060
- Are you a planner or... - I'm a planner.

398
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:49,359
That makes her a J.

399
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,199
What do you think about while washing your hair?

400
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,200
Nothing.

401
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,975
Do you usually think while washing your hair?

402
00:13:54,999 --> 00:13:56,200
You're a sensor.

403
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,468
- ISTJ. - Are you examining her?

404
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,899
ISTJ. I think she's an ISTJ.

405
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,939
(Unlicensed exam result: ISTJ)

406
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,768
ISTJ. I'm sure.

407
00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:05,478
- "T?" Was I a thinker? - Yeon Seok.

408
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:06,539
- Between T and F... - Hey.

409
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,348
Coach Pak could use the app herself.

410
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:09,848
Why are you examining her yourself?

411
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,579
- I think Coach Pak is an ISTJ. - Really.

412
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,878
Are you from the MBTI association...

413
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,279
- or something? - Aren't I right?

414
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,059
Some people think we are close.

415
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,689
But there are some people...

416
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,406
- I don't think are close to me. - Of course.

417
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,759
Out of politeness,

418
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:26,799
I should say we're close, but I can't.

419
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,098
(Se Ri can't feed a line.)

420
00:14:28,099 --> 00:14:30,769
Are you close to Jae Suk...

421
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:32,469
or not?

422
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,469
(What is Jae Suk to Se Ri?)

423
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:37,769
I can't say we're close.

424
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:40,679
You have to meet her a few more times.

425
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,978
(Hoping the two get closer)

426
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:43,209
We've warmed up to each other.

427
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,079
- That's true. - I don't find Coach Pak awkward.

428
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,550
- It isn't awkward. - Coach Pak... No.

429
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,488
- But you two aren't close. - No.

430
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,189
- Though we're not that close, - Yes?

431
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,419
- we've warmed up to each other. - I see.

432
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,059
- If we were close, we should've... - Kept in touch.

433
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,699
- kept in touch... - Right.

434
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:00,199
And asked how the other was doing.

435
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,599
Give me your number today, Coach.

436
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,768
I don't think she will.

437
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:05,799
(A sudden proposal to exchange numbers)

438
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,939
I've known Coach Pak for about...

439
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,310
twenty years.

440
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,440
- Yes. - Almost, right?

441
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:12,679
After 20 years, you're getting her number.

442
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,508
I'm getting the Coach's number after 20 years.

443
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:15,608
I hope you succeed.

444
00:15:15,609 --> 00:15:17,649
I'll call her now and then to ask,

445
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,290
"What should I do to get better at golf?"

446
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,450
- Mind control is key. - Her eyes are expressing,

447
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,190
"Why are you asking me that?"

448
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:26,789
No.

449
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:28,289
That's the look your eyes were giving me.

450
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:29,529
(Feeling guilty?)

451
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:31,560
I'm good at sports that use small balls.

452
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,959
Table tennis and golf.

453
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,000
- Are you good at them? - I have a talent for them.

454
00:15:35,330 --> 00:15:37,830
- Golf is hitting a dead ball. - Right.

455
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:41,638
Other sports like table tennis, baseball, and such...

456
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,969
are hitting flying balls.

457
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:46,839
Golf, which is hitting a dead ball,

458
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,809
- is the hardest. - That's why it's hard.

459
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,910
- Exactly. - It's strange.

460
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:53,419
I used to play golf for a short while.

461
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,790
When?

462
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:56,889
When I was in my early 30s.

463
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,758
My friends kept urging me to go golfing.

464
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,420
That's how you hang out with friends.

465
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,460
- Did you golf right away? - I did.

466
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:05,930
- Golf gets harder... - Yes?

467
00:16:05,999 --> 00:16:08,530
If you start without a good lesson.

468
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,399
You need to get the basis down.

469
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,940
- So give me your number, Coach Pak. - Okay.

470
00:16:13,269 --> 00:16:15,008
I'll give you a call.

471
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,810
But she's not agreeing to give it to you.

472
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:19,478
No, she'll give it to me.

473
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,639
Are you fine with my lesson fee? It's quite expensive.

474
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,550
- Nothing in life is for free. - That...

475
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:27,049
We can negotiate that.

476
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,949
(Planning to negotiate later)

477
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:30,849
- We can negotiate. - Yes.

478
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,819
- It's time for us to go. - Yes.

479
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,258
- Let's go. - Taking the taxi...

480
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,690
will get us there on time.

481
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,659
She's already waiting for us.

482
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,859
Coach Pak. You already...

483
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,598
Coach Pak.

484
00:16:41,599 --> 00:16:43,400
- You're standing so still. - My gosh.

485
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:45,299
I called a taxi.

486
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,400
My gosh, it's there.

487
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,768
My gosh, Kumdori is on top of the taxi.

488
00:16:48,769 --> 00:16:52,279
I see. Daejeon used Kumdori as a character.

489
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,080
They put Kumdori on taxis too.

490
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,379
- Gosh, this is so cute. - I've never seen that before.

491
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:59,420
They're using Kumdori as a character to brand their city.

492
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,248
- Hello. - Hello.

493
00:17:02,249 --> 00:17:03,419
- Nice to meet you. - Yes.

494
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:04,989
- There's a handle here. - Yes.

495
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:07,159
- I'll start driving now. - Okay.

496
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,528
(They head out to the first spare time with Kumdori.)

497
00:17:08,529 --> 00:17:10,089
Sorry about that. Hold on. This...

498
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,329
Let me just say that before we arrive,

499
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:14,799
I might pass out.

500
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,228
- It's hot in here. - It's too tight in here.

501
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:17,229
Right.

502
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,200
- Hold on. Let's... - You know what?

503
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,799
We're bonding a lot today.

504
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,969
(Bonding as good friends in a tight taxi)

505
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,879
(Transitioning into Navi Yoo)

506
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,110
Where are we?

507
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:29,410
We'll arrive after the U-turn.

508
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,680
I guess the analysis lab is in the building.

509
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,589
I didn't know that kind of job existed.

510
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,690
Right.

511
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:40,189
Due to the nature of the job, they have to keep smelling odor.

512
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,829
- My gosh. That's tough. - Yes, it must be hard.

513
00:17:42,989 --> 00:17:45,460
But I wonder what they do with the analysis.

514
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:49,099
Do they use the analysis to produce daily necessities?

515
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,400
- Or... - I am curious.

516
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,238
- "Korea Environment Corporation?" - Right.

517
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,370
Gosh, this is the place?

518
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,870
It's possible for Korea Environment Corporation.

519
00:17:57,309 --> 00:17:59,309
"Odor Analysis Lab?" That's fascinating.

520
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,508
It feels like she knows all these places...

521
00:18:01,509 --> 00:18:02,509
because she's with us.

522
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:04,978
Do you know this place too?

523
00:18:04,979 --> 00:18:06,778
- She's always leading us. - Right.

524
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:08,659
- Is that so? - It's like she knows everything.

525
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,788
For me, it doesn't feel like we're in Daejeon.

526
00:18:10,789 --> 00:18:13,136
(The place for the first spare time is unfamiliar even for Se Ri.)

527
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,090
(But she still leads them.)

528
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:18,629
There's a conference room. And there's the Odor Analytical Lab.

529
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:20,460
- It's right here. "Odor." - It's here.

530
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,369
- Right here. - "Odor Analytical Lab."

531
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,106
- "Odor Analytical Lab." - It really exists.

532
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,646
The Odor Analytical Lab really exists.

533
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:26,900
But no one is in here.

534
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:29,068
Should we go inside?

535
00:18:29,069 --> 00:18:30,610
(Where is the Whenever Guest?)

536
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,710
Oh, hello. Are you...

537
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:33,910
An Sang Hui...

538
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,849
- Hello. - Are you Ms. An Sang Hui?

539
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,508
- Hi. Are you Ms. An Sang Hui? - Yes. I am.

540
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:39,318
- Hello. - Hello.

541
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:41,150
- Can we enter? Okay. - Yes, come on in.

542
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,949
I see. This is the Odor Analytical Lab.

543
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,488
Yes. Welcome.

544
00:18:45,489 --> 00:18:46,859
(An Sang Hui, the first Whenever Guest)

545
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:49,028
Is this the Odor Analytical Lab where you analyze odor?

546
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,558
- Yes. That's right. - Yes.

547
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,199
Smelling things is our job.

548
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,599
Do you actually have to smell?

549
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,799
- Yes. That's right. - Yes.

550
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:58,029
My gosh, that's such a unique job.

551
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,468
Where could we talk?

552
00:18:59,469 --> 00:19:01,769
- Why don't we sit there? - Should we sit there?

553
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,808
- What is the analysis... - Yes.

554
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,489
- of odor used for? - What is it used for?

555
00:19:05,739 --> 00:19:08,279
We analyze the odor...

556
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,880
and...

557
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,278
I am nervous. Hold on.

558
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,478
You can relax.

559
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:15,749
It feels like I'm dreaming right now.

560
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,950
I see.

561
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:21,288
What is the analysis of odor used for?

562
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,859
When systematic odor management is needed...

563
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:25,929
in environmental infrastructure facilities...

564
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:28,258
or small to medium-sized odor-related businesses,

565
00:19:28,259 --> 00:19:30,268
we analyze the odor-causing substances...

566
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,268
upon request...

567
00:19:32,269 --> 00:19:34,969
- and provide the results. - I see.

568
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,968
Sometimes, we hear this on the news.

569
00:19:36,969 --> 00:19:38,578
"An odor with an unknown cause..."

570
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,778
- Right. - "is permeating..."

571
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:43,248
- That's when you guys... - We find the cause of the odor.

572
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:44,979
- I see. - I see.

573
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,778
Then do you live in Daejeon?

574
00:19:47,779 --> 00:19:50,018
- Yes, we live in Daejeon. - Yes.

575
00:19:50,019 --> 00:19:51,919
- I'm also from Daejeon. - We know.

576
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,089
- I was born and raised here. - I live...

577
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,318
- in Yuseong-gu. - You were born and raised here?

578
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,389
(The union of locals from Daejeon)

579
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:57,189
- You were born and raised here? - I was.

580
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,399
- She was. - You gave two thumbs-ups.

581
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,529
Daejeon is the best.

582
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:01,528
What is so great about Daejeon?

583
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,170
First of all, it's quiet.

584
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,699
It's quiet and a great place to live.

585
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,298
- It's not hectic. - Right.

586
00:20:07,299 --> 00:20:08,869
- It's the best. - That's so true.

587
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:10,910
- And we've got Sungsimdang. - Sungsimdang.

588
00:20:12,809 --> 00:20:14,578
- Sungsimdang is our pride. - Sungsimdang. Yes.

589
00:20:14,579 --> 00:20:16,578
- We talked about the bakery too. - Yes.

590
00:20:16,579 --> 00:20:17,949
- This is a fun city. - It's a fun city.

591
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:18,978
- A fun city. - A fun city.

592
00:20:18,979 --> 00:20:20,249
What's so fun about the city?

593
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,950
Sungsimdang.

594
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,120
- Wait. You... - Listen.

595
00:20:23,121 --> 00:20:25,459
(Everything ends with the bakery.)

596
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,259
You wrote in your letter that...

597
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:30,089
you could now differentiate the odors of feces and urine...

598
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,959
from cows and pigs, just by smelling them.

599
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,058
- Yes. I can. - It's like...

600
00:20:34,059 --> 00:20:36,299
you're a sommelier.

601
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,670
What?

602
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:38,798
How should I explain it?

603
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,099
(Flustered after making the comparison)

604
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,468
- Right. Sommeliers... - Odor-melier?

605
00:20:41,469 --> 00:20:42,709
Sure.

606
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:44,439
(The odor-melier trio from Daejeon)

607
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,778
- We should change our name. - Odor-melier?

608
00:20:45,779 --> 00:20:48,308
When average people smell feces and urine,

609
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:50,048
they simply recognize that as an odor.

610
00:20:50,049 --> 00:20:51,349
"This is coming from a cow farm."

611
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:53,426
"A cow farm must be around here." We can guess the odor.

612
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,748
"It smells like a pig farm. There must be one around here."

613
00:20:55,749 --> 00:20:57,089
- They can tell just by smelling. - That's it.

614
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,758
Let's say you're hanging out with your friends.

615
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,359
If someone were to fart,

616
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,160
would that remind you of some statistics?

617
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,200
No, that'd be too much. Statistics don't come to mind.

618
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,998
But we look for the source.

619
00:21:08,999 --> 00:21:10,079
- The source? - The source?

620
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,768
- "Who could it be?" - Are you good...

621
00:21:11,769 --> 00:21:13,899
- You can tell who it is right away. - We can sort of...

622
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,985
But you don't have to work in this department to do that.

623
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:17,308
Don't most people look for the source?

624
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:18,738
- Right. - That's true.

625
00:21:18,739 --> 00:21:20,180
When someone farts...

626
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,249
By the way, there must've been many departments to choose from.

627
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,978
Is there a reason behind choosing...

628
00:21:24,979 --> 00:21:27,150
the Odor Analytical Department?

629
00:21:28,019 --> 00:21:29,350
I didn't volunteer to work here.

630
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,748
- I see. It's a public enterprise. - I see.

631
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:33,589
- We... - I see.

632
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,189
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

633
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:38,328
- No one volunteered to work here. - Right.

634
00:21:38,329 --> 00:21:40,099
Once we get appointed, we have to comply.

635
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,899
- You had to be appointed. - Yes.

636
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,370
- That's right. - Yes.

637
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,268
It doesn't smell here or anything.

638
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:46,798
Just listening to them makes me feel like I'm smelling odor.

639
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,279
It might be because we ate a lot too.

640
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,439
Can we guess the odors too?

641
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,569
- Sure. - Yes.

642
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,479
(Scowling)

643
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:56,009
- Would you like to try it? - How about it?

644
00:21:57,850 --> 00:21:59,049
Should we do it or not?

645
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:01,478
- But this might be fun. - What kind of odor?

646
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,819
- This might be fun. - Hold on.

647
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,330
- We're better off by ourselves. - He must be a curious type.

648
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,789
He must be a curious type.

649
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,829
- What kind of odor? - I think it will be fun.

650
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:10,890
Hold on.

651
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,990
- Did she prepare some samples? - Wait.

652
00:22:13,259 --> 00:22:15,700
- They must have samples here. - Just in case.

653
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,768
I hear some rustling sounds.

654
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,269
(There's a mysterious sound.)

655
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:22,340
(Rustling)

656
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,009
Or we can play this as a game.

657
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,039
- You two can do it. Not me. - What game?

658
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:28,978
The loser can pay for lunch and stuff.

659
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:30,880
- But... - You play it. I paid for the bread.

660
00:22:31,079 --> 00:22:32,620
- My gosh. That? - This is it?

661
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,320
- I have two samples. - They're big.

662
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,120
(A mysterious bag is brought in.)

663
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:39,189
- I have two samples. - They're big.

664
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,660
Why did you bring such big samples?

665
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:43,959
- We got this from an actual scene. - That's how we collect samples.

666
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,058
- That's how you get samples? - Yes.

667
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:46,459
- Yes. We get samples like this. - The samples come in like this.

668
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,569
- I see. - This is the odor bag.

669
00:22:49,999 --> 00:22:53,170
Is anyone here highly sensitive to smell?

670
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,068
- I have a sensitive sense of smell. - Or is your sense of smell dull?

671
00:22:56,069 --> 00:22:59,409
Well, I am sensitive to smell.

672
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,709
(Quite sensitive to smell)

673
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,508
I think I might be good at it.

674
00:23:02,509 --> 00:23:03,650
Then...

675
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,879
- I will give this to Jae Suk. - Yes.

676
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,090
- You can smell this, Yeon Seok. - I see.

677
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,488
- Smell it from afar. - From afar. It's the source smell.

678
00:23:11,489 --> 00:23:13,660
- It's the source smell. Yes. - "The source smell?"

679
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,389
- Usually... - Won't it spread into the air?

680
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:18,429
- No. Relax and smell it. - No.

681
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,950
- How can we relax and smell? - Relax?

682
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,258
Like this?

683
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:23,469
Let me demonstrate it for you.

684
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,568
- Yes. From this distance. - I see. When we press it,

685
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,670
- it comes out. - The air comes out when pressed.

686
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,768
- Why don't you go first? - But...

687
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:32,509
(Smelling)

688
00:23:32,779 --> 00:23:33,809
Aren't you nervous?

689
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,579
(Secretly curious)

690
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:39,318
- Aren't you nervous? - So this...

691
00:23:39,319 --> 00:23:42,218
You know, I've never smelled anything in this form.

692
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:43,219
Or is it something else?

693
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:44,349
Is it from feces and urine?

694
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,718
No, it's not from feces and urine.

695
00:23:45,719 --> 00:23:47,659
It came from a sewage disposal facility.

696
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,460
- Then it must be from a bathroom. - Right.

697
00:23:49,759 --> 00:23:51,489
(Yeon Seok tries it out first.)

698
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,430
(How is it?)

699
00:23:56,529 --> 00:23:57,900
- I've smelled it before. - You...

700
00:24:01,469 --> 00:24:03,340
But it's not that bad.

701
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,509
You're spot on.

702
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,279
My gosh!

703
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:08,179
- Right. - My gosh!

704
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,508
(Laughing)

705
00:24:09,509 --> 00:24:10,548
(Retching)

706
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:13,179
(Knocked out from the odor)

707
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,079
- This one is weak. - What?

708
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:16,988
It's not that strong.

709
00:24:16,989 --> 00:24:18,018
Why do you want me to smell it? It's not a good smell.

710
00:24:18,019 --> 00:24:20,059
It's not that strong. Smell it.

711
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:21,318
- Coach Pak. - It's not that strong.

712
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:22,559
I'm curious.

713
00:24:23,059 --> 00:24:24,558
You'd be okay with that one.

714
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:25,798
- It's okay. - Yes.

715
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:27,099
(She musters up her courage and breathes in.)

716
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,159
- What? - It smells musty.

717
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,499
- It's weak. - It smells musty.

718
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,399
- That one is pretty bad. - This one...

719
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,700
Yes. It's like...

720
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,068
- Why don't you try that one? - Do you want to smell that one?

721
00:24:36,069 --> 00:24:38,068
- My nose... - You need to aerate your nose.

722
00:24:38,069 --> 00:24:39,179
- How do you aerate your nose? - Right.

723
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,808
- We have to rest for five minutes. - We have to rest.

724
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:42,729
Then why did you tell us to smell it right away?

725
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,249
- We don't have time. - We don't have time.

726
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:49,788
It smells sour and musty.

727
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:52,518
- It smells like food waste. - Food waste?

728
00:24:52,519 --> 00:24:53,959
- That's a similar smell. - That's right.

729
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:54,988
- That's what we smelled. - Yes.

730
00:24:54,989 --> 00:24:56,129
- That's correct. - Yes.

731
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,290
- This is so unpleasant. - It smelled like a bathroom.

732
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,360
(The odor left a brief, yet strong impression.)

733
00:24:59,361 --> 00:25:01,258
- Seriously. - But they have to do...

734
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:04,029
- unpleasant things for their job. - So...

735
00:25:06,539 --> 00:25:10,110
So what made you want to write to our show?

736
00:25:10,239 --> 00:25:13,778
Actually, I'm a big fan of Cho Jung Seok's acting.

737
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:15,008
- Cho Jung Seok. - Yes.

738
00:25:15,009 --> 00:25:16,849
- He was in the second episode. - Right.

739
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:18,508
His episode...

740
00:25:18,509 --> 00:25:20,779
- led me to learn about the show. - I see.

741
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,666
Then you must have watched "Hospital Playlist."

742
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:25,119
Of course, I did. I saw you too.

743
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,318
Yes.

744
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:27,718
But you watched it for Jung Seok.

745
00:25:27,719 --> 00:25:28,758
(Guilty as charged)

746
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,288
She started watching Jung Seok's videos.

747
00:25:30,289 --> 00:25:32,258
- But my videos kept showing up. - That's how it is.

748
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:34,058
- That's what the algorithm does. - Yes.

749
00:25:34,059 --> 00:25:36,328
She started watching the show for Jung Seok too.

750
00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:37,369
Right.

751
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:38,940
- Thank you, Jung Seok. - Right.

752
00:25:39,769 --> 00:25:41,038
Yes. Please go on.

753
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,508
Right. So we have an interesting job.

754
00:25:43,509 --> 00:25:46,179
- Yes. Right. - And I wanted to invite you too.

755
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,679
The more I watched,

756
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,150
the more I thought this show was perfect for us.

757
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,078
So now that we're here, we ought to give...

758
00:25:53,079 --> 00:25:54,850
some presents before we go.

759
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,725
(They will do the mission in a different room.)

760
00:25:56,749 --> 00:26:00,259
I wonder what kind of prize the staff prepared for today.

761
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:02,430
- Let's start with Round One. - Yes!

762
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,960
All right.

763
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,929
- Round One. - It's the most modest one.

764
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:06,930
Let's start with Round One.

765
00:26:06,931 --> 00:26:08,359
- It's in there. - What could it be? I'm curious.

766
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,370
(Curious)

767
00:26:09,529 --> 00:26:12,239
"Bring your fatigued noses to the forest."

768
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,439
"Matching hiking shoes from The North Face."

769
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,869
(Round 1: Matching hiking shoes)

770
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:18,339
- This is amazing. - Hiking shoes.

771
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,679
- Hiking shoes. - I see.

772
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,109
- That's great for the first prize. - My gosh.

773
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,508
- This is a nice prize. - Yes.

774
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:24,048
- Matching hiking shoes. - We're off to a great start.

775
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,369
- My gosh. There are two pairs. - This is a great present.

776
00:26:26,779 --> 00:26:28,919
I go hiking a lot with my husband.

777
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,218
- Really? - That's why.

778
00:26:30,219 --> 00:26:31,548
- It's the perfect prize for her. - This is great.

779
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,120
They prepared the perfect prize.

780
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,090
The North Face is a great brand.

781
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,359
(The matching hiking shoes are at stake in this mission.)

782
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,758
(Gonggi Shooting)

783
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,199
(They will take turns flicking 1 gonggi pebble.)

784
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,828
(To win the prize, they must knock down the markers.)

785
00:26:44,829 --> 00:26:48,400
(Round 1: Knock down 3 markers.)

786
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,538
We have to use the gonggi pebble to knock down the markers.

787
00:26:50,539 --> 00:26:52,068
We have to knock them down?

788
00:26:52,069 --> 00:26:53,356
(The target markers, Starting line)

789
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,356
- Let's say I go first. - She can knock all of them down.

790
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,650
- And it ended up here. - Yes.

791
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,910
- The next player... - And the second person goes?

792
00:26:58,950 --> 00:26:59,979
Right.

793
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,479
- Like this. - I see. Like that?

794
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,419
But the gonggi pebble can't go outside the desk?

795
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,759
Then it's out.

796
00:27:06,390 --> 00:27:08,018
It'd be nice to start while knocking down a marker.

797
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:09,728
- Like that. Then... - Okay. Then...

798
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:10,758
Make sure it doesn't go out.

799
00:27:10,759 --> 00:27:11,828
- I'll flick it this way. - You can hit two markers...

800
00:27:11,829 --> 00:27:12,900
if you play it right.

801
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,359
- It fell off. - It can't fall off the desk.

802
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,068
(Coach Pak scolds him right away.)

803
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:19,200
- Coach. - Coach.

804
00:27:20,069 --> 00:27:21,268
- Coach. - He told us that.

805
00:27:21,269 --> 00:27:22,538
- Listen. - It can't fall off.

806
00:27:22,539 --> 00:27:24,308
- If it does, it's over. - So...

807
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,369
He's not good at these games.

808
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:26,778
(Struggling)

809
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,450
Why do you keep doing that? He said that wouldn't count.

810
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:31,380
You have to flick it gently.

811
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,919
- Gosh. When did you guys come? - You have to flick it gently.

812
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,488
- They came to cheer for you. - I see.

813
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,849
(The cheering squad of colleagues)

814
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,620
(Suddenly smiling)

815
00:27:40,621 --> 00:27:41,759
Hello.

816
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,130
(Yeon Seok practices.)

817
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,399
You did it.

818
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,029
(Cheering loudly)

819
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,399
(Yoo One Shot knocks down the marker at once.)

820
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,600
- Then I can go next. - Coach.

821
00:27:51,769 --> 00:27:53,339
- This is good, right? - Should I go this way?

822
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,600
That's the first step.

823
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,940
- The 2nd step. - The 2nd step.

824
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:57,768
(Se Ri will practice next.)

825
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,049
I was only trained to play golf.

826
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,440
(Flicking)

827
00:28:03,309 --> 00:28:04,380
Come on.

828
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:05,950
(Embarrassed)

829
00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:08,278
- What was that, Coach? - I've never played this before.

830
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:10,488
You said you were good at hitting dead balls.

831
00:28:10,489 --> 00:28:11,689
(Timid flicking compared to her bold coaching)

832
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,989
Then it won't be easy to finish it.

833
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:16,789
I told you not to make it fall. Come on.

834
00:28:17,059 --> 00:28:18,488
- It's hard not to make it fall off. - This isn't easy.

835
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,728
This is a difficult one.

836
00:28:19,729 --> 00:28:20,899
It's really hard.

837
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,200
- The 1st player must knock down 1. - Just 1 marker.

838
00:28:23,229 --> 00:28:24,899
I just have to make sure it lands in the front, right?

839
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,346
- I just have to get it close. - This is hard.

840
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:28,299
- Too short. It didn't work. - Coach. That's...

841
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,509
- Yes. You must get it close. - Then the second player...

842
00:28:31,969 --> 00:28:33,009
Darn it.

843
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,610
It's not working.

844
00:28:34,809 --> 00:28:35,849
Hold on.

845
00:28:35,850 --> 00:28:38,209
(The golf hero can't get the hang of it.)

846
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,548
- Please. - This is hard.

847
00:28:39,549 --> 00:28:40,880
- Please. - Let's practice.

848
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,789
- Like this. Then... - I...

849
00:28:46,019 --> 00:28:47,059
Coach.

850
00:28:47,519 --> 00:28:48,519
This is out then.

851
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,400
- It's hard to even start. - This is difficult.

852
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,460
I can't get it close to the markers.
(She fails.)

853
00:28:52,461 --> 00:28:55,130
- I'm feeling timid now. - Coach, just flick it 200m.

854
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,869
- Just drive it 200m. - Coach.

855
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,469
- The distance of 210. - Yes.

856
00:29:02,309 --> 00:29:03,840
- That's it. Great. - Yes.

857
00:29:04,809 --> 00:29:07,979
(The distance coaching was effective.)

858
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:12,278
- Great. - I see. No need to hit it hard.

859
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,795
- I knew she could do it. - That's amazing.

860
00:29:13,819 --> 00:29:15,119
- No need to hit it hard. - No need to hit it hard.

861
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,988
Coach, I think you figured out the sense of distance now.

862
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:18,389
I'm not sure. I'll know once I try.

863
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,059
Great. Your last two shots were great.

864
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,090
- If... - Hit the one in the front.

865
00:29:22,529 --> 00:29:23,860
- Okay. - This one.

866
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,130
Hit that.

867
00:29:25,131 --> 00:29:26,799
That's it! Then it works.

868
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,400
(A strategy to use the fallen marker)

869
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,228
(This is doable.)

870
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:34,369
- Then we can succeed. - Let's give it a try.

871
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,110
All right. Let's try it for the first time.

872
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,269
This is hard. I hope we succeed on our first try.

873
00:29:38,469 --> 00:29:40,679
All right. Tell me. Who will go first?

874
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,709
The first player...

875
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:42,849
- Why don't you start us off? - Me?

876
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:45,109
All right. Let's go ahead with our first try.

877
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,119
- Coach Se Ri. - Yes.

878
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,626
- Let's do a group cheer. - Let's do a group cheer.

879
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:50,149
All right. This is our 1st try. In 1, 2, 3.

880
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,288
- Let's go! - Let's go!

881
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,919
- Let's go. Our first try. - Here we go.

882
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,880
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 1.)

883
00:29:55,789 --> 00:29:56,859
(Se Ri who has gotten the sense of distance will go first.)

884
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,390
- Okay. - Great.

885
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,328
- All right, Coach. - It's...

886
00:30:00,329 --> 00:30:02,089
(Wearing the gaze of a professional athlete)

887
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:06,269
(She had just gotten the sense of distance.)

888
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,239
It didn't go out.

889
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,340
(Quite far from the markers)

890
00:30:13,539 --> 00:30:14,680
Darn it.

891
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,578
(Chuckling)

892
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:19,650
You must've been startled. You gasped.

893
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,650
(Gasping)

894
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:24,689
(Embarrassed)

895
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:26,360
- It spun that way. - Yes.

896
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,690
Well, it's still in. It's not out yet.

897
00:30:28,759 --> 00:30:29,959
- Gosh, that... - All right.

898
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,666
- It should've hit the marker. - Gosh, this...

899
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,729
- You don't have to hit it hard. - Right.

900
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,828
- Jae Suk. Aim for this. - That one.

901
00:30:35,829 --> 00:30:37,870
- I can try to hit this marker. - Right.

902
00:30:38,029 --> 00:30:39,269
- This way. - Yes.

903
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:44,710
(Too short)

904
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,710
- You got it. - Darn it.

905
00:30:46,809 --> 00:30:49,349
What? You can hit the marker. And it will knock down the others.

906
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:51,450
(A resentful gaze)

907
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:54,150
(Jae Suk didn't hit any marker.)

908
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:56,799
- Knocking down all three... - I see.

909
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,525
- Try it. You never know. - All at once...

910
00:30:58,549 --> 00:30:59,689
- Then... - Yeon Seok, if you knock down one,

911
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:00,690
it might knock down the other two.

912
00:31:00,691 --> 00:31:02,159
- I will... - Yes.

913
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,189
- I will hit this one really hard. - Right.

914
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:06,258
- But not too hard. - It will fall off the desk.

915
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:08,129
It doesn't matter. I'm the last player.

916
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,705
The pebble has to be on the desk until the end. Right?

917
00:31:09,729 --> 00:31:11,199
- It doesn't matter. - Then...

918
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:12,639
- I must hit it hard. - Hit it hard.

919
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,069
- Whatever happens... - Right.

920
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,238
- Let's see. - Go for it.

921
00:31:16,239 --> 00:31:17,816
- Should I hit it from here? - That's it.

922
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,008
- I'll make sure... - Oh, my.

923
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:20,180
(Glancing)

924
00:31:21,509 --> 00:31:23,609
(Cheering for him from the bottom of her heart)

925
00:31:23,610 --> 00:31:25,449
- Here. To the right of the marker. - Okay.

926
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:26,979
- Go for it. - I'll hit it hard!

927
00:31:28,819 --> 00:31:31,590
(Yoo One Shot delivers in a critical moment.)

928
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,160
(They failed with 1 marker remaining.)

929
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,558
The pebble broke.

930
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:41,930
- That was so close. - Gosh.

931
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,409
I hit it so hard to the point that the pebble broke.

932
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:45,768
Gosh, that was close.

933
00:31:45,769 --> 00:31:47,170
Had you knocked down just one.

934
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:50,468
Then the first player must knock down a marker.

935
00:31:50,469 --> 00:31:51,768
- Gosh, that was close. - Well, that would be ideal.

936
00:31:51,769 --> 00:31:53,639
If the marker knocks over other markers, it'd be better.

937
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,709
- So at first... - You...

938
00:31:54,710 --> 00:31:56,549
You have to make it pass through.

939
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:00,119
- That's it. Just like that. - Like this.

940
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,478
- Once you do that... - Okay. One more time.

941
00:32:01,479 --> 00:32:03,019
Don't touch that.

942
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,019
- Okay. - Let me practice.

943
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,690
- Use that. - Right. Like this.

944
00:32:10,829 --> 00:32:12,798
- That's it. - It fell down. So...

945
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,629
- No. If you did this instead... - Coach.

946
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,029
- It was here, right? - Right.

947
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:18,169
Let's say you hit the blue one. The black one will spin.

948
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,670
Then it can knock over the red one.

949
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,899
- Try it. - Try it.

950
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,538
- I mean, it's easy to say... - That might work...

951
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:24,539
if you hit it hard.

952
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,340
If you hit it hard.

953
00:32:26,579 --> 00:32:27,779
- Gosh. Like that. - I see.

954
00:32:28,239 --> 00:32:29,278
If you hit it hard.

955
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,279
(Successfully spinning the marker)

956
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,308
(It got close, but she fails.)

957
00:32:32,309 --> 00:32:34,278
- Gosh. Like that. - Right. Hit it harder.

958
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:36,650
- Great. - Yes.

959
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,620
My gosh. So spinning the marker...

960
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:41,488
All right. We'll go with the second try.

961
00:32:41,489 --> 00:32:43,058
- Yes. - In 1, 2, 3.

962
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,089
- Here we go! - Good luck!

963
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,210
- Hit at least 1 marker. - We must win the 1st prize.

964
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,400
Seriously.

965
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,069
It must go straight, but it doesn't go how I want.

966
00:32:53,069 --> 00:32:54,140
There.

967
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,839
(She must either hit a marker or get close to them.)

968
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,839
Coach, you have a long routine.

969
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,179
- Usually, I don't. - Coach.

970
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,379
- You see, - Yes.

971
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,778
You must hit the dead pebble.

972
00:33:01,779 --> 00:33:03,110
- Right. - You know that, right?

973
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:05,279
Here I go.

974
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,748
(She couldn't hit the marker, but she got it close to them.)

975
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:11,548
- It's okay. It's not bad. - It's not bad.

976
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:13,318
- So... - It's close to the markers.

977
00:33:13,319 --> 00:33:15,120
- Should I go? - Okay. You go.

978
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,860
- That's our second try. - Then...

979
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:20,528
I don't need to be greedy. No need to hit it hard.

980
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:21,798
(He must knock over more than 1 marker.)

981
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:23,228
- Let me try this. - Go ahead.

982
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:24,299
Here I go.

983
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:32,979
- You did it. - Great.

984
00:33:33,509 --> 00:33:34,639
- Great. - I think we might have a shot.

985
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,478
- It was moderately strong. - That's good.

986
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,748
If we were playing pool,

987
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:38,978
- this is the basic layout. - It's perfect.

988
00:33:38,979 --> 00:33:40,578
It's perfect. If you hit this one, it will knock over the last one.

989
00:33:40,579 --> 00:33:42,718
You have to hit the left side. You know what I mean, right?

990
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,359
- I must hit the left side, right? - Yes.

991
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:46,788
- I must hit this side. - Yes.

992
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:47,959
(Aiming to knock down 2 markers by hitting the blue marker)

993
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,630
- So they knock down each other. - Right.

994
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,489
(Sighing)

995
00:33:53,229 --> 00:33:54,259
You can hit it hard.

996
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,728
(Exhaling)

997
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:58,069
You must hit at least one.

998
00:33:59,539 --> 00:34:01,798
(If both markers fall down, they will have succeeded.)

999
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:02,870
I think you can do it.

1000
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:05,239
I think you can do it.

1001
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,579
I think you can do it.

1002
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,720
(He knocks down the rest of the markers!)

1003
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:14,949
(Hitting the blue marker)

1004
00:34:15,579 --> 00:34:18,220
(He uses the marker to knock down the last marker.)

1005
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,589
(Jae Suk did it!)

1006
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:24,888
I told you!

1007
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:26,428
(They successfully finish Round 1 only after 2 tries!)

1008
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,769
- Let's go! - Yes!

1009
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:33,499
- What a thrill! - My gosh.

1010
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,399
- Great. - Our calculation was spot on.

1011
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,908
My gosh, yes. Our calculation was spot on.

1012
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,909
Right.

1013
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:40,808
So you're good at pool.

1014
00:34:40,809 --> 00:34:42,509
- My gosh. - Do you play pool?

1015
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,510
My average is 80.

1016
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,448
All right. With this, we completed...

1017
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,649
- Round 1. - Round 1.

1018
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:50,049
(They won the matching hiking shoes from The North Face.)

1019
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:53,719
Stopping here would be a waste now.

1020
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,489
- Well... - Yes.

1021
00:34:55,490 --> 00:34:56,989
We have a lot of tries left.

1022
00:34:56,990 --> 00:34:59,729
But if you're happy with the hiking shoes,

1023
00:34:59,999 --> 00:35:01,428
- and you don't want more prizes, - You can stop then.

1024
00:35:01,429 --> 00:35:02,970
- you can stop then. - No.

1025
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,270
- I believe in you guys. - Will you keep going or stop?

1026
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:06,800
- Let's go! - Go.

1027
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,139
Then...

1028
00:35:09,199 --> 00:35:11,409
We'll be playing with the remaining tries.

1029
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:14,409
"Have a gourmet meal with your husband on a weekend."

1030
00:35:14,539 --> 00:35:16,178
"Onnuri gift certificate of 500 dollars."

1031
00:35:16,179 --> 00:35:18,478
(The traditional market voucher of 500 dollars)

1032
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:19,679
- That's amazing. - This is...

1033
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,888
- It's like getting hard cash. - My gosh.

1034
00:35:22,889 --> 00:35:24,319
(They can use the 500 dollar voucher like cash at traditional markets.)

1035
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,919
- But if we... - Good luck.

1036
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,259
(Round 2)

1037
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,690
(The formation of the markers will change.)

1038
00:35:30,889 --> 00:35:32,090
How will it change?

1039
00:35:32,229 --> 00:35:33,509
Will they be in a straight line?

1040
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,959
(It was in a triangular formation.)

1041
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,900
(It will be in a straight line.)

1042
00:35:37,499 --> 00:35:39,019
- I see. - That must be the formation.

1043
00:35:39,229 --> 00:35:40,469
- Is that harder? - That's hard.

1044
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,599
That's harder.

1045
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,670
- But the rules are the same? - Yes.

1046
00:35:43,869 --> 00:35:45,269
- We can hit it three times? - Yes.

1047
00:35:45,769 --> 00:35:47,210
I see. Is that harder?

1048
00:35:47,539 --> 00:35:48,740
I see. They're in a line.

1049
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:51,155
But we could knock them down at once if we do it right.

1050
00:35:51,179 --> 00:35:52,210
Right.

1051
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,650
- Is that harder? - We could finish it at once.

1052
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:56,389
- Should we practice? - So...

1053
00:35:57,249 --> 00:35:58,748
As long as it goes down straight...

1054
00:35:58,749 --> 00:36:00,118
- Right. - You could knock down all three.

1055
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,159
- Yes. - Yes.

1056
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:03,760
(He fails.)

1057
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:05,259
- You try it, Coach. - This is hard.

1058
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,099
How can I make it go down straight?

1059
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,829
I can't hit the markers.

1060
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:13,138
- That's good enough. - That's good.

1061
00:36:13,139 --> 00:36:15,240
That could totally work.

1062
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,070
Great.

1063
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:18,779
Coach, your sense of distance is perfect.

1064
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,478
- Well, for the sense of distance, - Yes.

1065
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:21,539
She's the best.

1066
00:36:22,309 --> 00:36:23,650
You got it, Coach.

1067
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:26,018
You got it, Coach.

1068
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,649
(It was going down straight. And then it suddenly spun.)

1069
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,618
- You got it, Coach. - Darn it. Why did that spin?

1070
00:36:29,619 --> 00:36:30,690
Coach.

1071
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:32,690
- Why did it suddenly curve? - How...

1072
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,990
You curved it.

1073
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,860
- Do your balls usually curve? - Yes.

1074
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,239
Should I look more this way when I hit it?

1075
00:36:40,329 --> 00:36:41,400
That isn't bad.

1076
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,998
What is this?

1077
00:36:43,999 --> 00:36:45,570
If it falls in here, is it a bunker?

1078
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,239
(Bunker: A sandpit on a golf course)

1079
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,769
- Hazard? - Is it a hazard?

1080
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,408
- Like this. - Can it be saved if it falls in?

1081
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:53,440
No? Do we have to hit it from there?

1082
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:55,210
I'll go like this.

1083
00:36:55,479 --> 00:36:57,610
Okay. The fourth try.

1084
00:36:58,179 --> 00:36:59,248
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1085
00:36:59,249 --> 00:37:00,280
Here we go.

1086
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:03,349
The black one is not in line.

1087
00:37:04,749 --> 00:37:07,190
(Burning up with competitive spirit)

1088
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:09,860
- This way. - Of course.

1089
00:37:11,429 --> 00:37:12,869
No. It needs to be a bit more right.

1090
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,900
- Calm down, Coach Pak. - It's not in line.

1091
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:17,900
- Coach Pak. - What?

1092
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,880
For this, we need the people from Korea Criticism Corporation.

1093
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:23,869
- You can do it. - I'll go.

1094
00:37:25,269 --> 00:37:26,538
(She won't even accept a single piece of dust.)

1095
00:37:26,539 --> 00:37:28,909
- The distance from earlier... - It was just right.

1096
00:37:28,979 --> 00:37:31,019
- Then the next person can go. - It was just right.

1097
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:32,380
Okay.

1098
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,579
Amazing.

1099
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,820
(Bullseye)

1100
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:41,820
Amazing.

1101
00:37:42,289 --> 00:37:43,558
- Okay. - You did it.

1102
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:45,029
(A nice shot in Daejeon, her home ground.)

1103
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,799
- That's how to do it. - Amazing.

1104
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,599
- That was great. - Oh, my.

1105
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,869
- That's how to do it. - Let's get one each.

1106
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:54,240
Jae Suk. Nothing more or less. Just one each.

1107
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:56,709
- Let's not get too greedy. - Then should I get one?

1108
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,909
- I hit one. - Go, Yeon Seok.

1109
00:37:59,039 --> 00:38:00,340
You can get both.

1110
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,578
Just one... If so,

1111
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,248
I won't try to get this one.

1112
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,219
- I'll try to hit this on the right. - Okay. Nice.

1113
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,650
- That's my plan. - Nice.

1114
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,320
- It can't go out. - Let's go!

1115
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,618
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1116
00:38:14,619 --> 00:38:16,289
- If you're too loud... - You scared him.

1117
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:19,159
- You scared him. - I was addressing the ball.

1118
00:38:19,329 --> 00:38:21,049
- You can do it. Okay. - You can't do that.

1119
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:22,558
- Were you? - Yes, I was addressing the ball.

1120
00:38:22,559 --> 00:38:23,899
You scared him.

1121
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,570
- I will address the ball now. - Okay.

1122
00:38:30,139 --> 00:38:34,210
(They need to get 1 each to succeed.)

1123
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,919
- Oh, but it fell in the hazard. - Oh, no.

1124
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,690
- It fell in the hazard. - Oh, no.

1125
00:38:49,559 --> 00:38:51,928
(It fell in the pit.)

1126
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:53,530
- It fell in the hazard. - Oh, no.

1127
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,498
- It fell in the hazard. - The hazard...

1128
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,729
(The next hitter feels hopeless.)

1129
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,070
- You need to save this one. - Oh, no.

1130
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:02,615
This would normally be considered ground under repair.

1131
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:04,408
- It's ground under repair. - Right. It's ground under repair.

1132
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,808
Even in golf, this is ground under repair.

1133
00:39:05,809 --> 00:39:06,929
This is ground under repair.

1134
00:39:07,309 --> 00:39:08,739
You should've gotten a table...

1135
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:10,149
- without this. - Exactly.

1136
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:12,078
- This is ground under repair. - You should've hit it more gently.

1137
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,719
No, this is ground under repair.

1138
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,819
Hurry up and relieve this.

1139
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,880
Get this out.

1140
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,089
I'm right.

1141
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:19,558
They said we had to play as is.

1142
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,919
It's basically a bunker.

1143
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:21,989
(Accepting it quickly)

1144
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:23,789
- A bunker. - Oh, gosh. This is...

1145
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,530
Can this really come out?

1146
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,929
- I think it will. - Jae Suk.

1147
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:29,828
- If you just it hard... - Right.

1148
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,198
- and get it somewhere around here, - Right.

1149
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:33,070
- it'll fall and do that, right? - Okay.

1150
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,538
No matter what,

1151
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:36,840
just hit it hard somewhere here.

1152
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:42,179
(This is our chance!)

1153
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,549
- You can do it. - If it's too hard...

1154
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,690
- I thought that might happen. - Oh, goodness.

1155
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,255
(Bouncing off)

1156
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,889
(Fail)

1157
00:39:54,089 --> 00:39:56,960
- Well... - Why did you put it in here?

1158
00:39:57,659 --> 00:39:59,860
Why did you put it in here, Yeon Seok?

1159
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,230
Well, I...

1160
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,590
- Why did you put it in here? - Do it again.

1161
00:40:04,330 --> 00:40:06,599
Right. You have to let him do that again, don't you think?

1162
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,840
- No? - Why did this come back?

1163
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:11,008
You really flicked that.

1164
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,539
Oh, that's disappointing.

1165
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:14,408
- You really flicked it. - We just talked about it,

1166
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:15,880
and it went in there.

1167
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:18,009
Hey, with things like this,

1168
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,949
we need to use the bonus now.

1169
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:22,295
- Let's use it... Right. - Let's use it once and calm down.

1170
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,619
- Okay. We'll use it. - We need to use it now.

1171
00:40:24,790 --> 00:40:26,159
You, as the guest,

1172
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,690
can choose one person to take a break.

1173
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:32,428
- Please name 1 person. - You can switch with 1 person.

1174
00:40:32,429 --> 00:40:33,629
- You need to be objective. - Yes.

1175
00:40:33,630 --> 00:40:36,170
- You can look at us in the eye. - Yes.

1176
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:40,100
(Clearly looking)

1177
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:44,239
I think she looked at you.

1178
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:47,639
- I thought... - Wait.

1179
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,650
(That's correct.)

1180
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,850
I succeeded in Round One.

1181
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:55,178
- But just now... - Okay.

1182
00:40:55,179 --> 00:40:56,290
That's fine.

1183
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,729
- You can practice a bit. - Go ahead and practice a bit.

1184
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,190
(Let's go, Sang Hui.)

1185
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,919
- I hope we get a miracle. - Let's go.

1186
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,829
- Get a feel for the distance. - Okay.

1187
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,029
- Yes. - The distance.

1188
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:06,459
- About that much. - About that much.

1189
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,559
- Try more. - Okay.

1190
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,680
You can practice a bit more.

1191
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,028
- Nice. - That was just right.

1192
00:41:12,029 --> 00:41:13,169
(Her distance is just right.)

1193
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:14,170
It went quite far.

1194
00:41:14,171 --> 00:41:15,539
Should I go first?

1195
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,815
- Would you like to go first? - Let's go!

1196
00:41:16,839 --> 00:41:18,068
- Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3.

1197
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:19,149
- Here we go! - Here we go!

1198
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:20,909
Oh, my gosh.

1199
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:22,948
(Bonus coupon round)

1200
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,810
(Whenever Guest, Sang Hui's first try)

1201
00:41:26,779 --> 00:41:28,179
- That's good. - Oh, nice!

1202
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:31,189
(A good spot)

1203
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,448
- That's quite good. - Yes.

1204
00:41:32,449 --> 00:41:33,460
That's enough.

1205
00:41:33,659 --> 00:41:34,818
Nice shot.

1206
00:41:34,819 --> 00:41:36,330
What should I do?

1207
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,730
(Nervous)

1208
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,399
- If you get 1 of these 2, - These 2?

1209
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,560
- Coach Pak. - we'll be okay.

1210
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,559
Let's go.

1211
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,630
A bit...

1212
00:41:43,699 --> 00:41:45,270
(Shaking)

1213
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,369
They could fall like dominoes.

1214
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:50,810
There we go. Oh, my.

1215
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,638
(It barely stayed on.)

1216
00:41:54,639 --> 00:41:56,250
There we go. Oh, my.

1217
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,850
Oh, hold on.

1218
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:59,779
You have to hit this hard.

1219
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,849
- In this case... - If I hit this spot,

1220
00:42:01,850 --> 00:42:03,419
- It'll go that way. - this one will hit this,

1221
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,448
- and this could hit that. - Exactly.

1222
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:06,488
Right here.

1223
00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:07,859
- Right here. - This line here.

1224
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,020
Here. Right here.

1225
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:10,189
Let's go!

1226
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,690
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1227
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:13,999
- Let's go! - It's so hard.

1228
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,830
Hard!

1229
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:17,029
Just hard.

1230
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:18,830
Okay.

1231
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,655
- It went all the way over there. - It's over there.

1232
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:29,979
- There? - Where did it go?

1233
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,509
(Hitting 0 birds with 1 stone again)

1234
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,679
- Where... - Hold on.

1235
00:42:34,949 --> 00:42:37,750
(They failed the bonus round.)

1236
00:42:37,949 --> 00:42:39,249
You should at least hit it.

1237
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:41,319
You didn't hit it either.

1238
00:42:41,719 --> 00:42:42,789
I can practice, right?

1239
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:44,190
Coach Pak.

1240
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,199
(Practicing while they're fighting)

1241
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,029
- I want to practice. - Hold on.

1242
00:42:51,770 --> 00:42:53,338
It's not going in the middle.

1243
00:42:53,339 --> 00:42:55,016
- How do I get it in the middle? - Oh, goodness.

1244
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,540
She practices so diligently.

1245
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:59,139
I think you should definitely go first.

1246
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:00,880
It's nice to have you start.

1247
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,580
(Slightly from the side)

1248
00:43:07,549 --> 00:43:08,949
(She hit 2 at once!)

1249
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,549
- Look. - Oh, that side...

1250
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,488
- is kind of... - It's this side.

1251
00:43:14,489 --> 00:43:15,889
(Coach Pak's new side strategy)

1252
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,760
- It's kind of... - This side?

1253
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,829
- The view from here is nice. - You can go from this side too.

1254
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:22,460
- Try it. - I think that's better.

1255
00:43:23,429 --> 00:43:24,500
- Exactly. - Oh, my.

1256
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:26,000
From the side.

1257
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:28,099
(Yeon Seok hit 2 birds with 1 stone from the side too!)

1258
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,940
The side is better if you hit it.

1259
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:32,739
- If it hits, it gets two. - Oh, gosh.

1260
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:34,690
- First, we should... - Oh, gosh. You're all...

1261
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,079
(Eyes full of expectation)

1262
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:39,209
You can do it!

1263
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:41,818
Okay. Forget the odor for a moment.

1264
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:43,420
"Forget the odor for a moment."

1265
00:43:43,489 --> 00:43:45,218
- Nice. - Coach Pak or Yeon Seok.

1266
00:43:45,219 --> 00:43:47,219
One of you two should start.

1267
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:49,290
This is the sixth try.

1268
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,489
Do you want to go first?

1269
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:52,365
- Okay. Coach Pak will go first. - Me? Oh, gosh.

1270
00:43:52,389 --> 00:43:53,798
- But... - This is our sixth try.

1271
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,399
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - Let's go!

1272
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:56,400
Here we go.

1273
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,638
(Will the side strategy work in the real game?)

1274
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,399
The issue is that this doesn't go straight.

1275
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,968
Are you sure about this?

1276
00:44:03,969 --> 00:44:05,310
This seems harder.

1277
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,609
Like this.

1278
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,650
(Just like how I practiced)

1279
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,509
- Let's go. - Please.

1280
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:14,549
- Let's go. - Please.

1281
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,219
Please.

1282
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:17,389
No!

1283
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:23,230
(It fell off?)

1284
00:44:24,130 --> 00:44:25,159
No!

1285
00:44:27,860 --> 00:44:30,270
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

1286
00:44:31,730 --> 00:44:32,730
(Laughing)

1287
00:44:32,731 --> 00:44:35,040
I don't think I said, "Here I go."

1288
00:44:35,699 --> 00:44:36,909
I didn't say, "Here I go."

1289
00:44:37,739 --> 00:44:39,109
- You did. - Really?

1290
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,679
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1291
00:44:41,909 --> 00:44:43,379
If you're going to be like that, I'm going to leave.

1292
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:44,678
I'm going to leave the shoot.

1293
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:45,679
Coach Pak.

1294
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,049
Why?

1295
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,019
I told you to do it from over here.

1296
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,580
It would've still fallen off the table.

1297
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:52,818
(Scratching)

1298
00:44:52,819 --> 00:44:54,118
- So, this is our seventh try? - Wait...

1299
00:44:54,119 --> 00:44:55,719
It's the 7th try. We have 4 tries left.

1300
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,960
Okay. The 7th try. In 1, 2, 3.

1301
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:59,359
- Here we go. - Here we go. I'll go.

1302
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,429
- Go ahead. - I'll go.

1303
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:01,959
Coach Pak is...

1304
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,429
She's very disappointed right now.

1305
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:04,780
She's not in her best condition.

1306
00:45:06,469 --> 00:45:07,639
She sat down.

1307
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,380
If things really don't work out, you can take your socks off.

1308
00:45:12,770 --> 00:45:14,139
Okay. Let's go.

1309
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,380
I got a feel for this earlier.

1310
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:18,249
(Yeon Seok got a feel for the side strategy.)

1311
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,310
It's here.

1312
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,500
I don't need to be nervous.

1313
00:45:26,219 --> 00:45:27,420
I knew it. Darn it.

1314
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:30,428
(It falls off again.)

1315
00:45:30,429 --> 00:45:31,730
I knew it. Darn it.

1316
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:35,699
- I knew it. - Gosh.

1317
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:41,000
(Glancing)

1318
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:43,238
Come on.

1319
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:44,508
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1320
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:47,110
I told you not to hit it from the side.

1321
00:45:47,139 --> 00:45:49,186
I don't think we should hit it from the side, Coach.

1322
00:45:49,210 --> 00:45:50,949
It's the same wherever you start.

1323
00:45:52,279 --> 00:45:53,750
- It was OB. - Let's see.

1324
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,049
- Should I go first? - This is bad.

1325
00:45:56,119 --> 00:45:57,349
In 1, 2, 3.

1326
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,448
- Here we go. - Here we go.

1327
00:45:58,449 --> 00:45:59,759
(They try again right away.)

1328
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,420
(Jae Suk is up first.)

1329
00:46:07,730 --> 00:46:09,250
It's okay. That's better than falling.

1330
00:46:10,569 --> 00:46:11,698
(It's still doable.)

1331
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:12,729
Why did it land so close?

1332
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:13,739
Coach.

1333
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,040
It doesn't matter who goes first.

1334
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:17,890
- You try, Yeon Seok. - Okay, I'll go next.

1335
00:46:18,409 --> 00:46:20,309
- I'll hit it lightly. - This is...

1336
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,579
- I'll try to hit it here. - If you hit it here,

1337
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,179
you may be able to get all three.

1338
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,150
Please let me get one without it falling.

1339
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:27,880
It can't fall.

1340
00:46:28,949 --> 00:46:29,988
I can't hit it too hard.

1341
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:32,190
(Please hit the marker.)

1342
00:46:37,190 --> 00:46:39,159
(Shaking)

1343
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:41,928
(It hit the marker.)

1344
00:46:41,929 --> 00:46:45,000
(But it didn't fall.)

1345
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:51,368
- This is... - Coach.

1346
00:46:51,369 --> 00:46:52,409
Coach Pak.

1347
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,609
If you hit it hard, it'll fall off for sure.

1348
00:46:54,610 --> 00:46:55,610
Coach.

1349
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:59,049
Hit the outer part of the red marker.

1350
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,250
You have to do what I did earlier.

1351
00:47:01,650 --> 00:47:02,920
- Do what I did. - You...

1352
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:04,989
Good luck.

1353
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:06,419
Good luck.

1354
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,989
Isn't that practically magic?

1355
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,088
(Magical Princess Se Ri has come)

1356
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,900
(She came to earth from a star)

1357
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,798
(Se Ri)

1358
00:47:17,799 --> 00:47:19,468
I don't think hitting it hard is the key.

1359
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:20,469
- You have to hit it hard. - You have to hit it hard.

1360
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:22,146
- Will that make it fall over? - Yes, you have to hit it hard.

1361
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:23,509
This is the last try.

1362
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:25,209
- Just go for it. - Here.

1363
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,139
- Yes, there. - Don't think too hard.

1364
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,409
(She has to take down the 2 markers to succeed.)

1365
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:34,279
- Please. - It worked well earlier.

1366
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:35,718
Okay.

1367
00:47:35,719 --> 00:47:38,389
(Please hit it.)

1368
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:40,919
Which finger should I use?

1369
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:41,959
(Nervous)

1370
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:42,989
Here I go.

1371
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,489
One, two, three.

1372
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:49,600
One, two, three.

1373
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,299
(Falling into the chair)

1374
00:47:53,799 --> 00:47:57,369
(Laughing)

1375
00:47:59,239 --> 00:48:01,138
Darn it.

1376
00:48:01,139 --> 00:48:02,379
(Magical Princess Se Ri fails.)

1377
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,009
Why won't this work?

1378
00:48:05,610 --> 00:48:07,080
Why won't this work?

1379
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,548
(She is highly competitive and tries it again.)

1380
00:48:10,549 --> 00:48:11,850
Earlier, this was...

1381
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:13,420
This is...

1382
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,219
- That's it. - That's right!

1383
00:48:18,259 --> 00:48:20,559
You know what?

1384
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,469
The corner of...

1385
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,730
Forget it.

1386
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:27,500
I know what you mean, Coach.

1387
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,940
It had to hit the marker in the center.

1388
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:33,309
(Upset)

1389
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:34,940
It's okay, Coach.

1390
00:48:35,139 --> 00:48:36,210
Are you okay, Coach?

1391
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:38,610
I have so much anger these days.

1392
00:48:40,449 --> 00:48:42,218
- I'll sit. - Coach.

1393
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,218
- Mind control. - You need to get it together.

1394
00:48:44,219 --> 00:48:46,758
You have to control your mind well while playing golf.

1395
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:47,860
Wait.

1396
00:48:48,119 --> 00:48:50,190
- Calm down. - What should we do?

1397
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,388
We have one try left.

1398
00:48:51,389 --> 00:48:52,789
- What are we to do? - It's okay.

1399
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,698
- Are you okay? - Are you sure?

1400
00:48:54,699 --> 00:48:55,899
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1401
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,429
It's not okay.

1402
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,600
- Come on. - What should we do?

1403
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,170
This is worse than the odors.

1404
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,638
- It stinks the worst. - It's the worst.

1405
00:49:06,639 --> 00:49:07,779
Let me practice once.

1406
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:09,479
I'll just take it closer.

1407
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,048
Their faces have gotten darker.

1408
00:49:11,049 --> 00:49:12,710
It's become more difficult.

1409
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:16,218
It's become more difficult.

1410
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:17,949
(One shot, one kill)

1411
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:19,888
- What happened? - Let's try.

1412
00:49:19,889 --> 00:49:20,919
(Yeon Seok is surprised too.)

1413
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,159
Let's try it. Here we go.

1414
00:49:22,389 --> 00:49:24,028
- I think it's better... - Okay.

1415
00:49:24,029 --> 00:49:25,189
- to start from a closer spot. - All right.

1416
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:26,289
First...

1417
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,005
We'll start quickly since we don't have much time.

1418
00:49:28,029 --> 00:49:29,436
- Bring the pebble closer. - Here we go.

1419
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,528
This is the last try.

1420
00:49:30,529 --> 00:49:33,298
We'll do our best.

1421
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:35,338
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1422
00:49:35,339 --> 00:49:36,368
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their last try.)

1423
00:49:36,369 --> 00:49:37,369
(It is over if they fail this time.)

1424
00:49:37,370 --> 00:49:38,809
- This is so difficult. - I know.

1425
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,810
- Coach Pak will go first. - It's so difficult.

1426
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:42,739
Why can't I hit it?

1427
00:49:43,179 --> 00:49:45,049
Why is it so difficult?

1428
00:49:46,310 --> 00:49:49,150
(Show us, Coach Pak.)

1429
00:49:49,989 --> 00:49:52,219
Like this.

1430
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,319
Like this.

1431
00:49:54,589 --> 00:49:55,659
Not bad.

1432
00:49:56,420 --> 00:49:57,429
Like this.

1433
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,489
(The pebble is close.)

1434
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,029
(It's worth a try.)

1435
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:03,500
Yeon Seok.

1436
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:05,330
- Me? - Yes.

1437
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,298
This is hard.

1438
00:50:08,299 --> 00:50:09,638
(Yeon Seok, who succeeded in getting them at once, is up next.)

1439
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,909
- I'll try to get rid of 2. - At least 2.

1440
00:50:12,040 --> 00:50:13,210
If I can just get rid of two.

1441
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:19,249
(Please.)

1442
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:22,880
(Let us see the miracle of Yoo One Shot.)

1443
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:24,318
I don't have to hit it hard.

1444
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,049
(I don't have to hit it hard.)

1445
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,758
Let's go.

1446
00:50:27,759 --> 00:50:29,389
This is too much pressure on me.

1447
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:31,429
Please.

1448
00:50:31,659 --> 00:50:34,199
(Everyone is hoping for it to end with one shot.)

1449
00:50:36,799 --> 00:50:39,100
- Jae Suk! You just have to spin it. - Spin it.

1450
00:50:41,739 --> 00:50:42,838
- Jae Suk! - Spin it.

1451
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:44,868
(The spin strategy?)

1452
00:50:44,869 --> 00:50:47,009
- Hit it to spin it. - You just have to spin it.

1453
00:50:48,610 --> 00:50:52,380
(The spin strategy Coach Pak discovered earlier)

1454
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:54,980
Like that.

1455
00:50:54,981 --> 00:50:58,549
(The strategy that can take 2 down with 1 try)

1456
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:00,588
- Jae Suk! - Spin it.

1457
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:02,919
(It's time.)

1458
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,840
- Hit it to spin it. - You just have to spin it.

1459
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:06,060
Jae Suk.

1460
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:07,999
It's lying down.

1461
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,069
- Jae Suk. - Yoo Jae Suk.

1462
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:12,629
- Yoo Jae Suk. - Yoo Jae Suk.

1463
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,239
(The only person left is Yoo Jae Suk.)

1464
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:17,508
(It's in a perfect position.)

1465
00:51:17,509 --> 00:51:19,610
- Hit it and spin it. - We got this.

1466
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,109
- Spin it. - Gosh.

1467
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:22,179
(Taking deep breaths)

1468
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:24,309
It's a miracle.

1469
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,379
(Give me miraculous strength.)

1470
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:28,218
- You know what to do, right? - It's a miracle.

1471
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,650
It's a miracle if I do this.

1472
00:51:30,119 --> 00:51:31,150
Go for it.

1473
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:33,119
How did it end up like this?

1474
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:34,860
- I think it'll work. - Please.

1475
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:36,860
I think it'll work.

1476
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:40,759
Please.

1477
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,170
Please.

1478
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,250
(The end)

1479
00:52:02,650 --> 00:52:04,189
The red marker flew so far away.

1480
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,319
Why did you hesitate?

1481
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:09,190
- It could've... - You could've hit it so...

1482
00:52:10,529 --> 00:52:11,758
You could've hit it so...

1483
00:52:11,759 --> 00:52:13,759
(She isn't able to finish her sentence.)

1484
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,299
It was an amazing chance.

1485
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,599
(Retrieving the presents)

1486
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,439
- No. - No.

1487
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,810
(He can't even look at them.)

1488
00:52:24,139 --> 00:52:26,039
- Gosh. - Was it here?

1489
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,580
It was here like this.

1490
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,510
Do we really have nothing for them?

1491
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,080
We have souvenirs.

1492
00:52:34,750 --> 00:52:36,419
(You give it to her, Coach.)

1493
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,520
I'm sorry.

1494
00:52:37,889 --> 00:52:39,089
Thank you.

1495
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,619
I'm sorry.

1496
00:52:41,719 --> 00:52:42,920
- Thank you. - I...

1497
00:52:43,659 --> 00:52:46,960
was hoping to give you clean air since you always smell bad odors...

1498
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,699
- while you work. - Me too.

1499
00:52:49,929 --> 00:52:52,330
The air is heavy here.

1500
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,269
We disappointed you.

1501
00:52:54,270 --> 00:52:56,338
- I know. This is sad. - After coming all this way.

1502
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,139
- We tried our best. - I'm sorry.

1503
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:01,479
Thank you for giving us a special and happy moment.

1504
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,149
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1505
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,310
We wish you the best.

1506
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:08,920
It's such a bitter feeling.

1507
00:53:10,389 --> 00:53:12,619
Our next Whenever Guest...

1508
00:53:13,250 --> 00:53:15,060
- is at 3pm. - At 3pm?

1509
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,029
- Let's eat first. - Where is the restaurant?

1510
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,159
Soft tofu?

1511
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:19,759
I don't have an appetite.

1512
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,659
Me, neither.

1513
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:23,198
- We should eat... - Gosh.

1514
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,730
- I need to sit. - and do better.

1515
00:53:24,799 --> 00:53:26,545
- I'll call them. - What's the name of the restaurant?

1516
00:53:26,569 --> 00:53:29,100
Why don't we just have triangle gimbap at a convenience store?

1517
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,669
(They are checking the restaurant Se Ri frequents.)

1518
00:53:31,670 --> 00:53:33,350
- Do we have to order ahead? - This is it.

1519
00:53:33,679 --> 00:53:35,719
- Wait, I'll call them. It's good. - It looks good.

1520
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,080
Stir-fried spicy pork?

1521
00:53:37,210 --> 00:53:38,278
(All ears)

1522
00:53:38,279 --> 00:53:39,309
The sign is...

1523
00:53:39,310 --> 00:53:40,979
Stir-fried spicy pork?

1524
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:43,449
They have stir-fried spicy pork and spicy braised chicken.

1525
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,226
- I'll have stir-fried spicy pork. - Do they have sarcodon mushroom?

1526
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,460
Yes, it's in Guam-dong.

1527
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,029
Who are you calling?

1528
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:52,410
I'm making a reservation at the restaurant.

1529
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:53,830
The food is really good.

1530
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:55,560
It's here.

1531
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,240
- Is it called Yetjeong? - Yes.

1532
00:53:57,600 --> 00:53:58,830
I know where it is.

1533
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:00,500
Do you know the restaurant?

1534
00:54:00,739 --> 00:54:02,100
It must be popular.

1535
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,540
- Coach Pak. - Yes?

1536
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,540
The parks are so nice here.

1537
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,599
- They are, aren't they? - There are many parks.

1538
00:54:09,710 --> 00:54:10,710
That's right.

1539
00:54:10,711 --> 00:54:13,778
They developed the stream and made trails along it.

1540
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:15,778
- I see. - It's...

1541
00:54:15,779 --> 00:54:19,448
quite a long trail now.

1542
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:20,789
(There is a trail and road along the 3 streams of Daejeon.)

1543
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:22,719
- Daejeon is quiet. - I can see that.

1544
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:24,988
- Even in downtown. - It's a nice place to live.

1545
00:54:24,989 --> 00:54:26,059
- Right? - Yes, it is.

1546
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:29,330
I'm not sure if that's why, but the people here are relaxed.

1547
00:54:30,170 --> 00:54:32,770
People from Chungcheong Province aren't impatient, are they?

1548
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:33,869
No.

1549
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:35,770
But I am.

1550
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:37,809
- I can tell. - It doesn't apply to everyone.

1551
00:54:37,810 --> 00:54:39,639
I'm impatient.

1552
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,610
Why would you do something slowly?

1553
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:44,849
(The speed racer of Daejeon)

1554
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,879
My house is on the other side of this church.

1555
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:49,579
- Over there? - Yes.

1556
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,588
- It's over there. - Behind it?

1557
00:54:51,589 --> 00:54:53,459
- Yes, behind the church. - I see.

1558
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,589
It's that one.

1559
00:54:55,290 --> 00:54:57,488
I told you taxi drivers knew my house.

1560
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,429
They know where it is even if I don't tell them.

1561
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,799
They see it as they pass by.

1562
00:55:02,830 --> 00:55:03,830
We're here.

1563
00:55:03,831 --> 00:55:04,969
- Is this it? - Yes.

1564
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,270
It has the aura of a good restaurant.

1565
00:55:08,469 --> 00:55:09,968
- It's here. - I can tell by the sign.

1566
00:55:09,969 --> 00:55:11,309
We're here. Thank you.

1567
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:12,568
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1568
00:55:12,569 --> 00:55:13,610
- Bring that. - Okay.

1569
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,639
- Gosh. - Hello.

1570
00:55:15,739 --> 00:55:17,109
- Hello. - I can already tell...

1571
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:19,580
- it's a good restaurant. - The lunch rush is over, right?

1572
00:55:20,049 --> 00:55:21,618
- It has an aura. - Yes, it is.

1573
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:23,059
(The owner came out to greet Se Ri.)

1574
00:55:23,949 --> 00:55:26,249
I bragged to them about how good the food is.

1575
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,020
- It's busy. - I see.

1576
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,729
It has the aura of a good restaurant, Coach.

1577
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:34,158
- Can we have some aprons? - Aprons.

1578
00:55:34,159 --> 00:55:35,259
(Yeon Seok sees something.)

1579
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,968
Yeon Seok.

1580
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:40,069
There is a photo of Se Ri here.

1581
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:42,269
The food is really good.

1582
00:55:42,270 --> 00:55:43,838
(Se Ri's autograph, Photo with the owner, Drawing, Magazine photo)

1583
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:45,540
This...

1584
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:48,810
The owner drew it.

1585
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,679
He drew someone else.

1586
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,349
It seems to be a hobby of his.

1587
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,755
(He takes a look at the other drawings as well.)

1588
00:55:54,779 --> 00:55:56,888
He did a good job of drawing him.

1589
00:55:56,889 --> 00:55:59,089
- He's my junior. - Look at that one.

1590
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,020
He looks too old.

1591
00:56:01,460 --> 00:56:03,860
We'll have three...

1592
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,759
- stir-fried spicy pork. - Coach.

1593
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,500
- They have soft tofu. - Yes, they do.

1594
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,428
We'll also have a children's soft tofu.

1595
00:56:11,429 --> 00:56:13,599
- Children's soft tofu? - Yes, and a spicy one.

1596
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:14,699
And a spicy one.

1597
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:16,339
Coach Pak.

1598
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,580
- I can tell you're a regular here. - That's right.

1599
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,609
- It looks good. - It's really good.

1600
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,339
I can tell.

1601
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:24,809
They still have customers at this hour.

1602
00:56:24,810 --> 00:56:27,079
You have to come as soon as they open for lunch.

1603
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:29,079
They get unbelievably busy as soon as they open.

1604
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,589
I can imagine.

1605
00:56:31,949 --> 00:56:33,588
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1606
00:56:33,589 --> 00:56:35,318
Is napa cabbage in season?

1607
00:56:35,319 --> 00:56:37,158
- It's kimchi-making season. - That's right.

1608
00:56:37,159 --> 00:56:39,159
- Look at the napa cabbage. - We get napa cabbage.

1609
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,129
(Putting gochujang on it).

1610
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:42,730
- We normally don't get this much. - No.

1611
00:56:42,929 --> 00:56:44,069
(Crunchy)

1612
00:56:45,170 --> 00:56:46,429
(Crunchy)

1613
00:56:46,969 --> 00:56:48,698
The gochujang is interesting.

1614
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:50,439
- Right? Isn't it like jam? - You're right.

1615
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,809
- It has a lot of garlic in it. - It's like jam.

1616
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:53,138
It's tasty, right?

1617
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,579
- It has a lot of garlic in it. - I think it has fruit in it.

1618
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,549
- It's tasty, right? - It's nice and sweet.

1619
00:56:58,049 --> 00:56:59,949
It will be amazing with stir-fried spicy pork.

1620
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:01,350
- Right? - Yes.

1621
00:57:02,650 --> 00:57:05,150
- It's already here. - Yes, they are prompt.

1622
00:57:05,549 --> 00:57:07,689
It's a generous portion.

1623
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:10,036
(A generous portion of stir-fried spicy pork for 3 is served.)

1624
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,290
Cheonggukjang comes with the stir-fried spicy pork.

1625
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,729
Their cheonggukjang is really good.

1626
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:16,429
Coach Pak likes the green onion kimchi.

1627
00:57:17,270 --> 00:57:18,429
Thank you.

1628
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,968
They give you different things because you're a regular.

1629
00:57:20,969 --> 00:57:21,969
(Special green onion kimchi for Se Ri)

1630
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:23,968
- Let's eat. - Gosh.

1631
00:57:23,969 --> 00:57:25,689
- Make a wrap. - The portions are generous.

1632
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:27,338
Yes.

1633
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:29,679
(He takes a bunch of pork...)

1634
00:57:31,449 --> 00:57:33,408
(and tries it with rice.)

1635
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:34,449
(Marveling)

1636
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:39,020
I'll put it on the napa cabbage.

1637
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:45,488
(You can't go wrong with this combination.)

1638
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:46,589
It's delicious.

1639
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:49,020
The green onion kimchi is really good.

1640
00:57:50,270 --> 00:57:52,900
(Lettuce, stir-fried spicy pork, rice, and green onion kimchi)

1641
00:57:53,270 --> 00:57:55,040
I'll eat all I can.

1642
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:00,509
I ate not long ago.

1643
00:58:01,409 --> 00:58:02,540
When did you eat?

1644
00:58:03,139 --> 00:58:04,579
Didn't you have breakfast?

1645
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,080
- That was bread. - Bread?

1646
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:08,419
- I have a separate belly for bread. - Right?

1647
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,700
- Yes, and for dessert. - Right.

1648
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:11,549
You have a separate belly for meals.

1649
00:58:11,650 --> 00:58:13,388
I have to try this.

1650
00:58:13,389 --> 00:58:15,469
(He adds green onion kimchi to his wrap like Se Ri.)

1651
00:58:15,889 --> 00:58:17,089
Is it because of this?

1652
00:58:18,589 --> 00:58:19,988
They are good at seasoning.

1653
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:21,100
- Yes. - Yes.

1654
00:58:24,230 --> 00:58:25,400
It's tasty.

1655
00:58:26,369 --> 00:58:28,069
(Proud)

1656
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,238
I sometimes come as often as 2 to 3 times a week.

1657
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:32,269
- Here? - You do?

1658
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:33,908
(A restaurant Se Ri truly frequents)

1659
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:35,810
I can see why. It's like a home-cooked meal.

1660
00:58:36,610 --> 00:58:37,779
Gosh.

1661
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:39,908
It's good.

1662
00:58:39,909 --> 00:58:41,920
- It's like you had some soju. - Right?

1663
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:44,420
It's like you're having a hangover meal.

1664
00:58:44,949 --> 00:58:46,088
It's refreshing.

1665
00:58:46,089 --> 00:58:48,888
(It forces Jae Suk, who doesn't drink, to get over his hangover.)

1666
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:50,449
What do you do on your days off, Coach?

1667
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:52,028
I spend time with my dogs.

1668
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,349
(She takes a walk with her dogs.)

1669
00:58:54,199 --> 00:58:55,429
I take a walk with them...

1670
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,330
or go out to have good food with friends.

1671
00:58:58,699 --> 00:59:00,969
I eat and drink with them.

1672
00:59:01,069 --> 00:59:03,069
You seem to relax on your days off.

1673
00:59:03,569 --> 00:59:06,710
When I talk to retired athletes,

1674
00:59:07,940 --> 00:59:10,278
they tell me they've exercised enough for their whole lives,

1675
00:59:10,279 --> 00:59:12,009
so they don't want to exercise anymore.

1676
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:14,178
I totally agree.

1677
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:16,548
When we were playing the game earlier,

1678
00:59:16,549 --> 00:59:19,919
I was nervous at crucial moments.

1679
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,588
When you're playing in a tournament...

1680
00:59:22,589 --> 00:59:24,889
and getting ready for the winning putt,

1681
00:59:25,029 --> 00:59:27,630
- you must feel extremely nervous. - I wonder how you feel.

1682
00:59:28,199 --> 00:59:30,830
- What is it like? - I didn't get that nervous.

1683
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,929
You didn't get nervous?

1684
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:35,838
I'm too focused to feel nervous.

1685
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,069
I see.

1686
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:40,270
It could be because I'm always tense.

1687
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,639
Nowadays, many Korean golfers play abroad...

1688
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:46,449
and do well.

1689
00:59:46,779 --> 00:59:48,379
But when you were playing golf,

1690
00:59:48,380 --> 00:59:52,520
no one had won a major tournament.

1691
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,259
It made a huge impact on Koreans.

1692
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,759
(Extra hole at the 1998 U.S. Women's Open)

1693
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:05,230
(She played barefoot toward victory.)

1694
01:00:08,569 --> 01:00:10,769
It was also during the IMF crisis.

1695
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:14,178
It gave us the hope that we could overcome it.

1696
01:00:14,179 --> 01:00:15,580
(We can do it too.)

1697
01:00:16,639 --> 01:00:17,649
(The first Asian to win the U.S. Women's Open)

1698
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:20,150
She was a national hero. She was the nation's hope.

1699
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:24,218
I was just lucky.

1700
01:00:24,219 --> 01:00:25,819
That isn't luck.

1701
01:00:26,420 --> 01:00:28,189
- I just happened to do well. - That isn't luck, Coach.

1702
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:31,089
- It's the result of hard practice. - Of course.

1703
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:33,230
It's because of my competitive spirit.

1704
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:34,959
You worked hard to get there.

1705
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:36,829
Did you have stage fright at first, Jae Suk?

1706
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:38,099
I totally did.

1707
01:00:38,100 --> 01:00:40,540
My hand shook like this when I held a mic.

1708
01:00:41,639 --> 01:00:43,319
- Really? - It was because I felt nervous.

1709
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:46,869
I'm not good when we're playing games even now.

1710
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,139
I'm fine when we're practicing. I'm really good.

1711
01:00:50,509 --> 01:00:51,879
I'm really good when we're practicing.

1712
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:53,880
But once the camera starts rolling, I get nervous.

1713
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,020
North Korea brought up the ownership...

1714
01:00:58,190 --> 01:01:01,960
of the publication right of the film that was produced...

1715
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:03,388
I'm sorry.

1716
01:01:03,389 --> 01:01:05,758
(When the national MC used to be a rookie)

1717
01:01:05,759 --> 01:01:07,298
I don't understand why I was like that.

1718
01:01:07,299 --> 01:01:09,360
My palms were so sweaty.

1719
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,529
I thought I might die from an electric shock.

1720
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:13,299
Seriously.

1721
01:01:13,569 --> 01:01:15,269
You aren't good at the actual thing.

1722
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,499
No, I'm not.

1723
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,239
So the producers didn't work with me.

1724
01:01:20,739 --> 01:01:23,610
Now, your anxiety is what makes it interesting.

1725
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,749
You look like you'd be good but aren't.

1726
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,618
He isn't nervous during the shoot, but while we play games.

1727
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:28,919
When we play games.

1728
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:29,920
(A moment later)

1729
01:01:30,279 --> 01:01:31,289
(Taking a deep breath)

1730
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:34,219
(The rookie Yoo Jae Suk is back.)

1731
01:01:36,060 --> 01:01:40,500
(He will shake like he did when he was a rookie.)

1732
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,258
(Glancing at his watch)

1733
01:01:43,259 --> 01:01:44,630
We have to go.

1734
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,698
- Already? I'll pay. - I'll pay.

1735
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:48,099
- No. - No.

1736
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:50,100
- Go outside. - Let's make it fair.

1737
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:51,439
Thank you for the lunch.

1738
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,468
(Polite)

1739
01:01:52,469 --> 01:01:53,609
(Impatient Se Ri paid.)

1740
01:01:53,610 --> 01:01:54,839
That was nothing.

1741
01:01:54,909 --> 01:01:57,749
It isn't common for guests to buy us so many things.

1742
01:01:57,750 --> 01:02:01,019
- Coach Pak is truly rich. - Yes.

1743
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:02,520
She's the rich coach.

1744
01:02:02,949 --> 01:02:04,889
- As long as you enjoyed it. - I am stuffed.

1745
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:07,689
(They leave to meet the second Whenever Guest.)

1746
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:10,758
Daejeon is the city with the least natural disasters.

1747
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:12,290
Yes, it seems like it.

1748
01:02:12,429 --> 01:02:13,790
Because of its location?

1749
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,099
The energy of Mount Gyeryong is amazing.

1750
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,100
It is.

1751
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:19,799
I hope...

1752
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:22,400
the Hanhwa Eagles will...

1753
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:24,669
(Laughing)

1754
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:27,540
- Why bring up a sad memory? - I'm serious.

1755
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,508
- They did pretty well this season. - I know.

1756
01:02:30,509 --> 01:02:32,250
We can hope for the next season.

1757
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:34,218
They will do well.

1758
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:37,719
As a fan of baseball,

1759
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,290
I want teams like the Hanhwa Eagles...

1760
01:02:40,719 --> 01:02:42,860
or Lotte Giants...

1761
01:02:43,089 --> 01:02:45,789
that haven't won for a long time...

1762
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:47,829
That's right. It'd be nice for them to win.

1763
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,198
- I want them to win. - Me too.

1764
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:51,368
I hope we win today too.

1765
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:53,298
Yes, let's do well this time.

1766
01:02:53,299 --> 01:02:55,368
I hope we do.

1767
01:02:55,369 --> 01:02:56,899
Our guest must've been so disappointed.

1768
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,500
(They hope to win for the second guest.)

1769
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,080
Where are we going this time?

1770
01:03:03,580 --> 01:03:05,909
Lee Jung Hoon and Kim Dong Gil.

1771
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:08,379
"We spend exciting mornings as a ping pong duo,"

1772
01:03:08,380 --> 01:03:10,989
"friendly afternoons with students,"

1773
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:13,520
"and heated weekends with an audience."

1774
01:03:13,619 --> 01:03:15,560
- What? - An audience?

1775
01:03:15,619 --> 01:03:17,790
Is it a cheerleading captain?

1776
01:03:17,989 --> 01:03:20,560
"I was doing my doctorate program when we met in Daejeon."

1777
01:03:20,699 --> 01:03:23,999
"We are the T Duo that has been a team for the past decade."

1778
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:25,968
- "T Duo?" - "T?"

1779
01:03:25,969 --> 01:03:27,599
- From the MBTI type? - Could it be from the MBTI type?

1780
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:29,440
- I don't think so. - "We will tell you..."

1781
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,408
"how to win missions on Whenever Possible..."

1782
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:33,040
"in a scientific way."

1783
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:35,980
Maybe they do something related to science...

1784
01:03:36,139 --> 01:03:37,925
- since it's Daejeon. - Are they at the school here?

1785
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,709
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1786
01:03:39,710 --> 01:03:41,020
Thank you.

1787
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:43,850
They are on the sixth floor of this building.

1788
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:45,618
- Where? - Where? An academy?

1789
01:03:45,619 --> 01:03:46,749
- An academy? - It's an academy.

1790
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:48,870
- Do we go in that way? - The entrance is over there.

1791
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,389
It's Se Ri.

1792
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:53,860
Yes, hello.

1793
01:03:54,659 --> 01:03:56,230
Daejeon...

1794
01:03:56,600 --> 01:03:58,600
- is practically Se Ri's city. - Yes, it is.

1795
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:01,868
- Here... - Wherever you go.

1796
01:04:01,869 --> 01:04:03,469
Daejeon...

1797
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:06,270
- is Se Ri's city. - Se Ri.

1798
01:04:06,569 --> 01:04:07,610
(Pak Se Ri.)

1799
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,980
(I'm from Daejeon.)

1800
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:13,480
(The star of Daejeon they are proud to share a hometown with)

1801
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:18,190
(Se Ri is a star who is welcome wherever she goes.)

1802
01:04:19,089 --> 01:04:21,389
Se Ri is more popular than Jae Suk in Daejeon.

1803
01:04:22,819 --> 01:04:24,689
- This is Se Ri's city. - Yes, it's Se Ri's city.

1804
01:04:24,690 --> 01:04:27,330
It's Se Ri's city.

1805
01:04:27,759 --> 01:04:30,968
Se Ri is more popular than Jae Suk in Daejeon.

1806
01:04:30,969 --> 01:04:32,500
That's right.

1807
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:34,170
- It's my hometown. - Yes.

1808
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:35,798
Almighty Se.

1809
01:04:35,799 --> 01:04:37,138
- Yes. - Almighty Se.

1810
01:04:37,139 --> 01:04:38,238
(Laughing)

1811
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:39,809
- Almighty Yoo and Almighty Se? - That sounds good.

1812
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:41,770
- I like the sound of Almighty Se. - Almighty Se.

1813
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:43,310
Almighty Se sounds good.

1814
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,709
Sixth floor.

1815
01:04:44,710 --> 01:04:45,809
(Almighty Se, Almighty Yoo, and plain old Yoo Yeon Seok?)

1816
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,520
Lee Jung Hoon and Kim Dong Gil.

1817
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:50,888
- Let's go. - Wait.

1818
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:52,388
(The 6th floor is all academies.)

1819
01:04:52,389 --> 01:04:54,318
I see the signs. This one is 605.

1820
01:04:54,319 --> 01:04:56,118
KAIST Science Academy.

1821
01:04:56,119 --> 01:04:57,959
- Is it that one? Room 602? - I think it's here.

1822
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,189
I saw 602 over there.

1823
01:04:59,190 --> 01:05:01,198
- You're right. - It was a science academy.

1824
01:05:01,199 --> 01:05:02,259
Should we ring the bell?

1825
01:05:02,630 --> 01:05:03,929
I think they are over there.

1826
01:05:04,330 --> 01:05:05,929
Hello.

1827
01:05:06,100 --> 01:05:07,568
Is this Room 602?

1828
01:05:07,569 --> 01:05:09,068
- Yes, it is. - Are you Lee Jung Hoon?

1829
01:05:09,069 --> 01:05:11,270
- Hello. - Hello.

1830
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,440
- Kim Dong Cheol? - I'm Kim Dong Gil.

1831
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,979
- Right. - Nice to meet you.

1832
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,880
- Hello. - All right.

1833
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:19,809
(Kim Dong Gil and Lee Jung Hoon, the second Whenever Guests)

1834
01:05:19,810 --> 01:05:21,118
- Almighty Se and Almighty Yoo. - Right.

1835
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:22,379
Daejeon is Se Ri's City.

1836
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,449
Right.

1837
01:05:23,779 --> 01:05:26,519
Are you two running an academy?

1838
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,420
- Yes. You're right. - Yes. You're right.

1839
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,618
- It feels different here. - Right.

1840
01:05:30,619 --> 01:05:32,729
You two are from KAIST, right?

1841
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:33,888
- Yes. You're right. - Yes. You're right.

1842
01:05:33,889 --> 01:05:35,459
What did you major in?

1843
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:37,869
I majored in constructional and environmental engineering.

1844
01:05:38,130 --> 01:05:39,298
I majored in mechanical engineering.

1845
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:40,299
I see.

1846
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,138
His checkered shirt stood out right away.

1847
01:05:43,139 --> 01:05:44,459
(They could tell from his shirt.)

1848
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:47,050
- The representative shirt. - Engineering students wear this.

1849
01:05:47,270 --> 01:05:48,979
- Why? - Well...

1850
01:05:48,980 --> 01:05:50,479
- Is there a reason? - Well,

1851
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,849
I'm not sure if this is still around these days,

1852
01:05:51,850 --> 01:05:53,109
but engineering students usually wear...

1853
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:54,949
what their mothers buy for them.

1854
01:05:55,179 --> 01:05:57,749
Mothers love checkered shirts.

1855
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,789
- Because they look neat. - Because they look neat.

1856
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:01,789
- Like a model student? - Right.

1857
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:03,710
The things that mothers buy for us are the best.

1858
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:06,460
- It's just an assumption. - Right.

1859
01:06:06,489 --> 01:06:07,629
Did your mother buy this for you as well?

1860
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,999
No. I bought this myself as I was tamed by...

1861
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,630
my mother's love for checkered shirts.

1862
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:13,629
- It happened all of a sudden. - Right.

1863
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:15,439
- It happened at one point. - All of a sudden,

1864
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,670
- you got stuck in that trap. - Right.

1865
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:19,738
- Shall we sit somewhere? - Shall we sit?

1866
01:06:19,739 --> 01:06:21,408
- Shall we go over there? - Sure.

1867
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:23,278
- It's quite big inside. - The classroom.

1868
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:24,425
- Right. - It's a big academy.

1869
01:06:24,449 --> 01:06:26,379
- It's big inside. - It's really big.

1870
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,619
Please feel comfortable.

1871
01:06:27,679 --> 01:06:28,980
There's a photo here.

1872
01:06:29,250 --> 01:06:31,089
Were you in a band together?

1873
01:06:31,219 --> 01:06:33,088
- Right. - Right. Actually,

1874
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:35,889
we're both in a band, and we run the academy together.

1875
01:06:36,219 --> 01:06:39,060
- Really? - It was written in the letter.

1876
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:41,459
"Heated weekends with an audience."

1877
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,499
Right.

1878
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:44,029
What do you do on weekends?

1879
01:06:44,060 --> 01:06:46,798
We're in an indie band.

1880
01:06:46,799 --> 01:06:47,999
- I see. - Right.

1881
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:51,568
We're not famous, but we perform regularly on the weekends.

1882
01:06:51,569 --> 01:06:53,838
- You're in an indie band? - Yes.

1883
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:55,479
Are you the drummer, Jung Hoon?

1884
01:06:55,480 --> 01:06:57,810
Yes. That's me in the middle.

1885
01:06:57,909 --> 01:07:00,349
- And Dong Gil... - I sing and play the guitar.

1886
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:01,979
- You sing and play the guitar? - Yes.

1887
01:07:01,980 --> 01:07:03,520
I see.

1888
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:07,519
So on weekdays, you are academy instructors.

1889
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:10,660
Right. We were band members first,

1890
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,458
but we needed to make a living,

1891
01:07:12,459 --> 01:07:15,099
and since we usually performed...

1892
01:07:15,100 --> 01:07:16,730
- on the weekend, - Right.

1893
01:07:16,829 --> 01:07:18,529
We had a lot of time left on weekdays.

1894
01:07:18,530 --> 01:07:20,298
We thought about what we could do...

1895
01:07:20,299 --> 01:07:22,219
and came up with the idea of running an academy.

1896
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,038
So you weren't academy instructors...

1897
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:26,309
- that made a band. - Right.

1898
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,810
You were indie band members...

1899
01:07:28,940 --> 01:07:30,439
- that became... - We became instructors later.

1900
01:07:30,440 --> 01:07:33,208
But students usually take supplementary lessons...

1901
01:07:33,209 --> 01:07:34,649
on weekends.

1902
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,749
- Right. - Does that not affect the academy?

1903
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,788
I do think we can make more money...

1904
01:07:38,789 --> 01:07:41,490
- if we work on weekends. - Right.

1905
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:44,959
But being in our band is our main occupation,

1906
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,590
and being an academy instructor is also our main occupation.

1907
01:07:47,660 --> 01:07:49,758
This is the only way to maintain both occupations.

1908
01:07:49,759 --> 01:07:52,569
It's just like Peppertones.

1909
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,629
Right.

1910
01:07:53,999 --> 01:07:55,038
- Right? - Yes.

1911
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,400
What's the name of the band?

1912
01:07:56,600 --> 01:07:58,270
The band is called Smoking Goose.

1913
01:07:58,370 --> 01:07:59,869
- Smoking Goose? - Goose?

1914
01:07:59,870 --> 01:08:01,538
Geese are the representative animals...

1915
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:02,578
- of KAIST. - Right.

1916
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:05,578
We thought it would be nice to have "Goose" in our name,

1917
01:08:05,579 --> 01:08:08,319
and that was how we got that name. It's Smoking Goose.

1918
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:09,619
- Smoking Goose. - Right.

1919
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:11,219
- Goose. - Goose.

1920
01:08:11,419 --> 01:08:13,219
It's the English word for goose.

1921
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,020
I know that much.

1922
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:18,959
Gosh. It's because they're instructors.

1923
01:08:19,129 --> 01:08:21,798
- Just in case. - Right. Just in case.

1924
01:08:21,799 --> 01:08:23,730
- He was just being polite. - Right.

1925
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:25,329
Did their songs come up?

1926
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,298
"Daejeon Youth Song."

1927
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:28,668
- Right. - That song...

1928
01:08:28,669 --> 01:08:29,838
Would you recommend this song?

1929
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:30,869
- Yes. - Yes.

1930
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:32,270
Great. Let's listen to it together.

1931
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,110
(Feeling the rhythm)

1932
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,280
(Whenever Guest, Kim Dong Gil)

1933
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:40,209
(Whenever Guest, Lee Jung Hoon)

1934
01:08:40,950 --> 01:08:42,918
("Daejeon Youth Song" by Smoking Goose)

1935
01:08:42,919 --> 01:08:47,120
(Winner of Representative Song of Daejeon Contest)

1936
01:08:47,919 --> 01:08:50,120
(A familiar shirt)

1937
01:08:50,759 --> 01:08:54,400
(They perform regularly in foreign countries like Japan and Taiwan.)

1938
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:56,798
(Unexpected moments of science teachers)

1939
01:08:56,799 --> 01:08:58,498
- We thought it would be nice. - We came up with a song...

1940
01:08:58,499 --> 01:09:00,798
that could be sung with the audience.

1941
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,899
It starts out a bit like "Oh Fighting Korea."

1942
01:09:03,900 --> 01:09:05,109
- Right. - Right.

1943
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,708
- It's great. - Thank you.

1944
01:09:06,709 --> 01:09:09,480
KAIST represents Daejeon.

1945
01:09:09,910 --> 01:09:11,749
- There's the Expo too. - Right.

1946
01:09:11,780 --> 01:09:14,620
- There's Pak Se Ri too. - The Expo.

1947
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,679
- They all represent Daejeon. - Right.

1948
01:09:16,780 --> 01:09:18,089
Anything else?

1949
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:19,718
When we first came to Daejeon...

1950
01:09:19,719 --> 01:09:21,059
We're not from Daejeon.

1951
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:22,620
- You're not? - We came for our school.

1952
01:09:23,219 --> 01:09:24,258
(The Daejeon star is full of disappointment.)

1953
01:09:24,259 --> 01:09:26,458
- She looks disappointed. - I had to get it out quickly.

1954
01:09:26,459 --> 01:09:29,019
- I didn't want to disappoint her. - She drew a line right away.

1955
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:31,270
They went to KAIST.

1956
01:09:31,329 --> 01:09:33,469
- She drew a line right away. - Right.

1957
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,499
Se Ri thought...

1958
01:09:35,639 --> 01:09:38,369
- you two were from Daejeon. - She must've been excited.

1959
01:09:38,370 --> 01:09:39,468
(Disappointed)

1960
01:09:39,469 --> 01:09:40,939
Right?

1961
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:42,940
- Yes. - This is quite interesting.

1962
01:09:43,110 --> 01:09:45,479
You two went to KAIST...

1963
01:09:45,480 --> 01:09:47,679
- and formed a band. - Right.

1964
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:49,480
How did that happen?

1965
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:52,650
I studied at KAIST,

1966
01:09:52,950 --> 01:09:54,859
and there were so many colleagues...

1967
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:57,160
who were much more competent than me.

1968
01:09:57,690 --> 01:10:00,189
"Research must not be the way for me."

1969
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:02,258
- I started to get these thoughts. - Right.

1970
01:10:02,259 --> 01:10:03,998
- So it started as a club? - Right.

1971
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,669
- A club in KAIST. - Right.

1972
01:10:06,929 --> 01:10:09,668
I went to KAIST when I was filming...

1973
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:11,168
"You Quiz on the Block."

1974
01:10:11,169 --> 01:10:13,539
I had a chance to talk to the students there.

1975
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:16,479
One student said, "I joined the school,"

1976
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,548
"and after the endless cycle of sifting,"

1977
01:10:18,549 --> 01:10:20,310
"it was my time to get sifted."

1978
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:22,820
It was that tough in KAIST.

1979
01:10:22,950 --> 01:10:24,489
Since it's a place where so many talented people gather.

1980
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:27,150
The student thought it was their turn to get sifted.

1981
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:29,589
They felt a lot of that after attending the school.

1982
01:10:29,719 --> 01:10:31,828
Right. It does make you feel quite perplexed.

1983
01:10:31,829 --> 01:10:34,729
"How did they understand that?"

1984
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:36,298
I said these things while not being able to understand things.

1985
01:10:36,299 --> 01:10:37,928
I felt that as well.

1986
01:10:37,929 --> 01:10:39,298
Also, this is what happens.

1987
01:10:39,299 --> 01:10:41,769
In a place that was made for studies,

1988
01:10:41,770 --> 01:10:43,998
it is fun to do something else.

1989
01:10:43,999 --> 01:10:46,639
I think that was why I enjoyed club activities even more.

1990
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,879
We thought that doing music would make us feel happy.

1991
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:54,110
We wanted to enjoy our lives,

1992
01:10:54,350 --> 01:10:55,779
and that was how it started.

1993
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:59,449
What made you apply to our show?

1994
01:10:59,450 --> 01:11:00,519
Well...

1995
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:03,159
Was it to promote your band?

1996
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,529
- No. - To promote the academy?

1997
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:06,729
Was it to promote the academy?

1998
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:07,928
Well,

1999
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:10,199
- to be honest, - To promote the band?

2000
01:11:10,200 --> 01:11:12,928
I wasn't the one to apply to the show.

2001
01:11:12,929 --> 01:11:15,039
- Actually... - Who was it then?

2002
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:16,869
There's another female instructor in our academy.

2003
01:11:16,870 --> 01:11:18,269
- We saw her earlier. - Right.

2004
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,469
Whenever she sees us, she says,

2005
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:23,479
"You two are the strangest and most fascinating people in this world."

2006
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:26,950
She wanted to let other people know how strange we were.

2007
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,150
She applied to the show under my name.

2008
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:31,350
I didn't know about this at all.

2009
01:11:31,419 --> 01:11:33,048
When she got a call from the writer of the show,

2010
01:11:33,049 --> 01:11:34,919
she came up to me really carefully.

2011
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:36,459
She said, "Listen up."

2012
01:11:36,860 --> 01:11:39,530
"Don't ever get mad. Just listen to me."

2013
01:11:39,929 --> 01:11:41,928
She said she had a favor to ask...

2014
01:11:41,929 --> 01:11:43,529
and talked about what had happened.

2015
01:11:43,530 --> 01:11:44,769
But we thought, "We aren't that strange."

2016
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:46,599
- "It'll be tough for us." - So...

2017
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,399
So that was why she was happy to see us...

2018
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,298
and left right away.

2019
01:11:50,299 --> 01:11:51,309
(The female instructor looked especially bright.)

2020
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:52,910
- Since we were finally here. - Right.

2021
01:11:53,139 --> 01:11:55,178
- You two aren't strange. - Right.

2022
01:11:55,179 --> 01:11:57,780
How should I put it?

2023
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,049
- They look like brothers. - Right.

2024
01:12:00,179 --> 01:12:02,718
- They have similar hairstyles too. - They resemble each other.

2025
01:12:02,719 --> 01:12:04,919
Did you know about this? You two both wear glasses too.

2026
01:12:05,719 --> 01:12:07,349
Are you going with similar styles as you're in the same band?

2027
01:12:07,350 --> 01:12:08,489
No, not at all.

2028
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:10,210
They must be becoming more like each other.

2029
01:12:10,419 --> 01:12:11,529
- Well... - Are they a married couple?

2030
01:12:11,530 --> 01:12:13,660
They must be becoming more like each other.

2031
01:12:13,929 --> 01:12:16,499
Aren't we like KOYOTE too?

2032
01:12:17,259 --> 01:12:18,599
(These three are starting to look like each other too.)

2033
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:19,928
We're all wearing white.

2034
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:21,839
- Then are you Jong Min? - Right.

2035
01:12:22,839 --> 01:12:24,239
- No. He's By 100. - By 100?

2036
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,139
- I'm By 100? - I'm chubby Shinji.

2037
01:12:27,839 --> 01:12:29,008
- I'm Jong Min? - Yes.

2038
01:12:29,009 --> 01:12:30,109
(Whenever KOYOTE has great teamwork.)

2039
01:12:30,110 --> 01:12:33,910
We're here, although they weren't the ones to apply to the show.

2040
01:12:34,079 --> 01:12:35,349
- We'll... - It wasn't their decision.

2041
01:12:35,350 --> 01:12:36,418
Right.

2042
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:38,519
- Let's start with the game. - Please open one up.

2043
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:40,690
You can see what prize you can get.

2044
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:42,620
Please read it for us.

2045
01:12:43,789 --> 01:12:46,729
Johnnie Walker Blue Label that will brighten up the team dinner...

2046
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:48,060
after a performance.

2047
01:12:48,860 --> 01:12:50,860
- Blue Label? - Blue Label?

2048
01:12:51,799 --> 01:12:53,899
This is something really nice. It's a high-quality whisky.

2049
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:56,176
(High-quality whisky that will brighten up the team dinner)

2050
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:57,740
- What? - Gosh.

2051
01:12:57,799 --> 01:12:59,319
You're giving out whisky as a present?

2052
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:00,639
Right. Are you serious?

2053
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:01,940
- Just one of these... - Gosh.

2054
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:04,979
Just one of these will settle a team dinner.

2055
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:07,280
- You must enjoy drinking. - It will be amazing.

2056
01:13:07,610 --> 01:13:09,280
- He looks so much brighter. - Gosh.

2057
01:13:09,480 --> 01:13:10,679
My goodness.

2058
01:13:11,150 --> 01:13:12,719
You're giving out whisky as a present?

2059
01:13:13,089 --> 01:13:14,690
He looks delighted.

2060
01:13:14,959 --> 01:13:16,020
Whisky?

2061
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:18,628
We decided to go up to Round Three no matter what.

2062
01:13:18,629 --> 01:13:19,989
- I think we can stop here. - With this...

2063
01:13:19,990 --> 01:13:22,129
- Just end with Round One? - Right.

2064
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:26,200
I've been in so many shows, and I've never seen whisky...

2065
01:13:26,829 --> 01:13:28,298
- Alcohol. - be given out as a present.

2066
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:29,439
- Really? - Yes.

2067
01:13:29,440 --> 01:13:31,440
- This is great. - This is amazing.

2068
01:13:31,810 --> 01:13:33,309
- All right. - People who enjoy drinking...

2069
01:13:33,310 --> 01:13:34,709
But we have to...

2070
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:37,780
(Pressing)

2071
01:13:39,209 --> 01:13:41,748
- Gosh. - I'm sorry.

2072
01:13:41,749 --> 01:13:43,426
(He became short-sighted after getting surprised.)

2073
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:45,588
(What is the mission for the high-quality whisky?)

2074
01:13:45,589 --> 01:13:47,449
(Guitar Pick Panchigi)

2075
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:49,359
(Hit the workbook with the palm of the hand...)

2076
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,990
(and flip all of the picks to succeed.)

2077
01:13:52,030 --> 01:13:54,230
(Round 1:3 guitar picks)

2078
01:13:54,799 --> 01:13:58,229
- The workbook gets hit like this. - This is hard.

2079
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:01,299
It's like the game with coins back in the day.

2080
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:03,270
We should take out a good workbook.

2081
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,070
So we have to flip these for Round One?

2082
01:14:06,570 --> 01:14:07,638
All three of us?

2083
01:14:07,639 --> 01:14:08,708
(They will succeed if they flip all picks.)

2084
01:14:08,709 --> 01:14:11,038
- What happens if it goes out? - It's over.

2085
01:14:11,039 --> 01:14:13,009
- It moves on to the next person? - Yes.

2086
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,248
- The ones flipped get taken out? - Yes.

2087
01:14:15,249 --> 01:14:16,579
All right.

2088
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:19,548
So when it's like this, this one gets taken out.

2089
01:14:19,549 --> 01:14:20,949
- Right. - This one is taken out.

2090
01:14:20,950 --> 01:14:22,088
- The other two must be flipped. - Then...

2091
01:14:22,089 --> 01:14:23,160
(The next person goes.)

2092
01:14:23,589 --> 01:14:26,128
- It can't go out. - It can't go out.

2093
01:14:26,129 --> 01:14:27,490
- It can't go out. - Right.

2094
01:14:27,829 --> 01:14:30,060
It has to be done well at the start.

2095
01:14:30,329 --> 01:14:31,998
(She has gone to the restroom.)

2096
01:14:31,999 --> 01:14:33,230
(Approaching)

2097
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:37,499
- You were the one who applied. - Oh, right.

2098
01:14:38,209 --> 01:14:40,639
But why did you apply to the show?

2099
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:44,140
You said you wanted to introduce these strange people.

2100
01:14:44,209 --> 01:14:46,529
- Aren't they hilarious? - What was so strange about them?

2101
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:47,579
Just their very existence.
I start laughing when I see their faces.

2102
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,919
Why?

2103
01:14:50,249 --> 01:14:51,319
(Bursting into laughter)

2104
01:14:51,320 --> 01:14:52,996
She really laughs just by seeing their faces.

2105
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:55,460
- She must find them hilarious. - Just by seeing their faces?

2106
01:14:55,759 --> 01:14:57,490
You have a lot of laughter.

2107
01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:02,599
But she says she's someone who never laughs.

2108
01:15:02,600 --> 01:15:04,136
- She says she never laughs. - I don't laugh that often.

2109
01:15:04,160 --> 01:15:05,629
You don't laugh that often?

2110
01:15:06,299 --> 01:15:07,369
(A perfect example of someone full of laughter)

2111
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,139
But she's laughing so much over nothing.

2112
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:10,600
Are you sure about that?

2113
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:12,510
You should try this, Coach Pak.

2114
01:15:13,009 --> 01:15:15,079
This is the game.

2115
01:15:15,639 --> 01:15:17,480
We each get a chance to hit the workbook.

2116
01:15:17,639 --> 01:15:19,149
When it flips...

2117
01:15:19,150 --> 01:15:21,179
All right. Give it a try, Coach Pak.

2118
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:22,649
- That's how it's done. - You have to flip them.

2119
01:15:22,650 --> 01:15:23,719
I have to flip them?

2120
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:29,089
(Hitting casually)

2121
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:34,060
(She flipped them all at once?)

2122
01:15:34,999 --> 01:15:36,459
We should've started right away.

2123
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:38,999
- This looks possible. - Right.

2124
01:15:39,129 --> 01:15:40,968
- This is doable. - Control the strength?

2125
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,369
- Yes. - Let's go for it.

2126
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,639
Let's go for Round One.

2127
01:15:43,700 --> 01:15:45,809
We'll start with Round One.

2128
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:48,078
- Let's start with a cheer. - Right. One...

2129
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,079
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2130
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:51,949
This is Round One.

2131
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:53,048
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2132
01:15:53,049 --> 01:15:54,150
Who will go first?

2133
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:55,650
- Shall I go first? - All right.

2134
01:15:55,780 --> 01:15:56,780
(The first one to go is Se Ri who did well earlier.)

2135
01:15:56,781 --> 01:15:58,021
I have to control the strength.

2136
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,789
(Show us, Almighty Se!)

2137
01:16:01,589 --> 01:16:02,690
I have to do it at once.

2138
01:16:02,959 --> 01:16:05,730
(Careful)

2139
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:09,160
(She hit it!)

2140
01:16:12,070 --> 01:16:13,168
(She managed to flip 1.)

2141
01:16:13,169 --> 01:16:14,230
One got flipped.

2142
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:16,239
- One got flipped. - This one.

2143
01:16:16,240 --> 01:16:17,299
- We got one. - Okay.

2144
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:18,539
- Should I go next? - Sure.

2145
01:16:19,209 --> 01:16:20,309
(Jae Suk is next.)

2146
01:16:20,310 --> 01:16:21,985
- I can't make them move too much. - Right.

2147
01:16:22,009 --> 01:16:23,779
- Let's get it done at once. - Right.

2148
01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,525
- Just flip both of them over. - There's a chance.

2149
01:16:25,549 --> 01:16:26,780
There's a chance.

2150
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:35,620
(Both of them flipped!)

2151
01:16:39,429 --> 01:16:40,429
(Excited)
(Laughing)

2152
01:16:41,759 --> 01:16:43,128
(Excited)

2153
01:16:43,129 --> 01:16:44,200
What was that?

2154
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:48,440
(Jae Suk surprises everyone.)

2155
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:49,939
- What was that? - Yes!

2156
01:16:49,940 --> 01:16:51,740
- Nice! - Nice!

2157
01:16:52,139 --> 01:16:53,839
We succeeded in Round One!

2158
01:16:54,039 --> 01:16:55,709
- We did it! - Nice one!

2159
01:16:56,139 --> 01:16:58,780
- We did it! Gosh. - What?

2160
01:16:58,950 --> 01:17:00,179
So we won the whisky.

2161
01:17:00,450 --> 01:17:02,249
- We won the whisky. - Nice!

2162
01:17:02,579 --> 01:17:04,789
They can't not go for Round Two.

2163
01:17:05,289 --> 01:17:06,849
- Shall we go for Round 2? - Will you go for Round 2?

2164
01:17:06,850 --> 01:17:08,520
- Let's open it. - Round Two.

2165
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:13,388
- What is it? - What is it?

2166
01:17:13,389 --> 01:17:14,588
"Your voice is vital."

2167
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:16,258
"Keep your throat moist for classes and songs..."

2168
01:17:16,259 --> 01:17:17,729
"with the standing water purifier."

2169
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:19,530
- It's a water purifier? - A water purifier?

2170
01:17:19,629 --> 01:17:22,038
- It can be placed here. - Right.

2171
01:17:22,039 --> 01:17:23,739
(Keep your throat moist for classes and songs...)

2172
01:17:23,740 --> 01:17:25,138
(with the standing water purifier.)

2173
01:17:25,139 --> 01:17:27,168
- It will be given right away. - This is amazing.

2174
01:17:27,169 --> 01:17:29,178
We heard that you were planning to move to a different place.

2175
01:17:29,179 --> 01:17:30,439
You're right.

2176
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:31,508
We were planning to move to a bigger place.

2177
01:17:31,509 --> 01:17:32,578
A bigger place?

2178
01:17:32,579 --> 01:17:33,779
Moving the academy to a bigger place.

2179
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:35,349
(Round 2)

2180
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,490
(A total of 5 picks)

2181
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:42,119
- The number of picks increases? - It goes right up.

2182
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:44,419
- It becomes much harder. - Right.

2183
01:17:44,490 --> 01:17:45,859
- It's done the same way? - Yes.

2184
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:47,036
(The 3 of them must flip all 5 picks.)

2185
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,329
- I think they can do all five. - Yes.

2186
01:17:49,860 --> 01:17:51,629
Okay. Things feel great right now.

2187
01:17:51,829 --> 01:17:53,269
We succeeded Round One really quickly.

2188
01:17:53,270 --> 01:17:54,270
Right.

2189
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:57,639
But the pick might fly out.

2190
01:17:58,139 --> 01:18:00,310
That's the hard part. It's hard to keep them inside.

2191
01:18:00,570 --> 01:18:02,139
The picks can't fall out.

2192
01:18:02,980 --> 01:18:04,639
- Shall we go for it? - Let's go for it.

2193
01:18:05,509 --> 01:18:06,509
In 1, 2, 3.

2194
01:18:06,510 --> 01:18:07,578
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2195
01:18:07,579 --> 01:18:08,649
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2196
01:18:08,650 --> 01:18:10,730
It will be great if we can flip all of them at once.

2197
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:12,789
All right. Let's go for it.

2198
01:18:13,419 --> 01:18:14,490
Good.

2199
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,419
They can't fall out.

2200
01:18:16,620 --> 01:18:18,990
I'll try to keep it simple. I'll just go for two.

2201
01:18:19,789 --> 01:18:20,829
Just two.

2202
01:18:21,499 --> 01:18:22,530
Just two.

2203
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,669
(He flipped 4 of them!)

2204
01:18:33,370 --> 01:18:34,570
Four!

2205
01:18:36,910 --> 01:18:38,809
(Yeon Seok flips 4 of them with 1 hit.)

2206
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:39,878
That was amazing.

2207
01:18:39,879 --> 01:18:41,359
Are we going to succeed in Round Two?

2208
01:18:41,410 --> 01:18:43,019
- Se Ri should go next. - We just need to keep it in.

2209
01:18:43,020 --> 01:18:45,419
- Just keep it in. - We just need to keep it in.

2210
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,849
This might be the fastest record of succeeding.

2211
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:49,588
(There are two people left.)

2212
01:18:49,589 --> 01:18:50,789
(Second try)

2213
01:18:51,320 --> 01:18:53,089
(Please!)

2214
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,400
(Will they succeed in Round 2 as well?)

2215
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:05,639
Gosh!

2216
01:19:06,770 --> 01:19:08,410
Gosh!

2217
01:19:09,839 --> 01:19:11,878
(Groaning)

2218
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:13,078
- Hold on. - It didn't flip.

2219
01:19:13,079 --> 01:19:15,748
- We have 1 person left. - It's 50-50.

2220
01:19:15,749 --> 01:19:16,950
- Let's go! - Jae Suk.

2221
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:19,020
This could be a new record.

2222
01:19:19,089 --> 01:19:21,589
The staff members are finally starting to look scared.

2223
01:19:21,820 --> 01:19:23,020
They're getting into a huddle.

2224
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:25,958
(For the first time ever, )

2225
01:19:25,959 --> 01:19:28,119
(they are about to succeed in Round 2 within 2 tries.)

2226
01:19:29,499 --> 01:19:30,529
No way.

2227
01:19:30,530 --> 01:19:32,499
(He just needs to flip one!)

2228
01:19:45,350 --> 01:19:47,009
Just one of them didn't flip.

2229
01:19:50,749 --> 01:19:51,949
- Just one didn't flip. - Gosh.

2230
01:19:51,950 --> 01:19:53,189
- Just one didn't flip. - This was...

2231
01:19:53,190 --> 01:19:54,850
- So this can happen. - Right.

2232
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:56,258
- We got four of them at once, - It didn't flip.

2233
01:19:56,259 --> 01:19:58,889
- but we couldn't flip one of them. - At once... My gosh.

2234
01:20:00,190 --> 01:20:02,310
Right. It'll look too easy if we succeed too quickly.

2235
01:20:03,660 --> 01:20:05,099
- Right. It will look too easy. - Right.

2236
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:07,829
But it would be great to show them that we can get it done quickly.

2237
01:20:08,469 --> 01:20:10,240
- Let's go for it again. - We'll go again.

2238
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:12,280
- You should go first again. - Right. Go again.

2239
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:15,410
- All right. It's our third try now. - Right.

2240
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,078
This is our 3rd try in Round 2.

2241
01:20:17,079 --> 01:20:18,209
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2242
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:19,910
Just like earlier.

2243
01:20:20,310 --> 01:20:21,879
I'm allowed to crease it a bit.

2244
01:20:22,150 --> 01:20:24,149
- I'm allowed to crease it. - Right.

2245
01:20:24,150 --> 01:20:26,110
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 3.)

2246
01:20:26,589 --> 01:20:28,990
Let's just get three of them. I can't make them go out.

2247
01:20:31,089 --> 01:20:33,030
Let's just get three of them.

2248
01:20:33,429 --> 01:20:34,860
- Okay. - That's two.

2249
01:20:35,829 --> 01:20:37,659
(It's not a bad start.)

2250
01:20:37,660 --> 01:20:40,229
- I can't touch them? - You can't touch them.

2251
01:20:40,230 --> 01:20:41,230
(The third try)

2252
01:20:41,499 --> 01:20:42,700
You never know.

2253
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,299
She could get all of them.

2254
01:20:44,870 --> 01:20:47,610
The picks are over here. It's easier if they are here.

2255
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:49,539
Then you can hit this side.

2256
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:51,319
I'm scared they might fall out.

2257
01:20:51,579 --> 01:20:53,379
Like this? I don't think it'll work.

2258
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:55,949
(She carefully adjusts her aim.)

2259
01:20:55,950 --> 01:20:57,850
Earlier... In 1, 2, 3.

2260
01:21:03,089 --> 01:21:04,860
(Not budging at all)

2261
01:21:05,129 --> 01:21:06,289
In 1, 2, 3.

2262
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:08,979
(She starts laughing out of embarrassment.)

2263
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:13,900
I got too scared.

2264
01:21:15,169 --> 01:21:17,039
You said you never got nervous.

2265
01:21:20,110 --> 01:21:21,879
(Embarrassed)

2266
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:24,338
- Get all of them. - I'll give it a try.

2267
01:21:24,339 --> 01:21:26,049
(The third try)

2268
01:21:26,079 --> 01:21:27,409
Let's go!

2269
01:21:27,410 --> 01:21:28,879
(Cheering all of a sudden)

2270
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:32,490
(There are 3 picks left.)

2271
01:21:39,089 --> 01:21:40,129
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2272
01:21:40,429 --> 01:21:41,429
It was too strong.

2273
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,629
(Disappointed)

2274
01:21:46,669 --> 01:21:49,270
(Walking on eggshells)

2275
01:21:49,469 --> 01:21:50,499
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2276
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:51,770
It was too strong.

2277
01:21:53,440 --> 01:21:55,179
Why did you hit it so hard?

2278
01:21:55,639 --> 01:21:57,410
I tried to get all three.

2279
01:21:58,310 --> 01:21:59,810
It's because...

2280
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,119
we passed Round One...

2281
01:22:02,120 --> 01:22:03,748
- so easily. - I got it.

2282
01:22:03,749 --> 01:22:06,350
- We should focus more. - Right.

2283
01:22:06,450 --> 01:22:08,190
- Will you go 1st this time? - I'll go 1st.

2284
01:22:09,089 --> 01:22:11,195
- Is it our 4th try? - Our 4th try? It's our 4th try.

2285
01:22:11,219 --> 01:22:12,788
- Let's get it this time. - We have to now.

2286
01:22:12,789 --> 01:22:13,789
- Let's not mess around now. - Right.
Let's be serious.

2287
01:22:14,790 --> 01:22:15,929
Try number four.

2288
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:17,400
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2289
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,628
This is quite hard. It's stressing me out.

2290
01:22:19,629 --> 01:22:20,829
That previous try was quite...

2291
01:22:21,629 --> 01:22:22,740
You can't make them go out.

2292
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:27,110
- That's 3 of them. - That's 3?

2293
01:22:27,270 --> 01:22:28,830
- That's 3 of them. - That's 3 of them.

2294
01:22:29,579 --> 01:22:30,910
- That's 3 of them. - That's 3?

2295
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:33,150
(It's a good start.)

2296
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:34,909
That's three of them.

2297
01:22:34,910 --> 01:22:36,179
(There are 2 picks left.)

2298
01:22:36,620 --> 01:22:37,949
Why do I always get...

2299
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,089
(The fourth try)

2300
01:22:39,219 --> 01:22:41,019
We'll succeed in Round 2 if we get 2 of them.

2301
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:42,660
Do it comfortably.

2302
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:44,490
In 1, 2, 3.

2303
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:46,589
In 1, 2, 3.

2304
01:22:48,759 --> 01:22:49,799
In 1, 2, 3.

2305
01:22:50,299 --> 01:22:51,360
Darn it!

2306
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:53,870
(Smiling quickly)

2307
01:22:54,230 --> 01:22:55,270
Darn it!

2308
01:22:56,339 --> 01:22:57,869
(She spoke her heart in a flash.)

2309
01:22:57,870 --> 01:22:59,370
- "Darn it!" - "Darn it!"

2310
01:22:59,810 --> 01:23:01,008
Daejeon is Se Ri's City.

2311
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,980
(Laughing)

2312
01:23:03,280 --> 01:23:05,450
- Gosh, this isn't easy. - Let's give it a try.

2313
01:23:05,509 --> 01:23:07,650
Getting two of them is surely doable.

2314
01:23:10,919 --> 01:23:13,719
It's right here. They will flip when I hit exactly here.

2315
01:23:14,749 --> 01:23:16,218
It's exactly here.

2316
01:23:16,219 --> 01:23:18,219
- I can get both of them here. - You can get them.

2317
01:23:18,389 --> 01:23:19,458
Please!

2318
01:23:19,459 --> 01:23:21,699
It will be great if we can go past Round Two right here.

2319
01:23:24,429 --> 01:23:25,498
I think I can get them.

2320
01:23:25,499 --> 01:23:27,100
(I think I can get them.)

2321
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:29,169
I think I can get them.

2322
01:23:29,799 --> 01:23:32,440
(They just need to flip 2 of them!)

2323
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:45,150
(Screaming)

2324
01:23:46,990 --> 01:23:48,289
(His head starts hurting.)

2325
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:53,560
I should've gotten at least one.

2326
01:23:54,690 --> 01:23:55,699
(They fail with just one left.)

2327
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:57,328
It's okay. We still have more tries.

2328
01:23:57,329 --> 01:23:58,769
- We have more tries. - I'm feeling so stressed out.

2329
01:23:58,770 --> 01:24:00,269
Let's start with Coach Pak this time.

2330
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:01,628
Coach Pak will go first.

2331
01:24:01,629 --> 01:24:03,239
Should we practice? Should we not?

2332
01:24:03,240 --> 01:24:04,439
No. Let's not practice.

2333
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,968
We can get it right away.

2334
01:24:05,969 --> 01:24:07,309
We might fail after getting it during practice.

2335
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,578
- Right. - They can't fall out.

2336
01:24:08,579 --> 01:24:09,779
- All right. - Let's go!

2337
01:24:09,780 --> 01:24:12,049
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2338
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:14,150
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Here we go!

2339
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:15,449
Let's go.

2340
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:16,979
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

2341
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:18,719
This one is stuck. Gosh.

2342
01:24:19,850 --> 01:24:21,520
Did you stick something on this?

2343
01:24:24,589 --> 01:24:26,088
- What is on this? - No one has touched it.

2344
01:24:26,089 --> 01:24:28,128
- There must be something on this. - Nobody else touched it.

2345
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:29,730
- It was stuck just now. - Is that so?

2346
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:31,030
I'll do it now.

2347
01:24:31,900 --> 01:24:32,900
In 1, 2, 3.

2348
01:24:33,129 --> 01:24:34,169
In 1, 2, 3.

2349
01:24:35,999 --> 01:24:37,039
In 1, 2, 3.

2350
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:39,338
(Disappointed)

2351
01:24:39,339 --> 01:24:41,539
They did a full turn.

2352
01:24:43,740 --> 01:24:44,910
They did a full turn.

2353
01:24:47,079 --> 01:24:48,208
A flower has blossomed.

2354
01:24:48,209 --> 01:24:51,218
(A flower has blossomed.)

2355
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:53,889
(A pick flower has blossomed.)

2356
01:24:56,589 --> 01:24:58,520
- A flower blossomed? - A flower out of nowhere?

2357
01:24:58,730 --> 01:25:01,389
Gosh, this is really stressing me out!

2358
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:04,629
It's making me angry!

2359
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:06,929
It's making me angry!

2360
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:08,939
- I need to get at least three. - Right.

2361
01:25:08,940 --> 01:25:09,940
All right.

2362
01:25:10,799 --> 01:25:12,410
- You can get all five of them. - Right.

2363
01:25:12,969 --> 01:25:14,469
I won't be too ambitious.

2364
01:25:15,240 --> 01:25:16,320
I'll try to keep it simple.

2365
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,610
(He flipped 1.)

2366
01:25:22,249 --> 01:25:23,280
One.

2367
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,520
Well, you flipped four earlier.

2368
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:30,059
You flipped four earlier.

2369
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:32,429
- Four is too many. - You try it.

2370
01:25:33,129 --> 01:25:35,189
Gosh, we can't do this in Round Two.

2371
01:25:35,190 --> 01:25:36,999
- Is this our fifth try? - Yes.

2372
01:25:37,129 --> 01:25:38,329
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

2373
01:25:39,530 --> 01:25:40,530
Here I go.

2374
01:25:41,129 --> 01:25:42,900
- I can flip all four. - Right.

2375
01:25:46,709 --> 01:25:48,980
(Fail)

2376
01:25:49,940 --> 01:25:51,008
Goodness.

2377
01:25:51,009 --> 01:25:53,280
(Sighing)

2378
01:25:56,520 --> 01:26:00,249
(There was a pick flower earlier. Now, there is flowery laughter.)

2379
01:26:00,450 --> 01:26:02,989
- Hang on. This is... - Five is hard.

2380
01:26:02,990 --> 01:26:04,119
Gosh, hang on.

2381
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,059
- It got so much harder. - It's much harder.

2382
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:07,660
- Right. - It's way too hard.

2383
01:26:07,889 --> 01:26:09,160
Gosh, I'm so stressed.

2384
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,369
In 1, 2, 3.

2385
01:26:12,370 --> 01:26:13,450
- Here we go! - Here we go!

2386
01:26:13,530 --> 01:26:14,700
This is our sixth try.

2387
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,469
- We have to do it this time. - Right.

2388
01:26:17,139 --> 01:26:18,600
Let's just get through Round Two.

2389
01:26:19,240 --> 01:26:20,639
- Just enough. - Please.

2390
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:23,110
- Just this much. Not harder. - Just like earlier.

2391
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:31,320
- Oh, 3. - You got 3.

2392
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:34,049
(That's not bad!)

2393
01:26:34,289 --> 01:26:35,690
- Oh, 3. - You got 3.

2394
01:26:35,820 --> 01:26:37,120
- Three. - You did well.

2395
01:26:37,789 --> 01:26:38,859
(The sixth try)

2396
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,088
- Just do one each. - Yes, we should.

2397
01:26:41,089 --> 01:26:42,100
Darn it. I'm last.

2398
01:26:42,499 --> 01:26:44,899
- Just do both yourself like before. - I wish I could.

2399
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,030
(Focused)

2400
01:26:51,200 --> 01:26:52,570
(He flips one.)

2401
01:26:53,910 --> 01:26:54,968
Yes, you got one.

2402
01:26:54,969 --> 01:26:57,279
(Now, the remaining person is...)

2403
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:59,378
(Se Ri.)

2404
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:01,780
- Coach. - Don't be nervous, Coach.

2405
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:06,048
- Magical Princess Se Ri has come - Magical Princess Se Ri has come

2406
01:27:06,049 --> 01:27:08,089
(Hush!)

2407
01:27:08,289 --> 01:27:09,889
- She came to - Be quiet.

2408
01:27:12,089 --> 01:27:13,449
- Do I have to hit it hard? - Yes.

2409
01:27:13,789 --> 01:27:16,629
(Almighty Se faces a great chance.)

2410
01:27:17,929 --> 01:27:19,070
In 1, 2, 3.

2411
01:27:23,302 --> 01:27:25,572
(If she flips this 1, they succeed in Round 2.)

2412
01:27:25,573 --> 01:27:26,613
In 1, 2, 3.

2413
01:27:29,842 --> 01:27:31,413
(Fail)

2414
01:27:36,882 --> 01:27:37,923
In 1, 2, 3.

2415
01:27:40,392 --> 01:27:41,852
(Exploding in the end)

2416
01:27:42,293 --> 01:27:43,422
Darn it!

2417
01:27:43,423 --> 01:27:44,892
(Succeeding too late)

2418
01:27:45,793 --> 01:27:47,963
(Banging on the table out of anger)

2419
01:27:48,948 --> 01:27:51,089
(Gritting her teeth)

2420
01:27:51,389 --> 01:27:52,758
There are still four tries left.

2421
01:27:52,759 --> 01:27:54,559
(Almighty Se is upset.)

2422
01:27:54,988 --> 01:27:57,588
(The air feels heavier.)

2423
01:27:57,589 --> 01:27:59,109
- Seriously... - The last one is hard.

2424
01:27:59,629 --> 01:28:00,799
There's too much pressure.

2425
01:28:01,429 --> 01:28:04,969
It doesn't work when I hit it hard or when I hit it softly. Darn it.

2426
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:06,697
Coach is so close to swearing now.

2427
01:28:06,698 --> 01:28:08,169
(Reading her face)

2428
01:28:09,099 --> 01:28:11,539
Darn it. Seriously. I'm going to smack you now.

2429
01:28:13,009 --> 01:28:14,179
Oh, she meant the book.

2430
01:28:15,009 --> 01:28:17,309
Gosh, we're in the Round Two swamp again. This is bad.

2431
01:28:17,749 --> 01:28:19,077
The book didn't have enough bounce.

2432
01:28:19,078 --> 01:28:20,918
- Right, it's hard when it's flat. - Darn it.

2433
01:28:20,919 --> 01:28:22,549
Hang on. You need some air in it.

2434
01:28:22,648 --> 01:28:24,568
- It's hard. - Hang on. You need some air in it.

2435
01:28:24,618 --> 01:28:26,018
We can't get stuck here.

2436
01:28:26,089 --> 01:28:27,518
But it's too hard when it's flat.

2437
01:28:28,988 --> 01:28:31,129
- It needs some bounce to it. - Right.

2438
01:28:31,259 --> 01:28:33,258
- You know? That bounce. - Right.

2439
01:28:33,259 --> 01:28:35,197
- It'll get flat when you hit it. - This is the eighth try.

2440
01:28:35,198 --> 01:28:36,527
Yes, you need that bounce.

2441
01:28:36,528 --> 01:28:37,898
- Jae Suk. - Let me practice once.

2442
01:28:41,568 --> 01:28:45,209
(He puts his faith in pseudoscience.)

2443
01:28:45,839 --> 01:28:47,539
Yes, you need that.

2444
01:28:48,339 --> 01:28:49,478
It's our eighth try?

2445
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:51,439
So, 8, 9, and 10. We only have 3 tries left?

2446
01:28:53,618 --> 01:28:54,618
Here we go!

2447
01:28:54,619 --> 01:28:56,617
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2448
01:28:56,618 --> 01:28:57,818
You can do it.

2449
01:29:13,198 --> 01:29:15,738
(He flipped all of them!)

2450
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,508
(Shouting)

2451
01:29:19,509 --> 01:29:20,577
(Jae Suk did it again!)

2452
01:29:20,578 --> 01:29:21,709
No way!

2453
01:29:22,749 --> 01:29:25,607
(Shouting)

2454
01:29:25,608 --> 01:29:28,448
(Background music: "Daejeon Youth Song" by Smoking Goose)

2455
01:29:29,389 --> 01:29:32,249
(He created a miracle with a touch of his hand.)

2456
01:29:33,635 --> 01:29:35,706
(Touched)

2457
01:29:35,988 --> 01:29:39,299
(Jae Suk became the problem-solver in Rounds 1 and 2.)

2458
01:29:39,828 --> 01:29:41,158
They won the water purifier.

2459
01:29:41,328 --> 01:29:42,668
The water purifier.

2460
01:29:42,669 --> 01:29:44,629
(They won the luxury whiskey and water purifier.)

2461
01:29:45,169 --> 01:29:46,568
Success!

2462
01:29:46,969 --> 01:29:48,539
They won the liquor and water purifier.

2463
01:29:49,669 --> 01:29:51,407
(It was a dramatic success.)

2464
01:29:51,408 --> 01:29:52,978
- Goodness. So, now... - My gosh.

2465
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:55,607
- You must decide well. Only two... - This isn't an easy call.

2466
01:29:55,608 --> 01:29:56,879
We won't say anything.

2467
01:29:56,978 --> 01:29:58,778
- There are only two tries left? - This is...

2468
01:29:59,249 --> 01:30:00,878
In terms of probability...

2469
01:30:00,879 --> 01:30:02,318
- Right. - Right.

2470
01:30:02,448 --> 01:30:04,289
Think about the probability.

2471
01:30:04,589 --> 01:30:06,358
The game will get harder,

2472
01:30:06,518 --> 01:30:08,559
and the prize will get better.

2473
01:30:09,259 --> 01:30:10,959
You should discuss it amongst yourselves.

2474
01:30:12,589 --> 01:30:13,929
- Can I do as I want? - Yes.

2475
01:30:14,129 --> 01:30:15,429
- Can I do as I want? - Yes.

2476
01:30:15,499 --> 01:30:18,397
- Then we should go for it. - What?

2477
01:30:18,398 --> 01:30:20,738
No.

2478
01:30:20,839 --> 01:30:22,867
- What? - No.

2479
01:30:22,868 --> 01:30:24,669
Okay, let me discuss it with them.

2480
01:30:24,768 --> 01:30:26,309
No.

2481
01:30:26,639 --> 01:30:27,938
I was so surprised.

2482
01:30:28,209 --> 01:30:29,748
- No! - I think...

2483
01:30:29,749 --> 01:30:31,389
you're the type to cause trouble quietly.

2484
01:30:31,778 --> 01:30:34,179
- You sent us a letter... - So, these are the rules.

2485
01:30:34,849 --> 01:30:36,447
If you go for Round Three,

2486
01:30:36,448 --> 01:30:38,348
- you don't just lose that prize. - Everything.

2487
01:30:38,349 --> 01:30:40,088
- You lose these two as well. - You'll lose everything.

2488
01:30:40,089 --> 01:30:41,718
We'll discuss it.

2489
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:42,858
- Yes, please do. - Okay.

2490
01:30:43,028 --> 01:30:44,458
- Gosh, what do we do? - Either way,

2491
01:30:44,459 --> 01:30:46,027
- But why not? - we'll do our best.

2492
01:30:46,028 --> 01:30:47,398
There are only two tries.

2493
01:30:47,728 --> 01:30:49,098
- But... - There are only two tries left.

2494
01:30:49,099 --> 01:30:50,629
But he flipped all five at once.

2495
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:52,599
But that was...

2496
01:30:53,938 --> 01:30:55,867
- I did flip them all at once, - But...

2497
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:57,709
but think about how many tries that took.

2498
01:30:58,809 --> 01:30:59,809
Go?

2499
01:30:59,810 --> 01:31:01,179
(Nodding)

2500
01:31:01,839 --> 01:31:02,849
Really?

2501
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:05,179
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

2502
01:31:05,249 --> 01:31:07,179
- Go! - Go!

2503
01:31:07,919 --> 01:31:09,748
- Gosh. - Seriously?

2504
01:31:09,749 --> 01:31:10,889
My gosh.

2505
01:31:10,919 --> 01:31:12,589
You can't blame us.

2506
01:31:12,759 --> 01:31:14,058
You can't blame us for this.

2507
01:31:14,059 --> 01:31:17,028
- We did our best. - We've done our best.

2508
01:31:20,158 --> 01:31:22,027
- Read it out loud. - Read it for us.

2509
01:31:22,028 --> 01:31:24,198
- What is it? - Two air purifiers.

2510
01:31:24,429 --> 01:31:26,139
- Two? - Two.

2511
01:31:26,469 --> 01:31:27,598
If there are two...

2512
01:31:27,599 --> 01:31:29,408
It says "Two Samsung air purifiers."

2513
01:31:29,709 --> 01:31:31,608
What's up with the huge scale here?

2514
01:31:32,068 --> 01:31:33,108
But...

2515
01:31:34,309 --> 01:31:36,948
You don't have any at the academy, right?

2516
01:31:37,049 --> 01:31:38,708
- We don't have them now. - Right.

2517
01:31:38,709 --> 01:31:41,148
You could just take these with you when you move.

2518
01:31:41,518 --> 01:31:42,748
(Round 3)

2519
01:31:42,749 --> 01:31:44,718
(The same as Round 2)

2520
01:31:44,719 --> 01:31:47,658
(However, the book gets smaller.)

2521
01:31:47,988 --> 01:31:50,459
- What? - The book gets smaller?

2522
01:31:51,089 --> 01:31:52,358
The book gets smaller?

2523
01:31:52,559 --> 01:31:55,099
(The playing field has gotten much smaller.)

2524
01:31:55,299 --> 01:31:57,429
That means there's a higher chance...

2525
01:31:57,528 --> 01:31:58,828
of falling off.

2526
01:31:59,328 --> 01:32:00,768
As long as they don't fall off...

2527
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:03,238
I think you could get it in one try with this...

2528
01:32:04,209 --> 01:32:05,268
Then, let's...

2529
01:32:06,039 --> 01:32:07,408
We only have two tries.

2530
01:32:07,539 --> 01:32:08,878
- Let's do a cheer. - All right.

2531
01:32:08,879 --> 01:32:10,848
All right. Coach Se Ri too. In 1, 2, 3.

2532
01:32:10,849 --> 01:32:12,078
- Let's go! - All right.

2533
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:13,278
Who's going first?

2534
01:32:13,318 --> 01:32:14,848
- Just like before. You first. - Me?

2535
01:32:14,849 --> 01:32:16,488
- Yes. - Coach, you go first.

2536
01:32:17,289 --> 01:32:19,349
All right. Let's create a miracle.

2537
01:32:19,488 --> 01:32:21,588
Actually, we've never had anyone...

2538
01:32:21,589 --> 01:32:23,688
go for Round Three when we were this far in.

2539
01:32:23,728 --> 01:32:25,987
- But what if they fly off the book? - In just two tries...

2540
01:32:25,988 --> 01:32:27,059
It's okay.

2541
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:28,798
- We have one more try left. - It could work like before.

2542
01:32:28,799 --> 01:32:30,867
- Gathering the picks. - Seriously...

2543
01:32:30,868 --> 01:32:32,028
That would be amazing.

2544
01:32:34,198 --> 01:32:35,268
Are you going for it?

2545
01:32:35,799 --> 01:32:37,209
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

2546
01:32:37,868 --> 01:32:40,639
(Totally nervous)

2547
01:32:44,509 --> 01:32:46,148
I should flip at least a few.

2548
01:32:46,318 --> 01:32:47,577
- I think it'll work, right? - Just don't let any fall off.

2549
01:32:47,578 --> 01:32:48,849
I think it'll work.

2550
01:32:51,349 --> 01:32:52,549
Should I go this way?

2551
01:32:52,959 --> 01:32:54,458
(Searching for the best position)

2552
01:32:54,459 --> 01:32:55,589
She's so careful.

2553
01:32:55,658 --> 01:32:57,158
We should succeed in one go.

2554
01:32:57,389 --> 01:32:58,765
- Are you going for it? - Here we go.

2555
01:32:58,789 --> 01:32:59,929
Here we go.

2556
01:33:00,358 --> 01:33:01,428
The ninth try.

2557
01:33:01,429 --> 01:33:03,629
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

2558
01:33:04,429 --> 01:33:06,799
(Please.)

2559
01:33:08,099 --> 01:33:09,198
In 1, 2, 3.

2560
01:33:15,413 --> 01:33:17,612
(She flips 2!)

2561
01:33:17,613 --> 01:33:19,852
- Oh, two. - It's not too bad.

2562
01:33:20,482 --> 01:33:22,051
- You can do this one. - All right.

2563
01:33:22,052 --> 01:33:24,022
- Should I go first? - This could work.

2564
01:33:24,993 --> 01:33:26,322
Let's do this!

2565
01:33:26,323 --> 01:33:28,622
Are you here? You're here.

2566
01:33:28,623 --> 01:33:30,092
You are? Okay, let's go.

2567
01:33:33,302 --> 01:33:35,003
(He flips one.)

2568
01:33:36,732 --> 01:33:37,772
What?

2569
01:33:38,972 --> 01:33:39,972
- One. - Two left...

2570
01:33:39,973 --> 01:33:42,042
(Now, there are 2 picks left.)

2571
01:33:42,043 --> 01:33:43,043
- One. - Two left...

2572
01:33:43,044 --> 01:33:44,471
- Yes, you could do two. - It is possible.

2573
01:33:44,472 --> 01:33:46,112
- All right. This is... - It is possible.

2574
01:33:46,613 --> 01:33:48,089
- It's possible. - I'm worried they might fall off.

2575
01:33:48,113 --> 01:33:49,413
I should've gotten one more.

2576
01:33:49,613 --> 01:33:50,812
But this is...

2577
01:33:51,113 --> 01:33:53,582
- If you go the other way... - If I hit hard, they might fall.

2578
01:33:53,583 --> 01:33:54,881
(Analyzing)

2579
01:33:54,882 --> 01:33:57,051
- This way? - Still, hit it hard. Yes.

2580
01:33:57,052 --> 01:33:58,421
- I think that would be better. - Yes, hit it hard.

2581
01:33:58,422 --> 01:33:59,663
But my left hand isn't...

2582
01:34:00,422 --> 01:34:01,963
- Harder than you think. - Right.

2583
01:34:05,903 --> 01:34:07,132
(Fail)

2584
01:34:08,632 --> 01:34:10,171
(Groaning)

2585
01:34:10,172 --> 01:34:12,131
- This is hard. - There is one try left.

2586
01:34:12,132 --> 01:34:13,572
I should've just used my right hand.

2587
01:34:13,943 --> 01:34:15,602
- But it would fly off. - The bounce...

2588
01:34:15,802 --> 01:34:18,542
(Now, they only have one try left.)

2589
01:34:18,543 --> 01:34:21,282
- Come on. - But that was really effective.

2590
01:34:21,283 --> 01:34:22,382
- Yes, of course. - It is.

2591
01:34:23,052 --> 01:34:24,052
Nice.

2592
01:34:24,812 --> 01:34:26,022
This our last chance.

2593
01:34:26,153 --> 01:34:28,052
But I'm worried they might all fly off.

2594
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,672
- Do you want to go first? - Yes.

2595
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,051
You seem to have a good feel for it.

2596
01:34:31,052 --> 01:34:32,772
(Starting with Jae Suk who has a good vibe)

2597
01:34:37,762 --> 01:34:40,162
(For some reason, they keep chuckling.)

2598
01:34:40,163 --> 01:34:42,102
Coach, will you go 2nd or 3rd?

2599
01:34:42,232 --> 01:34:43,572
- I'll go 2nd. - You'll go 2nd?

2600
01:34:43,573 --> 01:34:46,671
(Sighing with worry)

2601
01:34:46,672 --> 01:34:48,503
(Continuing to sigh)

2602
01:34:49,413 --> 01:34:50,873
It all hangs on this one try.

2603
01:34:51,043 --> 01:34:52,942
You guys don't regret this, do you?

2604
01:34:52,943 --> 01:34:54,312
No, we have no regrets.

2605
01:34:54,342 --> 01:34:55,712
I do regret it a bit.

2606
01:34:55,713 --> 01:34:57,682
(Honest)

2607
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:00,323
Yes, it was so nice earlier.

2608
01:35:00,422 --> 01:35:01,722
But you got greedy.

2609
01:35:02,022 --> 01:35:03,252
- You can do it. - Like what you just did.

2610
01:35:03,253 --> 01:35:04,753
- You can do it. - All right.

2611
01:35:05,352 --> 01:35:06,493
You did it in a single try.

2612
01:35:07,623 --> 01:35:09,092
Gosh, this is...

2613
01:35:10,392 --> 01:35:11,463
The last one...

2614
01:35:12,163 --> 01:35:13,463
Let's do a cheer.

2615
01:35:14,102 --> 01:35:15,532
The final 10th try. In 1, 2, 3.

2616
01:35:15,533 --> 01:35:16,703
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2617
01:35:17,732 --> 01:35:18,772
Are we going for it?

2618
01:35:19,272 --> 01:35:20,543
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2619
01:35:21,543 --> 01:35:22,742
Gosh, this is hard.

2620
01:35:22,743 --> 01:35:24,743
(Suddenly, we recall Jae Suk's performance today.)

2621
01:35:26,083 --> 01:35:28,942
(For every successful mission, )

2622
01:35:28,943 --> 01:35:31,453
(Jae Suk was there!)

2623
01:35:33,052 --> 01:35:35,952
(The final mission in Daejeon...)

2624
01:35:35,953 --> 01:35:38,091
(given to Problem-solver Jae Suk)

2625
01:35:38,092 --> 01:35:40,323
I feel like it might just pop off.

2626
01:35:41,092 --> 01:35:46,903
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on the final try.)

2627
01:35:58,972 --> 01:36:00,681
(He has never felt so pressured before.)

2628
01:36:00,682 --> 01:36:02,213
Aren't you sighing too much?

2629
01:36:05,583 --> 01:36:07,653
(Problem-solver Jae Suk's final try)

2630
01:36:11,852 --> 01:36:13,262
- No! - Don't fall off!

2631
01:36:14,693 --> 01:36:16,432
(Falling off)

2632
01:36:20,033 --> 01:36:21,132
My gosh.

2633
01:36:21,963 --> 01:36:24,033
(At a loss for words)

2634
01:36:24,632 --> 01:36:26,073
Don't fall off!

2635
01:36:28,573 --> 01:36:32,881
(He flipped 4, but they fail because 1 fell off.)

2636
01:36:32,882 --> 01:36:34,812
Gosh, how is this possible?

2637
01:36:35,113 --> 01:36:36,582
You flipped almost all of them.

2638
01:36:36,583 --> 01:36:38,312
Gosh, how is this possible?

2639
01:36:38,682 --> 01:36:40,083
You flipped almost all of them.

2640
01:36:40,323 --> 01:36:41,921
How is this possible?

2641
01:36:41,922 --> 01:36:44,351
(Taking the prizes out)

2642
01:36:44,352 --> 01:36:46,221
They're taking them away so quickly.

2643
01:36:46,222 --> 01:36:47,863
They take them away at lightning speed.

2644
01:36:48,022 --> 01:36:49,062
Seriously!

2645
01:36:49,562 --> 01:36:51,333
- That one... - What do we do?

2646
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:53,963
- Just 1. - Just 1.

2647
01:36:54,703 --> 01:36:57,972
(He couldn't solve the last problem in the end.)

2648
01:37:01,503 --> 01:37:02,743
It was all in vain.

2649
01:37:03,642 --> 01:37:06,642
(Regretting it belatedly)

2650
01:37:10,982 --> 01:37:12,481
No, it's okay.

2651
01:37:12,482 --> 01:37:13,583
It's not okay.

2652
01:37:17,193 --> 01:37:19,392
- What is this? - It was so close.

2653
01:37:19,793 --> 01:37:21,163
- We're sorry. - Thank you.

2654
01:37:22,793 --> 01:37:24,368
- We're sorry. - Thank you for your hard work.

2655
01:37:24,392 --> 01:37:25,631
That wasn't a good decision.

2656
01:37:25,632 --> 01:37:28,061
- We shouldn't have gotten greedy. - Right.

2657
01:37:28,062 --> 01:37:30,271
- What a shame. - If you hang it over here...

2658
01:37:30,272 --> 01:37:31,403
All right.

2659
01:37:34,003 --> 01:37:35,072
(Still full of regrets)

2660
01:37:35,073 --> 01:37:36,812
That one was so close.

2661
01:37:37,043 --> 01:37:39,113
It's fine. You did a good job.

2662
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:41,259
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you for your hard work.

2663
01:37:41,283 --> 01:37:42,342
We lost but fought well.

2664
01:37:43,083 --> 01:37:44,552
I told you that didn't exist.

2665
01:37:45,913 --> 01:37:47,152
We lost. How is that fighting well?

2666
01:37:47,153 --> 01:37:48,783
A loss is a loss.

2667
01:37:49,522 --> 01:37:52,591
Gosh, I feel so bad as we must head back to Seoul.

2668
01:37:52,592 --> 01:37:53,623
I know.

2669
01:37:54,092 --> 01:37:55,992
This was the hardest show I've ever been on.

2670
01:37:55,993 --> 01:37:57,761
(Her final thoughts)

2671
01:37:57,762 --> 01:37:59,601
This was my hardest day on TV.

2672
01:37:59,602 --> 01:38:00,703
Of course.

2673
01:38:00,762 --> 01:38:03,202
In the beautiful city of Daejeon,

2674
01:38:03,203 --> 01:38:06,801
we had a happy and joyous day together.

2675
01:38:06,802 --> 01:38:08,471
Thank you to everyone who joined us today.

2676
01:38:08,472 --> 01:38:10,142
- Thank you. - Thank you.
