1
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,890
- It's already... - Goodness.

2
00:00:09,067 --> 00:00:10,607
The New Year.

3
00:00:10,608 --> 00:00:12,506
This year is the Year of the Blue Snake.

4
00:00:12,507 --> 00:00:14,014
- "The Year of the Blue Snake?" - Yes.

5
00:00:14,038 --> 00:00:17,477
Happy New Year.

6
00:00:17,548 --> 00:00:18,607
- Goodness. - Gosh.

7
00:00:19,348 --> 00:00:21,017
To think it's the new year already.

8
00:00:21,247 --> 00:00:22,277
(A typical comment at the beginning of the year)

9
00:00:22,278 --> 00:00:23,747
In the past,

10
00:00:23,918 --> 00:00:26,187
when Korea was implementing the international age,

11
00:00:26,188 --> 00:00:27,656
it was...

12
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:29,737
- It was the beginning of the year. - It was, right?

13
00:00:30,188 --> 00:00:32,528
- Back then... - We debated on whether you were...

14
00:00:33,088 --> 00:00:34,427
- Thirty-nine. - forty or not.

15
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:38,228
(Last April, Yeon Seok's 40th birthday party)

16
00:00:38,927 --> 00:00:42,467
(YeonSeok84 couldn't accept he was 40.)

17
00:00:42,937 --> 00:00:46,137
- Something like that. - That time has passed,

18
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:48,308
and Yeon Seok has accepted his age.

19
00:00:48,437 --> 00:00:49,978
I accepted it right away.

20
00:00:51,047 --> 00:00:52,676
I had nowhere to back out.

21
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,747
- You're... - I'm still 40.

22
00:00:55,418 --> 00:00:56,977
- My birthday hasn't passed. - Right.

23
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:58,698
You were born in 1984, the Year of the Rat.

24
00:00:59,217 --> 00:01:01,617
Yeon Seok and I are 12 years apart.

25
00:01:02,058 --> 00:01:03,538
He's 12 years younger but already 40.

26
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:05,928
(Laughing)

27
00:01:06,288 --> 00:01:07,457
Time really flies.

28
00:01:08,497 --> 00:01:10,097
The view here is amazing.

29
00:01:10,258 --> 00:01:11,297
You're right.

30
00:01:11,467 --> 00:01:13,428
I always passed...

31
00:01:14,038 --> 00:01:16,137
the Olympic Expressway whenever I went for a shoot.

32
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:18,206
You can see a pavilion over there.

33
00:01:18,207 --> 00:01:19,837
(Today's spare time, Heukseok-dong)

34
00:01:19,838 --> 00:01:22,107
By the way, today's guests are...

35
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:24,677
also in the drama airing at the same time as mine.

36
00:01:24,678 --> 00:01:25,846
- Really? - Yes.

37
00:01:25,847 --> 00:01:26,948
For real?

38
00:01:27,847 --> 00:01:29,647
- It's the drama... - The next drama...

39
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,764
- after "The Fiery Priest 2." - after "The Fiery Priest 2."

40
00:01:31,788 --> 00:01:33,347
- Life is like that. - Right.

41
00:01:33,487 --> 00:01:35,587
Yes. We'll do our best at promoting the drama.

42
00:01:35,588 --> 00:01:36,987
- Of course. - Right?

43
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:39,257
And your drama is a big hit.

44
00:01:39,258 --> 00:01:40,757
- Yes, luckily. - Right?

45
00:01:40,758 --> 00:01:41,956
(Meanwhile)

46
00:01:41,957 --> 00:01:44,168
I lived in the town behind us when I was little.

47
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:45,967
We're going to Heukseok-dong today.

48
00:01:46,467 --> 00:01:48,237
Why did you come in such nice clothes?

49
00:01:48,568 --> 00:01:50,037
You're dressed up today.

50
00:01:50,038 --> 00:01:52,167
We never had such a vibe.

51
00:01:52,168 --> 00:01:54,838
- It feels different. - Really?

52
00:01:55,737 --> 00:01:57,406
(The two Whenever Friends seem close.)

53
00:01:57,407 --> 00:01:58,647
Did you bring your credit card?

54
00:01:58,648 --> 00:01:59,777
You might need to buy us meals.

55
00:01:59,778 --> 00:02:00,978
- You've heard, yes? - I have.

56
00:02:02,047 --> 00:02:03,178
There they come.

57
00:02:03,918 --> 00:02:04,918
Hey.

58
00:02:05,388 --> 00:02:07,717
- They came in matching colors. - It's Jun Hyuk.

59
00:02:08,718 --> 00:02:10,888
The two are shy.

60
00:02:11,628 --> 00:02:14,257
Since it's those two, Soo Bin should be here too.

61
00:02:14,258 --> 00:02:16,827
- Exactly. I feel lonely. - Soo Bin.

62
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:18,366
- Hi. - Goodness.

63
00:02:18,367 --> 00:02:19,896
(Today's Whenever Friends, Lee Jun Hyuk and Han Ji Min)

64
00:02:19,897 --> 00:02:21,336
- Hi. - Look at the...

65
00:02:21,337 --> 00:02:22,567
- Hi. - Hello.

66
00:02:22,568 --> 00:02:23,968
- Han Ji Min. - Jae Suk.

67
00:02:24,607 --> 00:02:26,638
- It's been a while. - Jun Hyuk.

68
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,137
- Hi. - I didn't think we'd meet so fast.

69
00:02:28,138 --> 00:02:29,737
- Take a seat. - Jun Hyuk.

70
00:02:29,938 --> 00:02:31,146
- Do you two know each other? - Well...

71
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:32,207
Jun Hyuk.

72
00:02:32,378 --> 00:02:33,783
- Do you two know each other? - Well...

73
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,147
You two look awkward.

74
00:02:35,718 --> 00:02:37,016
- Do you know each other? - What are you two?

75
00:02:37,017 --> 00:02:39,516
We're currently online friends.

76
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:41,218
- Really? - You see...

77
00:02:41,788 --> 00:02:44,056
- I was quite disappointed in him. - How come?

78
00:02:44,057 --> 00:02:45,956
- I saw this show, - Yes?

79
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,657
And he said there was...

80
00:02:47,658 --> 00:02:50,057
- a gathering with Kian84. - There is one.

81
00:02:50,668 --> 00:02:52,468
- But he didn't invite me. - No...

82
00:02:52,867 --> 00:02:54,736
- You announced it on the show. - We...

83
00:02:54,737 --> 00:02:57,607
Jun Hyuk is always a bit disappointed in everything.

84
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,438
He's always slightly upset.

85
00:02:59,767 --> 00:03:01,836
The 1984 get-together is...

86
00:03:01,837 --> 00:03:02,877
"The 1984 get-together?"

87
00:03:02,878 --> 00:03:04,576
- Are you two of the same age? - Yes, they are.

88
00:03:04,577 --> 00:03:06,107
It's next week.

89
00:03:06,307 --> 00:03:09,447
But this episode might air after our get-together.

90
00:03:09,448 --> 00:03:11,447
- I see. The future... - Yes.

91
00:03:11,448 --> 00:03:12,547
Exactly.

92
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:14,616
We're meeting up next week.

93
00:03:14,617 --> 00:03:15,777
(They will be closer by now.)

94
00:03:15,918 --> 00:03:18,188
- Either way... - Do you two talk casually?

95
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:19,758
Are you close?

96
00:03:19,759 --> 00:03:22,056
- We promised to, starting today. - Starting today...

97
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:23,396
- You two look awkward. - Starting today?

98
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,366
- Yes, starting today. - There's an awkwardness.

99
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,697
We've only met twice in person.

100
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:29,698
- Really? - And it was at events.

101
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:32,667
But you have been in entertainment for years.

102
00:03:32,668 --> 00:03:35,836
Not long ago, Jun Hyuk and I...

103
00:03:35,837 --> 00:03:38,447
shot some content. I've met the two.

104
00:03:38,448 --> 00:03:41,017
We've already had a few conversations.

105
00:03:41,277 --> 00:03:42,447
- Right. - The day before...

106
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:45,046
- was the Blue Dragon Film Awards. - That's right.

107
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:47,788
- I remember. - You have all my respect.

108
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:51,158
- I remember. - You have all my respect.

109
00:03:51,427 --> 00:03:54,197
- How did you do it? - She received...

110
00:03:54,198 --> 00:03:56,227
the baton from Hye Soo.

111
00:03:56,228 --> 00:03:57,826
- Right. - Yes.

112
00:03:57,827 --> 00:03:59,796
- I was the MC for 6 years. - He did it for 6 years.

113
00:03:59,797 --> 00:04:01,537
- You did it for six years? - Hye Soo...

114
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,137
and I resigned together.

115
00:04:03,138 --> 00:04:04,266
I wondered why we felt close,

116
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,267
and it was because of the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

117
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:09,007
He was really relaxed hosting the show.

118
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:10,907
I was also incredibly nervous in my first year.

119
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:13,607
I couldn't tell. You looked calm.

120
00:04:13,908 --> 00:04:15,977
- How was it? - I...

121
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,517
Is this an interview?

122
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,618
To think I'd be able to talk about it on a show.

123
00:04:22,217 --> 00:04:23,417
I'll take this chance.

124
00:04:23,517 --> 00:04:24,758
Yeon Seok. It seems...

125
00:04:24,988 --> 00:04:27,026
Ji Min and Jun Hyuk have met me more than you.

126
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:28,557
- A lot more. - Right?

127
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:29,997
- Don't you agree? - Yes.

128
00:04:29,998 --> 00:04:32,667
I know, right? Let me lead the show today.

129
00:04:32,928 --> 00:04:34,897
May I be the one to lead Jun Hyuk?

130
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,906
- I feel this closeness between us. - A close feeling.

131
00:04:37,907 --> 00:04:39,707
- I'm in your care. - Okay.

132
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:41,178
- So you feel this closeness. - Yes.

133
00:04:41,277 --> 00:04:44,777
Yesterday, I watched this show in detail.

134
00:04:45,048 --> 00:04:47,007
Having watched one, I'm a bit...

135
00:04:47,008 --> 00:04:48,917
- Familiar? - Which episode did you watch?

136
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:52,017
I watched a tiny bit of the one with Seo Jin.

137
00:04:52,818 --> 00:04:54,216
I had to check if he was working hard or not.

138
00:04:54,217 --> 00:04:55,656
- "Lee San, Wind in the Palace?" - Yes.

139
00:04:55,657 --> 00:04:58,057
Actually, it's a relief that I feel comfortable,

140
00:04:58,058 --> 00:04:59,826
despite not seeing each other for a while.

141
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:01,997
He was slightly scary when we first met.

142
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:02,998
- Yeon Seok was? - I was?

143
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:05,466
I didn't mean scary in a bad way.

144
00:05:05,467 --> 00:05:07,096
- You mean at the MAMA Awards? - It was at the MAMA Awards.

145
00:05:07,097 --> 00:05:11,207
He was like, "Hey. You're Jun Hyuk, right?"

146
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:12,766
(Yeon Seok was acting cool.)

147
00:05:12,767 --> 00:05:14,437
- That was... - You were quite arrogant.

148
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:15,737
Did I drop the formality right away?

149
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:18,547
How should I put it? I wanted to act like him.

150
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:21,447
- You wanted to act like him? - Yes, greet with confidence.

151
00:05:21,448 --> 00:05:22,916
Confident and dignified.

152
00:05:22,917 --> 00:05:24,586
That left a great impression on me.

153
00:05:24,587 --> 00:05:27,347
I was determined to do the same if I met someone later.

154
00:05:27,388 --> 00:05:29,317
- Have you tried it? - Not yet.

155
00:05:29,318 --> 00:05:30,827
I'll do it today.

156
00:05:31,258 --> 00:05:32,827
Why is it so awkward?

157
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:38,427
- Jun Hyuk usually plays... - Yes?

158
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:40,596
- charismatic... - Right.

159
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:43,437
And levelheaded roles in dramas.

160
00:05:43,438 --> 00:05:46,867
- But in real life, he's careful, - Right.

161
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,607
Shy, and such.

162
00:05:48,608 --> 00:05:50,276
Jun Hyuk's very talented.

163
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:51,447
- He is. - Right?

164
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:53,447
He writes music, fairy tale books,

165
00:05:53,448 --> 00:05:55,178
- He raps too. - and raps.

166
00:05:55,717 --> 00:05:57,117
- Don't do that. - He also makes games.

167
00:05:57,118 --> 00:05:58,547
- Really? - Those born...

168
00:05:58,548 --> 00:06:00,016
in the Year of the Rat are busy.

169
00:06:00,017 --> 00:06:01,887
He wrote a children's song.

170
00:06:01,888 --> 00:06:03,217
- A children's song? - Yes.

171
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:04,526
There's one I made.

172
00:06:04,527 --> 00:06:06,487
- The title is "Baby Sloth." - Baby what?

173
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:08,057
- "Baby Sloth." - "Baby Sloth?"

174
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:09,956
(The children's song Jun Hyuk took part in)

175
00:06:09,957 --> 00:06:14,537
(Title: "Baby Sloth")

176
00:06:14,738 --> 00:06:17,036
It was released on International Sloth Day.

177
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:19,037
(Every 3rd Saturday of October each year)

178
00:06:19,967 --> 00:06:22,178
He loves sloths to the point that...

179
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:24,178
his messenger profile picture...

180
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:25,677
- is of a sloth. - I know.

181
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:27,846
- For real? - I'm obsessed with sloths.

182
00:06:27,847 --> 00:06:29,216
Why do you like them so much?

183
00:06:29,217 --> 00:06:30,776
Baby sloths...

184
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,286
But not the three-toed sloth.

185
00:06:33,287 --> 00:06:35,416
- There's the two-toed sloth. - The species?

186
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,487
- Are they different? - Yes.

187
00:06:36,488 --> 00:06:39,826
The three-toed sloth is the one we are most familiar with.

188
00:06:39,827 --> 00:06:43,257
The baby two-toed sloths are adorable.

189
00:06:43,258 --> 00:06:45,127
- Really? - So...

190
00:06:45,128 --> 00:06:47,297
- on YouTube, - Yes?

191
00:06:47,298 --> 00:06:49,997
You can hear it cry,

192
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:52,266
and it's incredibly cute.

193
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:53,368
Between the two...

194
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,938
(Looking around)

195
00:06:56,477 --> 00:06:58,048
This is how everyone reacts at first.

196
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:00,608
People barely listen to him later on.

197
00:07:01,977 --> 00:07:04,216
It's nice how everyone is all ears.

198
00:07:04,217 --> 00:07:05,697
(It's nice how everyone is all ears.)

199
00:07:06,787 --> 00:07:08,086
Thank you.

200
00:07:08,087 --> 00:07:10,016
We're quite similar. I have countless hobbies.

201
00:07:10,017 --> 00:07:11,617
- He's a hobby enthusiast. - Is that so?

202
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,057
Yeon Seok is currently into gardening.

203
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,297
- Really? - Gardening is...

204
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:16,858
If you could come to my house.

205
00:07:17,327 --> 00:07:19,128
My place needs some gardening.

206
00:07:19,227 --> 00:07:20,867
- Shall I visit? - Do you do it yourself?

207
00:07:20,868 --> 00:07:22,497
- Should I do some pruning? - For real?

208
00:07:22,498 --> 00:07:24,808
- I normally hire experts to do it. - He does it himself.

209
00:07:25,638 --> 00:07:27,508
Yeon Seok likes camping...

210
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:29,198
- and gardening. - You even go camping?

211
00:07:29,378 --> 00:07:30,706
I also like coffee.

212
00:07:30,707 --> 00:07:32,307
- He does. - I'm a certified barista.

213
00:07:32,308 --> 00:07:34,276
- Taking photos. - That too.

214
00:07:34,277 --> 00:07:36,094
- It's all done outdoors. - I held an exhibition.

215
00:07:36,118 --> 00:07:38,416
- Most of them are cool. - Really?

216
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,647
- He's even certified. - You're cool as well.

217
00:07:41,217 --> 00:07:42,258
Thanks.

218
00:07:43,058 --> 00:07:44,188
What are you two doing?

219
00:07:46,087 --> 00:07:47,827
It's because they're not close enough.

220
00:07:47,957 --> 00:07:50,258
Guys aren't usually like that. You get it, right?

221
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,267
Guys who are close aren't like that.

222
00:07:52,767 --> 00:07:55,068
You're on the mark. It's because they're not close.

223
00:07:55,597 --> 00:07:58,738
This is my 1st time calling Yeon Seok's name more than 3 times.

224
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:01,836
- Let's call each other a lot today. - Okay, Yeon Seok.

225
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:02,906
Nice.

226
00:08:02,907 --> 00:08:04,607
- I'm enjoying this awkward air. - Right.

227
00:08:04,608 --> 00:08:05,907
- Nice. - Yes.

228
00:08:05,977 --> 00:08:07,817
A new drama...

229
00:08:07,818 --> 00:08:11,118
has started on SBS.

230
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:13,317
Our two guests are in it.

231
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:14,857
- "Love Scout." - "Scout."

232
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,117
("Han Ji Min and Lee Jun Hyuk Are in a Romance Drama")

233
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:17,703
("The perfect two shot, Han Ji Min and Lee Jun Hyuk")

234
00:08:17,727 --> 00:08:19,357
Hi. I'm Yu Eun Ho.

235
00:08:19,358 --> 00:08:20,427
I'll do my best.

236
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:22,797
(An in-depth romance between a headhunting company's CEO...)

237
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:25,373
(who only works well and a perfect secretary who also works well)

238
00:08:25,397 --> 00:08:26,466
Am I fired?

239
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:27,867
I'm a CEO...

240
00:08:27,868 --> 00:08:30,797
obsessed with work who's quite like a robot.

241
00:08:30,798 --> 00:08:33,608
Jun Hyuk becomes my secretary,

242
00:08:33,907 --> 00:08:36,978
adjusts everything to the CEO,

243
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:39,407
and cares for her in-depth.

244
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:43,378
(How about we go home together?)

245
00:08:45,947 --> 00:08:47,816
- A perfect secretary. - Are you that kind of secretary?

246
00:08:47,817 --> 00:08:48,817
Yes.

247
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:50,557
- Yes, I am. - Right.

248
00:08:50,657 --> 00:08:53,186
It airs at the same time as his drama.

249
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,857
- Right. - Do we overlap?

250
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,597
- It airs at the same time. - It's ongoing.

251
00:08:56,598 --> 00:08:58,844
- I knew that, but does it overlap? - Our last episode...

252
00:08:58,868 --> 00:09:00,526
and your first episode overlap.

253
00:09:00,527 --> 00:09:02,536
- I see. - The last and the first episodes.

254
00:09:02,537 --> 00:09:03,896
It's a big hit.

255
00:09:03,897 --> 00:09:05,436
It's getting good reviews from abroad.

256
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:06,637
How does it feel...

257
00:09:06,638 --> 00:09:08,977
to be a worldwide celebrity?

258
00:09:08,978 --> 00:09:11,276
- "Worldwide?" - I've never been one.

259
00:09:11,277 --> 00:09:14,277
- I heard you were popular overseas. - It hasn't hit me yet.

260
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,577
Yeon Seok has only ever heard about it.

261
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:19,118
You're right. I've not met them...

262
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:20,416
in person.

263
00:09:20,417 --> 00:09:21,487
Has your life changed?

264
00:09:21,488 --> 00:09:23,717
- No. Nothing has changed. - No?

265
00:09:23,718 --> 00:09:24,957
- Is that so? - Right now...

266
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,757
It's like you're offending him on purpose.

267
00:09:26,758 --> 00:09:28,227
- No, I was genuinely curious. - No?

268
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,127
It's an unbelievable situation...

269
00:09:30,128 --> 00:09:32,026
we never dreamed of...

270
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:33,827
- when we were younger. - Right.

271
00:09:33,828 --> 00:09:35,796
But aren't you, Ji Min and Jun Hyuk,

272
00:09:35,797 --> 00:09:37,497
- famous overseas too? - No.

273
00:09:37,498 --> 00:09:38,507
- No? - No.

274
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:40,066
Didn't you gain international fans since "Lee San, Wind in the Palace?"

275
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:41,787
"Lee San, Wind in the Palace" was ages ago.

276
00:09:42,138 --> 00:09:44,176
- Jae Suk. - "Lee San, Wind in the Palace?"

277
00:09:44,177 --> 00:09:46,848
Ji Min. Did "Lee San, Wind in the Palace" fail?

278
00:09:47,078 --> 00:09:48,676
- I mean... - It was a hit in Japan.

279
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:50,046
Exactly.

280
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,416
(The original K-drama, "Lee San, Wind in the Palace")

281
00:09:51,417 --> 00:09:53,618
We need to head out together...

282
00:09:53,817 --> 00:09:55,258
with Ji Min and Jun Hyuk.

283
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:56,687
Where are we going, Yeon Seok?

284
00:09:57,618 --> 00:09:58,657
Let's see.

285
00:09:59,488 --> 00:10:01,156
- Today... - Our collection is huge now.

286
00:10:01,157 --> 00:10:02,998
- Goodness. Here it is. - The business cards.

287
00:10:03,157 --> 00:10:06,967
"Lim Eun Bin, Kang Na Rae, and Ma Ye Rim."

288
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,166
Are there three guests?

289
00:10:08,167 --> 00:10:11,207
"Born with high spirits, talent show lovers,"

290
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:12,306
- We're in trouble. - "and..."

291
00:10:12,307 --> 00:10:14,907
"beanpoles who do anything asked."

292
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,146
"We're a new group that debuted on national TV eight months ago."

293
00:10:18,147 --> 00:10:19,407
- What? - What?

294
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,276
- "A new group?" - "A new group?"

295
00:10:21,277 --> 00:10:22,277
Are they comedians?

296
00:10:22,447 --> 00:10:23,646
"Unable to defy our instincts,"

297
00:10:23,647 --> 00:10:26,047
"we were led to each other one day and became one."

298
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:29,187
"We were once the most wanted cast in Dongjak-gu."

299
00:10:29,287 --> 00:10:33,128
"Please come and resuscitate our waned popularity."

300
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,897
I see. "Cast in Dongjak-gu."

301
00:10:36,128 --> 00:10:39,627
They could've been on "Korea Sings" in Dongjak-gu.

302
00:10:39,628 --> 00:10:41,796
Or they could be comedians...

303
00:10:41,797 --> 00:10:43,097
- Right. - who performed onstage...

304
00:10:43,098 --> 00:10:45,368
but are not as active anymore.

305
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:46,637
Could they be 1 of the 2?

306
00:10:46,638 --> 00:10:48,978
We have to roll that first.

307
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,177
This is...

308
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:52,047
Who's going to throw it?

309
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:54,847
I suck at things like this.

310
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,247
- Is that so? - My hands are...

311
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:57,987
- Why don't you do it, Jun Hyuk? - Go ahead.

312
00:10:57,988 --> 00:10:59,646
- Good luck. - The perfect secretary.

313
00:10:59,647 --> 00:11:00,748
Yes.

314
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,618
Let's see how perfect you are.

315
00:11:04,157 --> 00:11:05,597
Let's see if your hands are perfect.

316
00:11:05,758 --> 00:11:07,156
Since I'm doing it, I'll throw it up high.

317
00:11:07,157 --> 00:11:08,297
Throw it up high.

318
00:11:10,397 --> 00:11:11,468
Don't tell me...

319
00:11:14,968 --> 00:11:17,566
(They secured 2 coupons.)

320
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:18,936
- Two. - Do we have two more chances?

321
00:11:18,937 --> 00:11:20,707
- Two more. Not bad, right? - Okay.

322
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,477
- It's a moderate number. - I agree.

323
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:24,607
- We can all take a turn. - Exactly.

324
00:11:24,608 --> 00:11:25,748
The coupons.

325
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:28,348
- Shall we head out? - Okay.

326
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:29,816
Thank you.

327
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,488
Thank you. Bye.

328
00:11:31,618 --> 00:11:33,987
(Current time, 11:42am)

329
00:11:33,988 --> 00:11:35,888
I didn't think this place would have these.

330
00:11:36,588 --> 00:11:39,258
- I know, right? - These love locks and such.

331
00:11:39,427 --> 00:11:40,588
Have you tried it?

332
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:41,757
No.

333
00:11:41,758 --> 00:11:42,857
(Packed with love locks)

334
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,997
(Thinking)

335
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:47,426
Yeon Seok. How about we do a friendship lock?

336
00:11:47,427 --> 00:11:48,567
(Being courageous)

337
00:11:49,037 --> 00:11:51,436
- The 1984 get-together. - A friendship lock?

338
00:11:51,437 --> 00:11:54,207
Jun Hyuk seems like the type to do it.

339
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:55,306
If the two of us do it...

340
00:11:55,307 --> 00:11:57,676
Jun Hyuk carries such a vibe.

341
00:11:57,677 --> 00:11:58,807
It'll be the worst.

342
00:11:59,307 --> 00:12:01,477
Two men in their forties...

343
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:02,478
It's the best.

344
00:12:03,118 --> 00:12:04,816
- What about you, Ji Min? - Two men...

345
00:12:04,817 --> 00:12:06,117
- I'm in. - in their forties...

346
00:12:06,118 --> 00:12:07,217
- Can you do it? - Yes.

347
00:12:07,218 --> 00:12:09,457
- You can? - You know how people...

348
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:11,016
- write things at temples? - Yes.

349
00:12:11,017 --> 00:12:13,127
- I write one and hang it up. - Really?

350
00:12:13,128 --> 00:12:14,958
I've once done it on Mount Nam.

351
00:12:15,157 --> 00:12:16,457
- Really? - Seriously?

352
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:17,497
Did you throw the key?

353
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:18,667
Why would you do that?

354
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:20,503
- So no one can open it? - For a lasting love.

355
00:12:20,527 --> 00:12:21,567
(Laughing)

356
00:12:22,667 --> 00:12:24,067
For the love to last forever.

357
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:27,707
Something like, "Nobody can come in between our love."

358
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:28,878
(Yeon Seok, Jun Hyuk)

359
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:31,176
I heard three generations of your family...

360
00:12:31,177 --> 00:12:32,847
- lived here. - Yes. My grandfather,

361
00:12:32,848 --> 00:12:34,646
- What? - dad, and I...

362
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:36,517
graduated from the same elementary school.

363
00:12:36,647 --> 00:12:38,186
- From the same elementary school? - Yes.

364
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:39,748
- For real? - In Heukseok-dong.

365
00:12:39,817 --> 00:12:41,657
Gosh, that's unusual.

366
00:12:42,258 --> 00:12:44,057
Your grandfather, father...

367
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:46,388
My older sister, aunts, and me.

368
00:12:47,328 --> 00:12:48,328
That elementary school...

369
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:49,828
- must be really old. - It is.

370
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:52,167
Which town did you live in, Jun Hyuk?

371
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:55,237
I moved around a lot.

372
00:12:55,238 --> 00:12:56,598
- I see. - That's right.

373
00:12:56,767 --> 00:12:58,637
I also lived in Ilsan.

374
00:12:58,638 --> 00:13:00,806
I moved around mainly in the capital area.

375
00:13:00,807 --> 00:13:02,036
- A few years each. - In the capital area?

376
00:13:02,037 --> 00:13:03,107
- Continuously? - Yes.

377
00:13:03,108 --> 00:13:04,306
You must've transferred schools.

378
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:05,848
I frequently did.

379
00:13:06,348 --> 00:13:09,146
Personality-wise, changing schools...

380
00:13:09,147 --> 00:13:10,877
and making new friends...

381
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:12,617
- must've been hard. - It sounds tough.

382
00:13:12,618 --> 00:13:14,347
Adjusting to the school isn't easy.

383
00:13:14,348 --> 00:13:17,186
Yes. I hated making self-introductions.

384
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,627
- I can imagine. - Introducing yourself, right?

385
00:13:19,628 --> 00:13:21,257
- Introducing myself was... - "Come here."

386
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,196
"He's a transfer student." It's awful, right?

387
00:13:23,197 --> 00:13:24,526
I never transferred schools.

388
00:13:24,527 --> 00:13:25,597
- Really? - Gosh.

389
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,738
My family tends to stick to one place...

390
00:13:29,037 --> 00:13:30,437
when they settle down.

391
00:13:30,998 --> 00:13:32,708
When I suddenly moved to Seoul...

392
00:13:33,108 --> 00:13:35,708
after living in Gyeongsang Province,

393
00:13:36,277 --> 00:13:39,107
I was at a loss with my dialect.

394
00:13:39,108 --> 00:13:40,108
Really?

395
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:42,217
I started school when the semester started,

396
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:43,748
so nobody noticed at first.

397
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,546
Did you not talk much?

398
00:13:45,547 --> 00:13:46,847
I barely talked.

399
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:49,717
It was during math class...

400
00:13:49,718 --> 00:13:50,987
when I had a question.

401
00:13:50,988 --> 00:13:53,628
I raised my hand and shouted, "Teacher!"

402
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,597
But that's adorable.

403
00:13:56,598 --> 00:13:58,097
To think someone can actually do that.

404
00:13:58,098 --> 00:14:00,327
- "Teacher!" - At that moment...

405
00:14:00,328 --> 00:14:01,368
"Teacher!"

406
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:03,498
I shouted, "Teacher!"

407
00:14:03,838 --> 00:14:05,436
- I got busted at that moment. - That's cute.

408
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:06,467
How funny.

409
00:14:06,468 --> 00:14:08,608
If "Talk Box" still existed,

410
00:14:08,907 --> 00:14:10,837
- your story would come first place. - I agree.

411
00:14:10,838 --> 00:14:12,438
I got busted right away with, "Teacher!"

412
00:14:12,478 --> 00:14:13,946
You don't have any dialect now.

413
00:14:13,947 --> 00:14:15,747
- No. - I can't tell.

414
00:14:15,748 --> 00:14:18,146
But I have the dialect when I meet hometown friends...

415
00:14:18,147 --> 00:14:19,316
- or make a call. - Don't worry, Ji Min.

416
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,457
I'll support you the minute you fall down.

417
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,717
(A pretentious bodyguard)

418
00:14:22,718 --> 00:14:25,027
- I'm constantly watching you. - Got it.

419
00:14:25,088 --> 00:14:26,656
I'll use my legs right away.

420
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,328
Jae Suk. Just take care of yourself.

421
00:14:29,927 --> 00:14:31,727
Ji Min is being very careful.

422
00:14:31,728 --> 00:14:33,127
- He offered help first. - He's the perfect secretary.

423
00:14:33,128 --> 00:14:35,896
Yes, the perfect secretary should do it.

424
00:14:35,897 --> 00:14:36,968
Right.

425
00:14:38,067 --> 00:14:39,767
- Where is it? - Over there.

426
00:14:40,537 --> 00:14:42,208
It's this one.

427
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:44,036
Isn't this a famous car?

428
00:14:44,037 --> 00:14:45,507
- I'll drive. - You will?

429
00:14:45,508 --> 00:14:47,447
Yes. You can drive next time.

430
00:14:47,677 --> 00:14:49,947
Sit in the back. I'll sit in the front.

431
00:14:50,677 --> 00:14:51,988
You saw my secretary, right?

432
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:53,488
Hey.

433
00:14:53,647 --> 00:14:55,988
- Sit in the front. - Ji Min, take the passenger seat.

434
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:58,888
- Let the two friends sit together. - Awkwardly.

435
00:14:59,388 --> 00:15:00,857
- Thank you. - No problem.

436
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,258
(The 1984s sit side by side.)

437
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:05,797
- Let's get going. - Okay.

438
00:15:06,027 --> 00:15:07,727
- Isn't it hot? - It's hotter than I imagined.

439
00:15:07,728 --> 00:15:09,897
- You're right. - The sun makes it hot.

440
00:15:10,098 --> 00:15:12,066
We can open the sunroof today.

441
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:13,708
- Yes. - The sky is pretty too.

442
00:15:15,777 --> 00:15:17,207
The openness is nice.

443
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,177
- It's huge. - It's a panorama sunroof.

444
00:15:19,378 --> 00:15:20,608
Let's hit the road.

445
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,618
(Setting out with the sunroof open)

446
00:15:24,478 --> 00:15:25,887
Jun Hyuk doesn't have a car.

447
00:15:25,888 --> 00:15:27,447
You don't, Jun Hyuk?

448
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,858
He doesn't drive.

449
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:33,888
There are those who have a driver's license...

450
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:36,258
but don't drive because it doesn't feel right.

451
00:15:36,628 --> 00:15:38,796
Jun Hyuk is my secretary in the drama...

452
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,827
- and has to drive all the time. - Can he do it?

453
00:15:40,828 --> 00:15:44,497
I asked if he could actually drive and had experience.

454
00:15:44,498 --> 00:15:46,266
- I do. - You're a secretary, Jun Hyuk.

455
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:47,566
Isn't it a problem if you can't drive?

456
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:49,807
But I drive all the time when we shoot outdoors.

457
00:15:49,937 --> 00:15:51,946
- Really? - I drive at drama shoots...

458
00:15:51,947 --> 00:15:54,377
- and chase after things. - Then it's not a problem.

459
00:15:54,378 --> 00:15:56,118
You're good at driving...

460
00:15:56,447 --> 00:15:58,747
but don't own a private car.

461
00:15:58,748 --> 00:16:01,146
- Right? - And there aren't many times...

462
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:03,016
- when he has to drive. - Right.

463
00:16:03,017 --> 00:16:04,487
- By the way, Yeon Seok. - Yes?

464
00:16:04,488 --> 00:16:06,127
I haven't heard "private car" in a while.

465
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:07,257
- "Private car." - "Private car."

466
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,497
- Isn't it a "private car?" - "Private."

467
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:10,427
- "Private." Mine. - Yes.

468
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:13,228
It's been ages since I last heard "private car."

469
00:16:13,527 --> 00:16:14,767
What else do you call it?

470
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,867
Who has a private car at home?

471
00:16:16,868 --> 00:16:18,138
- Me. - Own car?

472
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:20,368
- "Own car?" - "Own car."

473
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:22,838
- "Private car" was funny. - "Private car."

474
00:16:23,238 --> 00:16:26,176
I think it's my first time riding a car driven by Jae Suk.

475
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:27,208
Is that so?

476
00:16:27,407 --> 00:16:28,916
You said you were a driver in the military.

477
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:29,917
(The former driver Yeon Seok was in charge of driving.)

478
00:16:29,918 --> 00:16:31,347
- Were you a driver? - Yes.

479
00:16:31,348 --> 00:16:32,417
That's right.

480
00:16:33,218 --> 00:16:34,987
I served near here.

481
00:16:34,988 --> 00:16:36,457
- Is that so? - In Daebang-dong.

482
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:38,728
- Really? - Yes. I was in the Air Force.

483
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:40,786
I didn't know you were in the Air Force.

484
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:42,897
Didn't you grow up in this area?

485
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:44,968
- Yes. - For three generations?

486
00:16:45,027 --> 00:16:46,766
- Really. - You must know...

487
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,796
many old must-eat places.

488
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:52,708
Heukseok-dong isn't big.

489
00:16:52,838 --> 00:16:55,878
It's like a small village. It's not big.

490
00:16:56,008 --> 00:16:58,807
There's a market.

491
00:16:59,108 --> 00:17:00,977
Compared to other areas, the price is cheap.

492
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,046
I see.

493
00:17:02,047 --> 00:17:06,187
There are many affordable yet delicious restaurants.

494
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:08,256
I'm excited about lunch.

495
00:17:08,257 --> 00:17:09,987
When I was a rookie,

496
00:17:10,257 --> 00:17:13,457
I had a friend living in this town.

497
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:16,098
- The broadcast stations are nearby. - Yes.

498
00:17:16,157 --> 00:17:18,097
- So I often crashed at his place. - It's close to Yeouido.

499
00:17:18,098 --> 00:17:19,466
Yes, because it's close to Yeouido.

500
00:17:19,467 --> 00:17:22,067
Apartments like those were built recently.

501
00:17:22,068 --> 00:17:24,196
- Right. - The area transformed recently.

502
00:17:24,197 --> 00:17:26,466
Luxury apartments were built too.

503
00:17:26,467 --> 00:17:27,906
Yes, up there.

504
00:17:27,907 --> 00:17:30,476
But the university town hasn't changed that much.

505
00:17:30,477 --> 00:17:32,597
I haven't stopped by Chung-Ang University in a while.

506
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:34,307
(Glancing)

507
00:17:34,308 --> 00:17:36,577
- Isn't this... - Are you sleeping, Jun Hyuk?

508
00:17:36,578 --> 00:17:37,617
No.

509
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,887
This is the biggest Volkswagen SUV.

510
00:17:39,888 --> 00:17:41,217
- This one? - Yes.

511
00:17:41,288 --> 00:17:42,657
This car sure is big.

512
00:17:43,588 --> 00:17:46,687
(Joining the conversation very awkwardly)

513
00:17:47,528 --> 00:17:49,328
What kind of food do you like, Jun Hyuk?

514
00:17:49,757 --> 00:17:51,527
Honestly, I like all kinds of food.

515
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,666
It's just that I can't eat in many situations.

516
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,868
I heard that...

517
00:17:55,437 --> 00:17:58,406
Jun Hyuk loves pizza.

518
00:17:58,407 --> 00:17:59,736
- Pizza? - I love pizza.

519
00:17:59,737 --> 00:18:00,807
How come?

520
00:18:00,808 --> 00:18:03,007
- Yeon Seok. - How can you not like pizza?

521
00:18:03,278 --> 00:18:05,007
Do you not eat during a drama?

522
00:18:05,147 --> 00:18:06,707
- Do you go on a diet? - No, I eat.

523
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:09,153
- You don't seem to gain weight. - Jun Hyuk gains weight easily.

524
00:18:09,177 --> 00:18:11,378
I don't really gain weight that easily.

525
00:18:11,647 --> 00:18:14,588
But I lost a lot of fat around my face in "When the Phone Rings."

526
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:16,987
- During the shoot. - That's...

527
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:18,427
I'm jealous.

528
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,557
(An envious trait for the food-loving Jun Hyuk)

529
00:18:22,558 --> 00:18:25,098
Ji Min ate something late last night.

530
00:18:25,298 --> 00:18:27,827
That's why my face is slightly puffy today.

531
00:18:27,828 --> 00:18:29,568
Ji Min deliberately...

532
00:18:29,967 --> 00:18:32,967
eats something the night before to not look drawn.

533
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,077
- There are people like that. - I wasn't like that before.

534
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:38,377
But I recently kept losing the fat around my face...

535
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:40,048
- because of fatigue. - I get it.

536
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:41,877
Some viewers might think,

537
00:18:41,878 --> 00:18:43,916
"I'm jealous. What's with her?"

538
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:46,117
They say, "Why would she say that?"

539
00:18:46,118 --> 00:18:48,088
- Right? - But here's the thing.

540
00:18:48,147 --> 00:18:51,628
Some people look drawn if they don't eat.

541
00:18:52,487 --> 00:18:53,628
I'm always jealous.

542
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:57,797
- We have to be there by 12pm? - Yes.

543
00:18:57,798 --> 00:18:59,927
- We'll make it on time. - We will.

544
00:19:00,028 --> 00:19:02,337
This is really amusing.

545
00:19:02,338 --> 00:19:03,838
- What is? - We don't...

546
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,236
often meet the submitter out of the blue.

547
00:19:06,237 --> 00:19:07,436
- This is so nice. - Now that I think about it.

548
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,878
It's like the old days of "You Quiz on the Block."

549
00:19:10,477 --> 00:19:13,677
I hope we can help them start the new year...

550
00:19:13,907 --> 00:19:15,518
with good memories.

551
00:19:15,977 --> 00:19:18,017
- I bet... - Right?

552
00:19:18,018 --> 00:19:19,617
- I'll feel really bad... - Those feelings...

553
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:20,947
- if I fail. - You'll be...

554
00:19:21,957 --> 00:19:23,387
going home with those feelings.

555
00:19:23,388 --> 00:19:24,788
(Calm)

556
00:19:25,288 --> 00:19:27,787
They must hate me...

557
00:19:27,788 --> 00:19:29,397
whenever I'm on TV.

558
00:19:30,298 --> 00:19:33,226
The submitters understand all of it. But...

559
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:34,426
- "But." - But still.

560
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:36,667
It's a bummer as the prize disappears before their eyes.

561
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:39,907
My heart is already pounding.

562
00:19:41,068 --> 00:19:42,608
How do you do this every week?

563
00:19:42,707 --> 00:19:45,308
- You are already nervous? - Yes, right now...

564
00:19:45,677 --> 00:19:49,217
- Wait. It's a public health center. - I see. It's Dongjak Health Center.

565
00:19:49,348 --> 00:19:50,847
It says Health Pharmaceutical Department.

566
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:51,928
(There's a new group here?)

567
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:54,186
- Health Pharmaceutical Department. - All right. We've arrived.

568
00:19:54,187 --> 00:19:56,216
- Let's go. You got this, Jun Hyuk. - Thank you.

569
00:19:56,217 --> 00:19:57,487
You can ace the games, right?

570
00:19:57,917 --> 00:19:59,358
That was a smooth ride.

571
00:19:59,427 --> 00:20:00,857
- Thank you. - Right?

572
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:01,858
Sure.

573
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:04,857
It's on the second floor, right?

574
00:20:04,858 --> 00:20:06,898
(Entering as her perfect secretary escorts her in.)

575
00:20:07,227 --> 00:20:09,236
- What? Are you nervous? - Nothing.

576
00:20:09,237 --> 00:20:10,936
- No. - Why are you suddenly...

577
00:20:10,937 --> 00:20:13,084
- Jun Hyuk, why are you so nervous? - Why did you suddenly get so quiet?

578
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:14,907
- We didn't even start yet. - What?

579
00:20:15,237 --> 00:20:16,754
We didn't even start. Why are you so nervous?

580
00:20:16,778 --> 00:20:18,577
- I rarely come outside. - Hello.

581
00:20:18,578 --> 00:20:19,658
- You don't come out? - No.

582
00:20:19,778 --> 00:20:22,916
- Jun Hyuk, wave at them. - Hello.

583
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,317
- You look so young. - Jun Hyuk...

584
00:20:24,318 --> 00:20:25,487
She said you looked young.

585
00:20:26,217 --> 00:20:28,288
There is a health center, indeed.

586
00:20:28,987 --> 00:20:31,227
- What was her name? - Health Pharmaceutical Department.

587
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:33,387
- You have to turn left. - There are three people.

588
00:20:33,388 --> 00:20:35,127
- It's that way. - I see. Hello.

589
00:20:35,128 --> 00:20:36,226
- Hello. - Hello.

590
00:20:36,227 --> 00:20:37,357
- Hello. - I see. It's this way.

591
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:38,804
- Health Pharmaceutical Department. - This is the place.

592
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:39,868
Lim Eun Bin.

593
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:42,068
Kang Na Rae. Ma Ye Rim.

594
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,696
- Hello. - Kim Eun Bin.

595
00:20:43,697 --> 00:20:45,367
- Kim Eun Bin? - This is the place.

596
00:20:45,368 --> 00:20:47,236
- Hello. - Hello.

597
00:20:47,237 --> 00:20:48,437
- Hello. - Yes.

598
00:20:48,507 --> 00:20:49,878
Nice to meet you. Goodness.

599
00:20:50,108 --> 00:20:51,947
- Your outfits are totally ready. - Hello.

600
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:54,646
- Hello. - Your outfits are ready for TV.

601
00:20:54,647 --> 00:20:56,117
- Hello. - Hello.

602
00:20:56,118 --> 00:20:57,378
- Gosh. Oh, no. - My goodness.

603
00:20:58,247 --> 00:21:00,047
(Kang Na Rae, Ma Ye Rim, Lim Eun Bin)

604
00:21:00,048 --> 00:21:01,548
(First Whenever Guests)

605
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:04,617
First of all, thank you for spending your spare time with us.

606
00:21:04,618 --> 00:21:06,486
- Hello. - Hello.

607
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:08,396
- Jun Hyuk and Ji Min are here too. - Hello.

608
00:21:08,397 --> 00:21:09,426
- Hello. - Hello.

609
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:10,827
And as usual, Yeon Seok and I are here.

610
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:13,628
- Yeon Seok and I are here. - My goodness. It's so fascinating.

611
00:21:13,798 --> 00:21:14,996
- He's so handsome. - What's so fascinating?

612
00:21:14,997 --> 00:21:17,213
- This is so fascinating. - Jun Hyuk is handsome, is he not?

613
00:21:17,237 --> 00:21:19,437
- Yes. You're both handsome. - Isn't he handsome?

614
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:22,608
- Isn't Jae Suk handsome too? - Yes. He is.

615
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,476
- Ji Min is pretty too. - Yes.

616
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:25,608
- Ji Min. - Yes.

617
00:21:26,048 --> 00:21:27,646
So the three of you work...

618
00:21:27,647 --> 00:21:29,416
in the Health Pharmaceutical Department.

619
00:21:29,417 --> 00:21:30,646
- Yes. - Could you tell us...

620
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:31,848
about the department?

621
00:21:33,247 --> 00:21:35,257
- Well... Yes. - Could you explain it?

622
00:21:35,358 --> 00:21:36,787
They're truly shy.

623
00:21:36,788 --> 00:21:38,357
- I didn't expect this. - Well, I'm sorry.

624
00:21:38,358 --> 00:21:39,727
But you wrote you guys were hyper.

625
00:21:40,128 --> 00:21:42,156
- How is this being hyper? - You wrote you got excited easily.

626
00:21:42,157 --> 00:21:44,226
- Remember what I said? - Yes.

627
00:21:44,227 --> 00:21:45,567
- We're not ready yet. - Gosh.

628
00:21:45,568 --> 00:21:47,726
- We didn't warm up yet. - I see.

629
00:21:47,727 --> 00:21:48,936
Our department handles...

630
00:21:48,937 --> 00:21:52,466
civil complaints related to the Pharmaceutical Affairs Act,

631
00:21:52,467 --> 00:21:55,307
the Medical Service Act, and the Medical Devices Act.

632
00:21:55,308 --> 00:21:58,747
We also conduct many projects related to CPR and so on.

633
00:21:59,247 --> 00:22:02,317
- So you guys work in Dongjak-gu. - Yes.

634
00:22:02,318 --> 00:22:03,947
Actually, Ji Min was...

635
00:22:04,078 --> 00:22:05,617
born and raised here.

636
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:06,618
- Really? - Really?

637
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:07,646
- For three generations. - I'm from Heukseok-dong.

638
00:22:07,647 --> 00:22:08,756
- For three generations. - Heukseok-dong.

639
00:22:08,757 --> 00:22:10,818
- Her grandfather, her father, - Then when...

640
00:22:11,187 --> 00:22:12,357
and Ji Min.

641
00:22:12,358 --> 00:22:14,727
- My sister and aunt. - Why didn't the district know?

642
00:22:15,328 --> 00:22:17,397
- We know that Kim Yuna lives here. - What?

643
00:22:18,028 --> 00:22:19,726
- I see. Yuna. - I ought to...

644
00:22:19,727 --> 00:22:21,496
- She moved here, didn't she? - do better with my career.

645
00:22:21,497 --> 00:22:22,896
- My gosh, Ji Min. - Yes.

646
00:22:22,897 --> 00:22:24,436
- Yuna lives here. - Her family has been here...

647
00:22:24,437 --> 00:22:26,514
- for three generations. - You can't beat her. You know?

648
00:22:26,538 --> 00:22:27,767
There's nothing you can do.

649
00:22:27,768 --> 00:22:29,037
She is the pride of Dongjak-gu.

650
00:22:29,038 --> 00:22:31,778
I would like to address the many residents in Dongjak-gu.

651
00:22:31,878 --> 00:22:33,977
Ji Min is a local here.

652
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:35,747
Actually, I moved now.

653
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:37,617
She doesn't live here anymore.

654
00:22:37,618 --> 00:22:39,186
- That explains why we didn't know. - Right.

655
00:22:39,187 --> 00:22:40,547
- I see. Current residents. - Current residents are important.

656
00:22:40,548 --> 00:22:41,857
- Current residents. - Current residents?

657
00:22:41,858 --> 00:22:43,287
- That's important. - Right. It is.

658
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:44,388
You guys are so exact.

659
00:22:44,487 --> 00:22:46,257
So in the letter, it said...

660
00:22:46,657 --> 00:22:50,627
you made your debut eight months ago on national TV.

661
00:22:50,628 --> 00:22:53,567
- We were thinking that maybe... - That's correct.

662
00:22:53,568 --> 00:22:55,167
You were on "Korea Sings."

663
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:56,767
- You guessed right. - Really?

664
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,867
- We were precise. - My gosh.

665
00:22:57,868 --> 00:22:59,466
- I guessed correctly. - Gosh.

666
00:22:59,467 --> 00:23:01,007
- He's indeed the best. - No way.

667
00:23:01,108 --> 00:23:02,637
We actually prepared...

668
00:23:02,638 --> 00:23:04,236
for the preliminary round right here.

669
00:23:04,237 --> 00:23:05,347
- Right. - I see.

670
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,976
What was the name of your group on the show? What was it?

671
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:10,746
We combined Dongjak and girls.

672
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,617
- So we were Dongjak Girls. - I see.

673
00:23:12,618 --> 00:23:15,186
We actually wanted to promote CPR on the show.

674
00:23:15,187 --> 00:23:17,017
That's why we wanted to participate.

675
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:19,287
CPR is very important these days.

676
00:23:19,288 --> 00:23:20,357
It is.

677
00:23:20,358 --> 00:23:21,827
So we formed a group and participated in the show.

678
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:23,097
How was the result?

679
00:23:23,098 --> 00:23:25,327
The result... Well, we passed the preliminary round.

680
00:23:25,328 --> 00:23:27,396
- So we were on TV. - I see.

681
00:23:27,397 --> 00:23:28,896
But we just had a blast.

682
00:23:28,897 --> 00:23:30,367
(But we just had a blast.)

683
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:32,507
Which song did you choose to perform on the show?

684
00:23:32,568 --> 00:23:34,038
"Honey Honey."

685
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,406
- "Honey Honey?" - "Honey Honey."

686
00:23:35,407 --> 00:23:38,108
- The one by Seo Ji O. - Honey, do you love me?

687
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:39,778
I see.

688
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,617
- Which year was this? - My gosh.

689
00:23:42,618 --> 00:23:43,716
- It was last April. - It was in 2024.

690
00:23:43,717 --> 00:23:44,976
- In 2024? - I see.

691
00:23:44,977 --> 00:23:46,617
- When Nam Hee Suk was the MC? - I should look it up.

692
00:23:46,618 --> 00:23:48,118
- Yes. - The episode in Dongjak-gu.

693
00:23:48,288 --> 00:23:49,617
(CPR!)

694
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:51,156
(Showcasing their theme intensely)

695
00:23:51,157 --> 00:23:53,328
(Ma Ye Rim, Kang Na Rae, Lim Eun Bin)

696
00:23:53,727 --> 00:23:57,027
After your episode aired, did you feel any popularity?

697
00:23:57,028 --> 00:23:58,827
- Within our district, - Yes.

698
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:00,297
We experienced some popularity.

699
00:24:00,298 --> 00:24:01,896
- Like how? - Well...

700
00:24:01,897 --> 00:24:03,466
- I... - Some people recognized us.

701
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,268
- Pardon? - Some people recognized us.

702
00:24:05,538 --> 00:24:08,137
Of course, we are famous within our health center.

703
00:24:08,138 --> 00:24:10,537
And when we have to work outside the office for some projects,

704
00:24:10,538 --> 00:24:12,807
some people do recognize us from the show.

705
00:24:12,808 --> 00:24:15,047
I was appointed here last December.

706
00:24:15,048 --> 00:24:17,176
So I didn't know a lot of my colleagues here.

707
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:20,288
But when I go to the restroom, people say, "You're that star."

708
00:24:20,818 --> 00:24:22,787
So it's a bit iffy to go to the restroom.

709
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:24,756
- Well, you must know... - She's cute.

710
00:24:24,757 --> 00:24:26,327
As you experienced popularity,

711
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,327
- but it dies down fast. - I see.

712
00:24:28,328 --> 00:24:29,456
- Right. - Yes.

713
00:24:29,457 --> 00:24:30,858
- You were spot on. - So...

714
00:24:31,528 --> 00:24:33,427
Popularity is like a bubble.

715
00:24:33,628 --> 00:24:35,028
We all know that.

716
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,166
- You're really popular now. - Gosh, no.

717
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:38,807
This could die down at any minute.

718
00:24:38,808 --> 00:24:39,867
If we lose the momentum,

719
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,148
- it dies down quickly. - Right.

720
00:24:41,308 --> 00:24:42,676
- We must always be humble. - Yes.

721
00:24:42,677 --> 00:24:44,278
Jun Hyuk. Why...

722
00:24:44,338 --> 00:24:46,207
Why do you keep wiping your palms?

723
00:24:46,378 --> 00:24:47,747
Why are you nervous?

724
00:24:48,147 --> 00:24:50,647
I rarely come outside like this.

725
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:54,388
It feels surreal that I'm meeting you.

726
00:24:54,848 --> 00:24:58,157
Jun Hyuk. How could you be more nervous than the ladies here?

727
00:24:58,518 --> 00:25:00,327
- His face got paler. - It got paler.

728
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,557
Could you perform CPR on Jun Hyuk?

729
00:25:02,558 --> 00:25:04,027
(His palms never stay dry.)

730
00:25:04,028 --> 00:25:05,097
You wrote in the letter that...

731
00:25:05,098 --> 00:25:06,926
- you guys were cheerful. - Yes.

732
00:25:06,927 --> 00:25:10,367
Are you guys usually cheerful and hyper?

733
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:12,406
Yes. We're always hyper.

734
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:14,608
- We always want to be on TV. - Right now...

735
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,607
- You want to be on TV? - Yes.

736
00:25:17,608 --> 00:25:19,308
What kind of TV show do you want to be on?

737
00:25:19,447 --> 00:25:21,676
- Well, can I tell you? - A show like this.

738
00:25:21,677 --> 00:25:23,476
- Yes. - It was "You Quiz on the Block."

739
00:25:23,477 --> 00:25:24,746
We wanted to be famous as non-celebrities...

740
00:25:24,747 --> 00:25:26,018
and star on that show.

741
00:25:26,388 --> 00:25:27,517
I'm sorry.

742
00:25:27,518 --> 00:25:29,357
- That's too much pressure. - It's all right.

743
00:25:29,358 --> 00:25:30,787
- Jae Suk is here. - It's all right.

744
00:25:30,788 --> 00:25:33,557
You can do everything you wanted to do on "You Quiz on the Block."

745
00:25:33,558 --> 00:25:36,058
Right. What did you want to do on the show?

746
00:25:37,098 --> 00:25:38,197
What?

747
00:25:38,528 --> 00:25:41,196
She wrote that she would show all of her special talents if we asked.

748
00:25:41,197 --> 00:25:43,798
Can we ask what kind of special talents you have?

749
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:46,868
(Everyone freezes.)

750
00:25:47,368 --> 00:25:48,907
- You know... - Right.

751
00:25:49,138 --> 00:25:50,337
- So... - You didn't prepare anything.

752
00:25:50,338 --> 00:25:51,338
- Right? - No.

753
00:25:51,339 --> 00:25:52,906
- No, that's not true. - Did you prepare something?

754
00:25:52,907 --> 00:25:54,577
Actually, we're not that talented.

755
00:25:54,578 --> 00:25:57,746
But after starring in "Korea Sings," I wanted to find my talent.

756
00:25:57,747 --> 00:25:59,746
So I've been going to a dance academy.

757
00:25:59,747 --> 00:26:00,888
- A dance academy? - Yes.

758
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,387
What are you practicing...

759
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:04,456
- these days? - We're practicing "Whiplash" now.

760
00:26:04,457 --> 00:26:05,686
- "Whiplash?" - "Whiplash."

761
00:26:05,687 --> 00:26:07,456
The choreography is difficult. You have to bend your neck.

762
00:26:07,457 --> 00:26:08,587
- Can you do it? - It's not that.

763
00:26:08,588 --> 00:26:09,668
(Correcting him right away)

764
00:26:10,457 --> 00:26:11,558
Can you do it?

765
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:13,868
- What? - Right. I meant that.

766
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:16,966
- That's when you get a neck cramp. - Right.

767
00:26:16,967 --> 00:26:18,544
- A neck cramp. - Like a herniated disk.

768
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:20,936
- "A herniated disk." - How much of it did you learn?

769
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:23,038
Well, just the chorus part.

770
00:26:23,278 --> 00:26:24,878
- The chorus part. - I see.

771
00:26:25,108 --> 00:26:26,677
- The highlight? - Yes.

772
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:28,347
- This part. The highlight. - I can't do the whole choreography.

773
00:26:28,348 --> 00:26:30,646
- Could you show us a snippet? - Just the highlight.

774
00:26:30,647 --> 00:26:33,327
- Just up to the part you learned. - Which camera should I look at?

775
00:26:33,687 --> 00:26:34,746
- Right here. - I see.

776
00:26:34,747 --> 00:26:36,557
- I can look at this camera? Okay. - Yes.

777
00:26:36,558 --> 00:26:38,117
- She's so funny. - Hold on.

778
00:26:38,118 --> 00:26:40,127
- Here's the thing. She learned it. - We'll play the song.

779
00:26:40,128 --> 00:26:41,557
- You can play "Whiplash." - I learned it.

780
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:42,656
- You learned it. - I must make use of it.

781
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:44,156
- They'll play the song. - My husband...

782
00:26:44,157 --> 00:26:46,996
You can play it exactly 30 seconds into the song.

783
00:26:46,997 --> 00:26:48,226
- I see, 30 seconds? - Yes.

784
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:49,966
She knows her stuff. Thirty seconds.

785
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,098
That's impressive.

786
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,666
(A handshake with the fan)

787
00:26:52,667 --> 00:26:53,868
Thank you.

788
00:26:54,437 --> 00:26:56,237
What did your husband say about this?

789
00:26:56,507 --> 00:26:58,746
"It's a waste of money. When could that possibly come in handy?"

790
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:00,307
- Right now. - Right now.

791
00:27:00,308 --> 00:27:02,324
- I need to go all out today. - This will come in handy now.

792
00:27:02,348 --> 00:27:03,577
- I'll just dance for a bit. - Yes.

793
00:27:03,578 --> 00:27:04,847
I'm not that good of a dancer.

794
00:27:04,848 --> 00:27:07,717
- All right. We ought to see it. - Yes.

795
00:27:07,818 --> 00:27:08,857
Move to the front.

796
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:10,717
(Preparing)

797
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:12,788
This is the part now.

798
00:27:12,927 --> 00:27:14,057
It's coming up soon.

799
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:15,058
She's about to do...

800
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,539
- the neck-cramp part. - There it is.

801
00:27:26,338 --> 00:27:27,568
Gosh, her back...

802
00:27:28,407 --> 00:27:30,737
(I can't watch this.)

803
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:32,777
(The main dancer keeps dancing.)

804
00:27:32,778 --> 00:27:35,007
- Her back... - You know what?

805
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:38,318
- I'm not done yet. - You're not done yet?

806
00:27:38,417 --> 00:27:41,187
(This is a dancing train without any brakes.)

807
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:44,518
(The signature dance move of "Whiplash")

808
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:47,288
(Shaking)

809
00:27:49,157 --> 00:27:50,157
(Joyfully giggling)

810
00:27:50,158 --> 00:27:51,718
She's making the facial expression too.

811
00:27:53,128 --> 00:27:54,827
My gosh. Is that the signature move?

812
00:27:54,828 --> 00:27:56,508
(Her dancing is right up Jae Suk's alley.)

813
00:27:59,308 --> 00:28:01,338
You're great.

814
00:28:01,707 --> 00:28:03,078
By the way, ma'am...

815
00:28:05,207 --> 00:28:07,407
(Startled)

816
00:28:08,147 --> 00:28:09,377
You were amazing.

817
00:28:09,378 --> 00:28:10,517
(The perfect finale)

818
00:28:10,518 --> 00:28:11,917
- You were incredible. - Oh, my.

819
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:14,048
Why is my face becoming red?

820
00:28:14,288 --> 00:28:16,208
- I'm the one getting embarrassed. - By the way,

821
00:28:16,257 --> 00:28:17,858
why is your face getting red?

822
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:19,486
- Ji Min. - You were so good.

823
00:28:19,487 --> 00:28:21,127
- You thought I was good, right? - Wait.

824
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:22,597
- You were great. - Why did your face get red?

825
00:28:22,598 --> 00:28:24,327
- Well... - I put myself in her shoes.

826
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,597
- I see. - You were amazing.

827
00:28:25,598 --> 00:28:26,828
- Jun Hyuk. - That's a relief.

828
00:28:26,868 --> 00:28:29,097
- Why is your face getting red? - What did you think?

829
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:30,497
What did you think of her dance?

830
00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:33,037
- Well... - Be honest, please.

831
00:28:33,038 --> 00:28:35,038
- It's all right. - You should tell her the truth.

832
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,477
Out of the blue, I saw some perfect dancing.

833
00:28:39,048 --> 00:28:40,348
You're lying.

834
00:28:40,947 --> 00:28:41,947
No.

835
00:28:42,378 --> 00:28:44,077
- Do you think I really did well? - She was great.

836
00:28:44,078 --> 00:28:45,078
- You were great. - Are you sure?

837
00:28:45,079 --> 00:28:47,647
- Okay. He pinched his hand so hard. - Wait.

838
00:28:49,788 --> 00:28:52,487
The other members of her group are quite flustered.

839
00:28:52,888 --> 00:28:54,627
- That's because... - They've never seen it either.

840
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:55,996
- Right. - It was our first time.

841
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:57,256
She's been preparing for it in secret.

842
00:28:57,257 --> 00:28:58,297
But you're in the same group.

843
00:28:58,298 --> 00:29:00,226
I only saw her dance with the mascot costume on.

844
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:01,896
But I've never seen her dance without it.

845
00:29:01,897 --> 00:29:02,996
- What costume? - A costume?

846
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:05,607
We have a mascot costume for our district, Dongjak-gu.

847
00:29:05,608 --> 00:29:06,767
It's called Dongjak.

848
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:08,666
And when we were on "Korea Sings,"

849
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,907
I had to dance with the costume on.

850
00:29:10,977 --> 00:29:12,506
- I see. Your face wasn't on TV. - My face wasn't on TV.

851
00:29:12,507 --> 00:29:14,146
- I see. That's disappointing. - Right.

852
00:29:14,147 --> 00:29:15,746
Actually, she wasn't a main member of the group.

853
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:16,747
But she worked hard...

854
00:29:16,748 --> 00:29:18,824
- She wasn't the main member. - You suddenly drew a line.

855
00:29:18,848 --> 00:29:20,017
- You can't do this to me. - So you think...

856
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:22,138
- she doesn't know her place, right? - That's not it.

857
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:24,087
- No. - She's not even the main member.

858
00:29:24,088 --> 00:29:26,157
- No. - But she danced to "Whiplash."

859
00:29:26,257 --> 00:29:28,726
You know what? Personally, I think this is quite positive.

860
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:30,657
They have so much fun energy and great talent.

861
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,696
- They must let it out somewhere. - Yes.

862
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:36,696
So you guys work for Dongjak-gu.

863
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:39,407
What are some things Dongjak-gu is proud of?

864
00:29:39,638 --> 00:29:42,777
There are many famous spots all over Dongjak-gu.

865
00:29:42,778 --> 00:29:44,236
- Seoul National Cemetery for one. - Yes.

866
00:29:44,237 --> 00:29:45,676
- There are other places like... - Right.

867
00:29:45,677 --> 00:29:47,206
Noryangjin Fisheries Wholesale Market.

868
00:29:47,207 --> 00:29:49,777
So our district is very lively.

869
00:29:49,778 --> 00:29:51,077
- That's how I feel. - I see.

870
00:29:51,078 --> 00:29:52,747
Right. That's true.

871
00:29:52,848 --> 00:29:56,256
Ye Rim. You said you were appointed here last December.

872
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,457
- Correct? - Yes.

873
00:29:57,818 --> 00:29:59,327
So it's been a year since you worked here.

874
00:29:59,328 --> 00:30:01,387
- Yes. - What is it like to work here?

875
00:30:01,388 --> 00:30:03,956
When I first came to the office,

876
00:30:03,957 --> 00:30:06,074
it felt like a typical office in a government branch.

877
00:30:06,098 --> 00:30:08,397
But when we were preparing for "Korea Sings,"

878
00:30:08,467 --> 00:30:10,966
our department colleagues seemed to enjoy that too.

879
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:13,206
They liked it. And now that we've bonded more as a team,

880
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:15,138
the atmosphere in our office is lively.

881
00:30:15,207 --> 00:30:16,608
- That's how it changed. - Yes.

882
00:30:16,677 --> 00:30:18,676
Anyway, "Korea Sings" brought...

883
00:30:18,677 --> 00:30:21,206
- many changes to you. - Right.

884
00:30:21,207 --> 00:30:22,623
- Could you perform "Honey Honey?" - Sure.

885
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:23,976
- Let's check it out. - Didn't you perform it together?

886
00:30:23,977 --> 00:30:25,317
- Yes. - Could you perform it together?

887
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:27,118
- What you did for the show. - "Honey Honey."

888
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:29,617
It's been a while. I hope they didn't forget it.

889
00:30:29,618 --> 00:30:32,017
- Here's your spot. - They're indeed cheerful.

890
00:30:32,018 --> 00:30:33,956
- Which part do you want for this? - It's the other way around.

891
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:35,527
Did we start from the beginning?

892
00:30:35,528 --> 00:30:37,098
- We can start from the top. - Yes.

893
00:30:37,858 --> 00:30:39,367
- It's by Seo Ji O. - I think this is incredible.

894
00:30:39,368 --> 00:30:41,097
- Yes. - Dancing in front of everyone...

895
00:30:41,098 --> 00:30:42,098
Of course.

896
00:30:42,099 --> 00:30:43,643
- This isn't an easy thing to do. - Right.

897
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,268
- There are so many cameras. - Yes.

898
00:30:46,207 --> 00:30:48,768
(This performance marked the beginning of Dongjak Girls.)

899
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:50,878
(It begins now!)

900
00:30:56,818 --> 00:30:57,818
(Shaking)

901
00:30:59,987 --> 00:31:01,088
Oh, no.

902
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:04,417
They indeed deserve to be stars.

903
00:31:04,788 --> 00:31:06,127
They totally deserve it.

904
00:31:06,128 --> 00:31:07,828
("Honey Honey")

905
00:31:08,358 --> 00:31:11,298
(She's still as passionate as she was on her debut stage.)

906
00:31:12,268 --> 00:31:14,368
(It calls for a standing ovation.)

907
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:16,736
(Perfectly humming it live)

908
00:31:16,737 --> 00:31:17,737
(Humming)

909
00:31:18,437 --> 00:31:20,368
I love this kind of performance.

910
00:31:21,068 --> 00:31:22,808
I love it.

911
00:31:23,138 --> 00:31:24,937
I love performances like this.

912
00:31:25,237 --> 00:31:26,406
So you wore a mascot costume onstage.

913
00:31:26,407 --> 00:31:29,018
- Right. It was a heavy costume. - She wore a costume.

914
00:31:29,618 --> 00:31:32,146
(Her disappointment of being a faceless singer...)

915
00:31:32,147 --> 00:31:34,087
(shall be relieved today.)

916
00:31:34,088 --> 00:31:35,187
This is fascinating.

917
00:31:36,657 --> 00:31:38,388
(Engrossed in their performance)

918
00:31:38,757 --> 00:31:40,558
I feel alive today...

919
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:41,987
thanks to the three of them.

920
00:31:42,288 --> 00:31:44,128
This is why I star on variety shows.

921
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,207
They're so into it.

922
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:58,277
(Her pride of Dongjak-gu swells.)

923
00:31:58,278 --> 00:31:59,807
- Great. They're excellent. - I love it.

924
00:31:59,808 --> 00:32:01,577
- My gosh, they're great. - This is great.

925
00:32:01,578 --> 00:32:02,617
(During this chaotic performance)

926
00:32:02,618 --> 00:32:04,947
- Hey, look at Jun Hyuk. - They're so into it.

927
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:06,887
- Look at him. - Wait.

928
00:32:06,888 --> 00:32:08,248
(Jun Hyuk has been keeping quiet.)

929
00:32:08,348 --> 00:32:10,388
(A special move for the fan)

930
00:32:11,417 --> 00:32:12,456
Jun Hyuk.

931
00:32:12,457 --> 00:32:13,933
(Is he praying that it will end soon?)

932
00:32:13,957 --> 00:32:15,187
- This is hilarious. - Right.

933
00:32:16,028 --> 00:32:17,527
- Give them a round of applause. - Yes.

934
00:32:17,528 --> 00:32:19,427
(Dongjak Girls' performance was touching.)

935
00:32:19,467 --> 00:32:21,997
(Getting up right away)

936
00:32:23,598 --> 00:32:25,496
My gosh, that was just amazing.

937
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:26,867
- You guys are so impressive. - Jun Hyuk.

938
00:32:26,868 --> 00:32:28,467
- My goodness. - I mean it.

939
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:30,807
- I'm out of breath. I'm tired. - That's amazing.

940
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:31,877
(The new girl group has guts on a different level.)

941
00:32:31,878 --> 00:32:34,646
- You laughed genuinely, right? - Yes, totally. They're amazing.

942
00:32:34,647 --> 00:32:37,018
Ji Min loved it.

943
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:38,976
- When they were sitting down, - Seriously.

944
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,686
- Yes? - I couldn't understand that...

945
00:32:40,687 --> 00:32:42,246
- they were a cheerful bunch. - Right.

946
00:32:42,247 --> 00:32:44,256
But the moment I saw you dance to the song, "Honey Honey,"

947
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:46,156
I understood right away.

948
00:32:46,157 --> 00:32:47,926
This performance by them...

949
00:32:47,927 --> 00:32:49,657
- is priceless. - Right.

950
00:32:49,828 --> 00:32:51,028
Seriously. That was so fun.

951
00:32:51,298 --> 00:32:53,828
By the way, their dance moves weren't in perfect sync.

952
00:32:53,967 --> 00:32:56,137
- Gosh, she's sharp. - That's real dancing.

953
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:57,236
It really was fun.

954
00:32:57,237 --> 00:32:58,538
What did you think, Jun Hyuk?

955
00:32:58,697 --> 00:33:01,037
For some reason, it felt very surreal.

956
00:33:01,038 --> 00:33:02,068
"Surreal?"

957
00:33:02,878 --> 00:33:04,677
- No, but it is very much real. - Yes.

958
00:33:04,707 --> 00:33:05,777
This is...

959
00:33:05,778 --> 00:33:07,777
(Experiencing a new world)

960
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,778
But why do you keep praying?

961
00:33:10,378 --> 00:33:12,416
- Jun Hyuk. - Yes?

962
00:33:12,417 --> 00:33:15,247
He wasn't the one performing, but he was so nervous.

963
00:33:15,818 --> 00:33:17,757
"I really hope they do well."

964
00:33:17,917 --> 00:33:20,727
Well, I have met Ji Min on other shows...

965
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:23,227
and filmed together before.

966
00:33:23,358 --> 00:33:25,456
- That was her genuine laughter. - Right. It was so fun.

967
00:33:25,457 --> 00:33:27,028
Right? Yes.

968
00:33:27,098 --> 00:33:28,827
All right. Anyway, we're here.

969
00:33:28,828 --> 00:33:30,774
- Let's do well on our mission. - The new year...

970
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:32,706
- They are... - I'm nervous.

971
00:33:32,707 --> 00:33:34,267
Our first Whenever Guests in the new year.

972
00:33:34,268 --> 00:33:36,406
- We ought to give them presents. - I want to give them many presents.

973
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,436
Sounds good. Let's do our best.

974
00:33:38,437 --> 00:33:40,223
- Let's do this. - All right. We must do well.

975
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:42,048
- What's the first present? - All right.

976
00:33:42,548 --> 00:33:44,977
Please break the fortune cookie for Round One.

977
00:33:45,278 --> 00:33:46,417
- Gosh. - It's big.

978
00:33:46,848 --> 00:33:47,887
(Opening the present for Round 1)

979
00:33:47,888 --> 00:33:49,857
- This is for the Dongjak Girls. - Read it.

980
00:33:49,858 --> 00:33:51,787
"Everyone can enjoy it together in the office."

981
00:33:51,788 --> 00:33:54,987
"A toaster and a coffee machine from BALMUDA."

982
00:33:55,558 --> 00:33:56,558
- We need them. - A coffee machine too?

983
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,097
- Yes. A toaster and a coffee maker. - Right here.

984
00:33:58,098 --> 00:33:59,396
(Enjoy some bread and coffee in the office.)

985
00:33:59,397 --> 00:34:03,236
(A toaster and a coffee machine)

986
00:34:03,237 --> 00:34:04,936
A coffee machine on top of that too?

987
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:06,006
- My gosh. - No way.

988
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:07,236
(There are two prizes.)

989
00:34:07,237 --> 00:34:08,808
- Oh, my. - What?

990
00:34:09,067 --> 00:34:11,207
- All right. Great. Yes. - This is amazing.

991
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:12,977
Was there a time when you failed to pass Round One?

992
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:13,978
Yes.

993
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:16,423
- We got this. - That could happen.

994
00:34:16,447 --> 00:34:17,917
- Let's go. - All right.

995
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:19,546
The new year has begun. It's 2025.

996
00:34:19,547 --> 00:34:21,216
- We must start it on a good note. - My gosh.

997
00:34:21,217 --> 00:34:22,887
- You know, I want to give... - Yes.

998
00:34:22,888 --> 00:34:23,917
A lot of presents to our first guests.

999
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,057
All right. What do we have to do?

1000
00:34:25,058 --> 00:34:26,986
(2 prizes are at stake on this mission.)

1001
00:34:26,987 --> 00:34:29,327
(Eraser Wrestling)

1002
00:34:29,328 --> 00:34:30,557
(They will take turns flicking the eraser.)

1003
00:34:30,558 --> 00:34:34,566
(They must land it on the target eraser to succeed.)

1004
00:34:34,567 --> 00:34:37,337
- Right here? - Yes. You must flick the other one.

1005
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:38,868
- Gosh, this... - I see.

1006
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:40,906
So we each get one chance to move the eraser.

1007
00:34:40,907 --> 00:34:43,507
- Yes. Someone else must go next. - The next person will go next.

1008
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,977
- That's really hard. - I see. On the eraser...

1009
00:34:45,978 --> 00:34:48,046
- Does it have to be... - The whole thing must be on it?

1010
00:34:48,047 --> 00:34:49,078
Yes.

1011
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:50,748
- What? - A long time ago...

1012
00:34:51,118 --> 00:34:52,376
What about this? Is this acceptable?

1013
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:54,247
- So that will count? - The last player...

1014
00:34:54,248 --> 00:34:56,608
I used to play this eraser game a lot when I was in school.

1015
00:34:56,987 --> 00:34:58,756
- There was not much to do. - Right.

1016
00:34:58,757 --> 00:34:59,827
We used to play games...

1017
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:01,268
- with erasers and pencils. - Right.

1018
00:35:01,587 --> 00:35:03,458
- So... I see. - Yes.

1019
00:35:03,857 --> 00:35:04,998
- What? - You did it.

1020
00:35:05,297 --> 00:35:07,737
If we place it horizontally when we start, it takes too long.

1021
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,437
- We must place it vertically. - Vertically first.

1022
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:10,897
- Right. - We use the length of it.

1023
00:35:10,898 --> 00:35:12,168
- I see. Like this. - Then...

1024
00:35:14,438 --> 00:35:16,176
I think Jun Hyuk is good...

1025
00:35:16,177 --> 00:35:18,107
- at board games and stuff. - This won't count?

1026
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:19,776
They'll win the presents, right?

1027
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,457
- What? - They'll win the presents, right?

1028
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,077
- All right. - It would be great to succeed...

1029
00:35:23,078 --> 00:35:24,847
- in the right number of tries. - So we all got to practice.

1030
00:35:24,848 --> 00:35:26,188
How should we decide the order?

1031
00:35:26,717 --> 00:35:28,816
I think we have to be strategic about the order.

1032
00:35:28,817 --> 00:35:31,256
- You should go last. - You must go last. You were good.

1033
00:35:31,257 --> 00:35:32,257
You must go last.

1034
00:35:32,627 --> 00:35:35,388
(Imposing pressure on him as if they were waiting for it)

1035
00:35:35,688 --> 00:35:37,497
It's nerve-racking to go last.

1036
00:35:37,498 --> 00:35:38,656
- You go last. - Okay.

1037
00:35:38,657 --> 00:35:40,026
Should I go third?

1038
00:35:40,027 --> 00:35:41,267
- Yes. - I'll go first.

1039
00:35:41,268 --> 00:35:43,098
- You go 1st. I'll go 2nd. - Yes.

1040
00:35:43,268 --> 00:35:46,406
All right. Let's begin after a team cheer.

1041
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:47,566
- There are four of us, right? - Yes.

1042
00:35:47,567 --> 00:35:49,438
- Let's do a team cheer. - One...

1043
00:35:49,607 --> 00:35:51,307
- All right. In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1044
00:35:51,308 --> 00:35:52,308
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1045
00:35:52,309 --> 00:35:54,106
We're with the Dongjak Girls.

1046
00:35:54,107 --> 00:35:55,747
(Try number one)

1047
00:35:55,748 --> 00:35:57,376
(1st: Ji Min, 2nd: Jae Suk, 3rd: Yeon Seok, 4th: Jun Hyuk)

1048
00:35:57,377 --> 00:35:59,117
- Ji Min, you'll go first. - Yes.

1049
00:35:59,118 --> 00:36:00,317
Round One. Here we go.

1050
00:36:02,018 --> 00:36:03,057
Yes.

1051
00:36:03,058 --> 00:36:05,317
- It didn't move much. - It's okay.

1052
00:36:05,618 --> 00:36:07,787
- It's okay. - Why didn't it go far?

1053
00:36:07,788 --> 00:36:09,026
- I thought... - Is this what you had in mind?

1054
00:36:09,027 --> 00:36:10,458
No, I thought it would go far.

1055
00:36:10,657 --> 00:36:13,066
(The 1st try, Number 2, Jae Suk)

1056
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,296
- It just flipped once. - It can't fall off the desk.

1057
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,268
- Your and my roles are important. - Right.

1058
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:21,798
- You could've flipped it harder. - That's a good spot. That's enough.

1059
00:36:22,007 --> 00:36:24,077
- The last one... - Gosh, this isn't easy.

1060
00:36:24,078 --> 00:36:25,538
Jun Hyuk, you practiced. Right?

1061
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:27,406
- Yes. - You should flip it harder.

1062
00:36:27,407 --> 00:36:29,077
Practicing it isn't the problem.

1063
00:36:29,078 --> 00:36:30,618
I will...

1064
00:36:30,947 --> 00:36:32,887
- I'll make it flip 2 or 3 times. - Yes.

1065
00:36:32,888 --> 00:36:35,047
- Make it flip twice. - What if I succeed?

1066
00:36:35,118 --> 00:36:36,617
- That's also allowed. - Hey. Then...

1067
00:36:36,618 --> 00:36:38,017
- I can finish it too? - Really?

1068
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:39,087
Then you can flip it hard.

1069
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:41,526
- Then I'll get it close. - It just can't go over.

1070
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:42,796
Or I'll get it on the target eraser. Okay.

1071
00:36:42,797 --> 00:36:43,828
So it doesn't fall off.

1072
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:47,844
- You got it. - What do you think?

1073
00:36:47,868 --> 00:36:48,868
- But... - Hey, this is...

1074
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:49,937
- I think he can do it. - But the thing is,

1075
00:36:49,938 --> 00:36:51,466
- the angle... - Do it from the side.

1076
00:36:51,467 --> 00:36:52,467
All right.

1077
00:36:52,468 --> 00:36:53,767
- You can flip it harder. - This is...

1078
00:36:53,768 --> 00:36:55,407
It should've turned this way.

1079
00:36:56,737 --> 00:36:59,018
- I'm sorry. It was my fault. - Well, that didn't happen.

1080
00:36:59,407 --> 00:37:00,676
- No, it's okay. - That didn't happen.

1081
00:37:00,677 --> 00:37:02,307
Just try to make it flip twice.

1082
00:37:02,308 --> 00:37:04,276
- I'll try it. - You can do this.

1083
00:37:04,277 --> 00:37:05,594
- Let's give him good energy! - You can do it.

1084
00:37:05,618 --> 00:37:07,147
- You got this. - You got this.

1085
00:37:07,148 --> 00:37:08,518
(The 1st try, Number 4, Jun Hyuk)

1086
00:37:09,087 --> 00:37:10,457
(Jun Hyuk is the last player who did well during practice.)

1087
00:37:10,458 --> 00:37:11,887
It's okay. We have many tries left.

1088
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:13,157
- Right. - It's our first try.

1089
00:37:14,587 --> 00:37:16,558
Gosh, I did it too hard.

1090
00:37:18,357 --> 00:37:19,367
(He fails.)

1091
00:37:19,368 --> 00:37:21,728
- That was too powerful. - We still have more tries left.

1092
00:37:22,498 --> 00:37:23,566
- I'm sorry. - Yes.

1093
00:37:23,567 --> 00:37:24,997
- Jun Hyuk... - It's okay.

1094
00:37:24,998 --> 00:37:26,667
Gets nervous when it's time to play.

1095
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:28,168
- Well, this... - Yes.

1096
00:37:28,337 --> 00:37:29,808
- In the beginning... - Yes.

1097
00:37:30,607 --> 00:37:31,776
- We should have gotten it here. - Right.

1098
00:37:31,777 --> 00:37:33,376
We need to control it around here.

1099
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:34,377
We must bring it close...

1100
00:37:34,378 --> 00:37:35,606
- in the 1st and 2nd flings. - We must start strong.

1101
00:37:35,607 --> 00:37:36,727
In the 1st and 2nd flings...

1102
00:37:37,078 --> 00:37:38,577
- Around here. Yes. - We must bring it close first.

1103
00:37:38,578 --> 00:37:40,046
- Right. From what I observed, - You can...

1104
00:37:40,047 --> 00:37:41,248
I should go first.

1105
00:37:42,018 --> 00:37:43,717
- Ji Min, you go second. - Okay.

1106
00:37:43,918 --> 00:37:45,133
- You'll go 3rd and 4th. - Yes.

1107
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:47,957
We'll go with our try number 2 for Round 1.

1108
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,126
- Don't worry. - Okay.

1109
00:37:49,127 --> 00:37:50,757
We'll pass Round One, Dongjak Girls.

1110
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:52,966
- All right. Try number two. - Okay.

1111
00:37:52,967 --> 00:37:54,667
Let's say it before we begin. In 1, 2, 3.

1112
00:37:54,668 --> 00:37:55,727
- Here we go. - Here we go.

1113
00:37:55,728 --> 00:37:56,836
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

1114
00:37:56,837 --> 00:37:59,506
(The 2nd try, Number 1, Jae Suk)

1115
00:37:59,507 --> 00:38:01,438
(Please get it as far as you can.)

1116
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,177
- That was great. - So that's it.

1117
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,006
(He manages to place it close to the target eraser.)

1118
00:38:08,007 --> 00:38:11,847
(The 2nd try, Number 2, Ji Min)

1119
00:38:11,848 --> 00:38:13,447
- You can finish it. - What?

1120
00:38:13,587 --> 00:38:14,687
- You can get it on the eraser. - That's allowed.

1121
00:38:14,688 --> 00:38:16,248
- You can do that too, Ji Min. - Right.

1122
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:19,463
It can go over the target eraser. It doesn't matter.

1123
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:21,257
That's it. It's okay.

1124
00:38:22,328 --> 00:38:24,356
(It lands right next to the target eraser.)

1125
00:38:24,357 --> 00:38:25,357
Then...

1126
00:38:25,358 --> 00:38:26,696
- It's too close. - Wait.

1127
00:38:26,697 --> 00:38:27,827
The direction should go that way.

1128
00:38:27,828 --> 00:38:29,498
- You should bring it here. - Yes.

1129
00:38:30,438 --> 00:38:31,736
- Put it on the eraser? - I think you can put it on there.

1130
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:32,868
What if it falls off...

1131
00:38:33,308 --> 00:38:35,007
But it won't go to the other side.

1132
00:38:36,138 --> 00:38:37,177
Okay.

1133
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:43,017
(He fails to put it on the target eraser in his turn.)

1134
00:38:43,018 --> 00:38:44,078
How's this?

1135
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,816
Yes. That's great.

1136
00:38:45,817 --> 00:38:47,364
- It's a bit close, right? - Is that what you wanted to do?

1137
00:38:47,388 --> 00:38:48,668
- It's a bit too close. - Right.

1138
00:38:49,248 --> 00:38:50,728
- It's a bit too close. - It's close.

1139
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:52,157
All right, Jun Hyuk.

1140
00:38:52,618 --> 00:38:53,856
- That's... - My gosh.

1141
00:38:53,857 --> 00:38:55,557
- Just follow your guts. - It's hard.

1142
00:38:55,558 --> 00:38:56,598
Just relax.

1143
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,427
Even if I send it here, it will go over the eraser.

1144
00:39:00,197 --> 00:39:01,498
It should go that way.

1145
00:39:02,268 --> 00:39:04,138
I didn't place it in a good angle.

1146
00:39:06,168 --> 00:39:09,308
Well, I keep hearing sighs from the Dongjak Girls.

1147
00:39:10,877 --> 00:39:12,107
Oh, no.

1148
00:39:13,478 --> 00:39:14,478
(Sighing)

1149
00:39:14,777 --> 00:39:16,618
- Just follow your gut. - Yes.

1150
00:39:17,377 --> 00:39:18,418
Okay.

1151
00:39:19,447 --> 00:39:21,817
(Trying to shake off his nervous tension)

1152
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:23,688
(Shaking)

1153
00:39:24,058 --> 00:39:25,657
He already gets nervous easily.

1154
00:39:26,927 --> 00:39:29,797
(The fate of Round 1 lies in Jun Hyuk's hands.)

1155
00:39:32,927 --> 00:39:35,227
(Their second try fails.)

1156
00:39:35,228 --> 00:39:36,367
- Nice try. - I got it.

1157
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:38,597
- There was nothing we could do. - It's okay.

1158
00:39:38,598 --> 00:39:40,437
- It's okay. - It's okay.

1159
00:39:40,438 --> 00:39:42,367
- As for the next try, - Oh, no.

1160
00:39:42,368 --> 00:39:44,207
- Should we change the order? - Should we?

1161
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:45,637
- Yes. - What order should we go in?

1162
00:39:45,638 --> 00:39:48,006
Choose the order for us, Dongjak Girls.

1163
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:49,007
Okay.

1164
00:39:49,008 --> 00:39:53,418
You should go first.

1165
00:39:55,748 --> 00:39:57,856
You're very clear.

1166
00:39:57,857 --> 00:39:59,727
- You'll go 1st. - You should go 1st.

1167
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:01,627
- And Yeon Seok should be second. - Second.

1168
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:03,256
- You should go third. - You want me to be last?

1169
00:40:03,257 --> 00:40:04,257
Yes.

1170
00:40:04,898 --> 00:40:06,827
- Let's give it a go. - Sounds good.

1171
00:40:06,828 --> 00:40:08,167
- That could be good. - That's really nice.

1172
00:40:08,168 --> 00:40:09,327
- That sounds good. - Oh, no.

1173
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:10,638
(The lineup that Eun Bin made)

1174
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:13,138
We need to pass Round One.

1175
00:40:13,268 --> 00:40:15,667
- Let's do a cheer. - We should've passed by now.

1176
00:40:15,668 --> 00:40:17,077
- What should I do? - In 1, 2, 3.

1177
00:40:17,078 --> 00:40:18,506
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1178
00:40:18,507 --> 00:40:19,507
(Going right away)

1179
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:21,877
Hey, what are you doing?

1180
00:40:22,148 --> 00:40:23,547
Hey, what are you doing?

1181
00:40:24,618 --> 00:40:25,647
So suddenly?

1182
00:40:25,648 --> 00:40:27,388
A little at a time.

1183
00:40:27,447 --> 00:40:29,788
- I wanted to follow the line. - When will we get there?

1184
00:40:30,458 --> 00:40:32,188
- Have you lost your touch? - No.

1185
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,486
Going one space at a time could be better...

1186
00:40:34,487 --> 00:40:37,256
- One space at a time? - Yes, instead of veering.

1187
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:39,327
- You can roll it farther after. - I mean... Yes.

1188
00:40:39,328 --> 00:40:40,897
- Should I do about two turns? - Okay.

1189
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:42,097
(The 3rd try, Number 2, Yeon Seok)

1190
00:40:42,098 --> 00:40:43,368
Can you do as planned?

1191
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,367
- I'm sorry. - Let's go.

1192
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:46,407
Here I go.

1193
00:40:46,837 --> 00:40:47,837
Here I go.

1194
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:51,176
- That was good, right? - Oh, that was nice.

1195
00:40:51,177 --> 00:40:52,336
- It went as planned. - You're last to go, Ji Min.

1196
00:40:52,337 --> 00:40:53,977
- You just need to turn it once. - Just once.

1197
00:40:53,978 --> 00:40:55,106
- Just one turn. - I won't get it up there.

1198
00:40:55,107 --> 00:40:56,477
- Just one turn. - Can you just get it up there?

1199
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:58,394
- I won't get it up there. - Please do it for me.

1200
00:40:58,418 --> 00:41:00,388
- Please do it for me. - But what if I try to...

1201
00:41:00,447 --> 00:41:01,946
and make a mistake?

1202
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:03,057
(The 3rd try, Number 3, Jae Suk)

1203
00:41:03,058 --> 00:41:04,387
(The last one up is feeling the pressure.)

1204
00:41:04,388 --> 00:41:05,587
You're so mean.

1205
00:41:08,087 --> 00:41:09,897
- That was just right. - That wasn't bad, right?

1206
00:41:09,898 --> 00:41:10,927
That was just right.

1207
00:41:11,297 --> 00:41:13,498
(It landed in a good spot.)

1208
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:15,398
(Groaning)

1209
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:17,497
(The 3rd try, Number 4, Ji Min)

1210
00:41:17,498 --> 00:41:19,297
Can I practice here just once?

1211
00:41:19,438 --> 00:41:20,836
Because we already started this try...

1212
00:41:20,837 --> 00:41:22,337
Oh, then we can't? I see.

1213
00:41:22,638 --> 00:41:25,006
- You can practice after this. - Let's go, Ji Min.

1214
00:41:25,007 --> 00:41:26,038
Let's go!

1215
00:41:27,208 --> 00:41:30,018
- Why is this happening to me? - You can do it. I got a feeling.

1216
00:41:30,118 --> 00:41:32,216
Get a taste of success.

1217
00:41:32,217 --> 00:41:34,587
- Oh, goodness. What should I do? - If you succeed...

1218
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,457
If you get a taste of this...

1219
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:38,458
- Right. - I shouldn't go too hard, right?

1220
00:41:38,518 --> 00:41:40,057
- It should be kind of hard. - It should?

1221
00:41:40,058 --> 00:41:41,856
- Just enough for two turns. - Just enough strength.

1222
00:41:41,857 --> 00:41:43,204
"Just enough" is the hardest thing.

1223
00:41:43,228 --> 00:41:44,897
Oh, goodness.

1224
00:41:44,898 --> 00:41:46,898
- Let's go. - I really hate things like this.

1225
00:41:47,268 --> 00:41:49,126
- Ji Min. - We're all such introverts.

1226
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:51,527
(Our Whenever Guest trusted Ji Min and put her at number 4.)

1227
00:41:54,808 --> 00:41:57,078
Get a taste of success.

1228
00:42:05,047 --> 00:42:07,288
(It went up!)

1229
00:42:09,717 --> 00:42:11,917
(Screaming)

1230
00:42:11,918 --> 00:42:13,328
Oh, my goodness!

1231
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:16,027
(Moved)

1232
00:42:16,357 --> 00:42:17,697
We did it!

1233
00:42:18,228 --> 00:42:19,898
- I'm so relieved! - Oh, Ji Min!

1234
00:42:20,297 --> 00:42:21,997
- We did it. - She got a taste of success!

1235
00:42:21,998 --> 00:42:23,897
- How does it feel? - The taste of success.

1236
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:26,868
- I'm so relieved. - Ji Min. How does it taste?

1237
00:42:27,038 --> 00:42:28,407
I'm so relieved.

1238
00:42:28,507 --> 00:42:30,506
How does it taste? This taste of success.

1239
00:42:30,507 --> 00:42:32,313
- Doesn't it taste great? - Doesn't it taste great?

1240
00:42:32,337 --> 00:42:34,547
- I don't want to do Round Two. - You're so good.

1241
00:42:34,648 --> 00:42:36,577
This is the taste. We passed Round One!

1242
00:42:36,578 --> 00:42:38,077
(They won a toaster and a coffee machine.)

1243
00:42:38,078 --> 00:42:39,277
I'm so relieved.

1244
00:42:39,578 --> 00:42:41,417
- We already... - I did something big today.

1245
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:43,617
- Hey, Ji Min. - I think I can go home now.

1246
00:42:43,618 --> 00:42:45,687
- That was perfect. - I can't believe that worked.

1247
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,586
We succeeded on our third try.

1248
00:42:47,587 --> 00:42:48,756
- Exactly. - This wasn't easy.

1249
00:42:48,757 --> 00:42:50,356
- This is a first for me. - You passed faster than expected.

1250
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:52,527
- This wasn't easy. - Oh, that was fast?

1251
00:42:52,627 --> 00:42:53,668
Oh, gosh.

1252
00:42:53,728 --> 00:42:55,067
Oh, I'm so relieved!

1253
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:57,237
- You can work happily now. - I'm so happy.

1254
00:42:57,837 --> 00:43:00,307
- Round Two's prize is bigger. - Isn't it exhilarating?

1255
00:43:00,308 --> 00:43:02,507
- I hope I'm not out of luck yet. - Right.

1256
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:04,737
- Isn't it exhilarating? - The game gets a bit harder.

1257
00:43:04,978 --> 00:43:06,106
- If we don't pass Round Two... - Gosh.

1258
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:07,848
It feels like I scored in the World Cup.

1259
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:10,248
- Oh, I'm sorry. - No, it's okay.

1260
00:43:10,677 --> 00:43:12,446
She got a taste of success.

1261
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:14,747
She's so happy right now. She can't contain herself.

1262
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:17,018
- I'm so sorry. - Next round.

1263
00:43:17,118 --> 00:43:18,856
- Do you want to go or stop? - Right.

1264
00:43:18,857 --> 00:43:20,227
You can stop here.

1265
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:21,557
Do you want to go or stop?

1266
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,657
They want to keep going?

1267
00:43:22,757 --> 00:43:24,526
- We wouldn't. - One moment.

1268
00:43:24,527 --> 00:43:26,026
- We have seven tries left. - How could you...

1269
00:43:26,027 --> 00:43:27,727
- No, we have 6. - We have 6?

1270
00:43:27,728 --> 00:43:29,503
- Do we have 6 tries left? - Do we have 6 tries left?

1271
00:43:29,527 --> 00:43:30,897
- You have 7. - You have 7 tries left.

1272
00:43:30,898 --> 00:43:31,937
(They have seven tries left.)

1273
00:43:31,938 --> 00:43:33,967
You have up to eight tries maximum.

1274
00:43:34,138 --> 00:43:35,807
You have 7 plus 1.

1275
00:43:35,808 --> 00:43:37,637
- What should we do? - I don't want to go last.

1276
00:43:37,638 --> 00:43:38,638
(Nervous)

1277
00:43:38,639 --> 00:43:41,547
- Will they make us go again? - But we have to go again.

1278
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:43,117
- In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1279
00:43:43,118 --> 00:43:44,546
- Go! - Go!

1280
00:43:44,547 --> 00:43:46,117
- Oh, no. - I knew it.

1281
00:43:46,118 --> 00:43:47,188
Who would like to...

1282
00:43:47,648 --> 00:43:48,887
- She can. - Okay.

1283
00:43:48,888 --> 00:43:50,388
You can't stop here.

1284
00:43:50,987 --> 00:43:52,487
- Please read it. - What does it say?

1285
00:43:53,058 --> 00:43:56,526
"We must get ready for a future performance."

1286
00:43:56,527 --> 00:43:59,027
- "A Medicube beauty device." - Oh, my.

1287
00:43:59,797 --> 00:44:01,426
- What is that? - This is a nice prize.

1288
00:44:01,427 --> 00:44:02,626
- And one for each of us. - One of each of us.

1289
00:44:02,627 --> 00:44:04,097
(Let's get ready for another performance with the device.)

1290
00:44:04,098 --> 00:44:05,836
(About 800 dollars for the 3)

1291
00:44:05,837 --> 00:44:07,037
- Oh, my. - One per person.

1292
00:44:07,038 --> 00:44:08,267
I've been wanting that.

1293
00:44:08,268 --> 00:44:09,507
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1294
00:44:09,638 --> 00:44:10,836
- Okay. - Oh, gosh.

1295
00:44:10,837 --> 00:44:12,638
Their faces are saying, "Oh, yes!"

1296
00:44:12,708 --> 00:44:13,708
(The prize for Round 2 are beauty devices.)

1297
00:44:13,709 --> 00:44:14,946
- Please. - So what is Round Two?

1298
00:44:14,947 --> 00:44:16,376
(Round 2)

1299
00:44:16,377 --> 00:44:19,118
(The target eraser gets smaller.)

1300
00:44:19,748 --> 00:44:22,347
- Oh, this is... - I really can't go last now.

1301
00:44:22,348 --> 00:44:24,256
(It became two erasers.)

1302
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:25,687
- The last one... - I really can't now.

1303
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:27,757
- We're losing one at a time. - I really can't.

1304
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:33,498
This is definitely hard.

1305
00:44:36,467 --> 00:44:38,067
- Do you want to go last? - Oh, Jae Suk.

1306
00:44:38,268 --> 00:44:39,837
- It should be right here. - Yes.

1307
00:44:40,607 --> 00:44:42,836
So if the 2nd or 3rd one to go...

1308
00:44:42,837 --> 00:44:45,177
could put it in this spot, it would be perfect.

1309
00:44:45,377 --> 00:44:47,337
- I should try it too. - Look. Right about there.

1310
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:49,277
Right. Just...

1311
00:44:51,618 --> 00:44:55,348
- It could work. - Ji Min got a taste of it.

1312
00:44:56,118 --> 00:44:58,987
- Now, she's doing tricks. - You're good.

1313
00:44:59,087 --> 00:45:00,856
- You got a taste, didn't you? - I really can't.

1314
00:45:00,857 --> 00:45:02,228
I really can't go fourth now.

1315
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,097
I've used all of my strength.

1316
00:45:04,098 --> 00:45:05,296
Jun Hyuk also needs to get...

1317
00:45:05,297 --> 00:45:06,767
- a taste of success. - Exactly. This next try.

1318
00:45:06,768 --> 00:45:08,066
(He hasn't gotten a taste yet.)

1319
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:11,497
Eun Bin did a great job...

1320
00:45:11,498 --> 00:45:14,406
of strategically making the team.

1321
00:45:14,407 --> 00:45:15,668
Please decide the order again.

1322
00:45:15,907 --> 00:45:17,276
(Scanning)

1323
00:45:17,277 --> 00:45:19,638
Since you should get a taste of success this time,

1324
00:45:19,708 --> 00:45:21,946
- Jun Hyuk should go last. - Last.

1325
00:45:21,947 --> 00:45:23,417
Yes, and Ji Min should go first.

1326
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:24,617
- Okay. - First.

1327
00:45:24,618 --> 00:45:25,676
And well...

1328
00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:26,787
(What about these two?)

1329
00:45:26,788 --> 00:45:27,987
We should decide on our own?

1330
00:45:29,648 --> 00:45:31,817
- We'll do that... - You're really great.

1331
00:45:32,018 --> 00:45:33,526
- Since she's held... - So funny.

1332
00:45:33,527 --> 00:45:35,828
A public post for a long time...

1333
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:38,026
- and handles lots of projects, - Right.

1334
00:45:38,027 --> 00:45:40,126
She can tell right away.

1335
00:45:40,127 --> 00:45:41,966
Okay. The first one up...

1336
00:45:41,967 --> 00:45:43,196
- is Ji Min. - Okay.

1337
00:45:43,197 --> 00:45:44,268
Oh, this is...

1338
00:45:44,337 --> 00:45:46,607
- I'll go 2nd. - Okay. I'll go 3rd.

1339
00:45:47,337 --> 00:45:49,236
- Let's do a cheer. In 1, 2, 3. - In 1, 2, 3.

1340
00:45:49,237 --> 00:45:50,337
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1341
00:45:51,277 --> 00:45:53,107
- Let's go. - The fourth try.

1342
00:45:53,777 --> 00:45:55,647
- Gosh, this... - It was fine when Jun Hyuk...

1343
00:45:55,648 --> 00:45:57,348
only moved it a little bit, right?

1344
00:45:58,748 --> 00:45:59,868
Just do what is comfortable.

1345
00:46:01,648 --> 00:46:02,768
Just do what is comfortable.

1346
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,357
(She really did what was comfortable.)

1347
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:15,403
Moving it only a little bit was also fine, right?

1348
00:46:15,427 --> 00:46:17,138
- It was... - It was okay.

1349
00:46:17,498 --> 00:46:19,567
- She almost didn't move it at all. - Right.

1350
00:46:20,638 --> 00:46:21,966
But at least it moved some.

1351
00:46:21,967 --> 00:46:23,877
- What a relief. - Right. It's a relief.

1352
00:46:25,308 --> 00:46:26,647
I should move it quite a bit, right?

1353
00:46:26,648 --> 00:46:28,577
- You should. - I'll turn it a few times.

1354
00:46:28,578 --> 00:46:30,477
- That's a given. - To about here.

1355
00:46:30,478 --> 00:46:31,918
- Okay. - About here.

1356
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:34,487
It has never happened as you said.

1357
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:37,388
- This is my target spot. - That's nice.

1358
00:46:39,157 --> 00:46:41,487
(Very nervous)

1359
00:46:41,728 --> 00:46:43,498
- About two and a half turns. - Okay.

1360
00:46:47,828 --> 00:46:49,498
(Going off-course)

1361
00:46:50,368 --> 00:46:51,868
This is too...

1362
00:46:52,638 --> 00:46:53,638
(The 4th try, Number 3, Jae Suk)

1363
00:46:53,639 --> 00:46:54,906
- Then you should... - Going horizontally...

1364
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:56,406
Going this way is a bit...

1365
00:46:56,407 --> 00:46:59,138
- I should fling it over here... - Right.

1366
00:46:59,377 --> 00:47:00,847
- A bit weak. - You need to fling it quite far.

1367
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:02,107
Quite far.

1368
00:47:03,547 --> 00:47:05,618
- I'm nervous. - I can't watch this.

1369
00:47:06,717 --> 00:47:08,216
- Without it going over... - It doesn't go very far...

1370
00:47:08,217 --> 00:47:10,057
- when you go this way. Right. - That doesn't work.

1371
00:47:10,058 --> 00:47:11,517
- So I need to roll it. - You need to roll it quite a lot.

1372
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:12,717
- With some power. - Yes.

1373
00:47:13,257 --> 00:47:14,958
(The last one up is so nervous.)

1374
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:20,228
(Satisfied)

1375
00:47:21,098 --> 00:47:22,398
- Okay. - This is...

1376
00:47:22,527 --> 00:47:23,637
Did you see that, Jun Hyuk?

1377
00:47:23,638 --> 00:47:26,497
(The 4th try, Number 4, Jun Hyuk)

1378
00:47:26,498 --> 00:47:28,708
- If you push it hard like this. - Yes.

1379
00:47:28,868 --> 00:47:31,007
- That's the only way, right? - That's the only way.

1380
00:47:31,907 --> 00:47:32,938
Okay.

1381
00:47:33,677 --> 00:47:34,776
This is hard.

1382
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:37,018
It'll take quite a stunt to succeed here.

1383
00:47:37,078 --> 00:47:38,724
- But you need to get a taste... - You can do it.

1384
00:47:38,748 --> 00:47:40,816
You can think of it as being named the fourth batter...

1385
00:47:40,817 --> 00:47:42,247
by your coach in baseball.

1386
00:47:42,248 --> 00:47:43,958
- Me? Why me... - Yes.

1387
00:47:45,058 --> 00:47:47,757
- He enjoys board games at home. - Right.

1388
00:47:47,857 --> 00:47:49,027
The adventurer.

1389
00:47:49,857 --> 00:47:50,857
Let's go.
(Nervous)

1390
00:47:51,858 --> 00:47:53,998
- The perfect secretary. - He is perfect.

1391
00:47:54,368 --> 00:47:56,837
- Show us your perfect fingertips. - Let's see them.

1392
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:01,808
You need to get a taste of success.

1393
00:48:06,848 --> 00:48:08,607
What? Hey!

1394
00:48:11,748 --> 00:48:14,388
(It went up!)

1395
00:48:16,248 --> 00:48:18,618
(Screaming)

1396
00:48:21,288 --> 00:48:23,057
(Jun Hyuk did it!)

1397
00:48:23,058 --> 00:48:24,657
- Hey, it was perfect! - Jun Hyuk!

1398
00:48:25,098 --> 00:48:27,297
(They passed Round 2!)

1399
00:48:27,498 --> 00:48:28,498
How did you do that?

1400
00:48:29,768 --> 00:48:31,437
(Finally tasting success!)

1401
00:48:31,438 --> 00:48:33,867
- We passed Round Two! - We passed! Hold on.

1402
00:48:33,868 --> 00:48:35,268
(They even won the beauty devices!)

1403
00:48:36,837 --> 00:48:38,177
Can I pass out now?

1404
00:48:40,648 --> 00:48:42,376
That was so crazy.

1405
00:48:42,377 --> 00:48:45,446
(My perfect 4th batter)

1406
00:48:45,447 --> 00:48:47,188
- Oh, gosh. - This is hard.

1407
00:48:47,918 --> 00:48:49,216
Oh, gosh. That was...

1408
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:52,017
- I think our drama will be a hit. - I think so.

1409
00:48:52,018 --> 00:48:53,487
- So... - Oh, gosh.

1410
00:48:53,828 --> 00:48:56,756
- Eun Bin is so good... - How did I do that?

1411
00:48:56,757 --> 00:48:58,897
- at deciding the order. - That was crazy.

1412
00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:00,327
- Insane. - The order...

1413
00:49:00,328 --> 00:49:02,427
- That was insane. - You're such a strategist.

1414
00:49:02,927 --> 00:49:04,268
(You want me to be last?)

1415
00:49:04,737 --> 00:49:07,168
(She placed Ji Min last when they passed Round 1.)

1416
00:49:08,308 --> 00:49:10,938
(Bullseye!)

1417
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:14,047
(After that, she boldly changed up the order.)

1418
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:17,478
(Bullseye again!)

1419
00:49:18,547 --> 00:49:20,947
(Dongjak-gu's strategist)

1420
00:49:21,547 --> 00:49:24,317
So now, we have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

1421
00:49:24,657 --> 00:49:25,787
- And with the chance, - With the chance,

1422
00:49:25,788 --> 00:49:26,957
- we have 7 tries. - we have 7 tries left.

1423
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,688
- Don't entice them. - What should we do?

1424
00:49:28,987 --> 00:49:30,656
You have to think seriously about this.

1425
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:33,897
Because it actually doesn't matter if you stop here.

1426
00:49:33,898 --> 00:49:35,268
- The prize... - Exactly.

1427
00:49:35,368 --> 00:49:37,397
- Even if... - It'll be just 1 for Round 3.

1428
00:49:37,398 --> 00:49:39,897
Exactly. I'm not sure if we can pass...

1429
00:49:39,898 --> 00:49:41,308
in seven tries.

1430
00:49:41,438 --> 00:49:43,807
But you do have so many tries left.

1431
00:49:43,808 --> 00:49:45,537
You should be...

1432
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:48,308
- Are you a spy? - No, I'm not.

1433
00:49:48,648 --> 00:49:50,347
- No, wait. - He looks serious.

1434
00:49:50,348 --> 00:49:51,847
This is hard to decide.

1435
00:49:51,848 --> 00:49:54,316
- The 3 of you discuss it. - You 3 have to discuss it.

1436
00:49:54,317 --> 00:49:56,348
You can really stop now.

1437
00:49:57,388 --> 00:49:58,917
I'm curious.

1438
00:49:58,918 --> 00:50:00,256
I think it won't be easy.

1439
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:02,126
They rarely pass Round Three.

1440
00:50:02,127 --> 00:50:03,696
Yes, you're right. Then stop?

1441
00:50:03,697 --> 00:50:05,126
But we do have many tries left.

1442
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,868
They sometimes pass Round Three when there are many tries left.

1443
00:50:08,927 --> 00:50:11,336
- All right. Please decide... - What should we do?

1444
00:50:11,337 --> 00:50:12,836
Whether you will begin Round Three or not.

1445
00:50:12,837 --> 00:50:14,537
In 1, 2, 3.

1446
00:50:14,538 --> 00:50:16,137
- Go. - Stop.

1447
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:17,578
- What? - Wait.

1448
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:18,836
(Their 1st discussion ended in disagreement.)

1449
00:50:18,837 --> 00:50:21,208
- Try again to make a decision. - Wait a minute.

1450
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:23,347
- We said we'd stop. - That's right.

1451
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:24,517
- Should we continue? - You have to decide.

1452
00:50:24,518 --> 00:50:26,147
- Go means to continue. - Do you want to continue?

1453
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:27,316
- Stop means it ends now. - Really?

1454
00:50:27,317 --> 00:50:29,046
Our strategist is a bit confused.

1455
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:31,458
Discuss it again among yourselves. We'll give you some time.

1456
00:50:31,757 --> 00:50:33,417
- Stop. - Is it stop?

1457
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:35,357
- This is tense. - Okay. You surprised me.

1458
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,657
Stop.

1459
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:37,828
(They practice just in case.)

1460
00:50:38,098 --> 00:50:39,098
It worked.

1461
00:50:40,228 --> 00:50:41,627
No, wait.

1462
00:50:42,498 --> 00:50:43,538
(Pushing)

1463
00:50:44,138 --> 00:50:45,236
Look at that.

1464
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:46,597
(Wait a second.)

1465
00:50:46,598 --> 00:50:47,807
It worked.

1466
00:50:47,808 --> 00:50:50,376
(She is flustered after an unexpected success.)

1467
00:50:50,377 --> 00:50:51,736
- It's tough. - Yes.

1468
00:50:51,737 --> 00:50:53,437
It's probably difficult. I don't think it's easy to balance.

1469
00:50:53,438 --> 00:50:54,647
This eraser is like that.

1470
00:50:54,648 --> 00:50:56,106
We need a KO win?

1471
00:50:56,107 --> 00:50:57,787
- You usually bet on three points. - What?

1472
00:50:58,547 --> 00:50:59,716
You usually bet on three points.

1473
00:50:59,717 --> 00:51:00,918
(Pass!)

1474
00:51:01,118 --> 00:51:02,316
- Don't look at this. - Okay.

1475
00:51:02,317 --> 00:51:03,347
(It worked again?)

1476
00:51:03,348 --> 00:51:04,717
We have several tries left.

1477
00:51:04,788 --> 00:51:06,517
- If we only had three tries left, - This is a tough decision.

1478
00:51:06,518 --> 00:51:08,126
- You want to change your mind? - I'd say we should stop.

1479
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:09,586
We should stop if we only have three tries left.

1480
00:51:09,587 --> 00:51:11,034
(The Dongjak Girls are swaying again.)

1481
00:51:11,058 --> 00:51:12,526
The three Dongjak Girls.

1482
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,067
I'm worried they'll lose the presents.

1483
00:51:14,197 --> 00:51:16,026
- They might lose it. - Yes, they might.

1484
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:17,066
(Nervous)

1485
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:18,837
Is it a go or a stop?

1486
00:51:18,967 --> 00:51:20,736
(Go to Round 3?)

1487
00:51:20,737 --> 00:51:22,308
(Or stop?)

1488
00:51:22,507 --> 00:51:23,808
In 1, 2, 3.

1489
00:51:24,808 --> 00:51:25,808
- Go. - Go.

1490
00:51:26,438 --> 00:51:27,478
- Go. - Go.

1491
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:29,377
Why?

1492
00:51:29,808 --> 00:51:31,847
We should try really hard.

1493
00:51:31,848 --> 00:51:33,586
You know what?

1494
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:36,347
Oh, no. We did our best.

1495
00:51:36,348 --> 00:51:38,087
Now...

1496
00:51:38,688 --> 00:51:40,458
They chose to continue.

1497
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,458
- I feel so anxious. - Dongjak Girls.

1498
00:51:43,898 --> 00:51:44,997
- What is the present? - I hope we pass.

1499
00:51:44,998 --> 00:51:46,597
"It's on the Dongjak Girls."

1500
00:51:46,598 --> 00:51:49,296
"We'll serve 200 cups of coffee to everyone at the health center."

1501
00:51:49,297 --> 00:51:50,697
- "A one-day coffee truck." - Gosh.

1502
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:53,438
A one-day coffee truck.

1503
00:51:53,538 --> 00:51:55,906
- I don't believe it. - That's amazing.

1504
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:58,037
(It's on the Dongjak Girls! One-day coffee truck...)

1505
00:51:58,038 --> 00:52:00,423
(serving 200 cups of coffee to the employees at the health center)

1506
00:52:00,447 --> 00:52:02,046
This is so cute.

1507
00:52:02,047 --> 00:52:03,176
Will the truck look like this?

1508
00:52:03,177 --> 00:52:06,047
- It says "Dongjak Girls." - We have to make it happen.

1509
00:52:06,348 --> 00:52:08,187
- Actors... - Gosh.

1510
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:10,887
- often order coffee trucks. - This is touching.

1511
00:52:10,888 --> 00:52:13,458
If we pass Round Three, and you get a coffee truck,

1512
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:15,526
you'll become a star in Dongjak-gu.

1513
00:52:15,527 --> 00:52:18,497
- Yes. - This must be from when you sang.

1514
00:52:18,498 --> 00:52:19,796
(Round 3 for a coffee truck)

1515
00:52:19,797 --> 00:52:21,097
(Round 3)

1516
00:52:21,098 --> 00:52:22,626
(The target eraser is smaller...)

1517
00:52:22,627 --> 00:52:23,736
(and farther away.)

1518
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:24,737
It's even farther away?

1519
00:52:26,098 --> 00:52:28,337
- What? We start here? - Yes.

1520
00:52:28,808 --> 00:52:30,776
(Original place)

1521
00:52:30,777 --> 00:52:33,708
(It's now farther and smaller.)

1522
00:52:34,907 --> 00:52:36,177
Let's see.

1523
00:52:36,607 --> 00:52:37,876
Let's see.

1524
00:52:37,877 --> 00:52:39,546
(He practices.)

1525
00:52:39,547 --> 00:52:41,027
- It'll drop easily. - It's very far.

1526
00:52:41,547 --> 00:52:43,348
- It'll drop easily. - It's very far.

1527
00:52:44,518 --> 00:52:45,558
He should go first.

1528
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:47,356
It's worth a try.

1529
00:52:47,357 --> 00:52:49,057
It's possible if we do well at the end.

1530
00:52:49,058 --> 00:52:50,058
It's too close.

1531
00:52:50,998 --> 00:52:52,798
- If we do well at the end. - It's too close.

1532
00:52:52,857 --> 00:52:54,967
(He succeeds in getting it on top!)

1533
00:52:56,127 --> 00:52:57,598
You go last, Yeon Seok.

1534
00:52:59,138 --> 00:53:00,537
Then...

1535
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:01,938
- Let's have him go last. - Okay.

1536
00:53:05,237 --> 00:53:07,046
- I think we can start right away. - The people going 1st and 2nd...

1537
00:53:07,047 --> 00:53:08,446
- have to move it quite a distance. - Yes.

1538
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:09,847
- That's right. Absolutely. - Yes.

1539
00:53:09,848 --> 00:53:12,647
(It's important for the people going first to reduce the gap.)

1540
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,587
Come up with a strategy for us again.

1541
00:53:14,817 --> 00:53:16,348
- This is our fifth try. - Yes.

1542
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:17,558
What do you think?

1543
00:53:21,757 --> 00:53:23,927
- Jae Suk, you go first. - Okay.

1544
00:53:23,958 --> 00:53:25,126
Yeon Seok, you go fourth.

1545
00:53:25,127 --> 00:53:26,627
- Fourth. - Last? Okay.

1546
00:53:27,067 --> 00:53:29,027
- Last? - Yes, and you two...

1547
00:53:29,768 --> 00:53:31,938
- We decide? - We decide.

1548
00:53:32,138 --> 00:53:33,196
Yes, for the 2nd and 3rd.

1549
00:53:33,197 --> 00:53:34,567
All right, then.

1550
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:37,236
This is our 5th try, and we are in Round 3.

1551
00:53:37,237 --> 00:53:39,406
Let's do a cheer.

1552
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:41,106
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

1553
00:53:41,107 --> 00:53:42,446
In 1, 2, 3.

1554
00:53:42,447 --> 00:53:43,477
- Let's go! - Let's go!

1555
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:44,518
Good.

1556
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:46,117
All right.

1557
00:53:46,118 --> 00:53:47,617
If we get six turns...

1558
00:53:47,618 --> 00:53:49,816
- and use the bonus coupon, - We get one more turn.

1559
00:53:49,817 --> 00:53:51,058
That means we have seven turns.

1560
00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:53,017
I don't want to try too hard and make it fly off.

1561
00:53:53,018 --> 00:53:54,328
It might fall off the table.

1562
00:53:59,697 --> 00:54:00,998
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1563
00:54:02,527 --> 00:54:03,797
- Gosh. - Gosh.

1564
00:54:04,337 --> 00:54:05,937
- That was good. - It was bold.

1565
00:54:05,938 --> 00:54:07,336
- I was bold. - You did a good job.

1566
00:54:07,337 --> 00:54:08,713
- You were bold. - Shake my hand too.

1567
00:54:08,737 --> 00:54:10,938
Be gentle, Ji Min.

1568
00:54:14,748 --> 00:54:16,708
- That was good. - Really?

1569
00:54:16,877 --> 00:54:18,237
You placed it in a good direction.

1570
00:54:21,348 --> 00:54:22,518
That wasn't good.

1571
00:54:23,987 --> 00:54:25,987
Come on, Jun Hyuk.

1572
00:54:27,828 --> 00:54:30,087
(It barely moved.)

1573
00:54:30,527 --> 00:54:31,696
- Come on. - That was bad.

1574
00:54:31,697 --> 00:54:33,744
- I should've used more power. - I wish it were a bit closer.

1575
00:54:33,768 --> 00:54:35,167
You never know.

1576
00:54:35,168 --> 00:54:38,337
It might bounce and end in a good result.

1577
00:54:39,168 --> 00:54:41,567
- It has to flip twice. - That's right.

1578
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,336
(It won't be easy to get it on top from this distance.)

1579
00:54:45,337 --> 00:54:47,046
You never know.

1580
00:54:47,047 --> 00:54:48,107
The taste of success.

1581
00:54:48,478 --> 00:54:50,447
Good luck. Let's see.

1582
00:54:51,377 --> 00:54:53,046
- I think it'll work. - Yes.

1583
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:54,118
It has to flip twice.

1584
00:54:54,547 --> 00:54:57,486
(Will the strategy work again?)

1585
00:54:57,487 --> 00:54:58,717
It has to flip twice.

1586
00:55:04,257 --> 00:55:06,697
It might end in a good result.

1587
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,570
That was close. You did a good job.

1588
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:13,641
You did a great job.

1589
00:55:15,054 --> 00:55:17,923
(The direction was precise, )

1590
00:55:17,924 --> 00:55:20,524
(but it didn't land on top of the other eraser, and they failed.)

1591
00:55:20,594 --> 00:55:22,464
- You did a great job. - That was great.

1592
00:55:22,665 --> 00:55:23,794
You did a good job.

1593
00:55:23,795 --> 00:55:25,864
- It grazed the eraser. - I know.

1594
00:55:26,565 --> 00:55:28,573
- You have ten minutes left. - Really? Let's hurry.

1595
00:55:28,574 --> 00:55:30,604
- We'll start right away. - Let's go in this order again.

1596
00:55:30,605 --> 00:55:31,803
- We'll go in this order again. - Yes.

1597
00:55:31,804 --> 00:55:32,843
In 1, 2, 3.

1598
00:55:32,844 --> 00:55:33,844
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1599
00:55:33,845 --> 00:55:35,274
- We'll go in this order. - There's a time limit.

1600
00:55:35,275 --> 00:55:37,235
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 6.)

1601
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,943
(Send it far away again!)

1602
00:55:38,944 --> 00:55:43,585
(The 6th try, Number 1, Jae Suk)

1603
00:55:45,625 --> 00:55:47,054
Be bold.

1604
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:49,455
(He is shocked too.)

1605
00:55:50,054 --> 00:55:51,863
(Amazing)

1606
00:55:51,864 --> 00:55:54,024
- That was impressive. - Let's flip it once each.

1607
00:55:54,025 --> 00:55:55,493
- Flip it once. - Yes, that's enough.

1608
00:55:55,494 --> 00:55:56,794
- Just flip it once. - Yes, that's enough.

1609
00:55:56,795 --> 00:55:58,104
(The 6th try, Number 2, Ji Min)

1610
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:00,505
(The strategy is to flip it once each to get it closer.)

1611
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,334
Let's flip it once each.

1612
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:05,015
- Just flip it once. - Yes, that's enough.

1613
00:56:05,475 --> 00:56:06,475
Flip it...

1614
00:56:22,225 --> 00:56:25,424
(They pass Round 3!)

1615
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:30,964
(Screaming)

1616
00:56:36,505 --> 00:56:37,774
Han Ji Min.

1617
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:39,404
(Ji Min did it!)

1618
00:56:39,605 --> 00:56:42,775
- Han Ji Min. - Han Ji Min.

1619
00:56:42,875 --> 00:56:44,684
(Everyone scream Almighty Ji Min!)

1620
00:56:44,685 --> 00:56:46,684
- What happened? - I'm tearing up.

1621
00:56:46,685 --> 00:56:49,084
- The daughter of Dongjak-gu. - The daughter of Dongjak-gu.

1622
00:56:49,085 --> 00:56:50,653
- The daughter of Dongjak-gu did it. - You did it.

1623
00:56:50,654 --> 00:56:52,054
(Good job, daughter of Dongjak-gu!)

1624
00:56:53,355 --> 00:56:55,315
(Jae Suk, who was number 1, flipped it far away.)

1625
00:56:56,295 --> 00:56:58,464
(Then the 2nd batter hit a home run.)

1626
00:56:58,994 --> 00:57:00,824
(Ji Min's walk-off home run)

1627
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:02,864
She's crying.

1628
00:57:03,565 --> 00:57:05,434
- I'm so happy for you. - Thank you.

1629
00:57:05,435 --> 00:57:07,364
- We had ten minutes left. - I don't believe it.

1630
00:57:07,505 --> 00:57:09,204
- We had ten minutes left. - This is great.

1631
00:57:09,205 --> 00:57:11,475
- We had ten minutes left, Ji Min. - I'm so relieved.

1632
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:14,875
It's like she won an award for Best Actress.

1633
00:57:15,375 --> 00:57:17,914
- This is a relief. - The daughter of Dongjak-gu.

1634
00:57:17,915 --> 00:57:18,944
She's crying too.

1635
00:57:19,685 --> 00:57:21,144
- She's crying too. - Seriously.

1636
00:57:21,145 --> 00:57:22,825
- Please give us your speech. - Of course.

1637
00:57:23,985 --> 00:57:25,225
It's such a relief.

1638
00:57:25,585 --> 00:57:26,784
She's crying too.

1639
00:57:26,924 --> 00:57:29,194
This is the most respect I've had for you.

1640
00:57:30,295 --> 00:57:33,194
- I'm amazing, right? - Yes, you did great.

1641
00:57:33,795 --> 00:57:37,795
All the residents in Dongjak-gu,

1642
00:57:38,034 --> 00:57:39,903
Han Ji Min,

1643
00:57:39,904 --> 00:57:41,735
the daughter of Dongjak-gu, did it.

1644
00:57:42,435 --> 00:57:44,573
(She makes a glorious return.)

1645
00:57:44,574 --> 00:57:47,004
I don't believe it. How did this happen?

1646
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,045
- She is in disbelief. - We need some tissue.

1647
00:57:49,674 --> 00:57:51,274
- I don't know why I'm crying. - Ji Min.

1648
00:57:51,744 --> 00:57:53,915
- The coffee truck. - Ji Min.

1649
00:57:54,145 --> 00:57:56,284
It's such a relief.

1650
00:57:57,554 --> 00:57:59,124
- Okay. - This is great, isn't it?

1651
00:57:59,125 --> 00:58:00,954
- With this, - How did this happen?

1652
00:58:00,955 --> 00:58:03,754
The Dongjak Girls get the presents from all three rounds.

1653
00:58:03,755 --> 00:58:05,564
(They get the coffee truck, beauty device, toaster, and coffee machine)

1654
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:08,134
You did a great job.

1655
00:58:08,264 --> 00:58:10,064
- I feel so happy. - Congratulations.

1656
00:58:10,065 --> 00:58:11,664
Who is the daughter of Dongjak-gu?

1657
00:58:11,665 --> 00:58:13,334
- Han Ji Min. - Han Ji Min.

1658
00:58:13,335 --> 00:58:14,934
Who is the pride of Dongjak-gu?

1659
00:58:14,935 --> 00:58:16,404
- Han Ji Min. - Han Ji Min.

1660
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:17,935
I'll move back.

1661
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:19,474
(The daughter and pride of Dongjak-gu)

1662
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:21,843
- I'm a good fit with Dongjak-gu. - You definitely are.

1663
00:58:21,844 --> 00:58:22,914
(A few days later)

1664
00:58:22,915 --> 00:58:25,383
- An iced latte and a cocoa, please. - Okay.

1665
00:58:25,384 --> 00:58:27,044
Chocolate and cheese.

1666
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,254
(The coffee truck arrived at Dongjak-gu Public Health Center.)

1667
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,414
- Thank you... - Thank you...

1668
00:58:30,415 --> 00:58:32,854
- to Whenever Possible on SBS. - to Whenever Possible on SBS.

1669
00:58:32,855 --> 00:58:34,954
- Good luck. - You're the best.

1670
00:58:34,955 --> 00:58:36,354
(We look forward to the Dongjak Girls' future endeavors!)

1671
00:58:36,355 --> 00:58:38,324
That was amazing.

1672
00:58:38,525 --> 00:58:41,294
- You're impressive. - We did great.

1673
00:58:41,295 --> 00:58:43,335
- You really are. - No, you're impressive.

1674
00:58:43,594 --> 00:58:46,205
I don't think my heart could take the stress weekly.

1675
00:58:46,534 --> 00:58:49,173
His hand was shaking,

1676
00:58:49,174 --> 00:58:51,134
- but he did well at the end. - Yes, he did well.

1677
00:58:51,304 --> 00:58:52,843
- We passed. - Seriously.

1678
00:58:52,844 --> 00:58:54,943
Jun Hyuk and Ji Min did amazingly well today.

1679
00:58:54,944 --> 00:58:57,315
- I'm so relieved. - Let's have something tasty.

1680
00:58:57,344 --> 00:58:58,844
There must be something nearby.

1681
00:58:59,284 --> 00:59:01,021
- Where should we go? - What's tasty around here?

1682
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:03,354
Let's go to a place recommended by the daughter of Dongjak-gu.

1683
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:05,553
- We're in Heukseok-dong. - That's right.

1684
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:07,884
If we go to Heukseok-dong,

1685
00:59:08,295 --> 00:59:11,763
there is a popular sundaeguk at Heukseok Market.

1686
00:59:11,764 --> 00:59:13,165
Heukseok Market sounds good.

1687
00:59:13,364 --> 00:59:15,633
- Don't you like pork cutlets? - I love it.

1688
00:59:15,634 --> 00:59:17,533
- There's a giant pork cutlet place. - I love pork cutlet.

1689
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:18,565
That sounds great.

1690
00:59:19,105 --> 00:59:20,734
They serve a side dish as tteokbokki.

1691
00:59:20,735 --> 00:59:22,303
I mean, they serve tteokbokki as a side dish.

1692
00:59:22,304 --> 00:59:23,334
- And... - That sounds great.

1693
00:59:23,335 --> 00:59:24,434
I like pork cutlets.

1694
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,545
Is that so?

1695
00:59:25,804 --> 00:59:27,704
- Do you like pork cutlets? - Yes, I do.

1696
00:59:27,705 --> 00:59:30,513
There is also a place that serves earthen pot pasta.

1697
00:59:30,514 --> 00:59:32,090
- Earthen pot pasta? - Earthen pot pasta?

1698
00:59:32,114 --> 00:59:33,985
It's old-style pasta.

1699
00:59:34,085 --> 00:59:35,314
They serve pasta in earthen pots.

1700
00:59:35,315 --> 00:59:38,254
Do they also sell pork cutlets?

1701
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:40,153
- They're three different places. - They're different restaurants?

1702
00:59:40,154 --> 00:59:42,454
- They all sound good. - I agree.

1703
00:59:42,455 --> 00:59:43,455
You can choose.

1704
00:59:43,456 --> 00:59:45,125
I'm indecisive.

1705
00:59:45,324 --> 00:59:46,763
- Then should we have pork cutlet? - I'd like that.

1706
00:59:46,764 --> 00:59:47,794
Earthen pot pasta?

1707
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:49,533
I feel like earthen pot pasta.

1708
00:59:49,534 --> 00:59:51,903
Then why don't the people born in 1984 decide?

1709
00:59:51,904 --> 00:59:53,335
- That's a good idea. - You decide.

1710
00:59:53,735 --> 00:59:55,704
Let's play rock, paper, scissors for either pasta or pork cutlet.

1711
00:59:55,705 --> 00:59:57,133
- Good idea. - That will be fun.

1712
00:59:57,134 --> 00:59:58,705
- Okay. - Play rock, paper, scissors.

1713
00:59:59,605 --> 01:00:01,374
- Rock, paper, scissors. - Rock, paper, scissors.

1714
01:00:01,375 --> 01:00:03,243
(Jun Hyuk wins.)

1715
01:00:03,244 --> 01:00:04,844
- It's pork cutlet. - Pork cutlet.

1716
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:08,514
- He's an adventurer. - Yes, he is.

1717
01:00:08,784 --> 01:00:11,114
- He doesn't hesitate. - No, he doesn't.

1718
01:00:11,255 --> 01:00:12,455
All right.

1719
01:00:12,585 --> 01:00:14,184
Earthen pot pasta sounds good too.

1720
01:00:14,185 --> 01:00:15,454
I'm actually okay with anything.

1721
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:16,693
- Then should we have pasta? - Yes, let's do that.

1722
01:00:16,694 --> 01:00:17,724
Okay then.

1723
01:00:17,725 --> 01:00:19,794
(They suddenly change to earthen pot pasta.)

1724
01:00:19,795 --> 01:00:21,764
I can't stop laughing.

1725
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,164
- Are you happy? - You look really happy.

1726
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:25,263
I'm serious.

1727
01:00:25,264 --> 01:00:26,863
- Right now... - We're so funny.

1728
01:00:26,864 --> 01:00:29,903
- Look at her. - She won't stop laughing.

1729
01:00:29,904 --> 01:00:31,033
- You're right. - Gosh.

1730
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:33,104
This must be what happens after a dopamine rush.

1731
01:00:33,105 --> 01:00:35,013
She experienced true success.

1732
01:00:35,014 --> 01:00:36,214
I'm so happy.

1733
01:00:36,415 --> 01:00:38,013
I hope we do well with the next guest too.

1734
01:00:38,014 --> 01:00:39,314
We won't be this good, will we?

1735
01:00:39,315 --> 01:00:41,085
At least we feel relieved now.

1736
01:00:41,654 --> 01:00:43,315
I'm getting greedy.

1737
01:00:43,815 --> 01:00:45,355
- I feel refreshed. - It's not...

1738
01:00:45,654 --> 01:00:47,684
- too cold, is it? - No.

1739
01:00:47,685 --> 01:00:49,653
I took off my undershirt and long johns...

1740
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:50,755
but still don't feel cold.

1741
01:00:50,824 --> 01:00:52,295
You took them all off?

1742
01:00:52,424 --> 01:00:54,564
I'm so happy today.

1743
01:00:54,565 --> 01:00:55,593
(Basking in joy)

1744
01:00:55,594 --> 01:00:57,193
I'm so happy I could treat you to lunch.

1745
01:00:57,194 --> 01:00:59,263
- You're that happy? - I brought my credit card.

1746
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:00,541
(I even brought my credit card.)

1747
01:01:00,565 --> 01:01:02,334
- Let's go. - Get in the car.

1748
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,303
- Let's have our driver take us. - I'll drive.

1749
01:01:04,304 --> 01:01:05,875
Jun Hyuk and I will sit in the back.

1750
01:01:07,645 --> 01:01:09,743
- I think we should call first. - Yes.

1751
01:01:09,744 --> 01:01:11,915
- But I didn't bring my phone. - I have mine.

1752
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:14,343
Do you really choose the restaurant on the spot?

1753
01:01:14,344 --> 01:01:16,784
Yes, we don't choose it ahead.

1754
01:01:17,185 --> 01:01:18,454
That worked?

1755
01:01:18,455 --> 01:01:20,354
- Yes, it does. - That's so random.

1756
01:01:20,355 --> 01:01:21,594
It works for us.

1757
01:01:21,924 --> 01:01:24,554
(Rolling her eyes)

1758
01:01:24,755 --> 01:01:25,835
I was talking about myself.

1759
01:01:26,094 --> 01:01:27,624
- What do you mean? - That I landed the eraser.

1760
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:28,735
- I see. - I see.

1761
01:01:29,364 --> 01:01:31,665
It'll take some time to get over the joy.

1762
01:01:32,235 --> 01:01:34,064
- How did it work? - It'll take some time.

1763
01:01:34,065 --> 01:01:35,604
I'm so happy...

1764
01:01:35,605 --> 01:01:38,475
that I want to go home now.

1765
01:01:39,275 --> 01:01:40,343
(Laughing)

1766
01:01:40,344 --> 01:01:41,744
The daughter of Dongjak-gu.

1767
01:01:41,844 --> 01:01:43,874
You can now call me the daughter of Heukseok-dong.

1768
01:01:43,875 --> 01:01:45,884
- Okay, daughter of Heukseok-dong. - Yes.

1769
01:01:46,384 --> 01:01:49,153
Thinking about food makes me famished.

1770
01:01:49,154 --> 01:01:50,455
The food will be so good.

1771
01:01:50,585 --> 01:01:52,124
You probably haven't gone there for a long time, right?

1772
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,854
I really haven't.

1773
01:01:53,855 --> 01:01:55,923
When did you go to the restaurant often?

1774
01:01:55,924 --> 01:01:58,053
- The earthen pot pasta restaurant. - It was...

1775
01:01:58,054 --> 01:01:59,364
when I was in university.

1776
01:01:59,764 --> 01:02:01,764
- It's been around for a long time. - Yes, it has.

1777
01:02:01,895 --> 01:02:05,403
Some people might not think it's the best,

1778
01:02:05,404 --> 01:02:07,263
- but your memories make up for it. - Yes, especially this place.

1779
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:08,335
I know what it's like.

1780
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:10,035
Do you have a place like that, Jun Hyuk?

1781
01:02:10,304 --> 01:02:12,505
I'm making a lot of memories today.

1782
01:02:14,344 --> 01:02:16,414
Actually, whenever I was...

1783
01:02:16,415 --> 01:02:18,314
on other variety shows,

1784
01:02:18,315 --> 01:02:21,985
I told myself I'd be amazing on Whenever Possible.

1785
01:02:23,054 --> 01:02:24,513
But it feels like I failed from the start.

1786
01:02:24,514 --> 01:02:27,255
- No, the opening was good. - You did well.

1787
01:02:28,255 --> 01:02:31,423
Ji Min continues encouraging you.

1788
01:02:31,424 --> 01:02:33,124
"You did a good job."

1789
01:02:33,125 --> 01:02:34,423
Of course, I should.

1790
01:02:34,424 --> 01:02:35,634
(My perfect mental support)

1791
01:02:36,634 --> 01:02:37,834
- Toward Chung-Ang University? - Yes, toward it.

1792
01:02:37,835 --> 01:02:39,104
This is the way to Chung-Ang University.

1793
01:02:39,105 --> 01:02:40,164
(They are near Chung-Ang University.)

1794
01:02:40,165 --> 01:02:42,274
This must be Chung-Ang University Hospital.

1795
01:02:42,275 --> 01:02:43,304
- Yes. - Yes.

1796
01:02:44,005 --> 01:02:45,443
Before it became a hospital,

1797
01:02:45,444 --> 01:02:46,975
it was a boys' middle and high school.

1798
01:02:47,045 --> 01:02:49,374
But it merged with a girls' school,

1799
01:02:49,375 --> 01:02:52,184
- That's right. - and this became a hospital.

1800
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,545
I see.

1801
01:02:54,244 --> 01:02:56,755
I made my debut after the schools merged.

1802
01:02:56,784 --> 01:02:58,524
- Really? - At the time,

1803
01:02:58,525 --> 01:03:00,554
the soccer coach...

1804
01:03:01,255 --> 01:03:02,823
- for the boy's team... - Yes.

1805
01:03:02,824 --> 01:03:05,694
Was my first manager's brother-in-law.

1806
01:03:06,025 --> 01:03:07,724
- Goodness. - He was the coach.

1807
01:03:07,725 --> 01:03:10,434
- The boy's team. - So the soccer coach...

1808
01:03:10,435 --> 01:03:12,134
- made the recommendation? - Yes.

1809
01:03:12,534 --> 01:03:14,374
To make a debut in the entertainment business?

1810
01:03:14,404 --> 01:03:15,935
He must've recognized your talent.

1811
01:03:17,975 --> 01:03:19,573
- Thank you for driving. - Thank you.

1812
01:03:19,574 --> 01:03:20,774
(They arrive near the restaurant.)

1813
01:03:20,775 --> 01:03:21,974
- Thank you. - Of course.

1814
01:03:21,975 --> 01:03:24,213
- Thank you for driving. - Thank you.

1815
01:03:24,214 --> 01:03:25,414
(It's now time to have lunch.)

1816
01:03:25,685 --> 01:03:27,783
- Look at that. - The giant dumplings look tasty.

1817
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:28,954
It all looks tasty.

1818
01:03:28,955 --> 01:03:30,084
I'm starving.

1819
01:03:30,085 --> 01:03:31,415
- That's tasty too. - I see.

1820
01:03:31,855 --> 01:03:34,584
This area looks the same as it used to when I was young.

1821
01:03:34,585 --> 01:03:35,694
Yes, it does.

1822
01:03:35,795 --> 01:03:37,653
I used to take piano lessons over there.

1823
01:03:37,654 --> 01:03:38,763
- Really? - Yes.

1824
01:03:38,764 --> 01:03:40,895
- Piano lessons? - It's over there.

1825
01:03:42,464 --> 01:03:44,504
I can't believe we're filming in this neighborhood.

1826
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,604
- How does it feel? - It feels strange.

1827
01:03:46,605 --> 01:03:48,633
(It's a strange feeling.)

1828
01:03:48,634 --> 01:03:50,673
- I think we're almost there. - It's right here.

1829
01:03:50,674 --> 01:03:52,275
- Is this it? - "Earthen pot spaghetti?"

1830
01:03:52,574 --> 01:03:54,044
- I think it's on the second floor. - That's right.

1831
01:03:54,045 --> 01:03:55,805
- It's upstairs? - Yes, on the second floor.

1832
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,174
It really...

1833
01:03:57,275 --> 01:04:00,213
does have an old vibe.

1834
01:04:00,214 --> 01:04:02,455
It's my first time coming after they moved.

1835
01:04:02,514 --> 01:04:03,984
But the old location...

1836
01:04:03,985 --> 01:04:05,383
- was also on the second floor. - It was?

1837
01:04:05,384 --> 01:04:07,464
(The friendly vibe of restaurants near universities)

1838
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:10,224
- Do they have an empty table? - Hi.

1839
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:13,094
- Hi. - Hi.

1840
01:04:13,924 --> 01:04:14,963
Should we sit here?

1841
01:04:14,964 --> 01:04:16,734
It has the university town vibe.

1842
01:04:16,735 --> 01:04:19,303
Yes, it does. The prices used to be very cheap as well,

1843
01:04:19,304 --> 01:04:21,144
- I can feel the vibe. - but I'm not sure now.

1844
01:04:25,205 --> 01:04:27,243
- The song... - It's an old song.

1845
01:04:27,244 --> 01:04:29,914
- It's perfect. - Is it?

1846
01:04:29,915 --> 01:04:31,474
Wouldn't you be more comfortable sitting here?

1847
01:04:31,475 --> 01:04:33,084
I love this vibe.

1848
01:04:33,085 --> 01:04:34,544
It's like a romance drama.

1849
01:04:34,545 --> 01:04:35,553
(Even the music gives off a retro vibe.)

1850
01:04:35,554 --> 01:04:38,213
It feels like I'm in the 2000s or 1990s.

1851
01:04:38,214 --> 01:04:39,355
(It hits the spot.)

1852
01:04:41,625 --> 01:04:43,725
- Don't sit in the corner. - Okay.

1853
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,824
You're superstitious.

1854
01:04:46,295 --> 01:04:47,724
It's because I lived with my grandparents.

1855
01:04:47,725 --> 01:04:49,693
They always told me not to step on the threshold.

1856
01:04:49,694 --> 01:04:50,964
The threshold?

1857
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:53,263
She wasn't just worried about me. It bothered her.

1858
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,364
- I know. - Yes.

1859
01:04:54,505 --> 01:04:55,903
Don't step on the threshold,

1860
01:04:55,904 --> 01:04:58,081
- don't sit in the corner... - Don't rest your chin on your hand.

1861
01:04:58,105 --> 01:04:59,474
You were told not to rest your chin on your hand?

1862
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:01,955
- Yes, I was told not to. - Don't rest your chin on your hand?

1863
01:05:02,574 --> 01:05:03,644
This looks good.

1864
01:05:03,645 --> 01:05:04,645
(They look through the menu carefully.)

1865
01:05:04,646 --> 01:05:06,243
- What should I have? - The assorted seafood sounds good.

1866
01:05:06,244 --> 01:05:07,685
The spicy ones sound tasty.

1867
01:05:08,045 --> 01:05:09,255
There are so many options.

1868
01:05:10,514 --> 01:05:13,154
They also have oil pasta.

1869
01:05:13,255 --> 01:05:14,684
We can choose the toppings.

1870
01:05:14,685 --> 01:05:16,454
(There is a variety of pasta with different sauces.)

1871
01:05:16,455 --> 01:05:17,994
They have all kinds of pasta.

1872
01:05:18,395 --> 01:05:20,664
Wait. "Ppongpaghetti?"

1873
01:05:20,665 --> 01:05:22,763
- I've never seen that before. - We should order a variety.

1874
01:05:22,764 --> 01:05:24,133
Let's order an oil pasta.

1875
01:05:24,134 --> 01:05:25,634
They even have jjamppong pasta.

1876
01:05:25,705 --> 01:05:26,981
There are also rice dishes at the back.

1877
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:28,875
- Fried rice. - They have tteokpaghetti.

1878
01:05:30,174 --> 01:05:31,774
- What will you have? - I want tomato pasta.

1879
01:05:31,775 --> 01:05:32,974
- Tomato? - Yes.

1880
01:05:32,975 --> 01:05:34,474
(Tomato sauce)

1881
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:35,874
- I'll have assorted seafood. - Assorted seafood?

1882
01:05:35,875 --> 01:05:37,815
- Yes. - Assorted seafood.

1883
01:05:37,944 --> 01:05:39,443
I'll try the ppongpaghetti.

1884
01:05:39,444 --> 01:05:40,784
- Ppongpaghetti? - Yes.

1885
01:05:41,114 --> 01:05:42,685
- Assorted seafood. - Okay.

1886
01:05:42,755 --> 01:05:44,584
Shouldn't we have the garlic sticks?

1887
01:05:44,585 --> 01:05:46,154
- Yes, of course. - Yes.

1888
01:05:46,355 --> 01:05:48,454
Let's also order an assorted seafood black fried rice.

1889
01:05:48,455 --> 01:05:50,153
- Assorted seafood black fried rice. - Doesn't that sound good?

1890
01:05:50,154 --> 01:05:51,794
- Yes, it does. - Are you okay with that?

1891
01:05:52,594 --> 01:05:54,764
And a cream shrimp pasta.

1892
01:05:54,964 --> 01:05:56,363
- A cream shrimp pasta? - Yes.

1893
01:05:56,364 --> 01:05:58,065
And for drinks...

1894
01:05:58,505 --> 01:05:59,664
Do you have diet coke?

1895
01:05:59,665 --> 01:06:01,564
- Yes, we have a soda fountain. - I see.

1896
01:06:01,565 --> 01:06:03,633
- It's a self-serve machine? - We'll have four soft drinks.

1897
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:05,004
- Four drinks. - Yes.

1898
01:06:05,005 --> 01:06:06,105
Diet coke?

1899
01:06:07,045 --> 01:06:11,214
(The perfect secretary who does things without being asked.)

1900
01:06:13,685 --> 01:06:16,154
(Shy)

1901
01:06:16,455 --> 01:06:17,854
This is the self-service station, right?

1902
01:06:17,855 --> 01:06:19,455
(Yeon Seok helps out.)

1903
01:06:20,455 --> 01:06:21,994
The younger people should do it.

1904
01:06:22,654 --> 01:06:23,895
- You're right. - Yes.

1905
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,564
You're older than them.

1906
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,795
You're right. Now, everyone is younger than I am at shoots.

1907
01:06:28,994 --> 01:06:30,133
Even the directors.

1908
01:06:30,134 --> 01:06:31,194
Thank you.

1909
01:06:32,134 --> 01:06:33,205
Thank you.

1910
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:34,963
- Jun Hyuk is considerate. - Yes, he is.

1911
01:06:34,964 --> 01:06:36,404
- Do you need an apron? - I'm fine.

1912
01:06:36,505 --> 01:06:37,705
Isn't he perfect for the role?

1913
01:06:37,735 --> 01:06:39,275
- Yes. - The perfect secretary.

1914
01:06:39,744 --> 01:06:41,375
What was he like during shoots?

1915
01:06:41,775 --> 01:06:44,044
- Was he considerate? - Yes, he was.

1916
01:06:44,045 --> 01:06:45,883
Even though he couldn't eat,

1917
01:06:45,884 --> 01:06:47,613
he brought me food.

1918
01:06:47,614 --> 01:06:49,384
- Even though he couldn't eat? - Right.

1919
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:50,613
I was sad about that.

1920
01:06:50,614 --> 01:06:52,324
We didn't get to eat often.

1921
01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:55,123
Does your face get puffy right away?

1922
01:06:55,124 --> 01:06:56,293
Are you okay eating right now?

1923
01:06:56,294 --> 01:06:57,924
I can eat right now.

1924
01:06:58,395 --> 01:07:01,694
You should eat since you're going to get nervous and sweat again.

1925
01:07:01,695 --> 01:07:02,895
But I might get indigestion.

1926
01:07:04,035 --> 01:07:05,740
- That's true. - Do you easily get indigestion?

1927
01:07:05,764 --> 01:07:09,174
I rarely have anything to get this nervous about.

1928
01:07:09,804 --> 01:07:11,673
Aren't you comfortable now?

1929
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:14,905
I'm honestly nervous to be looking at Jae Suk.

1930
01:07:16,945 --> 01:07:18,985
- I'm still amazed. - Eat.

1931
01:07:19,645 --> 01:07:22,953
What did you call each other during the shoot?

1932
01:07:22,954 --> 01:07:24,913
- Ji Min. - Eun Ho.

1933
01:07:24,914 --> 01:07:26,253
That's the name of his role.

1934
01:07:26,254 --> 01:07:27,254
Ji Yoon.

1935
01:07:27,255 --> 01:07:30,253
We tried to immerse ourselves in the roles.

1936
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:33,024
- That's right. - So we used the name of the roles.

1937
01:07:33,025 --> 01:07:34,895
I see. Until the shoot ended?

1938
01:07:34,995 --> 01:07:36,164
Yes.

1939
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:37,763
After the last shoot,

1940
01:07:37,764 --> 01:07:39,833
he called me "Sister,"

1941
01:07:39,834 --> 01:07:42,074
- so I told him not to. - She told me not to.

1942
01:07:42,075 --> 01:07:43,174
Why?

1943
01:07:43,874 --> 01:07:44,874
- I told him not to. - You didn't like that?

1944
01:07:44,875 --> 01:07:46,081
- She didn't like it. - It's not that.

1945
01:07:46,105 --> 01:07:48,444
There are roles that are okay...

1946
01:07:48,445 --> 01:07:50,145
to be like brothers and sisters.

1947
01:07:50,445 --> 01:07:52,713
But if he starts calling me that, it felt like the romance...

1948
01:07:52,714 --> 01:07:54,444
- would disappear. - That's right.

1949
01:07:54,445 --> 01:07:56,383
I was worried we'd become too comfortable.

1950
01:07:56,384 --> 01:07:57,484
(She wanted to protect the romance of the characters.)

1951
01:07:57,485 --> 01:07:59,225
I can already smell it.

1952
01:07:59,424 --> 01:08:00,525
I'm hungry.

1953
01:08:01,355 --> 01:08:03,430
I think they're cooking mine. I can smell the jjamppong.

1954
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,325
But it sounds like something else.

1955
01:08:06,594 --> 01:08:08,463
- We ordered this. Thank you. - Thank you.

1956
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:09,564
Have some wheat crepe.

1957
01:08:09,565 --> 01:08:11,165
- Thank you. - It must be complimentary.

1958
01:08:11,264 --> 01:08:13,935
- We can dip it in the sauce. - That's right.

1959
01:08:14,365 --> 01:08:15,904
They've upgraded the service. They didn't have this before.

1960
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:18,405
- They didn't? - No, they just had the baguette.

1961
01:08:18,475 --> 01:08:19,975
Can you hand me the wet wipes?

1962
01:08:21,004 --> 01:08:22,575
Thank you, Ji Min.

1963
01:08:23,075 --> 01:08:24,575
Thank you, our ace.

1964
01:08:24,775 --> 01:08:26,945
I'm in trouble. How will I do in the next one?

1965
01:08:27,985 --> 01:08:29,114
It feels great to be called that, right?

1966
01:08:29,115 --> 01:08:31,054
It does feel great, but I feel pressured.

1967
01:08:31,954 --> 01:08:32,984
Our ace.

1968
01:08:32,985 --> 01:08:35,623
It's not just the plain one.

1969
01:08:35,624 --> 01:08:37,094
That must be right.

1970
01:08:37,754 --> 01:08:38,825
Is it good?

1971
01:08:39,225 --> 01:08:41,163
Thank you. You should eat too, Jun Hyuk.

1972
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:42,464
- Is it good? - It's good.

1973
01:08:43,134 --> 01:08:44,564
Thank you.

1974
01:08:44,565 --> 01:08:46,203
(She is amazed as soon as she puts it in her mouth.)

1975
01:08:46,204 --> 01:08:48,634
There's something in it.

1976
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:50,204
I can taste vegetables.

1977
01:08:50,575 --> 01:08:52,804
- There are some vegetables in it. - It's not plain.

1978
01:08:53,804 --> 01:08:56,945
(The two friends take a bite as well.)

1979
01:08:57,145 --> 01:08:58,145
It's not plain.

1980
01:08:58,445 --> 01:08:59,684
- It's good. - It's good.

1981
01:08:59,685 --> 01:09:01,914
(Tasting)

1982
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:03,953
It's the type I like.

1983
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:05,053
- Right. - It's here.

1984
01:09:05,054 --> 01:09:06,623
- The tomato seafood pasta? - Here.

1985
01:09:06,624 --> 01:09:08,083
(Ji Min's tomato seafood pasta came out first.)

1986
01:09:08,084 --> 01:09:09,694
- Thank you. - It's hot.

1987
01:09:09,695 --> 01:09:11,024
- Be careful. - It looks good, doesn't it?

1988
01:09:11,025 --> 01:09:13,423
- Gosh. - It looks amazing.

1989
01:09:13,424 --> 01:09:14,894
It does look amazing.

1990
01:09:14,895 --> 01:09:16,610
(The pasta is sizzling in the earthen pot.)

1991
01:09:16,634 --> 01:09:18,263
- Start eating, Ji Min. - Weren't you curious about it?

1992
01:09:18,264 --> 01:09:20,534
- Start eating, Ji Min. - Right. Thank you.

1993
01:09:20,535 --> 01:09:22,575
It's unique as it's served in an earthen pot.

1994
01:09:22,804 --> 01:09:24,404
- The next one is here. - The ppongpaghetti?

1995
01:09:24,405 --> 01:09:26,005
- The ppongpaghetti. - That would be me.

1996
01:09:26,044 --> 01:09:27,203
Enjoy your meal.

1997
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:28,275
(Impressed)

1998
01:09:28,475 --> 01:09:30,373
- It's a collaboration... - That looks great.

1999
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,975
Between jjamppong and spaghetti.

2000
01:09:32,344 --> 01:09:34,043
- The seafood oil pasta. - Gosh.

2001
01:09:34,044 --> 01:09:35,414
- Gosh. - That looks good too.

2002
01:09:35,584 --> 01:09:37,014
- That looks good. - Right.

2003
01:09:37,655 --> 01:09:38,923
- I can't believe it. - I ordered the cream pasta.

2004
01:09:38,924 --> 01:09:40,724
- Cream. They're all different. - Cream shrimp pasta.

2005
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:41,725
I love it.

2006
01:09:41,726 --> 01:09:42,753
- Thank you. - There's garlic in it.

2007
01:09:42,754 --> 01:09:44,423
- Enjoy your meal. - Try some of mine too.

2008
01:09:44,424 --> 01:09:45,725
Thank you.

2009
01:09:46,924 --> 01:09:48,124
Go ahead and eat.

2010
01:09:48,794 --> 01:09:49,865
Okay.

2011
01:09:50,995 --> 01:09:52,364
- What's wrong? - Eat comfortably.

2012
01:09:52,365 --> 01:09:53,434
(Feeling awkward all of sudden)

2013
01:09:53,435 --> 01:09:54,463
What's wrong, Jun Hyuk?

2014
01:09:54,464 --> 01:09:55,803
- Do you feel uncomfortable again? - No.

2015
01:09:55,804 --> 01:09:58,075
- Should we leave you alone? - No!

2016
01:09:59,105 --> 01:10:01,075
Just don't keep your eyes on me.

2017
01:10:01,674 --> 01:10:03,214
- Oh, right. - Gosh.

2018
01:10:03,544 --> 01:10:04,544
I'm fine.

2019
01:10:04,645 --> 01:10:08,043
If Um Tae Goo and Jun Hyuk appear together,

2020
01:10:08,044 --> 01:10:09,083
(The two best-known celebrities to be shy)

2021
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:10,285
it'll be amazing.

2022
01:10:11,155 --> 01:10:12,961
- Gosh, this looks amazing. - There isn't one in Korea.

2023
01:10:12,985 --> 01:10:14,354
- I'll give it a try. - Okay.

2024
01:10:14,355 --> 01:10:18,454
(The earthen pot pasta that Ji Min had often as a college student)

2025
01:10:19,565 --> 01:10:21,424
(Satisfied)

2026
01:10:23,935 --> 01:10:25,764
(Slurping)

2027
01:10:27,435 --> 01:10:28,833
- You should try some, Yeon Seok. - Right.

2028
01:10:28,834 --> 01:10:30,404
(Totally satisfied)

2029
01:10:30,405 --> 01:10:33,003
The ppongpaghetti. I'm curious about this one too.

2030
01:10:33,004 --> 01:10:34,374
- Give it a try. - Right.

2031
01:10:34,674 --> 01:10:35,914
- Try some. - Right.

2032
01:10:36,514 --> 01:10:37,945
All right.

2033
01:10:38,844 --> 01:10:41,543
The ppongpaghetti. I'm curious about this one too.

2034
01:10:41,544 --> 01:10:42,884
- Give it a try. - Right.

2035
01:10:43,254 --> 01:10:44,815
- Is it spicy? - It's spicy.

2036
01:10:45,785 --> 01:10:47,155
It's really good.

2037
01:10:47,225 --> 01:10:49,655
- Is the oil pasta good? - Try the jjamppong pasta.

2038
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:53,225
Gosh, it's great.

2039
01:10:53,764 --> 01:10:55,694
- It's good. - It's good. Give it a try.

2040
01:10:55,695 --> 01:10:57,594
It's good. It's nice we came here.

2041
01:10:57,764 --> 01:10:58,764
Really?

2042
01:10:59,304 --> 01:11:01,180
- It's really good. - It'd be great for hangovers.

2043
01:11:01,204 --> 01:11:03,405
- It's good. - It's good. Give it a try.

2044
01:11:04,405 --> 01:11:06,503
(Trying Jae Suk's pasta)

2045
01:11:06,504 --> 01:11:08,424
- That was very neat. - You should try mine too.

2046
01:11:09,075 --> 01:11:10,544
- I'll give it a try. - Okay.

2047
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:13,685
Oil.

2048
01:11:14,084 --> 01:11:15,145
Oil.

2049
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:17,685
Oil.

2050
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,324
I want to try this too.

2051
01:11:19,325 --> 01:11:21,725
Yes. It's really good.

2052
01:11:23,454 --> 01:11:24,895
It's perfect in winter.

2053
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,794
(Ji Min takes a bite.)

2054
01:11:28,395 --> 01:11:30,294
- There was one in the past. - Gosh.

2055
01:11:30,865 --> 01:11:32,304
There's no choice.

2056
01:11:32,935 --> 01:11:34,035
Gosh, it's good.

2057
01:11:34,235 --> 01:11:35,995
We all did well to order a variety of pasta.

2058
01:11:36,204 --> 01:11:37,833
- That one is good too. - It's good.

2059
01:11:37,834 --> 01:11:39,003
(Crossing forks)

2060
01:11:39,004 --> 01:11:40,804
It's still hot as it's in the earthen pot.

2061
01:11:41,445 --> 01:11:42,475
You're right.

2062
01:11:42,745 --> 01:11:44,713
It's the taste you find near colleges.

2063
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:45,714
Right.

2064
01:11:46,785 --> 01:11:49,615
Do you know the place called Sorrento from the past?

2065
01:11:50,285 --> 01:11:51,753
- Right. - I know that place.

2066
01:11:51,754 --> 01:11:53,785
- There was Minto too. - Right. Minto.

2067
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:56,094
I loved Minto.

2068
01:11:56,355 --> 01:11:58,093
- I worked there. - You worked part-time?

2069
01:11:58,094 --> 01:11:59,423
- Really? - At Sorrento?

2070
01:11:59,424 --> 01:12:01,093
- Minto. - Minto?

2071
01:12:01,094 --> 01:12:02,123
In Daehangno?

2072
01:12:02,124 --> 01:12:03,735
- Sinchon. - Sinchon?

2073
01:12:03,935 --> 01:12:05,504
You must've been popular.

2074
01:12:05,865 --> 01:12:07,105
He must've been really popular.

2075
01:12:08,605 --> 01:12:10,074
- It's really good. - The baguette. It looks so good!

2076
01:12:10,075 --> 01:12:11,134
Enjoy your meal.

2077
01:12:11,275 --> 01:12:12,774
Thank you.

2078
01:12:12,775 --> 01:12:14,373
- Enjoy your meal. - It's really big.

2079
01:12:14,374 --> 01:12:15,714
It's all cut up.

2080
01:12:16,514 --> 01:12:17,674
I thought it was an eel.

2081
01:12:19,315 --> 01:12:21,684
I thought it was a silver hairtail.

2082
01:12:21,685 --> 01:12:23,125
- It does look like an eel. - Right.

2083
01:12:23,914 --> 01:12:26,225
(He tries it right away.)

2084
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,094
(Nodding)

2085
01:12:30,525 --> 01:12:32,054
Gosh, check out the cream pasta.

2086
01:12:32,225 --> 01:12:34,385
- Gosh, it looks amazing. - Can I dip it in the sauce?

2087
01:12:34,424 --> 01:12:35,593
Go ahead.

2088
01:12:35,594 --> 01:12:36,874
I think it'll be good with this.

2089
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:39,204
(Dipping in the cream sauce)

2090
01:12:42,035 --> 01:12:43,674
(Taking a bite)

2091
01:12:44,504 --> 01:12:45,873
- It's nice. - Right.

2092
01:12:45,874 --> 01:12:47,475
I love these things.

2093
01:12:47,844 --> 01:12:49,314
- Things like buckwheat crepes? - Yes.

2094
01:12:49,315 --> 01:12:50,315
Things like naan.

2095
01:12:50,316 --> 01:12:52,074
- They're great. - We love bread,

2096
01:12:52,075 --> 01:12:54,084
- but we're not allowed to have any. - Right.

2097
01:12:54,584 --> 01:12:56,064
It's fine to have some now, Jun Hyuk.

2098
01:12:56,155 --> 01:12:57,754
- Right. - Have all you want.

2099
01:12:57,815 --> 01:12:59,215
That's why I'm loving it right now.

2100
01:12:59,985 --> 01:13:01,423
- I'm addicted to this. - You can have some...

2101
01:13:01,424 --> 01:13:03,325
- when you're done with a show. - Right.

2102
01:13:06,525 --> 01:13:07,695
He looks happy.

2103
01:13:10,235 --> 01:13:12,605
- It's good. - You look the happiest right now.

2104
01:13:12,764 --> 01:13:14,535
I think this is the best moment.

2105
01:13:14,865 --> 01:13:17,035
- You must love eating. - I really do.

2106
01:13:17,435 --> 01:13:19,075
He eats 2 to 3 boxes of pizza on his own.

2107
01:13:20,245 --> 01:13:21,343
(He's actually a big eater.)

2108
01:13:21,344 --> 01:13:22,614
This is why I'm controlling myself.

2109
01:13:22,615 --> 01:13:26,214
Once I start, I open up six packets of chips at once.

2110
01:13:26,344 --> 01:13:28,884
I wondered if it would be okay...

2111
01:13:29,014 --> 01:13:30,785
since we use a lot of energy when we work.

2112
01:13:31,084 --> 01:13:32,623
But Son Suk Ku knows him well,

2113
01:13:32,624 --> 01:13:34,923
and he said he really gains weight right after eating.

2114
01:13:34,924 --> 01:13:36,554
I'll have gained weight a while later.

2115
01:13:36,995 --> 01:13:38,024
(He gains weight right away.)

2116
01:13:38,025 --> 01:13:41,325
When I was in "The Roundup," Ma Dong Seok...

2117
01:13:41,594 --> 01:13:44,633
told me to gain 5kg, and I appeared the next day after gaining 5kg.

2118
01:13:44,634 --> 01:13:45,703
- Really? - Yes.

2119
01:13:45,704 --> 01:13:47,535
He asked if I could gain 5kg more.

2120
01:13:47,664 --> 01:13:49,604
I agreed, and that led me to gain 20kg.

2121
01:13:49,605 --> 01:13:51,333
(Joo Seong Cheol was born after gaining 20kg.)

2122
01:13:51,334 --> 01:13:53,414
- It must be easy to gain weight. - It's super easy.

2123
01:13:54,204 --> 01:13:57,944
When I eat well and go over 80kg,

2124
01:13:57,945 --> 01:13:59,384
I feel less shy.

2125
01:14:00,214 --> 01:14:02,214
I don't know why.

2126
01:14:02,514 --> 01:14:04,713
- Why is that? - I feel less shy.

2127
01:14:04,714 --> 01:14:06,224
You feel less shy when you eat well?

2128
01:14:06,225 --> 01:14:07,484
- Yes. - You should eat a lot.

2129
01:14:07,485 --> 01:14:08,953
I become more confident.

2130
01:14:08,954 --> 01:14:10,453
It must affect my hormones.

2131
01:14:10,454 --> 01:14:12,225
You should eat everything here.

2132
01:14:12,565 --> 01:14:14,325
- It really changes me. - Try the rice too.

2133
01:14:14,725 --> 01:14:16,594
- This is good. - It's black rice.

2134
01:14:16,664 --> 01:14:17,833
This is really good.

2135
01:14:17,834 --> 01:14:18,964
You should eat a lot.

2136
01:14:19,834 --> 01:14:22,034
Eat a lot before we meet our second guest.

2137
01:14:22,035 --> 01:14:23,650
(He makes sure his friend doesn't feel shy.)

2138
01:14:23,674 --> 01:14:25,004
Eat all you can.

2139
01:14:25,405 --> 01:14:27,275
You two are taking great care of each other.

2140
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:29,374
I think we've become a lot closer today.

2141
01:14:30,344 --> 01:14:33,115
How did you become an actor, Jun Hyuk?

2142
01:14:33,785 --> 01:14:35,815
It happened quite unexpectedly.

2143
01:14:36,084 --> 01:14:37,614
Actually...

2144
01:14:37,615 --> 01:14:39,824
I heard you majored in directing.

2145
01:14:39,825 --> 01:14:42,053
I didn't major in directing. I learned it myself separately.

2146
01:14:42,054 --> 01:14:43,324
You studied directing?

2147
01:14:43,325 --> 01:14:45,924
As I went around to film independent films,

2148
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:48,825
I got lost.

2149
01:14:49,464 --> 01:14:52,503
A moment of great embarrassment comes when that happens.

2150
01:14:52,504 --> 01:14:54,904
- "How do I direct this?" - I see.

2151
01:14:54,905 --> 01:14:58,035
You felt a moment when you didn't know what to do with directions.

2152
01:14:58,075 --> 01:15:00,145
That was why I started to learn how to act.

2153
01:15:00,945 --> 01:15:02,614
You learned how to act to be a better director.

2154
01:15:02,615 --> 01:15:05,174
That was how it started.

2155
01:15:05,315 --> 01:15:08,384
You would've ended up here even if you were a director.

2156
01:15:09,115 --> 01:15:10,484
Right. He's got great looks.

2157
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:12,485
- That's how it is. - Thank you.

2158
01:15:13,985 --> 01:15:17,624
It must've been similar for Ji Min with how she started.

2159
01:15:17,995 --> 01:15:20,395
Have you never been cast on the street?

2160
01:15:21,094 --> 01:15:23,734
Back then, there were a lot of people in front of the schools.

2161
01:15:23,735 --> 01:15:24,894
Right.

2162
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,680
She must've received a lot of business cards.

2163
01:15:26,704 --> 01:15:29,204
Even when that happened at an early age,

2164
01:15:29,735 --> 01:15:32,275
I didn't expect myself to become an actress.

2165
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:34,374
The people around you would've gone wild about it.

2166
01:15:35,544 --> 01:15:37,144
You were destined to become a celebrity.

2167
01:15:37,214 --> 01:15:38,975
Did the people around you go wild too?

2168
01:15:39,815 --> 01:15:41,084
They were very calm.

2169
01:15:41,414 --> 01:15:43,014
(Laughing)

2170
01:15:44,315 --> 01:15:45,554
I see.

2171
01:15:46,225 --> 01:15:47,285
Gosh, I'm full.

2172
01:15:47,884 --> 01:15:48,953
(The plates have been emptied clean.)

2173
01:15:48,954 --> 01:15:50,294
That was great, Jun Hyuk.

2174
01:15:52,395 --> 01:15:53,424
Right.

2175
01:15:53,924 --> 01:15:55,495
I can treat my friend to a meal.

2176
01:15:55,834 --> 01:15:57,735
I can pay for this as I won twice.

2177
01:15:58,164 --> 01:15:59,734
- Really? - I brought my wallet.

2178
01:15:59,735 --> 01:16:00,833
(She wants to treat them as she feels great.)

2179
01:16:00,834 --> 01:16:02,575
- Ji Min will treat us? - I'll treat you.

2180
01:16:03,204 --> 01:16:04,904
I feel really happy today.

2181
01:16:04,905 --> 01:16:07,343
- Gosh. - Gosh. Can we let her pay?

2182
01:16:07,344 --> 01:16:08,803
- I really enjoyed the meal. - Gosh.

2183
01:16:08,804 --> 01:16:10,413
- Thank you, Ji Min. - Thank you.

2184
01:16:10,414 --> 01:16:12,213
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

2185
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:13,713
- Thank you. - They all enjoyed the food.

2186
01:16:13,714 --> 01:16:15,285
Ji Min brought us here.

2187
01:16:15,344 --> 01:16:17,354
I think you did well to decide on the earthen pot dish.

2188
01:16:17,355 --> 01:16:18,513
- Really? - It was amazing.

2189
01:16:18,514 --> 01:16:20,084
Right. It was a great choice.

2190
01:16:20,525 --> 01:16:22,694
We'll be right on time.

2191
01:16:22,695 --> 01:16:23,924
- You're right. - Right.

2192
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:25,894
- Which way do we go? - We have to go this way.

2193
01:16:25,895 --> 01:16:27,163
- We can walk there? - It's a short walk.

2194
01:16:27,164 --> 01:16:28,424
- Really? - I love it.

2195
01:16:29,025 --> 01:16:30,935
- I wanted to walk. - Really?

2196
01:16:31,565 --> 01:16:33,263
You're at your old neighborhood after a while.

2197
01:16:33,264 --> 01:16:34,984
- Right. I love it. - It's great, isn't it?

2198
01:16:35,834 --> 01:16:37,704
This was the spot for puffed grains.

2199
01:16:38,035 --> 01:16:39,304
- Really? - Yes.

2200
01:16:40,275 --> 01:16:41,774
This happens to everyone.

2201
01:16:41,775 --> 01:16:42,843
When people return to their neighborhood...

2202
01:16:42,844 --> 01:16:43,944
They talk a lot, don't they?

2203
01:16:43,945 --> 01:16:45,444
(You start to talk a lot when you're at your hometown.)

2204
01:16:45,445 --> 01:16:48,814
They screamed, "Puff!" The stall for puffed grains used to be there.

2205
01:16:48,815 --> 01:16:49,954
It happens to everyone.

2206
01:16:50,084 --> 01:16:52,454
I become like that all the time when I go to Suyu-ri.

2207
01:16:53,785 --> 01:16:56,495
- It's right back there. - It's here?

2208
01:16:57,825 --> 01:16:59,794
It's Kim Bong Rae and Yoo Young Bae.

2209
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:03,664
"We have been in the same place looking the same for 15 years."

2210
01:17:04,035 --> 01:17:07,204
"We have been responsible for hearty meals for the students."

2211
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:09,003
- Students? - Is it a restaurant?

2212
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:10,104
Is it in front of the school?

2213
01:17:10,105 --> 01:17:12,303
"As it's sad to see them leave after just having a meal,"

2214
01:17:12,304 --> 01:17:13,873
"we nag them at times..."

2215
01:17:13,874 --> 01:17:16,513
"and serve them handmade bread."

2216
01:17:16,514 --> 01:17:19,214
"Come to our place full of love."

2217
01:17:19,315 --> 01:17:20,414
Is it a bakery?

2218
01:17:20,615 --> 01:17:22,213
- Could it be a bakery? - It must be in front of the school.

2219
01:17:22,214 --> 01:17:23,453
I love bread.

2220
01:17:23,454 --> 01:17:24,654
- Right. - Me too.

2221
01:17:24,655 --> 01:17:25,785
- Really? - Yes.

2222
01:17:28,225 --> 01:17:30,025
Who will we meet this time?

2223
01:17:30,655 --> 01:17:32,624
(He starts feeling shy again.)

2224
01:17:32,964 --> 01:17:35,594
Can you show me your tone?

2225
01:17:35,995 --> 01:17:37,234
What are you talking about?

2226
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:38,964
You can just speak in your original tone.

2227
01:17:40,105 --> 01:17:41,534
(He still does it for him.)

2228
01:17:41,535 --> 01:17:43,934
Hey, will we be able to do well in the second spare time?

2229
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:44,974
Oh, I see.

2230
01:17:44,975 --> 01:17:47,344
Hey, will we be able to do well in the second spare time?

2231
01:17:47,704 --> 01:17:49,413
- I think we can do well. - Just like the first spare time.

2232
01:17:49,414 --> 01:17:51,274
Right. Hold on. It's here.

2233
01:17:51,275 --> 01:17:52,944
- It's here? - It's here?

2234
01:17:52,945 --> 01:17:54,083
Is it this place? Curry?

2235
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:55,543
- Is it on the first floor? - Hold on.

2236
01:17:55,544 --> 01:17:57,154
- Right. This is it. - It's here?

2237
01:17:57,155 --> 01:17:59,053
- What is this place? - I don't see anyone.

2238
01:17:59,054 --> 01:18:00,894
- It looks closed. - I don't think this is it.

2239
01:18:00,985 --> 01:18:02,525
- Bread? - Hold on.

2240
01:18:02,995 --> 01:18:06,364
We have to find Kim Bong Rae and Yoo Young Bae.

2241
01:18:06,365 --> 01:18:08,194
- Inside? - Kim Bong Rae.

2242
01:18:08,195 --> 01:18:09,593
- Hello. Are you Kim Bong Rae? - Hello.

2243
01:18:09,594 --> 01:18:11,565
- Yes! Welcome. - Oh, hello.

2244
01:18:11,594 --> 01:18:15,303
- Welcome! - Hello!

2245
01:18:15,304 --> 01:18:17,574
It's great to see you. Gosh, thank you for coming!

2246
01:18:17,575 --> 01:18:18,833
- Gosh! - Hello.

2247
01:18:18,834 --> 01:18:20,373
- It's great to see you. - If we had known,

2248
01:18:20,374 --> 01:18:21,604
we would've come here to eat.

2249
01:18:21,605 --> 01:18:23,574
Right. Where did you eat?

2250
01:18:23,575 --> 01:18:24,645
We should've...

2251
01:18:24,775 --> 01:18:29,185
(Kim Bong Rae, Yoo Young Bae, the second Whenever Guests)

2252
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:33,285
- It's an honor. - We should thank the two of you.

2253
01:18:33,485 --> 01:18:35,484
You look a lot better in person than on TV.

2254
01:18:35,485 --> 01:18:36,655
Gosh, thank you.

2255
01:18:37,124 --> 01:18:38,524
You're shining brightly for the Yoo family.

2256
01:18:38,525 --> 01:18:39,964
Are you a Yoo too?

2257
01:18:40,195 --> 01:18:42,093
Which generation are you from?

2258
01:18:42,094 --> 01:18:43,593
You're even asking about which generation he's from?

2259
01:18:43,594 --> 01:18:45,463
- Your name starts with Jae, right? - Yes.

2260
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:46,963
Our grandfather is of that line.

2261
01:18:46,964 --> 01:18:48,734
- Really? Please take a seat. - Right.

2262
01:18:48,735 --> 01:18:50,375
(Benevolent grandson, Polite grandfather)

2263
01:18:50,475 --> 01:18:52,503
Curry would've been great too.

2264
01:18:52,504 --> 01:18:53,873
- It looks great. - This place is famous too.

2265
01:18:53,874 --> 01:18:54,974
Do you know this place?

2266
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:56,115
I've visited this place too.

2267
01:18:56,174 --> 01:18:57,654
But they won't know that I came here.

2268
01:18:58,115 --> 01:19:00,115
- Ji Min is with us. - Right.

2269
01:19:00,285 --> 01:19:02,584
- I'm from Heukseok-dong. - She lived in Heukseok-dong.

2270
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:04,484
She said she came here to eat.

2271
01:19:04,485 --> 01:19:05,854
- Really? - Yes.

2272
01:19:05,855 --> 01:19:07,284
You didn't know, right?

2273
01:19:07,285 --> 01:19:09,024
- I just came quietly to eat. - I only heard that...

2274
01:19:09,025 --> 01:19:10,895
that she was around 15 years ago.

2275
01:19:11,495 --> 01:19:13,224
We were wondering if she was never going to visit us.

2276
01:19:13,225 --> 01:19:14,293
- I did come here. - But she did come.

2277
01:19:14,294 --> 01:19:15,994
I ate here and at the pork cutlet place next door.

2278
01:19:15,995 --> 01:19:16,995
I see.

2279
01:19:16,996 --> 01:19:19,703
Ji Min went around this whole area.

2280
01:19:19,704 --> 01:19:21,133
She lived nearby.

2281
01:19:21,134 --> 01:19:24,834
A lot of students come here, right?

2282
01:19:24,975 --> 01:19:28,075
Yes. Students are our main customers.

2283
01:19:28,704 --> 01:19:30,944
Are you two running the place together?

2284
01:19:30,945 --> 01:19:33,944
- Yes. - Yes. I'm just an assistant.

2285
01:19:33,945 --> 01:19:35,584
She's the main chef.

2286
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:37,713
(Shy)

2287
01:19:37,714 --> 01:19:40,825
Is there anything specific that you take care of for the students?

2288
01:19:42,454 --> 01:19:45,794
Well, we don't use any artificial flavor enhancers.

2289
01:19:45,964 --> 01:19:47,364
The students tell us...

2290
01:19:47,365 --> 01:19:50,464
that it feels like they're eating at home here.

2291
01:19:51,035 --> 01:19:53,534
It isn't anything special, but it's food that feels comfortable.

2292
01:19:53,535 --> 01:19:54,934
- You've tried our food, right? - Yes.

2293
01:19:54,935 --> 01:19:56,373
- So you do the cooking? - It's like a homemade meal.

2294
01:19:56,374 --> 01:19:57,804
- Yes. - I see.

2295
01:19:57,905 --> 01:19:59,774
In your letter,

2296
01:19:59,775 --> 01:20:01,944
you said you've been here for 15 years...

2297
01:20:01,945 --> 01:20:03,814
and nagging at them from time to time.

2298
01:20:03,815 --> 01:20:05,474
- That was what was written. - Right.

2299
01:20:05,475 --> 01:20:07,414
When any of the students come alone,

2300
01:20:07,714 --> 01:20:10,615
I start a conversation with them first.

2301
01:20:10,884 --> 01:20:13,824
If it's a female student,

2302
01:20:13,825 --> 01:20:15,453
she might have long hair.

2303
01:20:15,454 --> 01:20:19,494
I ask how long it took to grow out her hair.

2304
01:20:19,495 --> 01:20:21,525
I purposely talk to the students.

2305
01:20:21,825 --> 01:20:23,633
So that is how I approach them.

2306
01:20:23,634 --> 01:20:24,864
So how long did it take for the girl to grow her hair?

2307
01:20:24,865 --> 01:20:26,435
Around three years.

2308
01:20:28,204 --> 01:20:30,703
This is a conversation I can never forget.

2309
01:20:30,704 --> 01:20:32,574
Many male students come to our place.

2310
01:20:32,575 --> 01:20:34,203
We have two sons as well.

2311
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,605
After becoming a mother,

2312
01:20:35,844 --> 01:20:39,745
it was hard to understand my sons' hearts.

2313
01:20:40,214 --> 01:20:43,684
So I asked the male students when they think about their mothers.

2314
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:45,185
What do you think they said to me?

2315
01:20:45,655 --> 01:20:46,753
When they need money.

2316
01:20:46,754 --> 01:20:48,184
Gosh, you're right!

2317
01:20:48,185 --> 01:20:49,394
- It's when they need money. - Really?

2318
01:20:49,395 --> 01:20:51,953
They think of their mothers when they need money.

2319
01:20:51,954 --> 01:20:54,064
- It's when they need money. - I did get it right, but...

2320
01:20:54,065 --> 01:20:55,724
(Son Jae Suk got it right but feels a bit bitter.)

2321
01:20:55,725 --> 01:20:57,333
- Really? - I got it right.

2322
01:20:57,334 --> 01:20:59,293
- That's so upsetting. - I felt so sad.

2323
01:20:59,294 --> 01:21:01,163
It really made me sad.

2324
01:21:01,164 --> 01:21:04,874
There's one thing I nag about to the students.

2325
01:21:05,075 --> 01:21:08,204
After becoming a mother, when my sons are outside,

2326
01:21:08,475 --> 01:21:10,673
I think to myself, "What would they have eaten today?"

2327
01:21:10,674 --> 01:21:13,814
I'm always concerned about if they would have eaten properly.

2328
01:21:13,815 --> 01:21:15,261
The first thing I say during a phone call is,

2329
01:21:15,285 --> 01:21:17,985
"Have you eaten?"

2330
01:21:18,384 --> 01:21:21,354
If a photo of what they eat is taken...

2331
01:21:21,355 --> 01:21:23,293
and sent to their mothers,

2332
01:21:23,294 --> 01:21:26,123
their mothers would feel relieved.

2333
01:21:26,124 --> 01:21:28,293
That is why I make them send pictures...

2334
01:21:28,294 --> 01:21:30,364
with that thought in mind.

2335
01:21:30,365 --> 01:21:33,264
My parents had two sons too.

2336
01:21:34,004 --> 01:21:35,904
- Really? - Just as you mentioned,

2337
01:21:35,905 --> 01:21:39,405
I don't think I've done that.

2338
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:41,843
"I ate this today."

2339
01:21:41,844 --> 01:21:43,744
I don't think I've ever sent...

2340
01:21:43,745 --> 01:21:45,944
- those kinds of photos before. - It doesn't have to be specific.

2341
01:21:45,945 --> 01:21:50,114
If you show your mom that you're eating well and doing well,

2342
01:21:50,115 --> 01:21:51,684
- she will feel a lot more relieved. - Right.

2343
01:21:51,685 --> 01:21:54,725
- This is the heart of our mothers. - Right.

2344
01:21:55,155 --> 01:21:57,355
As for us,

2345
01:21:57,495 --> 01:21:59,055
we scold them if they leave their food.

2346
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:02,793
That's the biggest one. "Was it bad?"

2347
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:05,865
"Did you not like it?" I say these things to them.

2348
01:22:07,235 --> 01:22:09,004
(He spots something.)

2349
01:22:10,975 --> 01:22:12,904
- Ma'am, what are these? - What are all of these?

2350
01:22:12,905 --> 01:22:15,144
- Are these business cards? - Yes.

2351
01:22:15,145 --> 01:22:17,020
- Why are there so many of them? - They are business cards.

2352
01:22:17,044 --> 01:22:19,343
They are coupons that show their mileage.

2353
01:22:19,344 --> 01:22:20,713
I see.

2354
01:22:20,714 --> 01:22:24,485
They get a stamp if they eat a meal.

2355
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:27,025
They just need to say their names.

2356
01:22:27,285 --> 01:22:29,794
We take care of them during our break.

2357
01:22:30,094 --> 01:22:32,054
That's amazing. All of these people come?

2358
01:22:32,995 --> 01:22:35,365
After one student comes and eats here,

2359
01:22:35,594 --> 01:22:38,833
they bring more and more friends.

2360
01:22:38,834 --> 01:22:40,703
They come day and night.

2361
01:22:40,704 --> 01:22:42,004
Back then,

2362
01:22:42,405 --> 01:22:44,934
the seniors brought the juniors on a tour of good restaurants.

2363
01:22:44,935 --> 01:22:47,604
- Right. - They introduce good places.

2364
01:22:47,605 --> 01:22:48,904
- I think I remember that. - Right.

2365
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:51,144
- My seniors... - The seniors bring you around.

2366
01:22:51,145 --> 01:22:52,843
- Right. - "You have to come here."

2367
01:22:52,844 --> 01:22:54,713
- Right. - There was a student...

2368
01:22:54,714 --> 01:22:57,414
that came to our place for a whole month.

2369
01:22:57,685 --> 01:22:58,854
It was a freshman.

2370
01:22:58,855 --> 01:23:01,724
The student couldn't tell the seniors that they already came here.

2371
01:23:01,725 --> 01:23:03,593
And that led them to...

2372
01:23:03,594 --> 01:23:05,294
come here...

2373
01:23:05,725 --> 01:23:07,724
for a whole month.

2374
01:23:07,725 --> 01:23:08,923
That happened to some students.

2375
01:23:08,924 --> 01:23:12,034
Simply put, this restaurant is doing really well.

2376
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:13,035
(Simply put, this restaurant is doing really well.)

2377
01:23:13,036 --> 01:23:14,640
- It's something to be happy about. - Right.

2378
01:23:14,664 --> 01:23:16,235
- I feel grateful. - I feel happy.

2379
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:19,405
When you live in Heukseok-dong,

2380
01:23:19,874 --> 01:23:22,074
it's really quiet when it's the break season.

2381
01:23:22,075 --> 01:23:24,213
All of the students return to their homes.

2382
01:23:24,214 --> 01:23:27,013
When I walk around with my mom, we get worried about...

2383
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:29,084
how long a new place would last in this area.

2384
01:23:29,445 --> 01:23:30,953
There's always a period of recession.

2385
01:23:30,954 --> 01:23:33,454
The vacation seasons are long for the summer and winter.

2386
01:23:33,525 --> 01:23:35,985
Are things okay during those times as well?

2387
01:23:36,554 --> 01:23:38,354
A business in a college town...

2388
01:23:38,355 --> 01:23:40,494
is known to last for seven months in a year.

2389
01:23:40,495 --> 01:23:41,564
(Sales are focused during the semesters.)

2390
01:23:41,565 --> 01:23:43,534
But as for us,

2391
01:23:43,535 --> 01:23:46,535
the teaching staff and adults around...

2392
01:23:46,634 --> 01:23:48,905
don't usually come because of the many students.

2393
01:23:49,004 --> 01:23:51,004
They come when the students are away on vacation.

2394
01:23:51,275 --> 01:23:52,904
- That's great. - That's great.

2395
01:23:52,905 --> 01:23:55,475
Thus, you two are doing well even during the off-season.

2396
01:23:56,275 --> 01:23:58,513
- That's what it means. - Things are going well.

2397
01:23:58,514 --> 01:23:59,744
That's great to hear.

2398
01:23:59,745 --> 01:24:01,514
- That really is great to hear. - Right.

2399
01:24:01,785 --> 01:24:04,213
I heard that you serve the students...

2400
01:24:04,214 --> 01:24:06,753
- bread as well. - Right.

2401
01:24:06,754 --> 01:24:10,654
It's my hobby to bake,

2402
01:24:10,655 --> 01:24:12,824
- and I like making things. - I see.

2403
01:24:12,825 --> 01:24:16,263
I pack some bread for the students that come often.

2404
01:24:16,264 --> 01:24:18,565
I share it with the people around us as well.

2405
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:20,565
What kind of things do you make?

2406
01:24:20,905 --> 01:24:23,475
I bake financiers...

2407
01:24:23,634 --> 01:24:25,203
- I love financiers. - or salted butter rolls.

2408
01:24:25,204 --> 01:24:26,673
I make these sorts of things.

2409
01:24:26,674 --> 01:24:28,404
- As a dessert. - Right.

2410
01:24:28,405 --> 01:24:30,615
Jun Hyuk said he loves financiers.

2411
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:32,944
I did bake some.

2412
01:24:32,945 --> 01:24:34,513
- Oh, really? - He loves bread.

2413
01:24:34,514 --> 01:24:35,944
- He loves bread. - Right.

2414
01:24:35,945 --> 01:24:36,953
Just a little bit of it would be great.

2415
01:24:36,954 --> 01:24:37,984
Just a little?

2416
01:24:37,985 --> 01:24:39,665
- Yes. - Yes. We can try them as we speak.

2417
01:24:39,825 --> 01:24:41,524
What kind of financiers are they?

2418
01:24:41,525 --> 01:24:42,730
(She gets up to get the financiers.)

2419
01:24:42,754 --> 01:24:43,754
(Excited)

2420
01:24:43,755 --> 01:24:45,725
- I love financiers. - Really?

2421
01:24:46,495 --> 01:24:48,924
You should each try one.

2422
01:24:49,195 --> 01:24:51,594
I made them last night.

2423
01:24:51,735 --> 01:24:54,964
This one is coconut-flavored, and the other one is chocolate.

2424
01:24:55,504 --> 01:24:56,974
- Yes. - I love them both.

2425
01:24:56,975 --> 01:24:58,105
- Gosh. - Me too.

2426
01:24:58,935 --> 01:24:59,974
(Excited)

2427
01:24:59,975 --> 01:25:02,003
- Gosh. - What is this?

2428
01:25:02,004 --> 01:25:03,475
They just need to say their names.

2429
01:25:03,714 --> 01:25:04,873
We take care of them...

2430
01:25:04,874 --> 01:25:06,354
- during our break. - It's delicious.

2431
01:25:07,514 --> 01:25:08,945
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

2432
01:25:09,115 --> 01:25:11,284
Do you like it? That's a relief.

2433
01:25:11,285 --> 01:25:13,025
He is a big bread lover.

2434
01:25:13,624 --> 01:25:15,944
- It isn't an ordinary financier. - He really loves bread.

2435
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:19,554
I love bread.

2436
01:25:20,065 --> 01:25:21,624
He's Bread Jun Hyuk.

2437
01:25:22,664 --> 01:25:24,594
You should visit your parents.

2438
01:25:25,495 --> 01:25:27,633
- What's this one? - That's a financier too.

2439
01:25:27,634 --> 01:25:29,804
It's just shaped differently.

2440
01:25:29,975 --> 01:25:31,604
It's great to see all of you enjoy it.

2441
01:25:31,605 --> 01:25:32,774
It's delicious.

2442
01:25:32,775 --> 01:25:34,844
I like it to be crunchy like this.

2443
01:25:35,105 --> 01:25:36,814
(The bread lover loves it.)

2444
01:25:36,815 --> 01:25:39,784
There must be a lot of regulars that you remember.

2445
01:25:39,785 --> 01:25:40,944
There are a lot.

2446
01:25:40,945 --> 01:25:43,383
There are students who became a couple...

2447
01:25:43,384 --> 01:25:44,944
after studying in Chung-Ang University.

2448
01:25:45,084 --> 01:25:48,655
One day, they came to us to give us their wedding invitation.

2449
01:25:49,084 --> 01:25:51,654
We went to their wedding to congratulate them.

2450
01:25:51,655 --> 01:25:54,293
One day, they came to us as the wife...

2451
01:25:54,294 --> 01:25:55,423
wanted our food after getting pregnant.

2452
01:25:55,424 --> 01:25:56,564
She got pregnant.

2453
01:25:56,565 --> 01:25:58,093
- After they gave birth, - They came with their child.

2454
01:25:58,094 --> 01:25:59,734
They came with their child.

2455
01:25:59,735 --> 01:26:01,633
- Really? - They came with their child.

2456
01:26:01,634 --> 01:26:03,003
- Right. - That's so touching.

2457
01:26:03,004 --> 01:26:04,873
- So... - We feel so grateful.

2458
01:26:04,874 --> 01:26:07,374
We feel so grateful about those things.

2459
01:26:07,704 --> 01:26:10,874
A student who suffered from an illness...

2460
01:26:11,544 --> 01:26:13,583
came to send us a letter of gratitude.

2461
01:26:13,584 --> 01:26:15,985
- That really made me tear up. - Right.

2462
01:26:16,355 --> 01:26:19,413
As he was talking,

2463
01:26:19,414 --> 01:26:21,553
- he cleaned up the crumbs. - He cleaned them up.

2464
01:26:21,554 --> 01:26:22,884
Right.

2465
01:26:25,495 --> 01:26:26,694
- Don't make a mess. - Right.

2466
01:26:26,695 --> 01:26:27,724
(Cleaning up in a hurry)

2467
01:26:27,725 --> 01:26:29,324
- Don't make a mess, Jun Hyuk. - Right.

2468
01:26:29,325 --> 01:26:31,593
Let's not make a mess.

2469
01:26:31,594 --> 01:26:32,663
(He cleans it up with his mouth.)

2470
01:26:32,664 --> 01:26:34,235
Are you here to eat?

2471
01:26:35,704 --> 01:26:37,105
It's just so good.

2472
01:26:37,535 --> 01:26:39,803
- Gosh. - If he didn't eat...

2473
01:26:39,804 --> 01:26:41,504
Please help yourself.

2474
01:26:41,575 --> 01:26:43,214
Jun Hyuk loves eating bread.

2475
01:26:43,445 --> 01:26:46,014
(Proud)

2476
01:26:46,044 --> 01:26:47,764
Where did the 2 of you 1st meet each other?

2477
01:26:48,185 --> 01:26:50,184
It's not around anymore,

2478
01:26:50,185 --> 01:26:51,185
but there was a famous cafe in Jongno 3-ga...
called Time Coffee Shop.

2479
01:26:53,054 --> 01:26:54,753
- Time Coffee Shop. - Right.

2480
01:26:54,754 --> 01:26:55,884
It was an old place.

2481
01:26:56,554 --> 01:26:58,194
Time sure is gold.

2482
01:26:58,195 --> 01:27:00,093
I waited for 30 minutes alone,

2483
01:27:00,094 --> 01:27:03,235
but the matchmaker didn't come, as well as the one who was introduced.

2484
01:27:03,435 --> 01:27:06,164
I thought to myself, "This won't work. Let's leave."

2485
01:27:06,464 --> 01:27:09,663
As I had lingering feelings,

2486
01:27:09,664 --> 01:27:11,605
I stood outside with my hand on a tree.

2487
01:27:11,775 --> 01:27:13,245
"Should I leave or not?"

2488
01:27:13,905 --> 01:27:16,514
You were thinking about whether to leave or not.

2489
01:27:16,575 --> 01:27:18,373
- You two met as you didn't leave. - Right.

2490
01:27:18,374 --> 01:27:20,485
- That's how things ended up. - That's so cute.

2491
01:27:21,214 --> 01:27:22,584
That sounds so romantic.

2492
01:27:22,914 --> 01:27:24,454
There were no text messages back then.

2493
01:27:24,785 --> 01:27:27,185
I think we clicked from the start.

2494
01:27:27,384 --> 01:27:28,724
The matchmaker wasn't there.

2495
01:27:28,725 --> 01:27:30,753
When we were talking,

2496
01:27:30,754 --> 01:27:32,923
I was the one who did the talking,

2497
01:27:32,924 --> 01:27:35,224
and he was a good listener.

2498
01:27:35,225 --> 01:27:37,394
I think things worked out for us in that way.

2499
01:27:37,395 --> 01:27:39,133
- It worked out. - Right.

2500
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:40,435
You two are a great match.

2501
01:27:40,535 --> 01:27:42,663
That is what led them...

2502
01:27:42,664 --> 01:27:44,474
to run this place for 15 years.

2503
01:27:44,475 --> 01:27:46,334
Even though they are married,

2504
01:27:46,504 --> 01:27:48,543
it's hard to be in one place together,

2505
01:27:48,544 --> 01:27:51,713
getting to work and getting off work.

2506
01:27:51,714 --> 01:27:54,184
- We're stuck together all day. - Right.

2507
01:27:54,185 --> 01:27:55,883
How is it being with him 24 hours a day?

2508
01:27:55,884 --> 01:27:58,184
- I like it. - Really?

2509
01:27:58,185 --> 01:27:59,453
- She said she likes it. - Right.

2510
01:27:59,454 --> 01:28:00,654
I'm delighted.

2511
01:28:00,655 --> 01:28:02,225
Oh, gosh!

2512
01:28:02,855 --> 01:28:03,855
Gosh.

2513
01:28:03,856 --> 01:28:05,053
I'm delighted.

2514
01:28:05,054 --> 01:28:06,394
Oh, gosh!

2515
01:28:06,395 --> 01:28:08,024
(You're unbelievable!)

2516
01:28:08,025 --> 01:28:09,964
Oh, gosh!

2517
01:28:10,435 --> 01:28:11,793
He's so romantic.

2518
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:14,365
Everyone is going wild.

2519
01:28:15,264 --> 01:28:17,104
(Everyone is touched.)

2520
01:28:17,105 --> 01:28:21,744
Recently, on a TV show, I saw Son Tae Jin singing a song...

2521
01:28:21,745 --> 01:28:23,815
- called "Pretend to Die." So, - A song.

2522
01:28:24,014 --> 01:28:26,115
- I listened to the lyrics, - The lyrics.

2523
01:28:26,374 --> 01:28:30,285
And they were so amazing. It said, "I only have eyes for you."

2524
01:28:30,514 --> 01:28:33,354
- The romantic of Heukseok-dong. - Yes.

2525
01:28:33,355 --> 01:28:34,553
(The birth of Heukseok-dong's romantic)

2526
01:28:34,554 --> 01:28:36,284
A romantic has been born.

2527
01:28:36,285 --> 01:28:38,123
- Seriously. - It's so romantic.

2528
01:28:38,124 --> 01:28:39,494
Seriously.

2529
01:28:39,495 --> 01:28:41,495
- Jun Hyuk feels warm inside. - Yes.

2530
01:28:41,695 --> 01:28:43,565
- I'm impressed. - Aren't you going to cry?

2531
01:28:44,664 --> 01:28:47,304
- I'm jealous. - How impressive.

2532
01:28:47,565 --> 01:28:49,364
The daughter of Heukseok, Dongjak.

2533
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:52,435
And the two romantics of Heukseok, Dongjak.

2534
01:28:52,735 --> 01:28:54,804
It's fun to talk to you guys.

2535
01:28:55,145 --> 01:28:57,944
How did you end up applying...

2536
01:28:57,945 --> 01:28:59,844
- for Whenever Possible? - Right.

2537
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:04,013
After COVID, the students changed a lot.

2538
01:29:04,014 --> 01:29:05,214
- In what way? - So...

2539
01:29:05,285 --> 01:29:07,284
After COVID,

2540
01:29:07,285 --> 01:29:09,953
students don't go out, don't eat, and eat delivery food.

2541
01:29:09,954 --> 01:29:13,593
There's a rush at lunch, but otherwise, students don't come.

2542
01:29:13,594 --> 01:29:16,263
- I see. - And a quick rush at dinnertime.

2543
01:29:16,264 --> 01:29:18,394
I thought it'd be nice for someone to come...

2544
01:29:18,395 --> 01:29:21,564
during our spare time and shine our restaurant.

2545
01:29:21,565 --> 01:29:22,881
(She applied to spend their spare time together.)

2546
01:29:22,905 --> 01:29:24,534
I hope we can do well in the game...

2547
01:29:24,535 --> 01:29:26,274
- and get you lots of prizes. - That sounds nice.

2548
01:29:26,275 --> 01:29:28,245
- I really hope we can. - So right now, we're...

2549
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,114
- Please pick one from here. - Go ahead and pick.

2550
01:29:32,115 --> 01:29:33,635
- Do I pull it out? - You can open it.

2551
01:29:33,844 --> 01:29:36,185
- Oh, my. - Oh, like this?

2552
01:29:36,445 --> 01:29:38,060
- Please read it for us. - What does it say?

2553
01:29:38,084 --> 01:29:39,285
One moment.

2554
01:29:39,414 --> 01:29:40,753
You don't have to read it in secret.

2555
01:29:40,754 --> 01:29:42,583
I can't really see it because my eyes are getting bad.

2556
01:29:42,584 --> 01:29:44,124
That can happen.

2557
01:29:44,424 --> 01:29:46,494
- Can you read it for us? - I'll take a look.

2558
01:29:46,495 --> 01:29:47,495
Okay.

2559
01:29:48,294 --> 01:29:49,995
- Neither of us can see it. - Jun Hyuk...

2560
01:29:50,294 --> 01:29:51,640
- Neither of us can see it. - Jun Hyuk...

2561
01:29:51,664 --> 01:29:52,694
(The helper has failed...)

2562
01:29:52,695 --> 01:29:54,064
- Neither of us can see it. - Next time, we will...

2563
01:29:54,065 --> 01:29:56,874
"It's good to make your own snacks."

2564
01:29:57,035 --> 01:29:58,404
"A Hurom juicer!"

2565
01:29:58,405 --> 01:30:00,475
(The prize for Round 1 is a Hurom juicer.)

2566
01:30:00,704 --> 01:30:03,445
- Oh, my! - Oh, my.

2567
01:30:03,615 --> 01:30:05,115
- Oh, my. - You're giving this to us?

2568
01:30:05,174 --> 01:30:07,944
- So we have to succeed... - We have to succeed.

2569
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:09,684
- Oh, not yet? - No, not yet.

2570
01:30:09,685 --> 01:30:12,184
- Oh, not yet? - It's so cruel to put it out...

2571
01:30:12,185 --> 01:30:13,325
right in front of them.

2572
01:30:13,355 --> 01:30:15,854
Oh, no. What should we do? What if we don't win this?

2573
01:30:15,855 --> 01:30:17,894
- So we have to do well. - We have to do well.

2574
01:30:17,895 --> 01:30:19,394
- So today... - But today,

2575
01:30:19,395 --> 01:30:21,824
Ji Min and Jun Hyuk have been doing well.

2576
01:30:21,825 --> 01:30:23,665
- Oh, I see. - You can expect them to do well.

2577
01:30:23,834 --> 01:30:24,964
- Yes. - We'll trust you.

2578
01:30:25,964 --> 01:30:27,064
- So, what's the game? - Are you getting nervous again?

2579
01:30:27,065 --> 01:30:28,934
(Will they get to taste success again?)

2580
01:30:28,935 --> 01:30:30,604
(The second mission of the new year to win a juicer)

2581
01:30:30,605 --> 01:30:32,974
(Blow Blow Coupon)

2582
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:34,944
(Blow the coupon with your mouth.)

2583
01:30:34,945 --> 01:30:37,975
(If it gets caught on the edge of the table, you succeed.)

2584
01:30:38,014 --> 01:30:42,485
(Round 1:1 of the 4 must succeed.)

2585
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:44,253
- Oh, gosh. This is... - Just 1 of us 4?

2586
01:30:44,254 --> 01:30:46,013
You're saying it needs to get caught on the edge.

2587
01:30:46,014 --> 01:30:47,623
- No way. - Is that possible?

2588
01:30:47,624 --> 01:30:49,855
- You tried playing this, right? - Oh, gosh.

2589
01:30:50,054 --> 01:30:51,793
- Who made this? - Who made this?

2590
01:30:51,794 --> 01:30:53,525
- This is... - You're so mean.

2591
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:56,025
- Is it not good from here? - Is it a bit sticky here?

2592
01:30:56,264 --> 01:30:58,594
These are coupons you use here, right?

2593
01:30:58,935 --> 01:31:00,004
They are.

2594
01:31:00,804 --> 01:31:03,203
(First, let's practice!)

2595
01:31:03,204 --> 01:31:04,204
This is too...

2596
01:31:04,304 --> 01:31:05,535
This is too...

2597
01:31:06,105 --> 01:31:08,475
- Did any of you succeed? - Yes.

2598
01:31:10,514 --> 01:31:11,673
So this is...

2599
01:31:11,674 --> 01:31:12,944
(If it falls like this, you fail.)

2600
01:31:12,945 --> 01:31:14,144
- Oh, goodness. - On the edge...

2601
01:31:14,145 --> 01:31:15,445
Water... Oh, with a tissue.

2602
01:31:15,745 --> 01:31:17,814
I wiped it, but it's still like that.

2603
01:31:17,815 --> 01:31:19,014
Let's wipe one more time.

2604
01:31:20,384 --> 01:31:21,524
I don't think this will work.

2605
01:31:21,525 --> 01:31:23,224
Oh, this is hard.

2606
01:31:23,225 --> 01:31:24,905
(Controlling the power at the end is key.)

2607
01:31:25,325 --> 01:31:26,794
Hold on. So at the end...

2608
01:31:28,664 --> 01:31:29,994
(Even if it's a bit too strong, the coupon falls off.)

2609
01:31:29,995 --> 01:31:30,995
Oh, this is hard.

2610
01:31:35,664 --> 01:31:38,105
(The coupon just won't get caught on the edge.)

2611
01:31:38,535 --> 01:31:39,734
Do you play pool?

2612
01:31:39,735 --> 01:31:40,803
Pool? Yes.

2613
01:31:40,804 --> 01:31:42,644
But you're not good at controlling your power.

2614
01:31:43,475 --> 01:31:46,714
You suddenly disrespected him...

2615
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,044
I mean, I'm not really good...

2616
01:31:49,145 --> 01:31:50,383
Are you giving up on Yeon Seok?

2617
01:31:50,384 --> 01:31:52,383
(I was just curious.)

2618
01:31:52,384 --> 01:31:54,184
But I have one good shot in me.

2619
01:31:54,185 --> 01:31:55,623
- Give it a go, Ji Min. - Me?

2620
01:31:55,624 --> 01:31:57,053
Don't feel too much pressure and just try it.

2621
01:31:57,054 --> 01:31:58,695
We can't let this turn to the side.

2622
01:31:58,954 --> 01:32:00,024
You're right.

2623
01:32:00,025 --> 01:32:01,025
Oh, no.

2624
01:32:01,565 --> 01:32:03,164
(Getting off-course)

2625
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:04,763
I'm bad at pool.

2626
01:32:04,764 --> 01:32:06,134
(Voluntarily confessing)

2627
01:32:08,834 --> 01:32:09,864
There we go.

2628
01:32:09,865 --> 01:32:12,146
- You need to be precise. - You need to be precise there.

2629
01:32:13,304 --> 01:32:14,604
Oh, gosh. This is...

2630
01:32:14,605 --> 01:32:15,843
(It's not easy to get the right power.)

2631
01:32:15,844 --> 01:32:17,114
This isn't easy.

2632
01:32:17,115 --> 01:32:19,044
- Seriously. - How did they make this game?

2633
01:32:20,245 --> 01:32:22,043
There we go. Don't blow it too hard at the end.

2634
01:32:22,044 --> 01:32:23,614
I don't think this spot is good.

2635
01:32:23,615 --> 01:32:24,985
The border really doesn't work.

2636
01:32:26,014 --> 01:32:27,484
- Oh, my. - I did it, right?

2637
01:32:27,485 --> 01:32:28,525
Yes.

2638
01:32:29,424 --> 01:32:30,994
- Oh, my. - I did it, right?

2639
01:32:30,995 --> 01:32:33,924
Yes. But it needs to stay there until the designated time.

2640
01:32:34,264 --> 01:32:35,764
You're feeling good today.

2641
01:32:36,124 --> 01:32:37,395
Oh, my. It's possible.

2642
01:32:37,495 --> 01:32:39,093
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

2643
01:32:39,094 --> 01:32:40,164
Oh, my.

2644
01:32:42,204 --> 01:32:43,264
Why are you so good?

2645
01:32:43,804 --> 01:32:44,804
Oh, my.

2646
01:32:44,975 --> 01:32:46,503
- It's possible. - Nice.

2647
01:32:46,504 --> 01:32:47,673
Let's go.

2648
01:32:47,674 --> 01:32:50,174
We'll begin our first try.

2649
01:32:50,374 --> 01:32:52,020
- I'm getting nervous again. - Let's do it together.

2650
01:32:52,044 --> 01:32:53,544
- Okay. - Please do well.

2651
01:32:53,685 --> 01:32:55,884
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2652
01:32:56,315 --> 01:32:57,985
- Here I go. - Get ready.

2653
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:01,025
Set.

2654
01:33:03,855 --> 01:33:05,954
(Going forward without hesitation)

2655
01:33:09,225 --> 01:33:10,435
Nice.

2656
01:33:11,735 --> 01:33:12,793
I think it'll work.

2657
01:33:12,794 --> 01:33:15,503
(If it gets caught on the edge, they succeed!)

2658
01:33:15,504 --> 01:33:16,565
I think it'll work.

2659
01:33:17,634 --> 01:33:19,235
It worked.

2660
01:33:19,804 --> 01:33:20,904
I think it'll work.

2661
01:33:20,905 --> 01:33:23,373
(It got caught on the edge?)

2662
01:33:23,374 --> 01:33:27,013
(Hanging on for 3, 2, 1 seconds)

2663
01:33:27,014 --> 01:33:28,383
- Success. - Yes!

2664
01:33:28,384 --> 01:33:31,114
(They passed Round 1.)

2665
01:33:31,115 --> 01:33:32,214
- Success. - Yes!

2666
01:33:32,485 --> 01:33:33,485
What was that?

2667
01:33:33,486 --> 01:33:35,725
(They succeeded in one go!)

2668
01:33:38,424 --> 01:33:39,454
It worked.

2669
01:33:39,954 --> 01:33:41,025
It worked.

2670
01:33:42,094 --> 01:33:43,734
- How did that happen? - How is that possible?

2671
01:33:43,735 --> 01:33:45,293
(This racehorse keeps running down his lane.)

2672
01:33:45,294 --> 01:33:47,534
(He actually succeeded.)

2673
01:33:47,535 --> 01:33:49,133
- Hey. - So impressive.

2674
01:33:49,134 --> 01:33:51,004
- Round One was a success! - A success!

2675
01:33:51,674 --> 01:33:53,504
Oh, we just had to do it once? I see.

2676
01:33:53,745 --> 01:33:55,244
- That was insane. - Oh, I was so nervous.

2677
01:33:55,245 --> 01:33:56,604
We have to do Round Two.

2678
01:33:56,605 --> 01:33:58,414
- You can stop here. - Okay.

2679
01:33:58,615 --> 01:34:00,145
But with the bonus coupon,

2680
01:34:00,745 --> 01:34:02,445
we have 11 tries left.

2681
01:34:02,685 --> 01:34:04,560
Since we haven't used the coupons, we have 11 tries left.

2682
01:34:04,584 --> 01:34:06,714
Would you like to go or stop? In 1, 2, 3.

2683
01:34:06,825 --> 01:34:07,854
- Go! - Go!

2684
01:34:07,855 --> 01:34:09,923
We have to keep going now.

2685
01:34:09,924 --> 01:34:11,053
- We have to. - Right.

2686
01:34:11,054 --> 01:34:13,923
Are you aware that you won't get that prize if we fail here?

2687
01:34:13,924 --> 01:34:14,924
- We know. - Yes.

2688
01:34:14,925 --> 01:34:15,995
We'll do well.

2689
01:34:16,424 --> 01:34:18,034
- Nice. - Oh, gosh.

2690
01:34:18,035 --> 01:34:19,365
Please pick the second one.

2691
01:34:19,794 --> 01:34:21,104
(What is the prize for Round 2?)

2692
01:34:21,105 --> 01:34:22,834
The letters are a bit bigger this time.

2693
01:34:24,105 --> 01:34:27,775
"The market is our favorite place for a date."

2694
01:34:27,975 --> 01:34:30,104
"A 500-dollar gift certificate."

2695
01:34:30,105 --> 01:34:31,644
(A 500-dollar gift certificate for a traditional market)

2696
01:34:31,645 --> 01:34:33,114
- This is nice. - Oh, my.

2697
01:34:33,115 --> 01:34:34,814
A gift certificate you can use like cash.

2698
01:34:34,815 --> 01:34:36,083
- Worth 500 dollars. - Oh, my.

2699
01:34:36,084 --> 01:34:38,514
- Oh, my. Fifty of these. - Let's go!

2700
01:34:38,985 --> 01:34:40,145
- Let's go! - She's so happy.

2701
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:41,684
- She's so cute. - She's so happy.

2702
01:34:41,685 --> 01:34:42,854
She's so touched.

2703
01:34:42,855 --> 01:34:44,225
We really need to do well.

2704
01:34:44,794 --> 01:34:46,294
Oh, my. Fifty gift certificates.

2705
01:34:46,525 --> 01:34:48,664
- Oh, my. - Why did you take them out?

2706
01:34:49,725 --> 01:34:51,064
(Round 2)

2707
01:34:51,065 --> 01:34:53,734
(Get 2 coupons caught on the edge.)

2708
01:34:53,735 --> 01:34:56,065
(However, you only have 30 seconds.)

2709
01:34:57,035 --> 01:34:58,235
In 30 seconds?

2710
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:01,275
- The first one needs to hang well. - Right.

2711
01:35:01,405 --> 01:35:03,203
- About seven seconds per person. - This is a bit...

2712
01:35:03,204 --> 01:35:04,474
(Each person gets about 7 seconds.)

2713
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:06,474
- At the end, you need to push it... - From here...

2714
01:35:06,475 --> 01:35:07,815
ever so slightly.

2715
01:35:08,115 --> 01:35:10,214
Ever so slightly from here.

2716
01:35:12,285 --> 01:35:14,053
(Slightly...)

2717
01:35:14,054 --> 01:35:15,054
There we go.

2718
01:35:15,355 --> 01:35:16,854
- You got it. - You get what I'm saying, right?

2719
01:35:16,855 --> 01:35:18,524
- You got it. - Okay.

2720
01:35:18,525 --> 01:35:21,264
- Round 2. Our 2nd try. - Yes.

2721
01:35:21,365 --> 01:35:22,824
Let's start with Yeon Seok.

2722
01:35:22,825 --> 01:35:24,093
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2723
01:35:24,094 --> 01:35:25,435
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2724
01:35:25,495 --> 01:35:26,495
- Let's go. - Ready.

2725
01:35:26,794 --> 01:35:27,834
Let's go.

2726
01:35:29,304 --> 01:35:31,303
(They have 30 seconds!)

2727
01:35:31,304 --> 01:35:33,235
Ready. Set.

2728
01:35:36,475 --> 01:35:37,544
We have 30 seconds, right?

2729
01:35:39,374 --> 01:35:40,414
The two of us?

2730
01:35:42,115 --> 01:35:43,314
- Hey, Ji Min. - Hurry.

2731
01:35:43,315 --> 01:35:44,513
(Quickly moving to the next player)

2732
01:35:44,514 --> 01:35:45,884
- Oh, gosh. - It's hard.

2733
01:35:46,454 --> 01:35:49,325
(Quickly moving forward)

2734
01:35:49,624 --> 01:35:51,695
Slowly.

2735
01:35:53,924 --> 01:35:56,395
(It got caught!)

2736
01:35:57,065 --> 01:35:58,534
You did it. Ji Min.

2737
01:35:58,535 --> 01:35:59,895
Next.

2738
01:36:00,865 --> 01:36:02,034
You did it. Ji Min.

2739
01:36:02,035 --> 01:36:05,604
(Carefully moving to the next player)

2740
01:36:05,605 --> 01:36:07,244
- Be careful. - How many seconds do we have?

2741
01:36:07,245 --> 01:36:09,085
(If Jun Hyuk's gets caught too, they succeed.)

2742
01:36:09,405 --> 01:36:11,514
- Five, four, - Oh, no.

2743
01:36:11,544 --> 01:36:14,384
- You have to get this. - three...

2744
01:36:15,115 --> 01:36:16,615
- You have to get this. - Three...

2745
01:36:16,844 --> 01:36:18,914
(He blew on it!)

2746
01:36:19,855 --> 01:36:20,855
- Two... - Oh, no!

2747
01:36:20,856 --> 01:36:22,054
(Jun Hyuk failed.)

2748
01:36:22,384 --> 01:36:24,194
That was such a short time.

2749
01:36:24,195 --> 01:36:25,394
- Don't blow too hard. - Two...

2750
01:36:25,395 --> 01:36:26,623
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

2751
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:28,963
(They ran out of time before they got to Jae Suk.)

2752
01:36:28,964 --> 01:36:30,894
(He didn't even get to try.)

2753
01:36:30,895 --> 01:36:31,895
This is hard.

2754
01:36:31,896 --> 01:36:32,963
(Disappointed)

2755
01:36:32,964 --> 01:36:34,234
Oh, gosh.

2756
01:36:34,235 --> 01:36:35,764
(But Ji Min did it!)

2757
01:36:36,065 --> 01:36:38,333
- Can I be a regular on the show? - Seriously.

2758
01:36:38,334 --> 01:36:39,734
- Seriously. - A regular...

2759
01:36:39,735 --> 01:36:41,703
- You're good. - Seriously.

2760
01:36:41,704 --> 01:36:43,650
- I'll do it. - Then Ji Min, you should go first.

2761
01:36:43,674 --> 01:36:46,275
You 2 should go 1st and 2nd.

2762
01:36:46,344 --> 01:36:47,644
Jun Hyuk will go, and then I'll go second.

2763
01:36:47,645 --> 01:36:48,884
I want to go last.

2764
01:36:49,615 --> 01:36:51,490
- Come here, Yeon Seok. - I don't think this is my game.

2765
01:36:51,514 --> 01:36:53,315
- It's so short. - Okay.

2766
01:36:53,855 --> 01:36:56,623
- Let's start over here. - This is our third try.

2767
01:36:56,624 --> 01:36:58,953
Since this is Round Two, we have many tries left.

2768
01:36:58,954 --> 01:37:01,395
Okay. Let's do a cheer.

2769
01:37:01,695 --> 01:37:04,035
Ready. Set.

2770
01:37:05,134 --> 01:37:06,234
(Daughter of Heukseok is the 1st runner up.)

2771
01:37:06,235 --> 01:37:07,334
I'm so nervous.

2772
01:37:08,535 --> 01:37:09,535
Set.

2773
01:37:09,605 --> 01:37:10,605
I'm so nervous.

2774
01:37:13,204 --> 01:37:14,245
Nice.

2775
01:37:15,405 --> 01:37:16,405
Nice.

2776
01:37:16,975 --> 01:37:18,775
Nice. That's nice.

2777
01:37:19,645 --> 01:37:21,043
(The next runner is ready to go too.)

2778
01:37:21,044 --> 01:37:22,804
Oh, right. I can't put my hand on the table.

2779
01:37:24,414 --> 01:37:26,514
(Ji Min failed.)

2780
01:37:27,124 --> 01:37:29,253
(The ace they were relying on failed.)

2781
01:37:29,254 --> 01:37:30,424
- I'm sorry. - Oh, gosh.

2782
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:34,725
(The next runner starts without any delay.)

2783
01:37:36,495 --> 01:37:38,565
- I'm sorry. - Oh, gosh.

2784
01:37:42,865 --> 01:37:43,874
Please.

2785
01:37:44,275 --> 01:37:46,034
(Success)

2786
01:37:46,035 --> 01:37:48,575
(And all there is left to do...)

2787
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:51,615
(is for Jae Suk to succeed.)

2788
01:37:51,874 --> 01:37:53,884
Hurry.

2789
01:37:54,185 --> 01:37:55,514
How many seconds do we have?

2790
01:37:56,645 --> 01:37:58,355
- How many seconds do we have? - Please.

2791
01:38:00,655 --> 01:38:02,384
- Five, four... - Be gentle.

2792
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:09,264
(Fail)

2793
01:38:10,895 --> 01:38:11,935
Oh, goodness.

2794
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:15,905
- Hurry. - Two, one.

2795
01:38:16,735 --> 01:38:18,374
(Their 30 seconds are over!)

2796
01:38:18,804 --> 01:38:19,834
One.

2797
01:38:26,075 --> 01:38:28,843
I didn't have the time to do this.

2798
01:38:28,844 --> 01:38:30,184
(The unexpected obstacle is the time limit.)

2799
01:38:30,185 --> 01:38:32,284
- It's such a short time. - It's too short for four people.

2800
01:38:32,285 --> 01:38:34,624
- It's too short. - Let's...

2801
01:38:35,025 --> 01:38:37,425
We have to basically assume that the fourth person won't go.

2802
01:38:37,695 --> 01:38:39,824
This is Round 2, the 4th try. Let's do a cheer.

2803
01:38:39,825 --> 01:38:40,994
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2804
01:38:40,995 --> 01:38:42,224
In 1, 2, 3.

2805
01:38:42,225 --> 01:38:43,225
Here we go.

2806
01:38:43,226 --> 01:38:44,264
Ready.

2807
01:38:44,495 --> 01:38:46,065
- It's possible. - It is.

2808
01:38:46,594 --> 01:38:48,464
Ready. Set.

2809
01:38:50,775 --> 01:38:52,004
He's bold.

2810
01:38:53,075 --> 01:38:54,304
He's bold.

2811
01:38:54,775 --> 01:38:55,844
He's bold.

2812
01:38:56,105 --> 01:38:57,115
Be gentle.

2813
01:38:59,645 --> 01:39:01,785
(Jun Hyuk succeeded.)

2814
01:39:02,084 --> 01:39:03,985
(We have another chance!)

2815
01:39:05,754 --> 01:39:08,434
(Because he succeeded in 5 seconds, they also have plenty of time.)

2816
01:39:08,655 --> 01:39:09,785
Oh, gosh.

2817
01:39:10,325 --> 01:39:11,325
I'm so nervous.

2818
01:39:11,825 --> 01:39:14,365
(If Ji Min succeeds, they pass Round 2 right away.)

2819
01:39:31,145 --> 01:39:33,445
(Even Ji Min succeeded!)

2820
01:39:35,615 --> 01:39:40,355
(They passed Round 2!)

2821
01:39:43,584 --> 01:39:44,655
What was that?

2822
01:39:45,454 --> 01:39:46,524
We did it!

2823
01:39:46,525 --> 01:39:47,663
(Jun Hyuk and Ji Min succeeded perfectly.)

2824
01:39:47,664 --> 01:39:48,664
I did it!

2825
01:39:49,424 --> 01:39:51,634
- Hey, what was that? - Good job!

2826
01:39:51,834 --> 01:39:53,163
(Good job, my baby.)

2827
01:39:53,164 --> 01:39:54,734
- Good job. - These two...

2828
01:39:54,735 --> 01:39:56,003
Thank you!

2829
01:39:56,004 --> 01:39:57,474
These two are card sharks.

2830
01:39:57,475 --> 01:40:00,034
- They're card sharks. - Oh, my.

2831
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:02,075
They're not just kind of good at games.

2832
01:40:02,275 --> 01:40:04,213
- That was crazy. - They're card sharks.

2833
01:40:04,214 --> 01:40:05,951
(They enjoyed the taste of success once again.)

2834
01:40:05,975 --> 01:40:07,714
You two are real card sharks.

2835
01:40:08,384 --> 01:40:10,485
They're the card sharks of Heukseok-dong.

2836
01:40:12,485 --> 01:40:14,685
- The two card sharks. - Seriously.

2837
01:40:14,954 --> 01:40:16,684
- Oh, my. - How did we do that?

2838
01:40:16,685 --> 01:40:18,623
- Okay. Round Two is a success! - A success!

2839
01:40:18,624 --> 01:40:20,824
(They passed Round 2!)

2840
01:40:20,825 --> 01:40:22,564
- Thank you. - Have you ever passed...

2841
01:40:22,565 --> 01:40:23,671
- Round Three in both games? - Wait on. This is...

2842
01:40:23,695 --> 01:40:25,633
- Have you not? - This is...

2843
01:40:25,634 --> 01:40:27,764
If we... So for the number of tries...

2844
01:40:28,035 --> 01:40:30,804
We have 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10...

2845
01:40:30,905 --> 01:40:33,775
- And we have 2 bonus coupons. - We have 2 bonus coupons.

2846
01:40:34,145 --> 01:40:37,244
Please discuss and decide whether to go or stop.

2847
01:40:37,245 --> 01:40:40,445
I'm actually satisfied that I got to see you four.

2848
01:40:40,914 --> 01:40:44,414
- So we should keep going. - Right.

2849
01:40:44,655 --> 01:40:46,053
- So we should keep going. - Then...

2850
01:40:46,054 --> 01:40:47,923
- shouldn't you stop? - No.

2851
01:40:47,924 --> 01:40:49,754
(Doubting their ears)

2852
01:40:50,285 --> 01:40:52,024
- We should keep going. - Really?

2853
01:40:52,025 --> 01:40:54,025
Don't you want to live a stable life?

2854
01:40:54,495 --> 01:40:55,623
Weren't you that type?

2855
01:40:55,624 --> 01:40:58,264
We've had a stable life until now, so let's take a risk.

2856
01:40:59,395 --> 01:41:00,565
That's cool.

2857
01:41:00,764 --> 01:41:02,333
Go or stop? In 1, 2, 3.

2858
01:41:02,334 --> 01:41:03,365
- Go! - Go!

2859
01:41:04,075 --> 01:41:05,404
It won't be all four of us, right?

2860
01:41:05,405 --> 01:41:06,434
- I'm sure. - Three of us.

2861
01:41:06,435 --> 01:41:08,344
First, let's pick the prize.

2862
01:41:08,645 --> 01:41:10,274
- Let's do it together. It's so big. - Go ahead.

2863
01:41:10,275 --> 01:41:12,575
- Take this side. In 1, 2, 3. - You're so cute.

2864
01:41:13,044 --> 01:41:14,485
- Here it is. - Let's see.

2865
01:41:16,615 --> 01:41:17,615
Oh, my.

2866
01:41:17,815 --> 01:41:19,685
Oh, she likes it so much.

2867
01:41:20,084 --> 01:41:21,724
(Feeling so much pressure)

2868
01:41:21,725 --> 01:41:23,730
- Oh, she likes it so much. - "We love to share food,"

2869
01:41:23,754 --> 01:41:25,623
"so we always make bread in our spare time."

2870
01:41:25,624 --> 01:41:27,864
- "A bread fermenter." - "A bread fermenter?"

2871
01:41:27,865 --> 01:41:29,694
- We have to go for this one! - Oh, this is...

2872
01:41:29,695 --> 01:41:31,534
- Look. - Oh, it's here.

2873
01:41:31,535 --> 01:41:33,593
- Oh, my! - It costs 1,400 dollars.

2874
01:41:33,594 --> 01:41:35,434
(The bread fermenter is here.)

2875
01:41:35,435 --> 01:41:36,435
Do you have to show them this?

2876
01:41:36,436 --> 01:41:38,156
- It's 1,400 dollars? - It's 1,400 dollars?

2877
01:41:38,204 --> 01:41:40,604
They wanted this so much.

2878
01:41:40,605 --> 01:41:42,475
(A 1,400-dollar bread fermenter)

2879
01:41:42,905 --> 01:41:45,775
I wasn't able to make bread because the dough wouldn't rise.

2880
01:41:46,475 --> 01:41:47,843
(She was just in need of this item.)

2881
01:41:47,844 --> 01:41:49,784
- Since it's cold these days... - Yes.

2882
01:41:49,785 --> 01:41:51,413
She's so touched right now.

2883
01:41:51,414 --> 01:41:53,383
What do we have to do? It's not four people, right?

2884
01:41:53,384 --> 01:41:54,525
What's Round Three?

2885
01:41:54,725 --> 01:41:57,253
(Round 3 is the same as Round 2.)

2886
01:41:57,254 --> 01:41:59,894
(However, the coupon gets bigger.)

2887
01:41:59,895 --> 01:42:01,565
- What? - A bigger card?

2888
01:42:01,865 --> 01:42:03,524
- What? - That's how it gets harder.

2889
01:42:03,525 --> 01:42:04,664
This is crazy.

2890
01:42:04,735 --> 01:42:06,610
- It's harder to blow this too. - It'll be hard...

2891
01:42:06,634 --> 01:42:07,964
to blow on this.

2892
01:42:08,605 --> 01:42:10,673
- This is... - And how many people?

2893
01:42:10,674 --> 01:42:12,203
- Two. - I see.

2894
01:42:12,204 --> 01:42:14,004
(They went from coupons to New Year's cards.)

2895
01:42:14,945 --> 01:42:16,405
- This... - Oh, gosh.

2896
01:42:16,504 --> 01:42:18,815
- Hold on. This is too... - We're in big trouble.

2897
01:42:19,514 --> 01:42:20,883
Is it bad to fold it too much?

2898
01:42:20,884 --> 01:42:23,214
- We shouldn't fold it too much. - Right? I think so.

2899
01:42:23,815 --> 01:42:24,854
This is...

2900
01:42:24,855 --> 01:42:26,154
(If the angle is too narrow, the card falls over easily.)

2901
01:42:26,155 --> 01:42:28,195
I think where on the card we blow is important too.

2902
01:42:28,855 --> 01:42:31,753
Since we have the card shark of Heukseok-dong here...

2903
01:42:31,754 --> 01:42:33,123
- Of course. - Yes.

2904
01:42:33,124 --> 01:42:34,865
- Oh, I'm in big trouble. - We can do it.

2905
01:42:36,794 --> 01:42:39,333
- I can't even make it move. - It won't move.

2906
01:42:39,334 --> 01:42:40,614
(The card is too heavy to move.)

2907
01:42:42,664 --> 01:42:43,764
I think it'll fall over.

2908
01:42:46,975 --> 01:42:48,004
Hey.

2909
01:42:49,145 --> 01:42:51,543
(Setting the card in a wide angle and blowing horizontally...)

2910
01:42:51,544 --> 01:42:54,115
(safely guarantees success.)

2911
01:42:54,344 --> 01:42:56,114
(Why am I good at this?)

2912
01:42:56,115 --> 01:42:57,454
- Ji Min. - Seriously.

2913
01:42:58,185 --> 01:43:00,513
You're such a card shark. What's up with you?

2914
01:43:00,514 --> 01:43:01,624
Who are you?

2915
01:43:02,554 --> 01:43:04,123
- Ji Min. You... - What should I do?

2916
01:43:04,124 --> 01:43:05,354
Who am I?

2917
01:43:05,355 --> 01:43:08,094
- Ji Min, you... - I finally found my path today.

2918
01:43:08,964 --> 01:43:11,293
I'm better at this than I am at acting. Oh, my.

2919
01:43:11,294 --> 01:43:13,194
- How did you... - What should I do?

2920
01:43:13,195 --> 01:43:14,734
- Yeon Seok. You should go 1st. - Go 1st.

2921
01:43:14,735 --> 01:43:15,803
- Ji Min should go second. - Okay.

2922
01:43:15,804 --> 01:43:17,124
- Jun Hyuk can go third. - Third.

2923
01:43:17,334 --> 01:43:18,905
- Let's go! - This is Round Three now.

2924
01:43:19,174 --> 01:43:20,974
This is our second Whenever Guest...

2925
01:43:20,975 --> 01:43:23,003
- of 2025. - Do well.

2926
01:43:23,004 --> 01:43:24,513
Will we miraculously pass...

2927
01:43:24,514 --> 01:43:26,275
Round Three in both games?

2928
01:43:26,445 --> 01:43:28,184
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2929
01:43:28,185 --> 01:43:29,944
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 5.)

2930
01:43:29,945 --> 01:43:31,553
- Ready. - We have our card shark here.

2931
01:43:31,554 --> 01:43:32,883
- No, I'm not... - Don't be too nervous.

2932
01:43:32,884 --> 01:43:34,485
- Let's go. - Set.

2933
01:43:35,355 --> 01:43:36,384
Set.

2934
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:41,364
- Yeon Seok. Looking good. - A wide angle.

2935
01:43:41,365 --> 01:43:43,294
(Going forward with a wide angle)

2936
01:43:43,764 --> 01:43:45,633
(The card shark's teachings: Use a wide angle.)

2937
01:43:45,634 --> 01:43:47,735
- This is a good plan. - This is good.

2938
01:43:54,804 --> 01:43:56,803
(They succeeded as they planned!)

2939
01:43:56,804 --> 01:43:58,014
(Dumbstruck)

2940
01:43:59,514 --> 01:44:00,713
- Ji Min. - Oh, it's me.

2941
01:44:00,714 --> 01:44:02,583
(The chance has now come to Heukseok-dong's card shark.)

2942
01:44:02,584 --> 01:44:04,791
There's still a lot of time. Ji Min, you have a lot of time.

2943
01:44:04,815 --> 01:44:06,284
(There's plenty of time left!)

2944
01:44:06,285 --> 01:44:07,285
Oh, gosh.

2945
01:44:09,384 --> 01:44:10,624
Ji Min, you have a lot of time.

2946
01:44:11,754 --> 01:44:12,994
(But the card won't move.)

2947
01:44:12,995 --> 01:44:14,394
We didn't stand it up right in the beginning.

2948
01:44:14,395 --> 01:44:16,075
- Why won't it move? - I think it'll work.

2949
01:44:17,325 --> 01:44:18,395
Ten.

2950
01:44:18,794 --> 01:44:21,065
(The last blow!)

2951
01:44:27,113 --> 01:44:28,299
(They were relying on Ji Min, but she failed.)

2952
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:29,770
- I'm sorry! - It's okay.

2953
01:44:31,600 --> 01:44:33,040
- I'm sorry! - It's okay.

2954
01:44:33,041 --> 01:44:34,041
(The clock is ticking.)

2955
01:44:34,042 --> 01:44:36,941
Five, four, three...

2956
01:44:37,911 --> 01:44:40,410
(Jun Hyuk failed too.)

2957
01:44:40,411 --> 01:44:41,680
(Time over!)

2958
01:44:43,810 --> 01:44:45,550
(He got poked in the bottom.)

2959
01:44:46,281 --> 01:44:48,451
- Oh, no. Are you okay? - Are you okay?

2960
01:44:48,850 --> 01:44:50,549
- Oh, gosh. - But this...

2961
01:44:50,550 --> 01:44:52,320
- It's possible. - It is.

2962
01:44:52,321 --> 01:44:53,620
- It is. - That was nice.

2963
01:44:53,621 --> 01:44:54,860
- That was nice. - Let's go in this order once more.

2964
01:44:54,861 --> 01:44:55,990
- Okay. - Just one more time.

2965
01:44:55,991 --> 01:44:57,731
But I think...

2966
01:44:58,191 --> 01:44:59,431
this could be the first time...

2967
01:44:59,960 --> 01:45:02,259
we don't get to use our coupons.

2968
01:45:02,260 --> 01:45:03,429
- Seriously. - Seriously.

2969
01:45:03,430 --> 01:45:04,730
- I hope that really happens. - How about...

2970
01:45:04,731 --> 01:45:06,969
- Seriously. - we use one of our coupons?

2971
01:45:06,970 --> 01:45:08,500
- I see. - I see. That could be fun.

2972
01:45:08,501 --> 01:45:10,640
- Shall we? - What if we just succeed?

2973
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,540
- At least once, we should... - That'd be a good thing.

2974
01:45:14,541 --> 01:45:16,009
What are you, a spy?

2975
01:45:16,010 --> 01:45:18,150
- That's not what I meant. - Hey.

2976
01:45:18,151 --> 01:45:19,250
What are you?

2977
01:45:19,251 --> 01:45:21,650
- Do you want to try? - They can try too.

2978
01:45:21,651 --> 01:45:23,150
- Let's use a coupon, - Okay.

2979
01:45:23,151 --> 01:45:24,320
- so they can try too. - Sounds good.

2980
01:45:24,321 --> 01:45:26,089
- This is outside of our tries. - Right.

2981
01:45:26,090 --> 01:45:27,919
- Who wants to try? - The main chef will do it.

2982
01:45:27,920 --> 01:45:29,019
- The main chef. - Sounds good.

2983
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:30,959
Because she wants the bread fermenter.

2984
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:33,001
- Of course. She has to use it. - Let's go!

2985
01:45:33,201 --> 01:45:36,401
You have to take the place of one of us.

2986
01:45:36,571 --> 01:45:38,600
- Take 1 person out. - Yes, pick 1 person...

2987
01:45:38,701 --> 01:45:39,770
Wait...

2988
01:45:40,170 --> 01:45:41,401
- Why? - Why?

2989
01:45:41,701 --> 01:45:42,741
Pick one person...

2990
01:45:43,310 --> 01:45:46,809
(She doesn't have to say a word.)

2991
01:45:46,810 --> 01:45:47,941
Step out, Yeon Seok.

2992
01:45:48,510 --> 01:45:49,580
- Step out. - Got it.

2993
01:45:49,581 --> 01:45:51,179
- This is a bit suspicious. - How funny.

2994
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:53,120
I just succeeded.

2995
01:45:53,121 --> 01:45:55,219
- This is so suspicious. - You did well.

2996
01:45:55,220 --> 01:45:56,950
- Let's do a cheer. - Ma'am.

2997
01:45:56,951 --> 01:45:58,890
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

2998
01:45:59,020 --> 01:46:00,320
You can practice a bit.

2999
01:46:00,321 --> 01:46:02,160
- Give it a try. - Honey. If you blow too up high,

3000
01:46:02,161 --> 01:46:03,230
it'll fall over.

3001
01:46:03,231 --> 01:46:05,030
He's coaching her.

3002
01:46:05,031 --> 01:46:07,030
- So blow on the lower part. - He's so clever.

3003
01:46:07,031 --> 01:46:08,161
- Like this. - Okay.

3004
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:11,170
- Oh, my. It won't move. - Right?

3005
01:46:11,300 --> 01:46:13,220
You have to blow on it harder than you'd expect.

3006
01:46:14,100 --> 01:46:15,820
- Be careful. You could get dizzy. - Right.

3007
01:46:18,970 --> 01:46:20,080
Oh, gosh.

3008
01:46:20,081 --> 01:46:21,557
You have to blow on it harder than you'd expect.

3009
01:46:21,581 --> 01:46:23,679
- Oh, I'm starting to get dizzy. - Right?

3010
01:46:23,680 --> 01:46:25,309
- This is... - I think if she does it calmly,

3011
01:46:25,310 --> 01:46:26,620
- she could succeed. - I think she could.

3012
01:46:26,621 --> 01:46:28,549
- We'll use our coupon now. - Okay.

3013
01:46:28,550 --> 01:46:30,290
- Let's do a cheer. - Ma'am.

3014
01:46:30,291 --> 01:46:32,291
- In 1, 2, 3. Let's go! - In 1, 2, 3. Let's go!

3015
01:46:32,621 --> 01:46:33,690
Ready.

3016
01:46:33,691 --> 01:46:38,861
(Will she get a taste of success?)

3017
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:41,430
Ready.

3018
01:46:41,431 --> 01:46:42,559
(Bonus coupon round)

3019
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,701
Set.

3020
01:46:49,170 --> 01:46:50,640
- That's nice. - Nice.

3021
01:46:51,411 --> 01:46:52,639
- Nice. - She's so cute.

3022
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:55,281
(The card is slowly but surely going forward.)

3023
01:46:56,251 --> 01:46:58,010
- Oh, my. - Nice. This is going to work.

3024
01:46:58,210 --> 01:46:59,981
- Oh, my. - Nice. This is going to work.

3025
01:47:01,151 --> 01:47:02,220
Okay. A little bit more.

3026
01:47:02,621 --> 01:47:04,019
Nice. It's looking good.

3027
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:08,020
(It got caught!)

3028
01:47:09,291 --> 01:47:12,291
(They only need to get one more to succeed.)

3029
01:47:13,001 --> 01:47:15,830
- You got it. Slowly, Jun Hyuk. - How many seconds?

3030
01:47:15,831 --> 01:47:17,200
(But they've used a lot of time.)

3031
01:47:17,201 --> 01:47:18,500
(He needs to finish it off here.)

3032
01:47:18,501 --> 01:47:22,241
Five, four, three, two...

3033
01:47:25,001 --> 01:47:29,671
(Their success lies in Jun Hyuk hand's.)

3034
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:34,540
Five, four, three, two...

3035
01:47:34,541 --> 01:47:35,541
I think he can do it.

3036
01:47:38,341 --> 01:47:39,341
I think he can do it.

3037
01:47:40,610 --> 01:47:42,780
(They passed Round 3!)

3038
01:47:48,391 --> 01:47:50,251
(The star of their success)

3039
01:47:50,450 --> 01:47:51,620
Did we succeed?

3040
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,290
Did we pass Round Three?

3041
01:47:53,291 --> 01:47:55,260
- Come here, everyone! - Did we succeed?

3042
01:47:55,261 --> 01:47:57,661
(They passed 2 Round 3s right at the start of the new year.)

3043
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:00,900
You did so well, ma'am.

3044
01:48:01,330 --> 01:48:02,500
(The celebration of a shy boy)

3045
01:48:02,501 --> 01:48:03,869
Good job.

3046
01:48:03,870 --> 01:48:05,269
(Enjoying the taste of success all day)

3047
01:48:05,270 --> 01:48:08,110
We rarely succeeded when we used a coupon...

3048
01:48:08,471 --> 01:48:10,769
and played with a guest.

3049
01:48:10,770 --> 01:48:12,711
- Right. - Seriously. Ma'am.

3050
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:15,950
I think my wishes for 2025 have already come true.

3051
01:48:16,351 --> 01:48:18,320
She is happiest about the bread fermenter.

3052
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:20,319
From the juicer to the bread fermenter,

3053
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:21,850
we passed through Round Three.

3054
01:48:21,851 --> 01:48:23,290
(They won all presents through Round 3.)

3055
01:48:23,291 --> 01:48:25,251
- And the gift certificates too. - Oh, thank you.

3056
01:48:27,721 --> 01:48:29,561
- Thank you so much. - She's so cute.

3057
01:48:29,660 --> 01:48:30,859
Congratulations, ma'am!

3058
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:32,800
- I'm so happy that she's so happy. - Me too.

3059
01:48:32,801 --> 01:48:34,159
- I'm so happy. - Seriously.

3060
01:48:34,160 --> 01:48:36,600
It was so nice to have fun today...

3061
01:48:36,601 --> 01:48:38,899
with Ji Min, the daughter of Heukseok-dong,

3062
01:48:38,900 --> 01:48:41,810
here in Heukseok-dong, Dongjak-gu.

3063
01:48:41,811 --> 01:48:43,971
- Our card shark. - We had some good food too.

3064
01:48:44,011 --> 01:48:46,131
- Should I come back for next week? - Our card shark.

3065
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:48,109
My perfect card shark.

3066
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:50,380
(My perfect card shark)

3067
01:48:50,381 --> 01:48:52,720
Please watch "Love Scout."

3068
01:48:52,721 --> 01:48:55,020
I'm glad I debuted as an actress.

3069
01:48:56,490 --> 01:48:58,159
It's been a while since I debuted.

3070
01:48:58,160 --> 01:48:59,920
- You two did it all today. - Seriously.

3071
01:48:59,921 --> 01:49:02,041
- We had such a great start. - We didn't do anything.

3072
01:49:02,291 --> 01:49:03,931
I didn't do much today.

3073
01:49:04,391 --> 01:49:06,730
I thought I was about to do something,

3074
01:49:07,160 --> 01:49:09,270
but she told me to step out...

3075
01:49:09,671 --> 01:49:11,670
- and succeeded right away. - That's what you did.

3076
01:49:11,671 --> 01:49:13,100
- Exactly. - Stepping out at the right time.

3077
01:49:13,101 --> 01:49:14,140
- Right? - Okay.

3078
01:49:14,141 --> 01:49:16,769
- I wisely used the coupon. - Yeon Seok made a good decision.

3079
01:49:16,770 --> 01:49:19,079
- I stepped out at the right time. - It was a great decision.

3080
01:49:19,080 --> 01:49:21,479
We were thinking of buying a lottery ticket...

3081
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,819
since Jae Suk was coming.

3082
01:49:24,820 --> 01:49:26,550
- But we really won the lottery. - Yes.

3083
01:49:26,551 --> 01:49:27,950
Thank you so much.

3084
01:49:28,351 --> 01:49:29,590
- Whenever Possible, - Whenever Possible,

3085
01:49:29,591 --> 01:49:31,231
- let's be together. - let's be together.

3086
01:49:34,791 --> 01:49:36,591
(We came to a place that I like.)

3087
01:49:37,091 --> 01:49:38,691
(Whenever Possible at an amusement park)

3088
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:41,829
(Because Yeon Seok is busy filming his drama, )

3089
01:49:41,830 --> 01:49:43,529
(Yeon Seok sadly can't join us...)

3090
01:49:43,530 --> 01:49:45,239
(for this week.)

3091
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:47,541
(Yeon Seok isn't here today?)

3092
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:50,170
(To take Yeon Seok's spot, )

3093
01:49:50,171 --> 01:49:52,311
(Yeon Seok's close friend is here?)

3094
01:49:52,780 --> 01:49:54,580
(Special MC, Kim Dae Myeong)

3095
01:49:54,780 --> 01:49:55,980
(You're from Suyu-ri.)

3096
01:49:56,351 --> 01:49:58,050
(It's nice to have another friend from Suyu-ri.)

3097
01:49:58,051 --> 01:49:59,351
(You know Seil Theater!)

3098
