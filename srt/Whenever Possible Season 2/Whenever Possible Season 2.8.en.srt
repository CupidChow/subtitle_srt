1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,439
The weather report said it was warm today.

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,739
It's sunny today.

3
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:10,010
The sun feels nice.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,478
This coffee is great.

5
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,839
(A coffee shop in Seoul)

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,010
The owner here...

7
00:00:14,809 --> 00:00:16,779
Judging by the coffee,

8
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:19,220
- It's clean. - the owner is an expert.

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:21,620
How do you know the taste of coffee?

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:22,888
It has a lot of milk in it.

11
00:00:22,889 --> 00:00:23,919
(Latte with a lot of milk)

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,788
- It's flavorful and tasty. - Does that make them an expert?

13
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:26,859
Yes, an expert.

14
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,658
The abundant amount of milk makes it flavorful and tasty.

15
00:00:29,659 --> 00:00:31,358
- Is it a light latte? - Yes.

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,429
- A light latte? - I love it.

17
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,428
It's nice.

18
00:00:35,429 --> 00:00:38,700
Gosh, the Han River is sparkling.

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,240
- The view here is fantastic. - You're right.

20
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,739
Many dramas were shot here when it was a restaurant.

21
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:45,339
- Really? - Yes.

22
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:47,108
- Some look good in primary colors. - Yes.

23
00:00:47,109 --> 00:00:48,686
- But primary colors don't suit me. - What?

24
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,008
- This place is great. - They don't?

25
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,678
- No, pastel colors... - Goodness.

26
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:53,818
- Wait. They're here. - Hi.

27
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,419
(A high-pitched greeting)

28
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,550
The comedy duo.

29
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:59,688
- It's been ages. - Give me

30
00:00:59,689 --> 00:01:02,590
- A call, baby - A call, baby

31
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:03,788
Come this way.

32
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:05,329
Should we take our coats off for our pink outfit?

33
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,758
- Isn't it hot? - No.

34
00:01:06,759 --> 00:01:08,168
- But... - It's warm in here.

35
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:09,169
It's really warm in here.

36
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,770
- Isn't it hot outside? - It was cold.

37
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,398
- It's cold. Yes. - Is it?

38
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:13,739
How should we sit?

39
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,239
- Is it okay? - Please take those seats.

40
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,339
- Over there? - Yes.

41
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,779
My gosh.

42
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:20,039
It's been a while.

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,379
- What has been a while? - Being on a TV show.

44
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,380
We haven't been...

45
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:24,948
- on TV for ages. - We're only on YouTube.

46
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:25,978
Right.

47
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:28,088
- Your channel is on a roll. - All we do is YouTube.

48
00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:30,449
- I'm an avid viewer. - I know.

49
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,418
Yeon Seok and I tried to meet up several times...

50
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:33,789
- Right? - but couldn't.

51
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:35,359
Do Min Kyung and Yeon Seok know each other?

52
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,689
We've met together before.

53
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,659
We three had a meal together years ago.

54
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,999
It was ages ago, but yes.

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,028
- Really? - Yes.

56
00:01:41,029 --> 00:01:45,198
I recall having fun with Yeon Seok at someplace, but she...

57
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:47,168
She can't remember us at the karaoke.

58
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:50,068
- Yes, we went to karaoke. - But I couldn't remember it.

59
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,079
They said I was good at singing.

60
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,678
- I remember it because... - You're a singer.

61
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,349
- Yeon Seok was great at singing. - He's good at it.

62
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,409
- Yeon Seok is good at it. - Exactly.

63
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,549
- Yes. - Because he was great at it?

64
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,918
- Yeon Seok was amazing. - I...

65
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:00,818
Being acknowledged made me really happy back then.

66
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:02,149
Are you hungry, Hae RI?

67
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:04,788
- She looked at the cake first. - There are all kinds of cakes here.

68
00:02:04,789 --> 00:02:06,588
- There's an assortment. - Get some with coffee.

69
00:02:06,589 --> 00:02:08,229
- Can we order? - Yes.

70
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:11,250
- What's with all of these options? - Over here.

71
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,069
- These six. - Shall we have banana pudding?

72
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,898
You can just take one from here.

73
00:02:15,899 --> 00:02:16,899
- This cake? - Yes.

74
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,040
- Really? - No, you have to order it.

75
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,308
You have to order it.

76
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:22,968
Is that coffee?

77
00:02:22,969 --> 00:02:24,609
That one is Hae Ri's, and this one is mine.

78
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:26,209
She must drink light coffee.

79
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,549
Yes. How did you know?

80
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,009
- Can you tell? - That's how light it should be.

81
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,278
Hae Ri said...

82
00:02:30,279 --> 00:02:32,878
she wanted her coffee as light as Jae Suk's.

83
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,419
- That's the perfect lightness. - Yes.

84
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:36,348
You must be able to see through the coffee.

85
00:02:36,349 --> 00:02:37,490
- Exactly. - Right?

86
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,640
- Do you drink barley tea, Hae Ri? - Yes, barely tea.

87
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,159
- I only need the scent of coffee. - Barley tea?

88
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,329
- It's not. - It's indeed barely tea,

89
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,330
- not coffee. - But it's good.

90
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:47,028
- Isn't that espresso? - It is.

91
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:48,428
I love coffee.

92
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:49,799
- I adore it. - She drinks espresso.

93
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,539
You drink espresso, Min Kyung?

94
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
- Of course. - And it's two shots.

95
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:53,739
- It has two shots. - Min Kyung...

96
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,338
knows the taste of coffee.

97
00:02:55,339 --> 00:02:56,509
Do you drink espresso?

98
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,579
I'm a certified barista.

99
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,839
(Cheering)

100
00:03:00,339 --> 00:03:01,408
- I... - Are you certified too?

101
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:02,510
No, I just like coffee.

102
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,148
- I like coffee. - Min Kyung.

103
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:06,678
Do you drink espresso on a regular day?

104
00:03:06,679 --> 00:03:07,688
She does.

105
00:03:07,689 --> 00:03:08,718
- For real? - I don't have a certificate,

106
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:09,789
but I like coffee.

107
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,658
Why do you drink espresso?

108
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:14,289
I drink to wake up on a day like today...

109
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:15,889
when it's quite early.

110
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,128
And I must play the games well.

111
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:18,299
- Right. - That's why you drink it?

112
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,528
It's to be wide awake.

113
00:03:19,529 --> 00:03:21,998
Unfortunately, we failed last week.

114
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,098
- You failed? - We did.

115
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,539
- We'll succeed today. - Today must be different.

116
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,639
- For sure. - We need to succeed.

117
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,368
When we play games on a TV show,

118
00:03:27,369 --> 00:03:28,408
- we win everything. - It gets wild.

119
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:29,438
Really?

120
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,086
- We win every single thing. - We have the spirit.

121
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:32,809
(A little while later)

122
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:33,908
(Incorrect!)

123
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:34,980
(Why?)

124
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:36,408
- That was the answer. - No.

125
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:37,769
(The prize killer is taken aback.)

126
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,779
(What is this?)

127
00:03:40,749 --> 00:03:42,990
(The site of wailing)

128
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,719
(It will be revealed soon.)

129
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,259
- Really? Are you good at it? - We love games.

130
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:49,658
- We become sincere. - We do.

131
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:51,260
- Yes. - We'll get serious.

132
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,699
- This one. - It looks good.

133
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,128
Why are there only two forks? They have them.

134
00:03:54,129 --> 00:03:55,899
- Yes, we were digging in already. - Try it.

135
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,040
I might get a blood sugar spike.

136
00:03:58,270 --> 00:03:59,498
What's a blood sugar spike?

137
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:01,040
But you added sugar into your coffee.

138
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,769
She added a sugar cube to her coffee.

139
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,868
Blood sugar spike, my foot.

140
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:05,739
I can't take in too much sugar.

141
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,908
- Is that so? - I'll hold back.

142
00:04:06,909 --> 00:04:08,109
We'll have lunch later, right?

143
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,308
- What? Yes. - Lunch later?

144
00:04:09,309 --> 00:04:10,709
- It's delicious. - It looks good.

145
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,819
- Try it. - It looks delicious.

146
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,378
- Is the pudding good? - Yes, it's really good.

147
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,289
- We debated... - That looks good.

148
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,570
Whether to get this cake or not.

149
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,718
It's tasty.

150
00:04:17,719 --> 00:04:19,119
The moistness is on another level.

151
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,559
It doesn't look that sweet.

152
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,089
It's not overly sweet.

153
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:24,298
- But it has cream inside. - No.

154
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,299
- It's moderately sweet. - Is it?

155
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,499
- It's not that sweet. - It's not too sweet.

156
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,228
- It's delicious. - It's good. Try it.

157
00:04:28,229 --> 00:04:30,070
- It's really good. - The pudding is great.

158
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:31,738
This must be their signature cake.

159
00:04:31,739 --> 00:04:33,098
- Really? - She's got her fork up.

160
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:34,739
- For real. - Shall I have a taste?

161
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,238
- It's good. - Is it?

162
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,239
Yes.

163
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,379
(Having a bite)

164
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,479
It's not sweet. It's really not sweet.

165
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,880
But really, the pudding isn't sweet.

166
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:47,348
"It's not sweet" after talking about blood sugar spikes.

167
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:49,619
- It's not sweet, everyone. - Min Kyung.

168
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,759
- It's delicious. - There won't be a spike.

169
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,119
"Everyone?" Who are you talking to?

170
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,418
Min Kyung is good at communicating.

171
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,329
- You're right. - Because of YouTube?

172
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,259
- Because she does YouTube. - She's like a panelist.

173
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,298
She's a good communicator.

174
00:04:58,299 --> 00:05:00,129
Min Kyung started a conversation with everyone.

175
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,199
- The number of cameras... - Actually,

176
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,329
- is making me happy. - she's...

177
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,968
- I'm so happy. - a first-generation YouTuber.

178
00:05:03,969 --> 00:05:06,598
Actually, she's a first-generation YouTuber.

179
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:08,309
- Yes. - Almost...

180
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,668
- the 1st generation. - A 1st-generation YouTuber.

181
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:11,338
- Almost the first generation. - What generation are you, Jae Suk?

182
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:12,709
- You edit your videos too. - Are you second-generation?

183
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,108
Aren't I in the third generation?

184
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:15,648
He's an invasive species.

185
00:05:15,649 --> 00:05:17,379
- You're right. - I'm serious.

186
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,379
- Yes. He's a disrupter. - For real.

187
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,389
- What invasive species? - Seriously.

188
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,119
You talk for two hours,

189
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,488
- then get 5 to 6 million views. - You're an invasive species.

190
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,989
- Exactly. - Reality hits hard, Jae Suk.

191
00:05:28,229 --> 00:05:30,999
Are you here as a group to complain to me today?

192
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,329
- No. - You're fine.

193
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,759
- You're a fine competitor. - Congratulations.

194
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,269
- It's a good thing, right? - Congratulations.

195
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,329
- Right? - That's part of Jae Suk's ability.

196
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,439
- You're right. - By the way,

197
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,269
didn't you release a new song a few days ago?

198
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:41,770
- We did. - The song is titled,

199
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,639
- "Stitching." - "Stitching."

200
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,108
- Correct. - Yes.

201
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:46,179
It was so nice.

202
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,439
- Thank you. - As a matter of fact,

203
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,809
- since... - Have you listened to it?

204
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:50,478
Of course. Davichi's...

205
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,048
We're in the Top 100.

206
00:05:52,049 --> 00:05:53,619
- Already? - We got in the Top 100.

207
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,918
- That's amazing. - Right?

208
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,218
"Don't call that love."

209
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:00,158
That part was catchy.

210
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:01,358
- Nice. - Thank you.

211
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:02,889
- Just once... - Unbelievable.

212
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,090
- You scared me. - What is it?

213
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,658
(Startled)

214
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:06,830
You're in 73rd.

215
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:09,870
- They're in 73rd in Top 100. - He scared me.

216
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:12,069
- Look. - He's right.

217
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,538
Getting into the Top 100...

218
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,809
- is impossible these days. - You're right.

219
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,009
- This sure is shocking. - Isn't it?

220
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,309
The Korean titles connect.

221
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:21,148
- "Don't Say Goodbye." - "Don't Say Goodbye."

222
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:23,189
- "Don't Call That Love." - "Don't Call That Love."

223
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:25,849
Is this really you two?

224
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:27,919
Is this really you two?

225
00:06:29,149 --> 00:06:30,149
How mean of you.

226
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:32,260
- But... - That was very mean of you to say.

227
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,288
- I... - To say that right in front of us?

228
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:37,028
- Don't say that. - Jae Suk is never this mean.

229
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,528
- Don't say that. - That was really mean.

230
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:40,298
It's different from their usual vibe.

231
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:41,700
- Jae Suk. - Even so...

232
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,770
From their usual vibe...

233
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:45,039
But Hae Ri...

234
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:47,370
- What is it? - Her clothes are...

235
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,940
- It's quite bold. - This part is bold.

236
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:52,738
But it's totally different...

237
00:06:52,739 --> 00:06:53,978
It is different.

238
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,010
It's this part.

239
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,278
I love it.

240
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:03,149
("Stitching" by Davichi)

241
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,890
Just listen to them.

242
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,200
Nice.

243
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,445
This song is worth getting into the Top 100.

244
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:24,879
- Thank you. Please listen to it. - The song is catchy.

245
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,379
It'll top the charts.

246
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,949
It's not easy to sing as a duo for such a long time.

247
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:32,249
- Yes, you're totally right. - Right?

248
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,519
Singing as a duo is not easy.

249
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,588
- And there aren't any female duos. - Exactly.

250
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,549
Why not? There must be a reason.

251
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,319
- What's the reason? - What is it?

252
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,028
- Give us your opinion. - It's not easy at all.

253
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,089
- No, it's not. - Right?

254
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,798
Working together for years isn't easy.

255
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,658
- And without fighting. - Without fighting.

256
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,898
- Exactly. - There's a reason you're loved...

257
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:50,569
- for a long time. - I agree.

258
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:52,399
- We... - Who holds back more?

259
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,738
(Thinking)

260
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,509
(They can't answer right away.)

261
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,569
Someone has to hold back for there to be no fights.

262
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:58,979
- You're right. - Yes. Who...

263
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:00,909
Stop being absurd.

264
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:04,148
Hae Ri denied it right away.

265
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:06,120
I was being silent, wasn't I?

266
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,588
- But how dare you nod? - You see...

267
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,889
- It's okay. - No.

268
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:11,619
- One must hold back. - Right.

269
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,959
Someone has to be understanding.

270
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,889
- A little bit more understanding. - Yes.

271
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:15,988
- A little bit more. - Exactly.

272
00:08:15,989 --> 00:08:18,429
- Do you usually hold back, Hae Ri? - That's what I think.

273
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,059
No, I hold back more.

274
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,098
(A spear and a shield)

275
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:24,838
- Both of us are strict about it. - That's how you keep a group.

276
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,999
We don't cross the line.

277
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,139
The group has two active roles.

278
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,510
- What? - You are singers...

279
00:08:30,609 --> 00:08:31,940
- and comediennes. - Yes.

280
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,579
To think that was what you were going to say.

281
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,180
- Me too. - What are you...

282
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:36,779
- Did you two not know? - Sorry?

283
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,179
Do you not know you work as a comedy duo?

284
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,419
I don't. It's my first time hearing it.

285
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,349
We're meeting as a set of duos today.

286
00:08:42,749 --> 00:08:43,888
- We're also a comedy duo. - Are you...

287
00:08:43,889 --> 00:08:45,488
- He's right. - Yes.

288
00:08:45,489 --> 00:08:46,718
- I see. - A comedy duo.

289
00:08:46,719 --> 00:08:48,159
I'm an actor and...

290
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,029
He's also a part of our comedy duo.

291
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,598
Yeon Seok has been hilarious recently.

292
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:52,599
Right?

293
00:08:53,359 --> 00:08:55,329
He's on a roll as a comedian.

294
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,669
- He's hilarious. - Yeon Seok has a gift for talking.

295
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,868
- Yes, he's funny. - I agree.

296
00:08:57,869 --> 00:09:00,738
Yesterday was my drama production presentation.

297
00:09:00,739 --> 00:09:03,768
- I found myself hosting together. - Exactly.

298
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:05,008
I see.

299
00:09:05,009 --> 00:09:06,138
- Once you... - You're right.

300
00:09:06,139 --> 00:09:07,279
You two are a comedy duo.

301
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,248
Doesn't such a compliment make you happy?

302
00:09:09,249 --> 00:09:10,909
- It does. - That helps you...

303
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:13,150
improve on your jokes. Got it?

304
00:09:13,379 --> 00:09:15,518
But being complimented for being funny...

305
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,388
- gets addicting. - Yes.

306
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,088
- You want to live up to it. - Exactly.

307
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:20,358
It makes you work harder.

308
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,888
- In short, Jae Suk is right. - Jae Suk.

309
00:09:21,889 --> 00:09:24,399
- We need to go. - Our conversation was just too fun.

310
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:27,599
Either way, we need to go find our Whenever Guests.

311
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,069
What are you looking for?

312
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,269
Wait. Where is it?

313
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,599
- Where did you leave it? - Is this a comedy skit?

314
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,008
If you look for something for ages,

315
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:38,108
- You won't pull out a heart, right? - something pops out.

316
00:09:38,109 --> 00:09:40,079
- There it is. - I found it.

317
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,810
It has the general information of the Whenever Guests.

318
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,979
- My gosh. - What was that?

319
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:46,779
(A great reaction)

320
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,988
- Business cards? - I love their reactions.

321
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,289
You're like a detective.

322
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,218
We've collected quite a lot of cards.

323
00:09:51,219 --> 00:09:52,888
- It's pretty. - Nice, right?

324
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:53,919
- That's a big collection. - Yes.

325
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,329
By the way, that wallet is really pretty.

326
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,758
It has "Whenever Possible" engraved on it.

327
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,936
(Customized business card wallet)

328
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,199
I thought it was Miu Miu.

329
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,728
It's great.

330
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,069
Seriously, it's so pretty.

331
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,169
She thought it was a designer brand.

332
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,539
I really thought it was from Miu Miu.

333
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,969
Does it look that high-end?

334
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:09,369
It's cool.

335
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,139
Overreacting is the basics of variety shows.

336
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,280
- No, I swear... - Overreacting.

337
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:15,849
Overreacting. Reacting well is important.

338
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:18,679
Here's a careful piece of advice...

339
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,718
for those who want to be funny...

340
00:10:20,719 --> 00:10:21,919
- Overreacting. - on variety shows.

341
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,949
- Overreacting is a must. - He's right.

342
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,060
- Interesting. - Now then, Lee Byung Ho.

343
00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:28,689
"From Asan to Seoul,"

344
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:32,460
"I enjoyed my hobby despite the five-hour round trip."

345
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,268
"But with one call from my boss, I started living in Seoul."

346
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,300
(Overreacting)

347
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:40,638
"I will help you find your taste at my workplace,"

348
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,439
"where you can listen, see, and feel music."

349
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,138
- What? Does he do music? - Music...

350
00:10:45,139 --> 00:10:46,279
- Listening to music. - How do you feel it?

351
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,109
- Is he a DJ? - Does he do Nanta?

352
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,848
- That's possible. - No? Using hands and such.

353
00:10:50,849 --> 00:10:52,618
- I don't know. - "I don't know?"

354
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,618
Nanta is closer to rhythm.

355
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:56,690
You tell Hae Ri off quite a lot.

356
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,819
- I don't know. - She tells Hae Ri off a lot.

357
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,789
- I gave her feedback. - Was it feedback?

358
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,659
- I asked what this was. - It was your opinion, right?

359
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,459
- It was feedback. - "I don't know."

360
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,859
Where's the place?

361
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,680
- They need to roll it first. - The coupon.

362
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:11,639
- I need to get a high number. - Hae Ri is...

363
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,098
- The higher, the better. - What if I knock everything over?

364
00:11:14,099 --> 00:11:15,108
- It's okay. - Is it?

365
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,738
- Roll it over there. - Do it gently.

366
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:17,939
Turn it to three and roll it gently.

367
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,138
You never know.

368
00:11:19,139 --> 00:11:21,008
- Turn it to three. - I really...

369
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:22,009
Nice.

370
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,650
Nice.

371
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,950
(Overreacting)

372
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:28,019
(Overreacting)

373
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,389
Nice.

374
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,358
What is it?

375
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,989
- Two. - Two.

376
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:36,289
- Two. - Goodness.

377
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,299
It's not bad. Two.

378
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,429
- Two isn't bad. - It's just right.

379
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,229
- Good job. - It's just right.

380
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,800
- Let's go downstairs. - Okay.

381
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,138
Thank you for the food, sir.

382
00:11:45,139 --> 00:11:47,169
- Thank you. - Thank you.

383
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,639
The banana pudding was good.

384
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,210
What did we call each other before?

385
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,508
I don't remember either.

386
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,608
Didn't we speak casually?

387
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,008
I think you and Yeon Seok did.

388
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:57,455
- Were you born early in the year? - Were you born early?

389
00:11:57,479 --> 00:11:58,549
Not me.

390
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,848
- Just 1984? - I was born in 1984.

391
00:11:59,849 --> 00:12:01,296
- I was born in early 1985. - Early...

392
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,488
So? Do you want to speak casually?

393
00:12:02,489 --> 00:12:04,320
- I don't know. - What year was Hae Ri born?

394
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,319
- Early 1985. - But listen, Jae Suk.

395
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,618
I'm sticking to 1985 after growing old.

396
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:10,189
Hae Ri keeps her manners with men she wants to.

397
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:11,799
That's not true.

398
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
"That's not true."

399
00:12:12,801 --> 00:12:15,468
When you're young, you want to be the same age as everyone.

400
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:16,569
- But as you get older, - Of course.

401
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,069
- you want to keep your manners. - You want to appear younger.

402
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,570
And everyone uses international age now.

403
00:12:20,769 --> 00:12:22,868
- Do you want to keep your manners? - Keep it.

404
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:25,478
I think we spoke casually back then.

405
00:12:25,479 --> 00:12:28,748
I also think we spoke casually.

406
00:12:28,749 --> 00:12:31,149
- Right? - That's how I remember it too.

407
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,748
- Shall we speak casually? - Do that.

408
00:12:32,749 --> 00:12:34,420
- Let's be friends. - Okay.

409
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,988
It seems Hae Ri wants to be friends.

410
00:12:37,989 --> 00:12:40,588
- Right? But... - I told you.

411
00:12:40,589 --> 00:12:42,559
- she kind of... - Yes?

412
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,199
Wanted to keep her manners to feel younger.

413
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,799
I want us to be the same age,

414
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,728
but our birthdays are quite far apart.

415
00:12:48,729 --> 00:12:50,569
- Don't worry about it. - It's okay.

416
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,998
- We were the same age before. - Exactly.

417
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:54,839
- Let's not be picky. - Right.

418
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:57,108
Yeon Seok is flexible about those things.

419
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,669
- That's why he's flexible. - That's why I'm flexible Yeon Seok.

420
00:12:59,739 --> 00:13:00,779
Nice one, Min Kyung.

421
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,179
- Yes. - You and I get along well.

422
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,209
- Nice. - He's Flexible Seok.

423
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:06,079
- Flexible. - "Flexible Seok?"

424
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,650
- Flexible. - What's with that?

425
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,089
You're flexible.

426
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,589
Hi.

427
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,636
- Who are you greeting? - Weren't they there earlier?

428
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,858
- She's a YouTuber. - Hae Ri.

429
00:13:14,859 --> 00:13:16,659
Why did you greet them? They've been around.

430
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,299
- Isn't it nice? - She greets everyone.

431
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
She likes cameras more than people.

432
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,930
But really, why did you greet them?

433
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:26,400
They've been filming you since the coffee shop.

434
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,138
- Greeting them surprised me. - Out of the blue.

435
00:13:28,139 --> 00:13:29,368
- No. - They filmed us...

436
00:13:29,369 --> 00:13:31,009
- upstairs. - Is it the change of scenes?

437
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:33,108
The scene has changed, Jae Suk.

438
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:34,238
Even the background has changed.

439
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,809
- Is that why? - Yes.

440
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:37,149
It's warmer than I expected.

441
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:38,378
- I told you. - The weather's fine.

442
00:13:38,379 --> 00:13:40,319
- You look cold. - No, I'm not cold.

443
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,549
Tell me if you're cold. I'll give you my coat.

444
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,619
No, I'm good.

445
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:44,248
- That'll be a sight to see. - Jae Suk.

446
00:13:44,249 --> 00:13:45,789
You're becoming skinnier by the day.

447
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:47,420
- I'm not cold. - Are you okay?

448
00:13:47,719 --> 00:13:49,159
Let's go.

449
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,659
We're at Sangsu-dong right now.

450
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,560
- Is this Sangsu-dong? - Sangsu.

451
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:54,498
I used to walk a lot in Sangsu.

452
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:57,169
Hae Ri lived in Hongdae in the past.

453
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,268
- Hongdae... - For real?

454
00:13:58,269 --> 00:14:01,508
I didn't leave Hongdae when I was young.

455
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,809
- Why not? - Hapjeong and Hongdae.

456
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,338
Hae Ri. Weren't you born...

457
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:05,638
- to be in Hongdae? - Hapjeong, Hongdae, and Sangsu.

458
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:07,079
- Weren't you born in Mangwon? - Yes.

459
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,549
- That means this is your hometown. - I was born in Mangwon.

460
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,749
- Yes. - Exactly.

461
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:12,649
You must know some must-eat places.

462
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,649
- But the whole place has changed. - Has it?

463
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:16,518
So many years have passed since then.

464
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,290
- You're right. - Every place is gone.

465
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,588
(Thinking)

466
00:14:19,589 --> 00:14:22,559
In Mangwon-dong... Although we're not there right now,

467
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,659
walk a little farther, and it's Mangwon-dong, right?

468
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:26,498
- The udon place... - Mangwon Udon.

469
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,228
- Yes. - That place is amazing.

470
00:14:28,229 --> 00:14:30,299
- You can go there even at night. - That place?

471
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,268
- Yes, instant udon. - We went there every day.

472
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:33,399
They also sell old-fashioned pork cutlets.

473
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,868
- Let's go there. - That place is phenomenal.

474
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:37,310
- Mangwon Udon? - Yes, Mangwon Udon is awesome.

475
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,279
I was a regular when it was still a food stall.

476
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,449
- Really? Me too. - When it was a food stall?

477
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,150
- Let's go to Mangwon Udon today. - Cool.

478
00:14:43,609 --> 00:14:45,348
- Let's go to Mangwon Udon. - I'm in.

479
00:14:45,349 --> 00:14:46,919
- How about it? - Let's go to Mangwon Udon.

480
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,919
- That place is delicious. - Totally.

481
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,089
- It's really good. - We're at... Sounds good.

482
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,118
This is my first time walking on this street.

483
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:55,529
- I used to walk a lot. - Hae Ri did, right?

484
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,089
I only ever passed by.

485
00:14:57,389 --> 00:15:00,228
I walked miles here on a date.

486
00:15:00,229 --> 00:15:01,589
- Really? - Is that so? With whom?

487
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,430
The guy I dated back then.

488
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,299
- Tell us who. - Really?

489
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,638
(Navi Yoo senses the destination.)

490
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,639
Tell us who.

491
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,508
- Hold on. - Are we not going the right way?

492
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:13,509
- I think it's this building. - Really?

493
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,909
- It's a record shop. - I see records.

494
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,978
Hold on.

495
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:20,978
- Earlier, it said he touched music. - It was vinyl.

496
00:15:20,979 --> 00:15:22,149
(Record shop where you feel music)

497
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,319
- This is the place. - How pretty.

498
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,988
- Goodness. - This place is unbelievable.

499
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,018
I haven't been in such a store in a while.

500
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,358
- Welcome. - My goodness.

501
00:15:29,359 --> 00:15:30,689
- Hi. - Hi.

502
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,059
- Mr. Lee Byung Ho? - Are you Byung Ho?

503
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,259
- Yes, I'm Byung Ho. - Hi.

504
00:15:34,499 --> 00:15:35,929
- This place is cool. - Nice to meet you.

505
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:38,070
- Hi. - As I thought.

506
00:15:38,469 --> 00:15:40,899
(Lee Byung Ho, the first Whenever Guest)

507
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,608
He has that contemporary vibe.

508
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,909
- Totally. - Yes.

509
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,539
- He's literally a Hongdae person. - Hongdae.

510
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,238
- He should be here. - He's a Hongdae person.

511
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,249
- "A Hongdae person?" - A Hongdae person.

512
00:15:49,650 --> 00:15:52,118
- My gosh. How cool. - By the way,

513
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:53,618
what is this place?

514
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,319
- This is a record shop. - I see.

515
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,588
- We sell many secondhand records. - I see.

516
00:15:57,589 --> 00:16:00,320
Anyone can come in freely,

517
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:01,888
listen to music, and purchase them.

518
00:16:01,889 --> 00:16:03,089
This place...

519
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,299
Should we sit somewhere to talk?

520
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,858
- It's so pretty. Here? - Is this area fine?

521
00:16:06,859 --> 00:16:07,900
Over here?

522
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,829
This place is stunning.

523
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,670
For real. It's like Brooklyn.

524
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,539
- "Brooklyn?" - Isn't it like Brooklyn?

525
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:15,539
- It has an overseas vibe. - There's something at the back.

526
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,710
Unbelievable. The Isley Brothers? For real?

527
00:16:18,509 --> 00:16:20,179
This store is fantastic.

528
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,579
- But really. - There are masterpieces.

529
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,179
I love this place.

530
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,518
There are many Japanese records.

531
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,919
- Chungmu-ro has a store like this. - Right.

532
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,018
In the underground shopping complex.

533
00:16:28,019 --> 00:16:29,949
ACDC. My dad loves them.

534
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,290
- ACDC? - Yes.

535
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,790
Goodness.

536
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,759
Do you have Wham!?

537
00:16:35,089 --> 00:16:36,429
- Wham! - "Last Christmas."

538
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:39,030
- A song you want to listen to. - Let's turn on "Last Christmas."

539
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:40,758
This is super nice.

540
00:16:40,759 --> 00:16:42,469
- There are small records. - Look at that.

541
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,129
Who is that? Led Zeppelin?

542
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,940
Actually,

543
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,608
I'm currently into city pop.

544
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,070
- City pop? - Yes.

545
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:53,579
The song HANNI sang.

546
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,449
(Making a song request)

547
00:16:55,450 --> 00:17:00,449
(Outputting the requested song)

548
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,790
(Satisfied)

549
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,659
What are these small records?

550
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:07,859
These are seven-inch records.

551
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,620
- Gosh. - It's a record with one song in it.

552
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,228
- Yes, this too. - A single record.

553
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:13,860
- It's so pretty. - I've never seen one before.

554
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,728
- Isn't it cute? - Davichi should release...

555
00:17:15,729 --> 00:17:16,729
a single record.

556
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,129
- We should. - Totally.

557
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,269
It's really cute.

558
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:20,939
I love it.

559
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,839
- It's my first time seeing it. - Jae Suk.

560
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:23,840
- What? - What?

561
00:17:24,509 --> 00:17:26,679
- This is the most expensive record. - What is it?

562
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,179
- What is it? - It's 250 dollars.

563
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,055
- Why is it so expansive? - It's really expensive.

564
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,410
- It's jazz hip-hop. - What?

565
00:17:31,579 --> 00:17:33,049
- The song... - It's jazz hip-hop?

566
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,350
We're an expert in hip-hop.

567
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:35,689
We can't open it and play it, can we?

568
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,718
We can.

569
00:17:36,719 --> 00:17:38,289
- But that's so expensive. - We...

570
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,619
- We can? - If you want to listen to it...

571
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:41,389
- No. You don't have to play it. - No.

572
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:42,629
- Shouldn't it be sealed? - No.

573
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,258
When customers come to our shop...

574
00:17:44,259 --> 00:17:46,258
and are interested in this record,

575
00:17:46,259 --> 00:17:47,599
they can listen to it.

576
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,869
- They can listen to everything. - But still.

577
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,028
- It's an open record. - Shouldn't it be...

578
00:17:50,029 --> 00:17:51,099
- So we can listen to it. - Really?

579
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,169
- Yes. - We'd like to listen to it then.

580
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,370
What kind of record is it?

581
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,840
He simply wants to listen to expensive records, above all.

582
00:17:57,569 --> 00:17:59,379
- Expensive records. - It's not about his taste in music.

583
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:02,179
I wanted to listen to it because he said it was a rare record.

584
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:04,255
(A listener who especially listens to expensive records)

585
00:18:04,279 --> 00:18:06,620
(He's ready to play the expensive record.)

586
00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:11,249
(Focused)

587
00:18:15,729 --> 00:18:17,989
- That's a difficult song. - It's very difficult.

588
00:18:19,059 --> 00:18:20,828
(The intro is a bit difficult to understand.)

589
00:18:20,829 --> 00:18:22,998
- This song... - It's a difficult song.

590
00:18:22,999 --> 00:18:24,200
- It's unique. - Yes.

591
00:18:24,469 --> 00:18:26,870
(Cheering)

592
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,109
(Overreacting at the changed beat)

593
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,409
- My gosh, the intro... - Yes.

594
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,808
It suddenly got trendy here.

595
00:18:31,809 --> 00:18:33,238
- Hello. - It suddenly got trendy.

596
00:18:33,239 --> 00:18:35,709
- Hello. - This is a cool song.

597
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:38,279
- This song is sexy. - This is nice.

598
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:41,718
It feels very much like we're in Hongdae.

599
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:43,120
I want this album.

600
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,119
There's a twist with this song.

601
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,359
- Yes. - The intro wasn't cool like this.

602
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,390
Right.

603
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,860
I like this album.

604
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,399
Is that a different song?

605
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,400
- Yes. It's a different song. - I love it.

606
00:18:53,401 --> 00:18:54,829
- My gosh. - As expected...

607
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,169
I love it.

608
00:18:57,170 --> 00:19:01,539
(The two friends dance to the rhythm in a similar style.)

609
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:05,008
- Let's talk. - We should talk.

610
00:19:05,009 --> 00:19:06,238
Yes. Let's talk.

611
00:19:06,239 --> 00:19:08,308
- Let's sit down. - Yes.

612
00:19:08,309 --> 00:19:09,349
"Yes."

613
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,856
(They come to their senses and get ready to talk.)

614
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,218
- Give me a call - Thank you.

615
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,620
(The excitement still lingers on.)

616
00:19:14,819 --> 00:19:16,548
Would our songs end up in albums like this later?

617
00:19:16,549 --> 00:19:18,018
- "Give me a call, baby?" - Once we die?

618
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:19,619
- You know, those records... - Wouldn't there be records...

619
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,060
of our songs when we're still alive?

620
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,228
Byung Ho. Are you from Gunsan?

621
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,498
- Asan, South Chungcheong Province. - He's from Asan.

622
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:27,099
- Asan, South Chungcheong Province? - Asan, South Chungcheong Province.

623
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,299
But you look like...

624
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,268
- Right. HYUKOH. - Yes.

625
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,939
- He has a similar vibe. - Yes.

626
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,100
- Or Naul when he was young. - Yes.

627
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,609
- Thank you. - You look cool.

628
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:38,578
So you came here from Asan for music.

629
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:40,880
- Yes. - And you ended up living in Seoul?

630
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:42,609
I always loved music...

631
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,609
- ever since I was young. - Okay.

632
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:46,949
- So I often bought records. - I see.

633
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,788
- Was buying records your hobby? - Yes.

634
00:19:48,789 --> 00:19:50,149
I always collected records.

635
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:52,389
Discovering songs people didn't know about...

636
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:53,619
was such a joy for me.

637
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,028
- So... Yes. - Like finding rare songs?

638
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,558
- I see. - Finding unique songs was fun.

639
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,099
I had been hooked on that.

640
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:04,229
But I wanted to be a music expert and more well-versed in music.

641
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,370
I always had that desire.

642
00:20:06,499 --> 00:20:08,909
So I studied music while buying more records.

643
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,738
Then you must have quite a lot of records.

644
00:20:10,739 --> 00:20:12,238
Yes. I have some at home.

645
00:20:12,239 --> 00:20:13,409
- How many? - How many records do you have?

646
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,379
The number of records I have isn't considered a lot.

647
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,880
But I have about 500 to 600 records.

648
00:20:16,979 --> 00:20:18,819
- That's not considered a lot? - No.

649
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:21,218
So you must spend most of your paycheck on records then.

650
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:23,249
- Yes. I love music. - My gosh.

651
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,288
Since I love these records,

652
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,318
I want to have them, even if I spend a lot of money on them.

653
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,159
Those records hold a deep meaning for me.

654
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,259
I bet.

655
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,728
But there aren't good record shops in Asan.

656
00:20:33,729 --> 00:20:34,729
You can't find...

657
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,429
- a variety of records there. - Right. That's why...

658
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,068
I always came to Seoul to buy records.

659
00:20:39,069 --> 00:20:41,869
Then did you come to this shop often?

660
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:44,538
The owner knew that I loved music.

661
00:20:44,539 --> 00:20:48,308
So the owner asked me first if I wanted to work for him.

662
00:20:48,309 --> 00:20:49,879
- It sounds like a drama. - So...

663
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,719
I used to commute from Asan every day.

664
00:20:53,249 --> 00:20:54,818
- Yes. I used to commute from there. - That's amazing.

665
00:20:54,819 --> 00:20:56,488
But I thought I couldn't commute anymore.

666
00:20:56,489 --> 00:20:58,149
- So I moved to Seoul. - How long does it take...

667
00:20:58,150 --> 00:20:59,389
to commute from Asan? For the round trip?

668
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:01,758
I get on the subway at Onyangoncheon Station.

669
00:21:01,759 --> 00:21:03,459
It takes about two and a half hours via subway.

670
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,828
- My gosh. - A round trip...

671
00:21:04,829 --> 00:21:06,200
- takes five hours. - Goodness.

672
00:21:06,329 --> 00:21:08,228
Then at what time did you have to wake up to come here?

673
00:21:08,229 --> 00:21:10,328
I would leave around 8am.

674
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,268
When I got off on time,

675
00:21:12,269 --> 00:21:14,468
I arrived at Asan Station around 11:30pm.

676
00:21:14,469 --> 00:21:16,485
- Around 11:30pm at Asan Station? - That's amazing.

677
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,939
But you have to leave at 8am again the next day.

678
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,609
- Right. - Goodness.

679
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,949
Because you loved music...

680
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,308
- Gosh. - and records,

681
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:26,718
you could make a five-hour round trip.

682
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:28,548
- If he worked at an office... - He couldn't have done it.

683
00:21:28,549 --> 00:21:29,949
- He couldn't have. - he couldn't have done that.

684
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,089
Then what did you do at home...

685
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,235
- once you arrived at 11:30pm? - Right.

686
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:34,389
I used to wash up and go to sleep right away...

687
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,659
- to go to work the next morning. - Right.

688
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,758
That's what I did.

689
00:21:36,759 --> 00:21:37,988
But when the owner offered me the job,

690
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:39,599
I really wanted to work here.

691
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,199
I told the owner, "I really want this job."

692
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,569
- "I can do it." - Really?

693
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,940
So I'm really happy these days.

694
00:21:46,969 --> 00:21:48,968
- I love it. - My gosh.

695
00:21:48,969 --> 00:21:50,370
What are you so happy about?

696
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,939
(He can't hold back and asks a question.)

697
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,078
- First of all... - I'm sorry.

698
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,778
- What's wrong with you? - Are you trying to argue with him?

699
00:21:55,779 --> 00:21:57,978
- A five-hour commute... - He's happy. What are you doing?

700
00:21:57,979 --> 00:21:59,179
- I also... - He used to spend five hours...

701
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,978
- commuting back and forth. - I mean...

702
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:02,048
- Now, he can get here fast... - Listen.

703
00:22:02,049 --> 00:22:03,548
- I can get here fast now. Yes. - and gets to work with records.

704
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:04,818
- I... - Right.

705
00:22:04,819 --> 00:22:07,359
I guess I knew how the viewers would feel.

706
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,960
- I mean... - What makes you so happy?

707
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,459
I used to put aside time separately for records.

708
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,699
But while working here,

709
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:18,180
- You get to learn more about them. - I get to handle records.

710
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:21,238
- So that makes me so happy. - Seriously.

711
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,410
I'm really happy here.

712
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:26,079
It looks like Davichi... How should I put it?

713
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,478
When you were talking about music,

714
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,879
there was so much joy in your eyes. And seeing that...

715
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,248
must have made them think.

716
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,619
I kept thinking to myself, "What are we doing?"

717
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:37,449
The more I look at his eyes, the smaller I feel.

718
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,488
- Same here. - Right.

719
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:39,889
Compared to the passion he has,

720
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,959
- our passion is insignificant. - Right. What do we do? It is.

721
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,129
It made me wonder...

722
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,929
if I was that passionate when I began singing in high school.

723
00:22:44,930 --> 00:22:46,998
- That crossed my mind too. - Right.

724
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,258
- He makes you reflect. - Yes.

725
00:22:48,259 --> 00:22:49,600
I keep reflecting on myself.

726
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,238
But is there something that could be better?

727
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,599
The downside of this job is...

728
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,339
that I have to work alone.

729
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,309
I want to introduce records to customers and talk about music.

730
00:22:58,509 --> 00:23:00,978
I love spending time with fellow music lovers.

731
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:02,478
So when I'm alone...

732
00:23:02,479 --> 00:23:04,048
- It gets boring. - Yes, it's a bit boring.

733
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,119
- Is that why you wrote to us? - Yes.

734
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,856
- Yes. That's why... - Could you tell us more about why?

735
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,889
I love records.

736
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,719
I wanted other music lovers to find out about this shop,

737
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,389
so they would come here when I have some spare time...

738
00:23:15,390 --> 00:23:17,129
and enjoy music together.

739
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,328
- To enjoy music together? - Yes.

740
00:23:18,329 --> 00:23:20,399
- That's great. - There are many customers...

741
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,468
who know more about music than me.

742
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:24,869
Artists like Davichi know a lot about music too.

743
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,568
I thought sharing what we know about music would be fun.

744
00:23:26,569 --> 00:23:28,709
You have such a positive personality.

745
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,140
- He loves his job so much. - Right.

746
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:33,579
I have never met anyone who loved their job this much.

747
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,508
When he's talking about his job, his eyes are gleaming...

748
00:23:35,509 --> 00:23:36,979
- with love. - Right.

749
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:38,778
- Is this possible? - How can this be?

750
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,318
- He makes me reflect on myself. - Same here.

751
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,818
- "Did I listen to as much music..." - We...

752
00:23:41,819 --> 00:23:43,318
- "as him?" - Besides, we're singers.

753
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:44,988
This is our job, you know?

754
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,059
"Job."

755
00:23:46,489 --> 00:23:48,119
- I can feel his love for it. - I mean...

756
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,728
- I'm about to tear up. - I'd like to ask the owner...

757
00:23:49,729 --> 00:23:50,959
if any employee could be as passionate as him.

758
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,099
- No. There are no employees... - Gosh, he's amazing.

759
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,229
- like him. - You know?

760
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,930
- So you used to collect records. - Yes.

761
00:23:56,069 --> 00:23:58,099
Is there a dream or a goal you want to achieve...

762
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,699
through your passion for records?

763
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,798
- Right. - I'm curious.

764
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,909
- I buy a lot of records. - Yes.

765
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:05,808
It made me wonder if listening to them alone was meaningful at all.

766
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:07,739
- I started to wonder about that. - I see.

767
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:11,008
So I looked into ways of having more fun with the records.

768
00:24:11,009 --> 00:24:13,218
- And records can be used... - Right.

769
00:24:13,219 --> 00:24:14,819
For DJing.

770
00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:16,449
Are you studying to be a DJ?

771
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:19,659
Yes. I'm practicing a lot.

772
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:21,518
- You're practicing that. - Yes.

773
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:23,359
- When I'm invited to an event, - That's great.

774
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,429
I play some music.

775
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,359
- Then you need a nickname. - I see.

776
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:29,268
I just go by my real name, Byung Ho.

777
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,430
- "Byung Ho?" - Yes.

778
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,929
- You go by your real name? - Yes.

779
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,699
- If you have a nickname... - Shouldn't we help him...

780
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,899
come up with a nickname?

781
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,670
- How about Bald Byung? - "Bald Byung?"

782
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,940
- How about Bald Byung? - "Bald Byung?"

783
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,439
(The stage name speaks to them.)

784
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,979
She came up with that so fast. That was fast.

785
00:24:44,809 --> 00:24:45,920
(Impressed)

786
00:24:46,579 --> 00:24:48,350
(He ends up approving it.)

787
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:49,689
- Min Kyung. - What?

788
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,518
- You made no effort. - It doesn't sound so nice.

789
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,959
Bald Byung? Seriously?

790
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,959
- You... You're like... - Bald Byung?

791
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,400
Give me some time to explain myself.

792
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,159
- A name must have an impact. - I see.

793
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,728
- An impact. - When he played the jazz record,

794
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:00,859
it started off with a calm melody.

795
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,798
But when the hip-hop beat started to play, we loved it.

796
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:03,968
- Yes. - There was an element of surprise.

797
00:25:03,969 --> 00:25:06,416
When people hear Bald Byung, they might expect something rough.

798
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,039
But they end up hearing smooth jazz and so on. Then...

799
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:11,068
That would be great.

800
00:25:11,069 --> 00:25:12,479
- Bald Byung... - Goodness.

801
00:25:13,479 --> 00:25:15,379
- Isn't it hard to pronounce? - No, listen.

802
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:17,279
- Right. - The English version is Park Byung.

803
00:25:18,249 --> 00:25:19,349
Park Byung. Isn't that nice?

804
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,420
- But... - My last name is Lee.

805
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:24,319
- You're a Lee? - Yes.

806
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,619
- You're a Lee? Then... - He's a Lee.

807
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,689
Why don't you give him a stage name?

808
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,328
Let's see how great of a stage name you come up with.

809
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:31,009
- Let's hear it. - I actually recommend...

810
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,399
using his own name.

811
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,859
- Right? - I personally prefer that.

812
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,998
- Really? - Yes.

813
00:25:34,999 --> 00:25:36,399
- You can just... - That's weak.

814
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,900
But Bald Byung isn't cool.

815
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,298
- Gosh, I see. - That can't be a nickname.

816
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,508
- How about Braised Byung Ho? - Everything...

817
00:25:42,509 --> 00:25:43,669
(How about Braised Byung Ho?)

818
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:45,308
(Candidate 2: Braised Byung Ho)

819
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:46,609
- "Braised Byung Ho?" - Braised Byung Ho.

820
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:48,209
- What do you think? - "Braised?"

821
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,349
- It sounds concentrated. - He's pulling back.

822
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,949
- He asked three times. - He's pulling back.

823
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,649
- "Braised?" - Number one, Bald Byung.

824
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,850
Number two, Braised Byung Ho.

825
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,789
I hate it.

826
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,389
- If someone recommended me... - My gosh.

827
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:58,589
- "What's the meaning behind it?" - That's a cool name.

828
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:00,288
- "Braised Byung Ho." - "It's a braised name."

829
00:26:00,289 --> 00:26:02,049
- Braised Byung Ho. - "It's a braised name."

830
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,389
- If anyone kept doing this to me... - Seriously.

831
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:07,059
This is the worst nickname I've heard recently.

832
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:09,100
- Braised Byung Ho. - Braised Byung Ho.

833
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,599
His eyes compared to before...

834
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,600
His eyes sparkled earlier, but...

835
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,169
- His eyes look a bit dull now. - Right. He looks very calm now.

836
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,139
- Talking about records... - His eyes look so different.

837
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,009
- Is your MBTI type ENFP? - His gaze changed.

838
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,710
- I... - Is it INFP?

839
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,879
I go back and forth between INFP and ISFP.

840
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,248
- ISFP? Right. - That's your MBTI type too.

841
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,149
Right. I can tell he's an ISFP.

842
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,019
But when we talk about things I'm interested in,

843
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,749
- I change. - I see.

844
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,988
- When it's about your interests. - Right. A bit.

845
00:26:32,989 --> 00:26:36,228
This is common for ISFPs. And it's the same for me too.

846
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:39,600
In my opinion, we're very selfish.

847
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:42,899
- We step up when we want to. - Right.

848
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,268
- When we want to. - When we want to step back...

849
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,328
So we're self-centered.

850
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:46,899
- Right. - You know what I mean, right?

851
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,199
- I'm like that too. - That's it, right?

852
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,339
- I can relate. - Yes.

853
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:52,508
Have you listened to Davichi's music?

854
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:53,789
I listened to their music a lot.

855
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,778
"Don't Say Goodbye." I listened to songs like that.

856
00:26:56,779 --> 00:26:57,849
And "Turtle."

857
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,318
- "Turtle." - Yes.

858
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,380
"Turtle."

859
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,319
- Why did you give him a fist bump? - "Turtle."

860
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,989
That's one of my favorites.

861
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,890
But...

862
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,728
You guys should release records of your songs as soon as possible.

863
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,429
- We're planning to release one. - We're seriously considering it.

864
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:14,498
- Really? - Yes.

865
00:27:14,499 --> 00:27:16,369
Will you display ours in the front?

866
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,268
At bookstores, they display newly released books in the front.

867
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:21,369
Do you guys also sell newly released records here?

868
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:22,409
- I can listen to it first... - Do you?

869
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,410
And give it to you then.

870
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,939
(Forcing a laugh)

871
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,140
- I can listen to it first. - Did you look at his face?

872
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,679
I bet he's good at explaining your songs.

873
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,078
Right. When you make great albums,

874
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:35,218
we can sell them here.

875
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:36,988
- Yes. - He's pulling back now.

876
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,119
That's typical for an ISFP.

877
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,558
(He fails to escape.)

878
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,389
Make a great album. And I'll do my best to sell it.

879
00:27:43,390 --> 00:27:44,829
- He leaned back. - Just now,

880
00:27:45,289 --> 00:27:46,359
- he pulled back. - When she got close,

881
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,199
- he pulled back. - Why did you sit there?

882
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,998
When she got close, he leaned back.

883
00:27:50,999 --> 00:27:53,238
One of the characteristics of ENFPs is...

884
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,799
draining introverts' energy.

885
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,768
(Draining)

886
00:27:57,769 --> 00:27:59,079
You drained his energy.

887
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,579
He leaned back.

888
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,780
- Did you see his eyes? - Yes.

889
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,380
- He's totally drained. - Anyway...

890
00:28:03,579 --> 00:28:05,919
So you wrote to our show.

891
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,149
- Yes. - We need to play games for you.

892
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:09,619
- Let's begin now. - Yes.

893
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,218
Since he's living on his own, we should give him some presents.

894
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,159
- We should. - Things he'll need for his house.

895
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,690
Seriously.

896
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,360
When you break it,

897
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,321
- you'll find out what the prize is. - Thank you.

898
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,799
Read it for us.

899
00:28:23,299 --> 00:28:25,228
"A limited edition album that came out before you became a fan."

900
00:28:25,229 --> 00:28:26,370
"A hard-to-get record."

901
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,700
"DJ Soulscape's limited edition record."

902
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,038
- Is that a good prize? - Is it a rare record?

903
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,478
- Do you have this? - My gosh.

904
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:34,839
- No, I don't have it. - You don't?

905
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,879
- No. - What's this?

906
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,880
(This limited edition record...)

907
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,650
(by DJ Soulscape that made him a music fan.)

908
00:28:40,079 --> 00:28:42,318
This album was what that led Byung Ho...

909
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,659
to collect records. This was the starting point.

910
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,718
- My gosh. - Right.

911
00:28:46,719 --> 00:28:48,318
But you couldn't find that album?

912
00:28:48,319 --> 00:28:50,459
No. It's really hard to get that record.

913
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,590
I mean, I wanted it.

914
00:28:51,729 --> 00:28:53,459
- Amazing. How did you get it? - We have to win this for him then.

915
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:54,758
- We must win it for him. - Yes.

916
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:56,298
- Let's play it if we succeed. - Let's play it then.

917
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,019
For your information, it costs 450 dollars.

918
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,568
- It costs 450 dollars? - That's so expensive.

919
00:29:00,569 --> 00:29:01,839
- So they take it away... - This is a rare record.

920
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,909
After showing it to him first?

921
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,485
- What? - After showing it to him first?

922
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,778
- They just take it? - Yes, if we fail.

923
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:07,209
- Let me take a look. - They take away everything.

924
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,008
- Then they shouldn't show it... - This is an expensive album.

925
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,809
Then what are we playing today?

926
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,949
(The limited edition record is at stake on this mission.)

927
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:15,449
(Teamwork! Soundtrack Quiz)

928
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,849
Original soundtracks! Oh, we're confident then.

929
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,988
You saw I got all of the period dramas wrong...

930
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,089
- last time. - I really want him to have it.

931
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:21,090
(On the other hand, he's not confident.)

932
00:29:21,091 --> 00:29:22,988
- I really want to win it for him. - I'm not good with titles.

933
00:29:22,989 --> 00:29:25,229
He totally ruined the quiz with the period dramas.

934
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:27,359
(Round 1)

935
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,659

936
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:32,400
(and guess the singer, actors, and title.)

937
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,139
(A practice round)

938
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,339
(Listen to the 10 seconds of the highlight.)

939
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,139
I'm going first. I got it. Hold on.

940
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,778
- Yim Jae Beom. - Right.

941
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:42,909
- All right. - In 1, 2, 3.

942
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,209
- Jang Hyuk. - Okay.

943
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,380
In 1, 2, 3.

944
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,680
Lee Da Hae?

945
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,349
- Okay. - "The Slave Hunters."

946
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,149
- Gosh! This is how we play it? - Yes, that's it.

947
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:51,920
- See? We should've gone for it. - Okay.

948
00:29:52,049 --> 00:29:53,089
- This is it. - It's easy.

949
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:54,159
- Okay. - Can we just play?

950
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,189
Okay. We got this.

951
00:29:55,190 --> 00:29:56,859
- We got this. Let's go for it. - It's not easy, though.

952
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,528
- We must listen to the whole thing. - Yes.

953
00:29:58,529 --> 00:30:00,058
- Listen to it for ten seconds. - Yes.

954
00:30:00,059 --> 00:30:01,258
- Great. I got it. - Because other people...

955
00:30:01,259 --> 00:30:02,468
- might not know what it is. - Listen to it for ten seconds?

956
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:03,998
- Okay. Let's go. - Don't stop the music.

957
00:30:03,999 --> 00:30:05,798
- Here. In 1, 2, 3. - Send them up?

958
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,869
- We got this. - We got this.

959
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,069
Can I get a sip of water?

960
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,639
- Do you want some water? - Yeon Seok is really bad...

961
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,709
- at quizzes like this. - You're good?

962
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:13,109
- This is really tough. - Gosh, I'm weak at these quizzes.

963
00:30:13,110 --> 00:30:14,738
- Do you want some water? - Then we should wait for them.

964
00:30:14,739 --> 00:30:15,808
- Let's wait... - Let's take it slow.

965
00:30:15,809 --> 00:30:16,978
Until Yeon Seok guesses the actors.

966
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:18,479
I'm not good at guessing the titles.

967
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:21,218
- I think we can do this. - We can do this.

968
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:22,849
- We could easily win this round. - My gosh.

969
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,549
- Goodness. - We must win this for him.

970
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,019
- Let's begin. - We'll begin.

971
00:30:27,319 --> 00:30:28,659
- This is the first song. - So this will count, right?

972
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,390
Yes. Here's the song.

973
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:34,860
(I think we can do this.)

974
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,229
Start.

- You know what it is. - No. Why?

- Why not? I was waiting. - Why didn't you say it?

999
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,779
I was waiting for you. You were mumbling something.

1000
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,718
I thought you were going to say it.

1001

1002
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,018

I could've guessed the rest.

1021
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,449
Right. Your best friends were in it. Why didn't you know that?

1022

My best friends were in it.

1023

- Why didn't I know? - Seriously.

1024
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:04,018
I thought you would go first. Why didn't you?

1025
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:06,259
You opened your mouth and mumbled something.

1026
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,589
You have to cover your mouth now.

1027
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,689
- Do that if you don't know. - Okay.

1028
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:10,160
- I'll go 1st, then. - You go 1st.

1029
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,360
What a bummer.

1030
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:12,429
I would've figured it out if I had known it was Ailee.

1031
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,228
And she's getting married soon.

1032
00:32:14,229 --> 00:32:16,569
- Right. Congratulations, Ailee. - Congratulations.

1033
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:18,669
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

1034
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,738
- That was random. - Congratulations.

1035
00:32:19,739 --> 00:32:22,038
- That was random. - It's nice she's getting married.

1036
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,209
- This is great. - And she's a great person.

1037
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,370
Right. She's so kind.

1038
00:32:25,469 --> 00:32:26,640
- Ailee. - Congratulations.

1039
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,210

We have to win this.

1050
00:32:47,559 --> 00:32:48,929
- Keep listening. Think. - Hold on.

1051
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:50,568
No. We must listen to it more. Wait.

Seriously. I'm bad with titles.

- You can figure it out, right? - Of course.

1094
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,455
- I'll guess the singer or actor. - That's an easy one to guess.

Singers of soundtracks have unique voices.

1096
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:13,479
- You know? - Guessing the title is hard.

1097

- "Guard." Guard! - "Guard." Hey, Mr. Guard.

1101
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:25,158
- "Guard." Where are you going? - "Guard."

1102

- We should've gotten that right. - To be honest...

1103

- The comedy duo is good. - The comedy duo...

1104
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:30,828
- We won't let that slide. - And...

1105
00:34:30,829 --> 00:34:32,999
- Guard. - Guard.

1106
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:34,800
- Guard. - Guard.

1107
00:34:35,670 --> 00:34:37,010

00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:38,768
- Min Kyung said I mumbled, - He's...

1109
00:34:38,769 --> 00:34:40,578
so I feel small right now.

1111
00:34:42,309 --> 00:34:44,679
- Mr. Guard. - You're still mocking me?

1112
00:34:45,409 --> 00:34:46,678
You're mimicking a North Korean accent for this?

1113
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,819
- You mispronounced the title, - Guard. Mr. Guard.

1114
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,819
- and they mimicked an accent. - Seriously.

1115
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,660
This is crazy. How many tries do we have left?

1116
00:34:52,789 --> 00:34:53,920
This is your third try.

1117
00:34:54,090 --> 00:34:55,189
- We have 10 tries left, right? - We have 7 tries left.

1118
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,135
- Did you know all of them so far? - We have seven tries left.

1119
00:34:57,159 --> 00:34:58,489
- You know what? - I didn't know a few.

1120
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,859
- Min Kyung surprised me. - Really?

1121
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,540
She said, "We have ten tries left, right?"

1122
00:35:02,229 --> 00:35:03,529
What happened, Min Kyung?

1123
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:06,039
- Goodness. - I don't remember my losses.

1202
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:33,549
- Anyone can go. - We got this.

1203
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,978
- We definitely got this. - We got this.

1204
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:35,979

- Incorrect. - No!

1213

What are you talking about?

1214
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,970
- In 1, 2, 3. - "Snow Flower."

"Snow Flower" is...

00:37:57,869 --> 00:37:59,829
- That's the song title. - That's the song title.

1218
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:02,409
- "I'm Sorry..." - I think my eardrums ripped.

1219
00:38:03,579 --> 00:38:05,078
"I'm Sorry..."

1220
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,455
(The answer is "I'm Sorry, I Love You.")

1221
00:38:06,479 --> 00:38:08,820
- Say you're sorry. - Say you're sorry now.

1222
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,888
- Hae Ri. - How could you do that, Hae Ri?

1223
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,365
- Hae Ri. How could you... - I'm sorry.

1224
00:38:13,389 --> 00:38:15,589
- I'm sorry. - That was such a good chance.

1225
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,129
- Hae Ri. - Oh, no.

1226
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:20,030
You didn't stick out until now, but...

1227
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,659
- The weakest link was right here. - Come on.

1228
00:38:22,869 --> 00:38:25,099
Oh, no. I feel so bad.

1229
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,768
That was unbelievable.

1230
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:27,868

00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:30,610

Oh, my goodness.

1233
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,379
- The song is "Snow Flower." - I was planning to say that.

- "Snow Flower?" - Yes.

1235
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:36,409
Oh, goodness.

1236
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:38,679
- Did you know all of the answers? - No. I'm also...

not really confident.

I really want it.

00:38:43,749 --> 00:38:45,388
Of course, you do.

Of course, you do.

- Let's give it a shot. - Yes, let's do well.

Kim Daniel.

That was our chance.

00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:18,449

You can tell one person to sit out.

- You need to take someone out. - Oh, someone to replace?

00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,719
- Someone to replace. - You can just stare at them.

00:48:48,117 --> 00:48:50,317
- What a relief. - Seriously.

1544
00:48:50,456 --> 00:48:51,987
- That was a struggle. - Gosh.

1545
00:48:52,157 --> 00:48:54,125
- That was a struggle. - You must be happy.

1546
00:48:54,126 --> 00:48:55,526
- That was a struggle. - Seriously.

1547
00:48:55,556 --> 00:48:57,596
- This is nice. - It's impressive.

1548
00:48:57,597 --> 00:49:00,496
- I was worried we wouldn't succeed. - I know.

1549
00:49:00,726 --> 00:49:02,197
(Marveling)

1550
00:49:03,396 --> 00:49:05,597
What kind of record is it?

1551
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:08,466
It's a great relief...

1552
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:09,706
we could give you a present.

1553
00:49:10,436 --> 00:49:11,677
I feel so happy.

1554
00:49:12,137 --> 00:49:15,306
It's the record of DJ Soulscape whom I highly respect.

1555
00:49:15,817 --> 00:49:18,677
I'm delighted to receive it as a present.

1556
00:49:19,117 --> 00:49:21,816
Whenever possible, I'd like to search for new music.

1557
00:49:21,817 --> 00:49:23,977
(Whenever possible, I'd like to search for new music.)

1558
00:49:24,617 --> 00:49:27,786
I got agitated every time I got the answer wrong.

1559
00:49:28,327 --> 00:49:29,855
- "Agitated?" - I got agitated.

1560
00:49:29,856 --> 00:49:31,395
- You got agitated? - Agitated.

1561
00:49:31,396 --> 00:49:32,467
Agitated Yeon Seok.

1562
00:49:32,697 --> 00:49:34,067
Seriously.

1563
00:49:35,496 --> 00:49:36,666
We decided...

1564
00:49:37,396 --> 00:49:39,336
where to have lunch.

1565
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:40,705
- The udon place? - The udon place.

1566
00:49:40,706 --> 00:49:41,835
- Let's go. - Shall we?

1567
00:49:41,836 --> 00:49:43,706
- Are you sure? - Is it walking distance?

1568
00:49:44,007 --> 00:49:45,375
- We can't walk? - I don't think so.

1569
00:49:45,376 --> 00:49:46,706
Wait. Are they open?

1570
00:49:47,206 --> 00:49:49,316
- They're open. - We can take a bus from here.

1571
00:49:49,317 --> 00:49:50,817
- Is that so? - Right here?

1572
00:49:51,916 --> 00:49:54,145
(They take the bus to get udon.)

1573
00:49:54,146 --> 00:49:56,916
I'm suddenly famished.

1574
00:49:57,657 --> 00:50:00,225
- That was quite a struggle. - I know.

1575
00:50:00,226 --> 00:50:02,625
Do you always get it wrong when it's so close?

1576
00:50:02,626 --> 00:50:04,903
- Yes. It sometimes doesn't work. - Sometimes, we get it wrong.

1577
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,125
- I'm not very good, - Seriously.

1578
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:08,367
But when someone else gets it wrong, I get very upset.

1579
00:50:08,467 --> 00:50:09,636
I got so mad.

1580
00:50:09,637 --> 00:50:11,597
- I got so mad. - How could you say "Kim Daniel?"

1581
00:50:11,996 --> 00:50:13,665
- Kim Daniel. - That was horrific, Jae Suk.

1582
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:15,777
He even said "Daniel Henney" at first.

1583
00:50:16,907 --> 00:50:18,737
(Glaring at him)

1584
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,406
Why did we say "Mr. Guard?"

1585
00:50:20,407 --> 00:50:22,646
- Mr. Guard? - It started with "Guardian."

1586
00:50:22,746 --> 00:50:25,317
- Why did you say "Guard?" - Seriously.

1587
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:27,085
You were supposed to name the singer. Why did you...

1588
00:50:27,086 --> 00:50:28,846
- Come on. - "Guard?"

1589
00:50:28,847 --> 00:50:32,016
I thought I was going to lose it when you said "Snow Flower."

1590
00:50:32,427 --> 00:50:34,026
- "Snow Flower." - When you said that...

1591
00:50:34,027 --> 00:50:35,526
- That was horrible. - I'm sorry.

1592
00:50:35,527 --> 00:50:37,225
- I know I was horrible. - Didn't Min Kyung get any wrong?

1593
00:50:37,226 --> 00:50:38,855
- No, I didn't. - She did well.

1594
00:50:38,856 --> 00:50:39,866
You didn't get anything wrong.

1595
00:50:39,867 --> 00:50:42,266
It didn't show.

1596
00:50:42,567 --> 00:50:44,935
But after we got the wrong answer,

1597
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:46,466
- That isn't true. - she guessed it wrong too.

1598
00:50:46,467 --> 00:50:47,637
That isn't true.

1599
00:50:47,936 --> 00:50:49,406
But she was the first to recognize the songs.

1600
00:50:49,407 --> 00:50:51,137
- It's true. - Yes, it is.

1601
00:50:51,706 --> 00:50:52,746
Gosh.

1602
00:50:55,277 --> 00:50:56,376
You're cold, aren't you?

1603
00:50:56,947 --> 00:50:57,976
A little bit.

1604
00:50:58,617 --> 00:50:59,645
Do you want my coat?

1605
00:50:59,646 --> 00:51:01,245
- No, it's okay. - I got worked up and am hot.

1606
00:51:01,246 --> 00:51:02,686
- I have a jacket. - You do?

1607
00:51:04,387 --> 00:51:06,987
(He ended up putting his jacket on.)

1608
00:51:08,086 --> 00:51:11,326
(The bus doesn't arrive.)

1609
00:51:11,327 --> 00:51:13,096
(And the weather gets colder.)

1610
00:51:13,097 --> 00:51:14,995
- It's definitely winter. - Yes, it is.

1611
00:51:14,996 --> 00:51:16,666
- This is just the beginning. - Yes.

1612
00:51:17,097 --> 00:51:18,696
It's very cold in the shade.

1613
00:51:18,697 --> 00:51:19,967
- Yes. - The wind is cold.

1614
00:51:20,467 --> 00:51:22,705
- Yes. Across the street, - Listen to your stylist.

1615
00:51:22,706 --> 00:51:24,406
Someone is running in short sleeves.

1616
00:51:24,407 --> 00:51:26,206
- Gosh. You're right. - Aren't you cold?

1617
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:28,506
- You're right. - Aren't you cold?

1618
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:30,846
(Passionate runner in short sleeves)

1619
00:51:30,847 --> 00:51:32,785
- Aren't you cold? - What?

1620
00:51:32,786 --> 00:51:34,266
- Aren't you cold? - Aren't you cold?

1621
00:51:35,117 --> 00:51:36,657
- Are you cold? - Yes.

1622
00:51:38,717 --> 00:51:41,355
(The runner in short sleeves is cold too.)

1623
00:51:41,356 --> 00:51:44,027
(She faces the wall of wailing again.)

1624
00:51:44,956 --> 00:51:46,427
I get cold if I stop running.

1625
00:51:46,567 --> 00:51:48,426
- He gets cold if he isn't running. - He gets cold if he isn't running.

1626
00:51:48,427 --> 00:51:49,736
You get cold if you stop running?

1627
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:51,896
- Good luck. - That was hilarious.

1628
00:51:51,967 --> 00:51:53,305
You asked him if he was cold, and he nodded.

1629
00:51:53,306 --> 00:51:54,535
(Run if you can't avoid the cold.)

1630
00:51:54,536 --> 00:51:55,665
"I get cold if I stop running."

1631
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:56,776
- That was hilarious. - Of course, he's cold.

1632
00:51:56,777 --> 00:51:57,806
That's funny.

1633
00:51:58,106 --> 00:51:59,847
"I get cold if I stop running."

1634
00:52:00,376 --> 00:52:02,346
He left us with that punchline.

1635
00:52:02,347 --> 00:52:04,316
- It's a wise saying. - "I get cold if I stop running."

1636
00:52:04,317 --> 00:52:06,116
- Of course. - Yes, that's right.

1637
00:52:06,117 --> 00:52:08,046
- Gosh. - How long do we have to wait?

1638
00:52:08,047 --> 00:52:10,987
- It's a minute away. - It's almost here.

1639
00:52:12,487 --> 00:52:14,527
(Staring at his phone)

1640
00:52:14,856 --> 00:52:15,856
Wait.

1641
00:52:16,427 --> 00:52:18,026
Are we in the wrong spot?

1642
00:52:18,027 --> 00:52:20,426
Unbelievable.

1643
00:52:20,427 --> 00:52:21,427
Oh, no.

1644
00:52:22,496 --> 00:52:23,736
- Oh, no. - What did you say?

1645
00:52:23,737 --> 00:52:26,536
No. It's 7013B.

1646
00:52:26,737 --> 00:52:28,566
- Is it... - No, I was right.

1647
00:52:28,567 --> 00:52:30,276
I was right.

1648
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:32,277
- It hasn't been a minute yet? - I was right.

1649
00:52:32,436 --> 00:52:33,706
I think I was right.

1650
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:35,975
(Flustered hands)

1651
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:37,015
- Are we in the right spot? - Yes.

1652
00:52:37,016 --> 00:52:38,546
Don't we get off at Mangwon Station?

1653
00:52:38,547 --> 00:52:40,846
I believe it's Mangwon Market.

1654
00:52:40,847 --> 00:52:42,555
I think the market is farther away.

1655
00:52:42,556 --> 00:52:44,516
From the bus stop,

1656
00:52:45,317 --> 00:52:48,185
it's a 2.5-minute walk.

1657
00:52:48,186 --> 00:52:49,395
We just have to walk 2.5 minutes.

1658
00:52:49,396 --> 00:52:50,995
Are you sure it isn't Mangwon Station?

1659
00:52:50,996 --> 00:52:53,526
It isn't Mangwon Station. We have to get off at...

1660
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:55,226
I'm so anxious today.

1661
00:52:56,036 --> 00:52:57,265
It's close to the station.

1662
00:52:57,266 --> 00:52:59,406
We have to get off at Seongsan Elementary School.

1663
00:52:59,407 --> 00:53:00,407
I see.

1664
00:53:00,408 --> 00:53:03,077
- The time... - You're being pressured by Davichi.

1665
00:53:03,277 --> 00:53:05,736
They say something right away.

1666
00:53:05,737 --> 00:53:07,076
- We nag at him too much. - The guests...

1667
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:08,406
Yes, you nag at me.

1668
00:53:08,407 --> 00:53:09,807
(Navi Yoo is pressured by the duo.)

1669
00:53:11,217 --> 00:53:12,376
Why isn't it here?

1670
00:53:13,217 --> 00:53:14,516
It's okay, Yeon Seok.

1671
00:53:15,146 --> 00:53:16,356
Don't feel anxious.

1672
00:53:17,157 --> 00:53:19,527
- It's here. - Is it 7013?

1673
00:53:19,726 --> 00:53:21,356
- It's here. - It has to be 7013B.

1674
00:53:21,956 --> 00:53:23,296
It's 7018.

1675
00:53:23,297 --> 00:53:24,656
- It's 7013B. - It's here.

1676
00:53:24,657 --> 00:53:26,466
- It's here. - Thank you, bus driver.

1677
00:53:26,467 --> 00:53:27,926
(He was scared to death and thanks the bus driver.)

1678
00:53:27,927 --> 00:53:29,066
Hello.

1679
00:53:29,067 --> 00:53:30,566
- Hello. - Hello.

1680
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:31,836
- Gosh. - This is nice.

1681
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:33,305
- It's so nice. - Gosh.

1682
00:53:33,306 --> 00:53:35,007
- Hello. - It's warm.

1683
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:36,677
- Four adults. - Hello.

1684
00:53:36,836 --> 00:53:38,076
- Hello. - Go to the back.

1685
00:53:38,077 --> 00:53:39,975
- Go to the back. - I love you so much.

1686
00:53:39,976 --> 00:53:40,976
Really?

1687
00:53:40,977 --> 00:53:42,375
You're on my phone wallpaper.

1688
00:53:42,376 --> 00:53:44,076
Gosh, you use my photo as your wallpaper?

1689
00:53:44,077 --> 00:53:45,676
- I have so many wallpapers. - Really?

1690
00:53:45,677 --> 00:53:47,277
Isn't that a photo of me in high school?

1691
00:53:49,117 --> 00:53:51,156
(She meets the Almighty Yoo.)

1692
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:52,726
You said you were my fan.

1693
00:53:52,956 --> 00:53:54,486
My husband looks like you.

1694
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:55,585
- Your husband looks like him? - Your husband?

1695
00:53:55,586 --> 00:53:56,596
Yes.

1696
00:53:56,597 --> 00:53:58,702
- Let's go to the back. - She abandoned me right away.

1697
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:01,426
This is the first time anyone on the bus showed such a big reaction.

1698
00:54:01,427 --> 00:54:03,296
- I know. - This is so nice.

1699
00:54:03,297 --> 00:54:04,336
Where are you going?

1700
00:54:04,697 --> 00:54:05,936
To a waxing salon.

1701
00:54:06,036 --> 00:54:07,106
A waxing salon?

1702
00:54:08,206 --> 00:54:09,677
- Where? - Gosh.

1703
00:54:09,836 --> 00:54:11,535
Why are you asking that?

1704
00:54:11,536 --> 00:54:13,176
I'm going to Hawaii.

1705
00:54:13,177 --> 00:54:14,177
I leave today.

1706
00:54:14,178 --> 00:54:15,346
- I see. - I see.

1707
00:54:15,347 --> 00:54:16,415
- Today... - That's why she is getting waxed.

1708
00:54:16,416 --> 00:54:18,076
You're going to Hawaii right after the wax?

1709
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:19,685
- It's necessary. - Yes, it is.

1710
00:54:19,686 --> 00:54:21,245
- It's the most important thing. - You should feel confident...

1711
00:54:21,246 --> 00:54:22,786
- when wearing a bathing suit. - Wait.

1712
00:54:23,157 --> 00:54:25,785
Have a good trip.

1713
00:54:25,786 --> 00:54:26,855
- Bye. - Thank you.

1714
00:54:26,856 --> 00:54:28,685
She's getting waxed on a cold day.

1715
00:54:28,686 --> 00:54:30,895
- Since she's going to Hawaii. - Yes, you need it.

1716
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,097
- Is that so? - Yes.

1717
00:54:32,126 --> 00:54:33,366
That was so funny.

1718
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:34,826
- Right? - She was going to a waxing salon.

1719
00:54:34,827 --> 00:54:36,395
- She didn't have to tell us. - I know.

1720
00:54:36,396 --> 00:54:37,766
Have you ever tried waxing?

1721
00:54:37,936 --> 00:54:40,237
I got it when I performed in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch."

1722
00:54:40,567 --> 00:54:43,277
So I got it for the 1st time 7 years ago.

1723
00:54:43,536 --> 00:54:45,136
- Everywhere? - I recently...

1724
00:54:45,137 --> 00:54:46,177
- What? - Everywhere?

1725
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:47,376
Just for the performance?

1726
00:54:48,277 --> 00:54:49,423
Or do you continue getting it?

1727
00:54:49,447 --> 00:54:51,416
- It's convenient. - So you continue getting it?

1728
00:54:52,686 --> 00:54:53,915
(Why are you curious about that?)

1729
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,586
Why won't you let it go?

1730
00:54:56,856 --> 00:54:59,217
They won't let go once they sink their teeth into you.

1731
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,995
Min Kyung seemed like a good cook.

1732
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:06,066
- That's right. - I like to cook.

1733
00:55:06,067 --> 00:55:07,067
You cook various dishes.
What about you, Hae Ri?

1734
00:55:08,297 --> 00:55:10,367
- I'm good at eating. - Is that so?

1735
00:55:10,567 --> 00:55:12,567
- She likes to cook too. - What is your best dish?

1736
00:55:12,867 --> 00:55:14,836
I'm good at Western dishes.

1737
00:55:15,407 --> 00:55:17,805
- Food that is cooked in the oven. - Baked dishes?

1738
00:55:17,806 --> 00:55:19,035
Dishes that look nice.

1739
00:55:19,036 --> 00:55:22,346
- People marvel at it. - It looks good when served.

1740
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:23,546
Dishes that are aesthetically good.

1741
00:55:23,547 --> 00:55:25,576
You seem vain.

1742
00:55:25,577 --> 00:55:26,785
- Yes, she is. - Right?

1743
00:55:26,786 --> 00:55:28,616
- She... - Her vanity is seen in her food.

1744
00:55:28,617 --> 00:55:30,685
- It's about the presentation. - Yes, it's about the presentation.

1745
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:32,216
- That's important. - I care about the presentation.

1746
00:55:32,217 --> 00:55:34,656
Min Kyung is devoted to her life.

1747
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:36,225
- That's right. - "Devoted."

1748
00:55:36,226 --> 00:55:38,326
- Right? - That's such a nice compliment.

1749
00:55:38,327 --> 00:55:39,796
- Right. - To be devoted.

1750
00:55:39,797 --> 00:55:42,495
- "You are devoted to your life." - You are devoted to your life.

1751
00:55:42,496 --> 00:55:44,197
(She is the icon of devotion.)

1752
00:55:44,597 --> 00:55:45,637
Let's get off.

1753
00:55:46,137 --> 00:55:47,366
- Let's get off. - Shall we?

1754
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:48,705
- Okay. - I have to swipe the card.

1755
00:55:48,706 --> 00:55:50,906
(They arrive in Mangwon-dong near the udon restaurant.)

1756
00:55:51,606 --> 00:55:53,846
- The weather is nice. - Turn left.

1757
00:55:53,847 --> 00:55:56,447
- We have to cross the street. - That's right.

1758
00:55:56,547 --> 00:55:57,646
We're here.

1759
00:55:57,746 --> 00:55:59,446
- Where is it? - Over there.

1760
00:55:59,447 --> 00:56:00,585
- What? - It's next to the blue sign.

1761
00:56:00,586 --> 00:56:02,046
It's over there.

1762
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,185
It used to be in front of the bank.

1763
00:56:03,186 --> 00:56:05,317
- Isn't that a line? - It used to be here.

1764
00:56:05,456 --> 00:56:08,586
(The wait is very long even on weekdays.)

1765
00:56:08,956 --> 00:56:09,956
Hello.

1766
00:56:09,957 --> 00:56:12,456
- Hello. - Hello.

1767
00:56:12,697 --> 00:56:14,126
There are so many people waiting.

1768
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:15,697
I haven't been here in a while.

1769
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:18,236
- I can't wait to eat it. - Hello.

1770
00:56:18,237 --> 00:56:19,383
(Communicating whenever possible)

1771
00:56:19,407 --> 00:56:20,906
They have a spicy udon.

1772
00:56:20,907 --> 00:56:22,166
- I want the spicy one. - Okay.

1773
00:56:22,907 --> 00:56:25,006
- What about you, Hae Ri? - I want the fish cake udon...

1774
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:26,375
- with additional crown daisy. - I think it's water parsley.

1775
00:56:26,376 --> 00:56:27,976
- Water parsley. - Crown daisy.

1776
00:56:28,077 --> 00:56:29,645
- Should we share a pork cutlet? - Yes.

1777
00:56:29,646 --> 00:56:31,122
- That sounds good. - Sharing one sounds good.

1778
00:56:31,146 --> 00:56:32,847
We have to pay as we order.

1779
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:34,515
- Really? - That's right.

1780
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,046
- What should we do? - Should we pay?

1781
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:37,955
- I'll pay. - No, it's okay.

1782
00:56:37,956 --> 00:56:39,586
We should play a game while waiting.

1783
00:56:39,786 --> 00:56:41,186
- To see who pays for lunch? - Yes.

1784
00:56:41,757 --> 00:56:43,225
- What game? - What game should we play?

1785
00:56:43,226 --> 00:56:45,055
- What should we play? - What's one we can play quickly?

1786
00:56:45,056 --> 00:56:46,096
(Playing a game to see who pays for lunch before eating)

1787
00:56:46,097 --> 00:56:47,196
- Rock-paper-scissors? - The game of wits?

1788
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,995
- The game of wits? - Where you stand up?

1789
00:56:48,996 --> 00:56:50,737
- Okay. - Let's squat down.

1790
00:56:50,836 --> 00:56:52,637
- Squat down. - We can sit as we go.

1791
00:56:52,967 --> 00:56:54,035
- What? - Sit down?

1792
00:56:54,036 --> 00:56:55,682
- Sit down as you say the number. - It's you, Jae Suk.

1793
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:56,806
No, wait.

1794
00:56:57,237 --> 00:56:58,776
- Thank you for the lunch. - Let's stand up as we play.

1795
00:56:58,777 --> 00:57:00,246
- Let's stand up as we play. - Okay.

1796
00:57:00,706 --> 00:57:01,906
- Let us know when to start. - We can't do it ourselves.

1797
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:03,077
Someone else has to tell us.

1798
00:57:03,177 --> 00:57:04,947
- Ready, go. - One.

1799
00:57:05,277 --> 00:57:06,416
- Two. - Three.

1800
00:57:06,717 --> 00:57:08,447
- Hey. - Thank you for the lunch.

1801
00:57:09,387 --> 00:57:11,657
(Flinching)

1802
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,585
- Thank you for the lunch. - Thank you, Hae Ri.

1803
00:57:13,586 --> 00:57:14,625
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1804
00:57:14,626 --> 00:57:16,356
There are fewer people than I thought.

1805
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:18,927
- It ended quickly. - You shouldn't wait.

1806
00:57:19,527 --> 00:57:21,996
The udon Hae Ri is buying us will be tasty.

1807
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:23,165
- Yes, that's right. - Eat a lot.

1808
00:57:23,166 --> 00:57:24,566
We should've ordered two pork cutlets.

1809
00:57:24,567 --> 00:57:26,096
- Let's do that. - Okay, order two pork cutlets.

1810
00:57:26,097 --> 00:57:27,136
We can order two.

1811
00:57:27,137 --> 00:57:29,875
This is the last show we're doing related our album.

1812
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:31,805
- One where we show our faces. - Really?

1813
00:57:31,806 --> 00:57:34,077
So we can eat all we want.

1814
00:57:34,106 --> 00:57:36,415
- This will be our cheat day. - Okay.

1815
00:57:36,416 --> 00:57:37,475
Noodles make our faces puffy.

1816
00:57:37,476 --> 00:57:39,515
What are things you can do without showing your faces?

1817
00:57:39,516 --> 00:57:40,946
Let's see.

1818
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:44,415
We might take selfies, but then we can use filters.

1819
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:46,286
Is that an official part of our schedule?

1820
00:57:46,456 --> 00:57:48,685
- Taking selfies? - Min Kyung.

1821
00:57:48,686 --> 00:57:50,526
Are taking selfies part of your official schedule?

1822
00:57:50,527 --> 00:57:51,555
(Even her team member has never heard of that.)

1823
00:57:51,556 --> 00:57:53,626
- It's a way to wrap up. - Okay.

1824
00:57:54,567 --> 00:57:56,467
I haven't been here for a few years.

1825
00:57:57,266 --> 00:57:59,097
I think a table just opened up.

1826
00:57:59,367 --> 00:58:00,436
Is it ready?

1827
00:58:01,766 --> 00:58:02,835
Hello.

1828
00:58:02,836 --> 00:58:03,906
- Is there an empty table? - That's a relief.

1829
00:58:03,907 --> 00:58:05,077
The table is ready.

1830
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:07,506
- Hello. - Hello.

1831
00:58:07,507 --> 00:58:08,746
- Enjoy your food. - Hi.

1832
00:58:09,447 --> 00:58:11,245
Hae Ri, can you pay?

1833
00:58:11,246 --> 00:58:12,915
- We have to pay first? - Okay, I see.

1834
00:58:12,916 --> 00:58:15,086
- Please pay, Hae Ri. - I'm paying today.

1835
00:58:15,887 --> 00:58:17,156
Two pork cutlets?

1836
00:58:17,157 --> 00:58:18,455
- Yes, two. - Go ahead and order.

1837
00:58:18,456 --> 00:58:19,626
Two pork cutlets,

1838
00:58:20,427 --> 00:58:24,226
four fish cake udon,

1839
00:58:24,356 --> 00:58:25,656
one with additional crown daisy.

1840
00:58:25,657 --> 00:58:27,126
How did you end up paying?

1841
00:58:27,797 --> 00:58:29,467
I lost in a game.

1842
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,395
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1843
00:58:32,396 --> 00:58:34,007
(She nonchalantly pays.)

1844
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,935
- Thanks for paying, Hae Ri. - Gosh.

1845
00:58:35,936 --> 00:58:38,006
- Thank you for the lunch. - I wish it were something pricier.

1846
00:58:38,007 --> 00:58:40,246
- Thank you, Hae Ri. - Thank you. This is great.

1847
00:58:40,907 --> 00:58:42,346
This reminds me of the old days.

1848
00:58:42,347 --> 00:58:44,177
We came when we were trainees.

1849
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:46,886
It feels like we're back after being successful.

1850
00:58:46,887 --> 00:58:48,786
How long were you trainees?

1851
00:58:48,987 --> 00:58:50,756
- It was around 3 years. - It was 3 to 4 years.

1852
00:58:50,757 --> 00:58:52,217
That's a long time.

1853
00:58:52,617 --> 00:58:53,886
- Isn't it longer than you thought? - Yes.

1854
00:58:53,887 --> 00:58:54,986
Our pork cutlet is here.

1855
00:58:54,987 --> 00:58:57,596
(The pork cutlet is served quickly.)

1856
00:58:57,597 --> 00:58:58,917
- Thank you. - It looks so tasty.

1857
00:58:59,226 --> 00:59:00,327
Let's cut it.

1858
00:59:00,427 --> 00:59:02,467
- There are two. - We can cut it.

1859
00:59:03,036 --> 00:59:04,966
(Crisp)

1860
00:59:04,967 --> 00:59:06,507
- You're energetic. - Gosh.

1861
00:59:07,266 --> 00:59:08,935
- Gosh. - It looks so good.

1862
00:59:08,936 --> 00:59:09,936
(There is no way something this crisp can taste bad.)

1863
00:59:09,937 --> 00:59:11,106
This is nice.

1864
00:59:11,876 --> 00:59:13,306
- I love it. - It smells amazing.

1865
00:59:14,206 --> 00:59:15,946
- Is this small enough? - Yes, that's good.

1866
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:17,076
- Do you like crown daisy? - I love it.

1867
00:59:17,077 --> 00:59:18,475
I like big pieces that fill my mouth.

1868
00:59:18,476 --> 00:59:19,646
- Like this? - Yes.

1869
00:59:21,947 --> 00:59:24,055
The way you cut is very different.

1870
00:59:24,056 --> 00:59:25,716
- Why? - Jae Suk cuts it like baby food.

1871
00:59:25,717 --> 00:59:27,986
- Is it because he's a dad? - Because he's a dad?

1872
00:59:27,987 --> 00:59:29,725
- The dad cuts it smaller. - This size.

1873
00:59:29,726 --> 00:59:31,757
- So it becomes a mouthful. - Yes.

1874
00:59:32,356 --> 00:59:34,366
- This one has more crown daisies. - Okay.

1875
00:59:34,367 --> 00:59:36,166
- That one is mine. - That's hers.

1876
00:59:36,896 --> 00:59:38,395
- You added crown daisy. - Yes.

1877
00:59:38,396 --> 00:59:39,716
- Thank you. - Is this size okay?

1878
00:59:40,166 --> 00:59:41,835
- Do you like crown daisy? - I love it.

1879
00:59:41,836 --> 00:59:44,335
(A bowl of udon that holds old memories)

1880
00:59:44,336 --> 00:59:46,305
- Enjoy the food. - Go ahead and eat.

1881
00:59:46,306 --> 00:59:48,547
- Thanks, Hae Ri. - Enjoy the food.

1882
00:59:49,177 --> 00:59:51,146
It tastes even better because Hae Ri paid.

1883
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:52,987
Of course.

1884
00:59:53,347 --> 00:59:55,085
- Gosh. - This looks crazy good.

1885
00:59:55,086 --> 00:59:57,387
(Warm fish cake udon that will chase away the cold)

1886
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:00,327
(She tries the broth first.)

1887
01:00:00,527 --> 01:00:02,527
- This is good on a cold day. - Is it different?

1888
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:04,156
This is insane.

1889
01:00:04,157 --> 01:00:05,895
(He eats it straight from the bowl.)

1890
01:00:05,896 --> 01:00:07,097
It's been a long time.

1891
01:00:07,467 --> 01:00:08,597
- Way too long. - Gosh.

1892
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:10,737
It tastes so good, having it after a long time.

1893
01:00:16,637 --> 01:00:19,077
(The forehead of truth)

1894
01:00:19,407 --> 01:00:21,745
Hae Ri really must've missed this.

1895
01:00:21,746 --> 01:00:22,907
It's so good.

1896
01:00:25,916 --> 01:00:27,516
Udon tastes best in the winter.

1897
01:00:28,047 --> 01:00:29,217
It warms my body.

1898
01:00:29,856 --> 01:00:31,016
I suddenly feel hot.

1899
01:00:31,456 --> 01:00:32,515
Gosh.

1900
01:00:32,516 --> 01:00:33,926
(The warmth automatically draws out an exclamation.)

1901
01:00:33,927 --> 01:00:35,027
It's so good.

1902
01:00:35,726 --> 01:00:36,856
Gosh.

1903
01:00:38,027 --> 01:00:41,197
Eating it after we waited in line...

1904
01:00:41,527 --> 01:00:43,607
and when our bodies were cold makes it taste better.

1905
01:00:43,967 --> 01:00:45,996
- It warmed me up. - It's like I'm melting.

1906
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:50,206
What are you doing?

1907
01:00:51,876 --> 01:00:53,516
- Since people might be curious. - I see.

1908
01:00:54,047 --> 01:00:55,145
You're good.

1909
01:00:55,146 --> 01:00:58,015
(A Meal in Mangwon: Pork Cutlet)

1910
01:00:58,016 --> 01:00:59,786
- I'm hot now. - Right?

1911
01:01:00,317 --> 01:01:01,447
The weird thing...

1912
01:01:01,947 --> 01:01:03,915
is that if I have it to go...

1913
01:01:03,916 --> 01:01:05,757
- It's different. - It tastes different.

1914
01:01:05,956 --> 01:01:07,026
- It is. - It's different.

1915
01:01:07,027 --> 01:01:08,186
You have to eat it here.

1916
01:01:09,456 --> 01:01:10,555
You have to eat it here.

1917
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,927
Can you just have the fish cake to go?

1918
01:01:13,197 --> 01:01:14,396
Since the noodles get soggy.

1919
01:01:14,967 --> 01:01:17,895
- You can heat it up at home. - That isn't what he meant.

1920
01:01:17,896 --> 01:01:18,966
(Firm)

1921
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:20,637
- She's firm. - You know what?

1922
01:01:21,206 --> 01:01:22,637
From what I saw,

1923
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:24,676
you don't listen to each other.

1924
01:01:24,677 --> 01:01:26,205
- You're right. - She cut you off right away.

1925
01:01:26,206 --> 01:01:27,347
- You're right. - Right?

1926
01:01:27,476 --> 01:01:28,677
She's firm.

1927
01:01:29,146 --> 01:01:30,576
- That's how we still work together. - We do it to each other.

1928
01:01:30,577 --> 01:01:32,676
- I get that. - We aren't very understanding.

1929
01:01:32,677 --> 01:01:35,487
You cut the other person off and stand your ground.

1930
01:01:36,016 --> 01:01:38,216
I think it's actually because we have the same sense of humor.

1931
01:01:38,217 --> 01:01:40,056
- That's right. - Even now.

1932
01:01:40,427 --> 01:01:42,326
- I can make fun of her, - You're right.

1933
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:45,125
And I can expect her to do the same.

1934
01:01:45,126 --> 01:01:47,866
You might laugh during the shoot,

1935
01:01:47,867 --> 01:01:49,395
but if it keeps nagging you...

1936
01:01:49,396 --> 01:01:50,765
- Right. - If you can't let it go,

1937
01:01:50,766 --> 01:01:51,966
- that means you can't get along. - If you turn it into an issue.

1938
01:01:51,967 --> 01:01:53,366
You have to know how to take a joke.

1939
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:54,436
Also,

1940
01:01:54,706 --> 01:01:56,306
even if you were okay,

1941
01:01:56,407 --> 01:01:58,406
sometimes other people ask, "Were you okay with that earlier?"

1942
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:00,776
- That happens. - That could start a fight.

1943
01:02:00,777 --> 01:02:03,217
- Some people are like that. - You sound natural saying that.

1944
01:02:04,117 --> 01:02:05,515
- Wait a second. - He got caught.

1945
01:02:05,516 --> 01:02:06,946
- You sound experienced. - He got caught.

1946
01:02:06,947 --> 01:02:08,217
He has experience.

1947
01:02:08,246 --> 01:02:09,955
- He might say that later. - Why do you sound so natural?

1948
01:02:09,956 --> 01:02:11,316
You are an unbelievable comedy duo.

1949
01:02:11,317 --> 01:02:13,827
- That was smooth. - You're an amazing comedy duo.

1950
01:02:14,327 --> 01:02:15,785
This is why you get along.

1951
01:02:15,786 --> 01:02:17,055
Even if you're okay,

1952
01:02:17,056 --> 01:02:18,625
- people around you could goad you. - Other people?

1953
01:02:18,626 --> 01:02:20,765
Then it makes you wonder if you should be upset.

1954
01:02:20,766 --> 01:02:22,125
- That's right. - Luckily,

1955
01:02:22,126 --> 01:02:24,336
we don't have anyone like that around us.

1956
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:27,866
They know we'd go after them if they tried anything funny.

1957
01:02:27,867 --> 01:02:29,205
So no one says anything bad about Hae Ri in front of me.

1958
01:02:29,206 --> 01:02:30,305
"Go after them?"

1959
01:02:30,306 --> 01:02:33,007
Let's say someone badmouthed Hae Ri in front of me.

1960
01:02:33,547 --> 01:02:34,846
Even if it's slightly insulting,

1961
01:02:34,847 --> 01:02:36,852
- You have to cut those people out. - I'd immediately...

1962
01:02:36,876 --> 01:02:38,946
- No one dares to do that. - No.

1963
01:02:38,947 --> 01:02:41,547
They don't dare to try to come between us, so it's nice.

1964
01:02:41,746 --> 01:02:43,455
They know they can't get away after trying to come between us.

1965
01:02:43,456 --> 01:02:44,685
- I see. - So it's never happened.

1966
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:46,886
They don't do it because they don't see an opportunity.

1967
01:02:47,786 --> 01:02:49,527
Hae Ri, can you tell us what it's like...

1968
01:02:49,856 --> 01:02:50,856
(Someone walks up.)

1969
01:02:50,857 --> 01:02:52,895
- being a newlywed? - What?

1970
01:02:52,896 --> 01:02:54,225
- Hang Jun. - Why? What is it?

1971
01:02:54,226 --> 01:02:55,366
- Hang Jun. - Gosh.

1972
01:02:55,367 --> 01:02:57,536
- Hello. - Hello.

1973
01:02:58,297 --> 01:03:00,536
- Hello. - Hello.

1974
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:01,866
- Hello. - Hello.

1975
01:03:01,867 --> 01:03:03,677
- Who are you here with? - What?

1976
01:03:04,007 --> 01:03:05,705
I was nearby...

1977
01:03:05,706 --> 01:03:07,077
and heard you were here.

1978
01:03:08,447 --> 01:03:10,117
- Gosh. - He's funny.

1979
01:03:10,447 --> 01:03:12,447
Yes, that's me. I'm the jokester.

1980
01:03:12,617 --> 01:03:13,986
Have a seat. Did you eat?

1981
01:03:13,987 --> 01:03:16,047
- What? I already ate. - Did you eat?

1982
01:03:16,246 --> 01:03:17,756
- We're very close friends. - I know.

1983
01:03:17,757 --> 01:03:19,256
Of course.

1984
01:03:19,257 --> 01:03:21,356
We're close.

1985
01:03:22,226 --> 01:03:24,066
Make sure to put your arm around my shoulders.

1986
01:03:24,456 --> 01:03:27,125
He's here to show off our friendship.

1987
01:03:27,126 --> 01:03:28,765
He told Jae Suk to make sure to put his arm around his shoulders.

1988
01:03:28,766 --> 01:03:30,466
- Even though he already ate, - Right.

1989
01:03:30,467 --> 01:03:32,567
- he's here to show off. - That's right.

1990
01:03:32,936 --> 01:03:34,765
- You can eat. - He wants the whole world...

1991
01:03:34,766 --> 01:03:36,286
- to know he knows me. - That's right.

1992
01:03:36,407 --> 01:03:38,737
- He wants to be on-screen with you. - I'll let you eat.

1993
01:03:38,907 --> 01:03:40,305
- Goodbye. - You can eat.

1994
01:03:40,306 --> 01:03:42,177
- Thank you. I'll call you. - Okay.

1995
01:03:42,547 --> 01:03:44,176
- I'll go visit you. - Okay.

1996
01:03:44,177 --> 01:03:45,946
Send me a coffee truck when I start filming my movie.

1997
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:47,286
Okay, I will.

1998
01:03:48,117 --> 01:03:49,717
- Bye. - That was smooth.

1999
01:03:50,387 --> 01:03:52,185
- He always asks for a coffee truck. - Yes.

2000
01:03:52,186 --> 01:03:53,356
He even calls me.

2001
01:03:53,487 --> 01:03:55,026
- He asks you to send it? - Yes.

2002
01:03:55,027 --> 01:03:57,125
(Director Jang is known for his love of coffee trucks.)

2003
01:03:57,126 --> 01:03:58,196
Then do you send him a coffee truck?

2004
01:03:58,197 --> 01:03:59,927
- Yes, I do. - Of course, he does.

2005
01:04:01,496 --> 01:04:03,197
That was a really good meal.

2006
01:04:03,637 --> 01:04:04,737
My belly is about to burst.

2007
01:04:04,936 --> 01:04:07,105
- Thank you. - Thank you for the meal.

2008
01:04:07,106 --> 01:04:08,836
- Thank you. - I ate too much.

2009
01:04:09,766 --> 01:04:11,276
Should we go have coffee?

2010
01:04:11,277 --> 01:04:13,276
We don't have much time.

2011
01:04:13,277 --> 01:04:14,876
We'll have to leave right after coffee.

2012
01:04:15,306 --> 01:04:16,617
We can buy it and go.

2013
01:04:16,847 --> 01:04:18,446
- You want to bite it? - No, get it to go.

2014
01:04:18,447 --> 01:04:21,047
- To go. - We have trouble communicating.

2015
01:04:22,286 --> 01:04:24,456
- You get annoyed easily. - Our communication is bad.

2016
01:04:25,356 --> 01:04:26,685
How did you know?

2017
01:04:26,686 --> 01:04:27,725
(Absolutely right)

2018
01:04:27,726 --> 01:04:29,186
I can see you get annoyed easily.

2019
01:04:29,686 --> 01:04:31,256
You read people quickly.

2020
01:04:31,257 --> 01:04:32,696
- I know right away. - Yes.

2021
01:04:32,697 --> 01:04:35,566
Not all ISFPs are like that,

2022
01:04:35,567 --> 01:04:37,765
but most get easily annoyed without getting truly mad.

2023
01:04:37,766 --> 01:04:39,566
- But I get over it quickly. - That's right.

2024
01:04:39,567 --> 01:04:41,366
- That's one of my strengths. - We don't linger on it.

2025
01:04:41,367 --> 01:04:42,535
You complain and forget about it.

2026
01:04:42,536 --> 01:04:43,782
- Yes, that's right. - That's right.

2027
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:45,436
It's like grumbling to yourself.

2028
01:04:45,777 --> 01:04:47,805
It's a 15-minute walk.

2029
01:04:47,806 --> 01:04:49,046
Or we could take a bus.

2030
01:04:49,047 --> 01:04:50,347
Then should we walk?

2031
01:04:50,416 --> 01:04:51,476
To digest the food?

2032
01:04:52,317 --> 01:04:53,785
- What? - The look in your eyes.

2033
01:04:53,786 --> 01:04:55,116
- What? - The look in your eyes...

2034
01:04:55,117 --> 01:04:56,585
- was telling me I was crazy. - That isn't true.

2035
01:04:56,586 --> 01:04:57,817
- That isn't true. - Then...

2036
01:04:58,056 --> 01:04:59,685
- Since we're full, - I'm so full.

2037
01:04:59,686 --> 01:05:00,955
Walking wouldn't be a bad idea.

2038
01:05:00,956 --> 01:05:02,186
And the weather is nice.

2039
01:05:04,956 --> 01:05:06,567
- The weather is nice. - Gosh.

2040
01:05:06,726 --> 01:05:07,797
I'm really full.

2041
01:05:08,626 --> 01:05:09,936
I'm so full.

2042
01:05:10,896 --> 01:05:11,936
Gosh.

2043
01:05:15,467 --> 01:05:17,436
Excuse me. Are you filming a vlog?

2044
01:05:18,237 --> 01:05:20,046
You gave me goosebumps.

2045
01:05:20,047 --> 01:05:22,246
How did you know?

2046
01:05:22,447 --> 01:05:23,745
- You were looking that way. - You keep...

2047
01:05:23,746 --> 01:05:25,276
- Why are you doing that? - Why...

2048
01:05:25,277 --> 01:05:26,816
Why are you doing that?

2049
01:05:26,817 --> 01:05:28,685
- Why are you doing that? - Why are you doing that?

2050
01:05:28,686 --> 01:05:30,285
- What? - You can just stand there...

2051
01:05:30,286 --> 01:05:32,685
- but was doing this. - You were smiling at the sun.

2052
01:05:32,686 --> 01:05:34,785
- It's like you want to be filmed. - I know.

2053
01:05:34,786 --> 01:05:36,455
- Is it a catalog shoot? - Wait.

2054
01:05:36,456 --> 01:05:37,596
(Vlog at Mangnidan-gil)

2055
01:05:37,597 --> 01:05:39,226
I got goosebumps.

2056
01:05:40,126 --> 01:05:41,327
Let's go, Yun Fat.

2057
01:05:42,467 --> 01:05:44,596
- How did you know? - Yun Fat.

2058
01:05:44,597 --> 01:05:46,535
- That's impressive. - How could I not notice?

2059
01:05:46,536 --> 01:05:48,066
- I could tell right away. - I was acting natural.

2060
01:05:48,067 --> 01:05:49,205
I thought I was acting natural.

2061
01:05:49,206 --> 01:05:50,336
This way.

2062
01:05:52,206 --> 01:05:53,407
That was hilarious.

2063
01:05:54,206 --> 01:05:55,976
You two are a duet but are very different.

2064
01:05:56,407 --> 01:05:58,246
Min Kyung lives in her own world.

2065
01:05:58,416 --> 01:05:59,817
Hae Ri lives in her own world too.

2066
01:06:00,487 --> 01:06:03,016
Are you used to these kinds of shoots, Hae Ri?

2067
01:06:03,217 --> 01:06:05,486
- No. That's why... - Taking pictures and such.

2068
01:06:05,487 --> 01:06:06,585
I'm feeling nervous today.

2069
01:06:06,586 --> 01:06:07,757
I don't know what to do.

2070
01:06:09,126 --> 01:06:11,496
- I can't do small talk. - Small talk?

2071
01:06:11,757 --> 01:06:13,696
- Min Kyung is great at small talk. - She loves small talk.

2072
01:06:13,697 --> 01:06:14,826
- She loves small talk. - She loves small talk.

2073
01:06:14,827 --> 01:06:15,895
- She's an expert. - Right.

2074
01:06:15,896 --> 01:06:17,137
I only do small talk.

2075
01:06:17,396 --> 01:06:18,836
I don't talk about deep things.

2076
01:06:18,936 --> 01:06:20,466
- About what? - Deep things.

2077
01:06:20,467 --> 01:06:22,035
- I don't talk big. - Big talk.

2078
01:06:22,036 --> 01:06:23,906
- She doesn't talk big. - Just small talk.

2079
01:06:23,907 --> 01:06:25,036
I just do small talk.

2080
01:06:27,246 --> 01:06:28,476
Gosh,

2081
01:06:28,777 --> 01:06:30,447
- it's cold in the shade. - Right.

2082
01:06:31,317 --> 01:06:32,776
Right. It's quite cold here.

2083
01:06:32,777 --> 01:06:33,846
It's cold here.

2084
01:06:33,847 --> 01:06:36,186
(Adjusting their jackets)

2085
01:06:36,646 --> 01:06:37,656
(Blowing)

2086
01:06:37,657 --> 01:06:39,916
- It's so cold! - Weren't you annoyed by the wind?

2087
01:06:40,887 --> 01:06:42,286
It's so cold!

2088
01:06:42,657 --> 01:06:43,855
- It's cold. - Hae Ri.

2089
01:06:43,856 --> 01:06:45,225
Weren't you annoyed by the wind?

2090
01:06:45,226 --> 01:06:46,296
It's so cold right now.

2091
01:06:46,297 --> 01:06:47,642
(She acknowledges that she got slightly annoyed.)

2092
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,106
Weren't you the one who got annoyed?

2093
01:06:49,726 --> 01:06:51,412
- Aren't you just like me? - You were the annoyed one.

2094
01:06:51,436 --> 01:06:52,866
He's making Hae Ri the annoyed one.

2095
01:06:52,867 --> 01:06:54,765
- He's the one that's annoyed. - Min Kyung.

2096
01:06:54,766 --> 01:06:56,206
- You're so sharp. - That was quick of you.

2097
01:06:56,207 --> 01:06:57,582
- That was quick. - You're so sharp.

2098
01:06:57,606 --> 01:07:00,045
The wind blew, and he moved his body right away.

2099
01:07:00,046 --> 01:07:01,946
- Gosh. - It's cold all of a sudden.

2100
01:07:01,947 --> 01:07:03,846
- The wind is so strong. - Right.

2101
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:06,746
A singer needs a bit of wind, though.

2102
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:08,685
You're thinking this to be some kind of vlog.

2103
01:07:08,686 --> 01:07:09,747
- Right. - Right.

2104
01:07:10,386 --> 01:07:12,855
- Aren't I right? - The wind is even used on purpose.

2105
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:14,626
The wind is even used on purpose during performances.

2106
01:07:14,627 --> 01:07:16,527
- She's driving me crazy. - Gosh.

2107
01:07:16,627 --> 01:07:18,055
- This is real. - Right.

2108
01:07:18,056 --> 01:07:19,696
- She's enjoying this. - It's real.

2109
01:07:19,697 --> 01:07:21,225
It's real for her.

2110
01:07:21,226 --> 01:07:22,795
Did you think it was fake, then?

2111
01:07:22,796 --> 01:07:24,067
She's amazing.

2112
01:07:25,337 --> 01:07:27,706
There are Christmas ornaments everywhere.

2113
01:07:27,707 --> 01:07:29,336
- Right. It's the end of the year. - It has begun.

2114
01:07:29,337 --> 01:07:31,036
- Gosh. - I should set up a tree.

2115
01:07:31,037 --> 01:07:32,106
Me too.

2116
01:07:32,407 --> 01:07:34,145
Let's sing a carol for them.

2117
01:07:34,146 --> 01:07:35,246
- A carol? - Sing a carol for us.

2118
01:07:35,247 --> 01:07:36,346
In 1, 2, 3, 4.

2119
01:07:36,407 --> 01:07:38,346
- Jingle bells - Last Christmas

2120
01:07:39,277 --> 01:07:41,197
- That was the worst. - That was just the worst.

2121
01:07:41,447 --> 01:07:42,715
- Let's sing "Last Christmas." - Gosh.

2122
01:07:42,716 --> 01:07:44,286
- You two are... - Just now,

2123
01:07:44,287 --> 01:07:46,516
- I was so excited to listen... - Hae Ri.

2124
01:07:46,686 --> 01:07:48,456
To the duo with 17 years of experience.

2125
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:51,997
"Jingle Bells" is something that we sing.

2126
01:07:52,226 --> 01:07:55,066
- It's not a Davichi song. - Gosh.

2127
01:07:55,067 --> 01:07:57,237
I'm sorry. Let's go with "Last Christmas."

2128
01:07:57,337 --> 01:07:59,337
- In, 1, 2, 3, 4. - In, 1, 2, 3, 4.

2129
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:07,777
They're amazing.

2130
01:08:09,447 --> 01:08:10,475
They're amazing.

2131
01:08:10,476 --> 01:08:13,886
(Davichi's year-end gift)

2132
01:08:14,186 --> 01:08:15,817
Gosh.

2133
01:08:16,046 --> 01:08:17,385
- Gosh. - They're amazing.

2134
01:08:17,386 --> 01:08:19,055
(It ends with the endless love for the camera.)

2135
01:08:19,056 --> 01:08:20,755
She's at it again.

2136
01:08:20,756 --> 01:08:22,056
She's amazing.

2137
01:08:22,657 --> 01:08:23,657
(Looking around)

2138
01:08:23,658 --> 01:08:25,055
Hold on.

2139
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:26,416
- I think we're here. - It's here?

2140
01:08:26,657 --> 01:08:29,327
"Come in through the door with a chick on it."

2141
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:31,996
Kwak Ji Hye and Lee Young Jin.

2142
01:08:31,997 --> 01:08:33,237
There are two of them.

2143
01:08:34,207 --> 01:08:37,536
"Hola! We have completely opposite MBTIs,"

2144
01:08:37,537 --> 01:08:39,853
"but we are a husband and wife that have perfect chemistry."

2145
01:08:39,877 --> 01:08:43,006
"With the wife's suggestion of getting married in a month,"

2146
01:08:43,176 --> 01:08:44,946
"the two of us got married just after a month."

2147
01:08:44,947 --> 01:08:47,486
"Please congratulate us on our wedding anniversary."

2148
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,146
Really? It's their wedding anniversary?

2149
01:08:49,287 --> 01:08:51,056
It's their wedding anniversary today.

2150
01:08:51,216 --> 01:08:52,755
- Today? - They are a married couple.

2151
01:08:52,756 --> 01:08:53,787
Can we go empty-handed?

2152
01:08:54,926 --> 01:08:56,425
- We can win them presents. - We'll be getting them presents.

2153
01:08:56,426 --> 01:08:57,772
Let's make sure to get them presents.

2154
01:08:57,796 --> 01:08:59,255
- We should get them presents. - We should.

2155
01:08:59,256 --> 01:09:00,697
- We can get them presents. - Okay.

2156
01:09:00,966 --> 01:09:02,196
- Here? - It's right here.

2157
01:09:02,197 --> 01:09:04,567
- They're right here. - Kwak Ji Hye and Lee Young Jin.

2158
01:09:04,837 --> 01:09:07,567
- Hello. - Hello.

2159
01:09:07,636 --> 01:09:09,536
- Hello. - It's so pretty.

2160
01:09:09,537 --> 01:09:11,337
- Gosh! - Hello.

2161
01:09:11,436 --> 01:09:12,706
Kwak Ji Hye and Lee Young Jin?

2162
01:09:12,707 --> 01:09:14,447
- Yes. That's us. - Yes! That's us!

2163
01:09:15,676 --> 01:09:19,546
(Lee Young Jin and Kwak Ji Hye, the second Whenever Guests)

2164
01:09:20,487 --> 01:09:21,516
This is amazing!

2165
01:09:22,646 --> 01:09:24,806
- Is this a bar? A wine bar? - It's Christmas in here.

2166
01:09:24,856 --> 01:09:26,316
- It really is. - It's a tapas bar.

2167
01:09:26,317 --> 01:09:27,855
- A tapas bar? - Yes. A Spanish tapas bar.

2168
01:09:27,856 --> 01:09:28,956
- It's a Spanish restaurant. - Spanish tapas.

2169
01:09:28,957 --> 01:09:30,026
- Tapas. - Right.

2170
01:09:30,027 --> 01:09:31,555
- It's great here. - Gosh.

2171
01:09:31,556 --> 01:09:34,196
It feels perfect for Christmas in here.

2172
01:09:34,197 --> 01:09:36,697
It's great, isn't it? I made this place look like this.

2173
01:09:36,896 --> 01:09:38,466
It's so pretty.

2174
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:40,805
- It's so pretty. - It's so pretty.

2175
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:41,936
Thank you.

2176
01:09:42,506 --> 01:09:46,257
This place is full of Christmas vibes, isn't it?

2177
01:09:46,337 --> 01:09:48,846
Thank you for noticing my effort.

2178
01:09:49,146 --> 01:09:52,116
How long do you keep up all of these ornaments?

2179
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:54,685
I keep them up as long as possible,

2180
01:09:54,686 --> 01:09:56,957
- and take them down around Seollal. - Right!

2181
01:09:57,117 --> 01:09:59,386
- Around Seollal. - Right!

2182
01:09:59,617 --> 01:10:00,956
This is what everyone does.

2183
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:02,855
- Everyone is the same. - Everyone is the same.

2184
01:10:02,856 --> 01:10:05,416
- That's when I take them down. - They're taken down at Seollal.

2185
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:08,626
So this is a Spanish tapas bar.

2186
01:10:08,627 --> 01:10:11,567
How did you get the idea to open up a place like this?

2187
01:10:11,636 --> 01:10:13,836
My husband was an experienced chef.

2188
01:10:13,837 --> 01:10:16,336
He kept working as a chef.

2189
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,436
- I see. - And last year,

2190
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:22,006
we went to Spain on our honeymoon.

2191
01:10:22,407 --> 01:10:24,876
There's a map of Barcelona right there.

2192
01:10:24,877 --> 01:10:27,645
Right. We put up the pictures we took there.

2193
01:10:27,646 --> 01:10:28,986
- Right. - Right.

2194
01:10:28,987 --> 01:10:31,356
- Did you take them yourself? - Yes.

2195
01:10:31,417 --> 01:10:32,885
They are placed at each spot?

2196
01:10:32,886 --> 01:10:33,986
- Yes. - Yes.

2197
01:10:33,987 --> 01:10:36,885
We took pictures and tried the food,

2198
01:10:36,886 --> 01:10:38,496
- and we loved it so much. - It must've been a great moment.

2199
01:10:38,497 --> 01:10:41,265
This is what we loved about the tapas bar.

2200
01:10:41,266 --> 01:10:44,836
People went in and out to meet people comfortably...

2201
01:10:44,837 --> 01:10:47,306
and enjoyed the food and drinks together.

2202
01:10:47,407 --> 01:10:50,066
So we decided to make our own tapas bar...

2203
01:10:50,067 --> 01:10:52,537
- in Korea. - What a great idea.

2204
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:56,006
Then do you make all of the tapas dishes...

2205
01:10:56,146 --> 01:10:58,145
- all on your own? - Yes. I do the cooking,

2206
01:10:58,146 --> 01:10:59,515
- She does the serving. - and she does the serving.

2207
01:10:59,516 --> 01:11:00,996
- I'm in charge of the hall. - I see.

2208
01:11:01,046 --> 01:11:03,386
How long has it been since you two have been married?

2209
01:11:03,487 --> 01:11:04,685
- It has been 4 years. - It has been 4 years?

2210
01:11:04,686 --> 01:11:05,715
I see.

2211
01:11:05,716 --> 01:11:07,086
In the letter, it said that...

2212
01:11:07,087 --> 01:11:08,855
that you two got married...

2213
01:11:08,856 --> 01:11:10,026
after a month of bringing up that idea.

2214
01:11:10,027 --> 01:11:11,027
Right.

2215
01:11:11,028 --> 01:11:12,133
- Things were done really quickly. - Right.

2216
01:11:12,157 --> 01:11:14,425
We did see each other for quite a while,

2217
01:11:14,426 --> 01:11:16,965
but he never talked about getting married. So...

2218
01:11:16,966 --> 01:11:18,596
(Feeling guilty)

2219
01:11:18,796 --> 01:11:20,996
Right. It was the wife that brought it up first, right?

2220
01:11:21,106 --> 01:11:23,566
- And... - She couldn't wait any longer.

2221
01:11:23,567 --> 01:11:26,707
I didn't want the year to pass before getting married.

2222
01:11:27,306 --> 01:11:29,376
"I want to get married this year."

2223
01:11:29,377 --> 01:11:31,247
"Should we get married next month?"

2224
01:11:31,747 --> 01:11:33,293
- She's really bold. - It was super-fast.

2225
01:11:33,317 --> 01:11:34,947
- So what did you say? - Well,

2226
01:11:35,046 --> 01:11:37,015
she said, "I want to get married next month."

2227
01:11:37,016 --> 01:11:38,516
So I asked, "When next month?"

2228
01:11:38,886 --> 01:11:40,855
She said that she wanted to get married on November 21.

2229
01:11:40,856 --> 01:11:43,457
She asked to get married on a specific date,

2230
01:11:43,627 --> 01:11:45,926
so I asked why, and this is what she said.

2231
01:11:46,127 --> 01:11:48,566
"I want to get married on the date when 1 and 1 get together,"

2232
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:49,567
"and 2 become 1."

2233
01:11:50,396 --> 01:11:51,396
(Grasping her hands)

2234
01:11:51,397 --> 01:11:53,337
(Goodness)

2235
01:11:53,636 --> 01:11:54,636
She likes adding meaning to things.
I love doing that.

2236
01:11:55,637 --> 01:11:56,736
- Adding meaning to things? - Yes.

2237
01:11:56,737 --> 01:11:57,975
"The date when 1 and 1 get together,"

2238
01:11:57,976 --> 01:11:59,737
- "and 2 become 1." - "And 2 become 1."

2239
01:12:01,146 --> 01:12:02,146
(Laughing)

2240
01:12:03,077 --> 01:12:05,215
(Feeling tingly)

2241
01:12:05,216 --> 01:12:06,747
- Gosh. - That's so touching.

2242
01:12:07,447 --> 01:12:09,215
(Struggling with the cringe)

2243
01:12:09,216 --> 01:12:10,457
That's just amazing.

2244
01:12:10,556 --> 01:12:12,056
(On the other hand, )

2245
01:12:12,487 --> 01:12:14,956
(Min Kyung seems to feel touched.)

2246
01:12:14,957 --> 01:12:16,256
That's so touching.

2247
01:12:16,287 --> 01:12:17,967
I didn't want to move on to the next year.

2248
01:12:18,856 --> 01:12:21,567
(She's so impressive.)

2249
01:12:21,896 --> 01:12:24,567
The meaning behind it struck my heart.

2250
01:12:25,697 --> 01:12:26,795
- It's meaningful, isn't it? - She must like adding meaning too.

2251
01:12:26,796 --> 01:12:28,435
- That sounded so beautiful. - Right?

2252
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:30,196
How did you feel after hearing her say this?

2253
01:12:30,636 --> 01:12:34,407
I did feel a bit flustered as we had to get it done really quickly,

2254
01:12:34,546 --> 01:12:37,577
but she regularly asked for unreasonable things to be done.

2255
01:12:38,447 --> 01:12:39,515
(Bringing down the touching moment)

2256
01:12:39,516 --> 01:12:40,846
These two are so different.

2257
01:12:40,987 --> 01:12:42,486
- These two are different. - Completely different.

2258
01:12:42,487 --> 01:12:44,185
- They're opposites. - Right.

2259
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:46,316
She smells a bit like me.

2260
01:12:46,317 --> 01:12:48,157
- Right. - Are you an ENFP?

2261
01:12:48,457 --> 01:12:49,486
Yes.

2262
01:12:49,487 --> 01:12:50,826
She reminded me of Min Kyung.

2263
01:12:50,827 --> 01:12:52,987
She smelled like Min Kyung when we greeted each other.

2264
01:12:53,226 --> 01:12:55,095
- Right at the entrance. - She reminded us of Min Kyung.

2265
01:12:55,096 --> 01:12:56,127
Right.

2266
01:12:56,226 --> 01:12:58,567
She reminded me of myself the more I saw her.

2267
01:12:58,997 --> 01:13:01,366
Ji Hye looks really bright.

2268
01:13:01,367 --> 01:13:03,236
Right. She really makes other people feel happy.

2269
01:13:03,237 --> 01:13:04,736
I'm so excited right now.

2270
01:13:04,737 --> 01:13:06,336
- Right. - I can tell.

2271
01:13:06,337 --> 01:13:08,145
- She's like the sun. - Right.

2272
01:13:08,146 --> 01:13:11,015
- She's like the sun. - Seriously.

2273
01:13:11,016 --> 01:13:13,846
You know the Sun Baby from "Teletubbies," right?

2274
01:13:14,386 --> 01:13:15,747
That's what she's like.

2275
01:13:16,787 --> 01:13:19,486
- The sun in the show. - The sun from "Teletubbies."

2276
01:13:19,487 --> 01:13:21,356
- The Sun Baby. - Right.

2277
01:13:21,487 --> 01:13:24,127
- She has such a pure smile. - Right.

2278
01:13:25,657 --> 01:13:27,367
The Sun Baby from "Teletubbies."

2279
01:13:28,226 --> 01:13:30,935
I heard that your MBTI types were complete opposites.

2280
01:13:30,936 --> 01:13:31,936
(If the husband's MBTI type is the complete opposite...)

2281
01:13:31,937 --> 01:13:34,037
- Are you a J? - You're an ISTJ, right?

2282
01:13:35,306 --> 01:13:36,805
Right. I am an ISTJ.

2283
01:13:36,806 --> 01:13:38,635
- The complete opposite. - The complete opposite.

2284
01:13:38,636 --> 01:13:40,305
- It's the complete opposite. - Right.

2285
01:13:40,306 --> 01:13:42,345
- The complete opposite. - All of a sudden,

2286
01:13:42,346 --> 01:13:44,616
she asked to get married on November 21.

2287
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:47,447
So the husband must have felt flustered as a planner.

2288
01:13:47,546 --> 01:13:49,747
So whenever...

2289
01:13:50,287 --> 01:13:52,586
- I had no plans, - You never moved.

2290
01:13:52,587 --> 01:13:54,156
- I didn't move. - You didn't take it to action.

2291
01:13:54,157 --> 01:13:55,786
And it was such a short time to prepare for it.

2292
01:13:55,787 --> 01:13:57,326
Right. I felt really stressed when things weren't planned.

2293
01:13:57,327 --> 01:14:00,126
After meeting her, I let go of a lot of those things.

2294
01:14:00,127 --> 01:14:02,395
- That's the way to go. - That's love.

2295
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:04,066
Doing that freed me from getting stressed...

2296
01:14:04,067 --> 01:14:05,067
- and prevented fights. - That is how you can live.

2297
01:14:05,068 --> 01:14:06,296
- That's true love. - Right.

2298
01:14:06,466 --> 01:14:08,505
It must be your wedding anniversary soon.

2299
01:14:08,506 --> 01:14:10,005
- Has it already passed? - It was yesterday.

2300
01:14:10,006 --> 01:14:11,037
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2301
01:14:11,476 --> 01:14:13,005
Congratulations!

2302
01:14:13,006 --> 01:14:16,175
Was the reason you sent in your letter...

2303
01:14:16,176 --> 01:14:18,175
because of your wedding anniversary?

2304
01:14:18,176 --> 01:14:20,276
Yes. I was a big fan of the show,

2305
01:14:20,277 --> 01:14:21,986
and our wedding anniversary was approaching.

2306
01:14:21,987 --> 01:14:24,356
I'm someone who loves adding meaning to things, after all.

2307
01:14:25,417 --> 01:14:27,162
I wanted to spend our anniversary in a special way.

2308
01:14:27,186 --> 01:14:29,326
I thought about how we could spend...

2309
01:14:29,327 --> 01:14:30,826
our wedding anniversary in a special way.

2310
01:14:30,827 --> 01:14:33,355
She's always thinking about these sorts of things.

2311
01:14:33,356 --> 01:14:35,626
Always. "Should we look up plane tickets?"

2312
01:14:35,627 --> 01:14:37,696
"Where should we go? Are you okay with this date?"

2313
01:14:37,697 --> 01:14:38,697
I'm always like that.

2314
01:14:38,698 --> 01:14:41,167
She talks just like you.

2315
01:14:41,306 --> 01:14:43,166
- I feel so comfortable. - She's just nodding.

2316
01:14:43,167 --> 01:14:44,447
I feel so comfortable right now.

2317
01:14:44,537 --> 01:14:46,675
I'm so happy to meet a fellow species.

2318
01:14:46,676 --> 01:14:48,106
Thank you.

2319
01:14:48,707 --> 01:14:50,175
Min Kyung loves wine.

2320
01:14:50,176 --> 01:14:52,645
I love wine. Especially Spanish wine.

2321
01:14:52,646 --> 01:14:54,917
- Really? - Spicy Spanish wine.

2322
01:14:55,016 --> 01:14:56,746
- They're really good. - Right.

2323
01:14:56,747 --> 01:14:57,786
I love Cava.

2324
01:14:57,787 --> 01:14:59,855
- Cava is amazing. - Cava is amazing.

2325
01:14:59,856 --> 01:15:01,755
Cava is a great one too.

2326
01:15:01,756 --> 01:15:03,225
Look at the husband's face.

2327
01:15:03,226 --> 01:15:04,497
(Looking exhausted)

2328
01:15:04,756 --> 01:15:08,226
These two are just the same.

2329
01:15:09,266 --> 01:15:12,395
- It isn't easy for him. - Right.

2330
01:15:12,396 --> 01:15:14,366
- She's comfortable. - But you really brighten me up.

2331
01:15:14,367 --> 01:15:16,567
- Really? That's a relief. - But why get upset with me?

2332
01:15:18,537 --> 01:15:20,746
(Feeling very disappointed)

2333
01:15:20,747 --> 01:15:22,846
You were annoyed with me all the time.

2334
01:15:23,046 --> 01:15:24,975
- She's a bit different. - Right.

2335
01:15:24,976 --> 01:15:27,516
- That's a relief. - I think we have four MCs today.

2336
01:15:28,587 --> 01:15:30,855
- They're amazing. - They're an amazing duo.

2337
01:15:30,856 --> 01:15:32,215
- Gosh, this is hilarious. - Great.

2338
01:15:32,216 --> 01:15:34,355
You two are so different.

2339
01:15:34,356 --> 01:15:36,287
How did you first meet each other?

2340
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:38,526
We met each other through a dating app.

2341
01:15:38,527 --> 01:15:39,627
- What? - What?

2342
01:15:40,697 --> 01:15:43,367
- That's fascinating. - Through a dating app?

2343
01:15:43,766 --> 01:15:45,135
Was it based on the people around your area?

2344
01:15:45,136 --> 01:15:47,406
Right. It's specified by a specific distance.

2345
01:15:47,407 --> 01:15:48,506
There is such an app?

2346
01:15:48,907 --> 01:15:50,037
- You didn't know? - No.

2347
01:15:50,266 --> 01:15:51,805
It's based on the distance.

2348
01:15:51,806 --> 01:15:52,837
That's amazing!

2349
01:15:53,407 --> 01:15:54,946
Why? Are you going to try...

2350
01:15:54,947 --> 01:15:56,377
- using it now? - No!

2351
01:15:56,606 --> 01:15:58,076
- You knew it too late. - Why do you sound so interested?

2352
01:15:58,077 --> 01:15:59,377
That's amazing!

2353
01:15:59,546 --> 01:16:01,316
Those kind of people nearby just meet each other?

2354
01:16:01,317 --> 01:16:03,397
I don't think that's the right way to refer to them.

2355
01:16:03,587 --> 01:16:06,117
- So... - It's not those kind of people.

2356
01:16:06,516 --> 01:16:07,725
- So... - It's not just anyone.

2357
01:16:07,726 --> 01:16:09,425
- The people who have the apps. - The ones with the apps.

2358
01:16:09,426 --> 01:16:12,126
- Those people who have the apps. - Right.

2359
01:16:12,127 --> 01:16:14,126
- That wasn't what I meant to say. - Right.

2360
01:16:14,127 --> 01:16:15,595
- You saw his profile picture? - Yes.

2361
01:16:15,596 --> 01:16:17,225
- But he could have been different. - The profile?

2362
01:16:17,226 --> 01:16:18,795
- Right. - But how was he?

2363
01:16:18,796 --> 01:16:22,265
He had a picture of him cooking.

2364
01:16:22,266 --> 01:16:24,336
People usually use pictures of their specialty.

2365
01:16:24,337 --> 01:16:25,376
- Right. - Right.

2366
01:16:25,377 --> 01:16:27,746
"A man who cooks? A chef?"

2367
01:16:27,747 --> 01:16:29,747
- "I'm getting curious." - What was your picture?

2368
01:16:30,447 --> 01:16:31,976
What was your picture?

2369
01:16:32,216 --> 01:16:33,845
She was at the beach.

2370
01:16:33,846 --> 01:16:35,286
- I was smiling brightly. - Right.

2371
01:16:35,287 --> 01:16:37,385
- Smiling brightly at the beach? - Right.

2372
01:16:37,386 --> 01:16:39,917
- Were you in your swimsuit? - No.

2373
01:16:40,056 --> 01:16:42,186
- She was wearing hotpants. - "Hotpants?"

2374
01:16:42,686 --> 01:16:45,395
- He remembers it perfectly. - Right.

2375
01:16:45,396 --> 01:16:47,666
The husband was cooking.

2376
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,095
- She was wearing hotpants. - The wife was wearing hotpants.

2377
01:16:49,096 --> 01:16:50,997
- Hotpants at the beach. - Hotpants.

2378
01:16:51,136 --> 01:16:54,036
- You didn't talk about your pants. - Gosh.

2379
01:16:54,037 --> 01:16:55,667
You only mentioned your bright smile.

2380
01:16:56,567 --> 01:16:59,537
You said that you liked how bright I looked.

2381
01:16:59,676 --> 01:17:02,777
Gosh. She didn't bring that up at all.

2382
01:17:03,306 --> 01:17:05,416
She's so bright, though.

2383
01:17:05,417 --> 01:17:08,045
It's better than being blunt and sensitive all the time.

2384
01:17:08,046 --> 01:17:09,416
- Right. - She gives off a bright energy.

2385
01:17:09,417 --> 01:17:11,286
That was why I thought I would feel happy...

2386
01:17:11,287 --> 01:17:13,316
- after getting married to her. - Right.

2387
01:17:13,317 --> 01:17:14,526
It has been four years since you got married.

2388
01:17:14,527 --> 01:17:15,556
How was it for you?

2389
01:17:15,756 --> 01:17:16,855
(Expectant)

2390
01:17:16,856 --> 01:17:18,556
It wasn't always easy.

2391
01:17:19,396 --> 01:17:22,066
He gave an unexpected answer right away.

2392
01:17:22,067 --> 01:17:23,426
Gosh.

2393
01:17:23,697 --> 01:17:26,636
You're right. Marriage isn't easy.

2394
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:28,536
He's so honest.

2395
01:17:28,537 --> 01:17:31,105
We found the same hobby with camping.

2396
01:17:31,106 --> 01:17:32,836
- Camping? - Yes.

2397
01:17:32,837 --> 01:17:34,845
- Camping isn't easy. - We go camping.

2398
01:17:34,846 --> 01:17:36,605
I'm someone who likes going outside,

2399
01:17:36,606 --> 01:17:38,576
- and he's someone... - I like staying at home.

2400
01:17:38,577 --> 01:17:39,715
Who likes staying at home.

2401
01:17:39,716 --> 01:17:42,916
But when we go camping, we can make our own home...

2402
01:17:42,917 --> 01:17:44,255
that is outside.

2403
01:17:44,256 --> 01:17:45,855
- That's a good idea. - That works.

2404
01:17:45,856 --> 01:17:46,885
It worked well with us.

2405
01:17:46,886 --> 01:17:49,026
- Camping reveals one's personality. - Right.

2406
01:17:49,027 --> 01:17:50,656
I heard there's a lot of fighting during a camping trip.

2407
01:17:50,657 --> 01:17:51,826
It's impossible not to fight.

2408
01:17:51,827 --> 01:17:54,295
I like organizing things and setting things up.

2409
01:17:54,296 --> 01:17:55,796
- You organize things. - Yes.

2410
01:17:55,896 --> 01:17:57,496
I'm just the one who sets off.

2411
01:17:57,497 --> 01:17:59,136
(She's in charge of going.)

2412
01:17:59,237 --> 01:18:01,207
- That's simple. - "Let's go!"

2413
01:18:01,466 --> 01:18:04,276
We should start with the game now.

2414
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:05,805
- Right. - It's their wedding anniversary,

2415
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,105
so we really want to get them a present.

2416
01:18:07,106 --> 01:18:09,346
- Let's make sure to do well. - Let's go!

2417
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,476
Right.

2418
01:18:10,577 --> 01:18:12,117
We have to do well.

2419
01:18:12,277 --> 01:18:14,816
Open the fortune cookie for Round One,

2420
01:18:14,817 --> 01:18:16,746
- and you'll find the present. - Her hand went in right away.

2421
01:18:16,747 --> 01:18:17,885
(She splits open the cookie as if it's a grilled sweet potato.)

2422
01:18:17,886 --> 01:18:20,055
There wasn't even an inch of hesitation.

2423
01:18:20,056 --> 01:18:21,087
Read it for us.

2424
01:18:22,027 --> 01:18:23,885
- Gosh. - "As a couple or with friends."

2425
01:18:23,886 --> 01:18:25,756
"It's great to drink with others."

2426
01:18:26,127 --> 01:18:27,697
It's a wine cellar! No way.

2427
01:18:27,726 --> 01:18:29,166
- A wine cellar? - A wine cellar!

2428
01:18:29,167 --> 01:18:30,366
You don't have a wine cellar?

2429
01:18:30,367 --> 01:18:32,136
- We don't. - Gosh!

2430
01:18:32,396 --> 01:18:33,866
- A wine cellar? - Gosh!

2431
01:18:33,867 --> 01:18:35,736
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2432
01:18:35,737 --> 01:18:37,777
- Gosh! - It's a perfect present for them.

2433
01:18:37,877 --> 01:18:40,276
Our show brings presents that are useful for the guests.

2434
01:18:40,277 --> 01:18:41,576
That's amazing!

2435
01:18:41,577 --> 01:18:42,805
- Gosh! - We'll make sure to win it.

2436
01:18:42,806 --> 01:18:45,446
- All right. It's a wine cellar. - Let's do our best!

2437
01:18:45,447 --> 01:18:47,916
(Poke Poke Fork Fork)

2438
01:18:47,917 --> 01:18:51,055
(Spin the 50-cent coin...)

2439
01:18:51,056 --> 01:18:53,916
(and poke it with the fork.)

2440
01:18:53,917 --> 01:18:56,957
(Just 1 out of 4 has to succeed.)

2441
01:18:57,527 --> 01:18:59,156
- What? - So...

2442
01:18:59,157 --> 01:19:00,255
just 1 has to succeed out of the 4 of us?

2443
01:19:00,256 --> 01:19:01,326
That's right.

2444
01:19:01,327 --> 01:19:02,896
We get 20 seconds for the 4 of us?

2445
01:19:03,127 --> 01:19:04,496
How can we do it in 20 seconds?

2446
01:19:04,497 --> 01:19:06,097
We can only use five seconds each, then?

2447
01:19:06,766 --> 01:19:08,666
- Let's give it a try. - Hold on.

2448
01:19:08,667 --> 01:19:10,306
- We have to take turns. - Right.

2449
01:19:11,136 --> 01:19:13,077
- Can we practice? - We can.

2450
01:19:13,237 --> 01:19:14,675
We have to do this.

2451
01:19:14,676 --> 01:19:15,946
How do you spin the coin?

2452
01:19:15,947 --> 01:19:18,447
- You have to hit it. Look. - Like this.

2453
01:19:19,016 --> 01:19:21,046
(After spinning the coin first, )

2454
01:19:21,587 --> 01:19:22,816
(you must poke it with the fork to succeed.)

2455
01:19:22,817 --> 01:19:24,116
- I think you can do it. - Gosh.

2456
01:19:24,117 --> 01:19:25,997
- This is hard. - Hold it like this and hit it.

2457
01:19:26,886 --> 01:19:29,287
(It's hard to poke it with the fork.)

2458
01:19:29,487 --> 01:19:30,586
- I think you can do it. - Gosh.

2459
01:19:30,587 --> 01:19:32,527
- This is hard. - Hold it like this and hit it.

2460
01:19:32,756 --> 01:19:34,795
- Hold it like this? - This doesn't look easy.

2461
01:19:34,796 --> 01:19:36,027
It's really hard.

2462
01:19:36,367 --> 01:19:37,566
- I can't even keep it up. - Should it be poked...

2463
01:19:37,567 --> 01:19:38,567
right before it collapses?

2464
01:19:38,568 --> 01:19:40,567
- That's how you do it. - Right? No.

2465
01:19:40,936 --> 01:19:42,406
- Stay still! - Gosh.

2466
01:19:42,407 --> 01:19:43,466
My hand was right there.

2467
01:19:43,636 --> 01:19:45,377
My hand was right there, Min Kyung.

2468
01:19:45,577 --> 01:19:47,006
(Being hasty)

2469
01:19:47,207 --> 01:19:48,277
Just like that.

2470
01:19:49,176 --> 01:19:50,916
It won't work if it's too slanted.

2471
01:19:50,917 --> 01:19:52,117
How does it spin like that?

2472
01:19:52,447 --> 01:19:53,645
- Gosh, it won't work. - Oh, no.

2473
01:19:53,646 --> 01:19:54,816
- How do we do this? - How do we do this?

2474
01:19:54,817 --> 01:19:57,416
- This won't work. - How do we do this?

2475
01:19:57,417 --> 01:19:58,556
It's just pure luck.

2476
01:19:59,356 --> 01:20:00,616
(Failing)

2477
01:20:00,617 --> 01:20:01,977
- It's too hard. - Will this work?

2478
01:20:03,226 --> 01:20:05,157
(Frustrated)

2479
01:20:05,497 --> 01:20:07,257
Spreading out the fork could be a good idea.

2480
01:20:07,466 --> 01:20:09,066
You should spread out the fork.

2481
01:20:09,067 --> 01:20:10,507
- Should I spread it? - Around here!

2482
01:20:13,337 --> 01:20:15,606
(He's spreading out the fork.)

2483
01:20:17,367 --> 01:20:20,407
Isn't that cheating, Jae Suk? How can you spread it out?

2484
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:22,746
- Gosh, it's a mess here. - Here.

2485
01:20:22,747 --> 01:20:23,777
That's mine!

2486
01:20:24,377 --> 01:20:25,475
- Gosh, it's a mess here. - Here.

2487
01:20:25,476 --> 01:20:26,546
That's mine!

2488
01:20:27,987 --> 01:20:29,015
Stop annoying me.

2489
01:20:29,016 --> 01:20:30,246
(Annoyance warning)

2490
01:20:30,247 --> 01:20:32,417
- Don't cross the line. - I'm getting annoyed now.

2491
01:20:33,487 --> 01:20:35,555
Gosh, this is hard.

2492
01:20:35,556 --> 01:20:37,555
- Seriously. It's luck. - It seems doable, though.

2493
01:20:37,556 --> 01:20:39,156
- Let's go for it. - Let's make it work.

2494
01:20:39,157 --> 01:20:40,226
Let's give it a try.

2495
01:20:43,867 --> 01:20:44,935
- You did it. - That was nice.

2496
01:20:44,936 --> 01:20:46,696
- That's a good method. - Going down slowly.

2497
01:20:48,067 --> 01:20:50,135
(Going down slowly)

2498
01:20:50,136 --> 01:20:52,175
(She got the coin accurately.)

2499
01:20:52,176 --> 01:20:53,836
- That's a good method. - Going down slowly.

2500
01:20:53,837 --> 01:20:55,246
Right! Going down slowly.

2501
01:20:55,247 --> 01:20:56,475
- Going down smoothly. - That was nice, right?

2502
01:20:56,476 --> 01:20:57,756
- Give it a try. - Take it slow.

2503
01:20:58,016 --> 01:21:01,046
You have to be gentle with it. Gentle.

2504
01:21:01,186 --> 01:21:02,947
You have to be gentle with it. Gentle.

2505
01:21:05,686 --> 01:21:08,225
- "Gentle." - "Gentle."

2506
01:21:08,226 --> 01:21:09,855
- Poke it as if it's a cake. - Right.

2507
01:21:09,856 --> 01:21:12,126
- Gentle. - Gentle.

2508
01:21:12,127 --> 01:21:13,725
- No. - Gentle.

2509
01:21:13,726 --> 01:21:14,926
It's running away.

2510
01:21:15,796 --> 01:21:17,667
It won't work for sure if it's done too hard.

2511
01:21:18,296 --> 01:21:19,895
- It can't be poked too hard. - It can't be poked too hard.

2512
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:21,265
- It can't be poked too hard. - Right before it falls...

2513
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:22,667
when it's slow.

2514
01:21:23,306 --> 01:21:24,975
It won't work when it's right about to fall.

2515
01:21:24,976 --> 01:21:26,656
- That won't work. - It can't be too slow.

2516
01:21:26,936 --> 01:21:28,947
You really can't do it.

2517
01:21:29,247 --> 01:21:31,676
Look at this! I did it again!

2518
01:21:31,877 --> 01:21:33,577
You really can't do it.

2519
01:21:33,947 --> 01:21:36,487
Look at this! I did it again!

2520
01:21:38,617 --> 01:21:40,756
(She managed to succeed again by going down slowly.)

2521
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:43,225
- This is your game. - You should do it.

2522
01:21:43,226 --> 01:21:44,725
We should go with this feeling right away.

2523
01:21:44,726 --> 01:21:45,726
- Let's do it. - Let's go.

2524
01:21:45,727 --> 01:21:47,255
- Should we go this way? - Yes.

2525
01:21:47,256 --> 01:21:48,925
- Let's go this way. - It's our first attempt.

2526
01:21:48,926 --> 01:21:50,366
- Here we go. - We will give it a try.

2527
01:21:50,367 --> 01:21:51,435
It's for the wine cellar!

2528
01:21:51,436 --> 01:21:52,837
Let's do a cheer together.

2529
01:21:53,096 --> 01:21:54,605
- Let's do this. - In, 1, 2, 3.

2530
01:21:54,606 --> 01:21:55,766
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2531
01:21:55,936 --> 01:21:57,805
This is Round One. I'll start.

2532
01:21:57,806 --> 01:21:59,836
- That was the easiest for me. - In 1, 2, 3.

2533
01:21:59,837 --> 01:22:00,907
- Let's go! - Here we go!

2534
01:22:01,777 --> 01:22:03,707
- Get ready. - That didn't work.

2535
01:22:05,077 --> 01:22:06,146
It has to be done quickly.

2536
01:22:07,317 --> 01:22:08,716
(Fail)

2537
01:22:08,787 --> 01:22:09,817
Gosh, I feel nervous.

2538
01:22:09,947 --> 01:22:11,016
(Fail)

2539
01:22:13,587 --> 01:22:15,587
- Gosh! - It went out.

2540
01:22:16,827 --> 01:22:17,856
Gentle.

2541
01:22:18,756 --> 01:22:20,226
(Fail)

2542
01:22:21,966 --> 01:22:23,026
We have time left, right?

2543
01:22:23,027 --> 01:22:24,096
(Yeon Seok is last.)

2544
01:22:24,466 --> 01:22:25,466
You have to be quick.

2545
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:27,296
This makes you feel really nervous.

2546
01:22:27,367 --> 01:22:28,407
Please.

2547
01:22:29,136 --> 01:22:30,136
Go.

2548
01:22:36,046 --> 01:22:37,076
(They fail on their first attempt.)

2549
01:22:37,077 --> 01:22:38,476
This is impossible.

2550
01:22:38,917 --> 01:22:40,515
- Can we practice? - We can practice.

2551
01:22:40,516 --> 01:22:42,356
- This is hard. - We have to do this. Hold on.

2552
01:22:42,516 --> 01:22:44,656
It won't be any fun if we keep failing.

2553
01:22:44,657 --> 01:22:45,987
(Practice makes perfect.)

2554
01:22:46,716 --> 01:22:48,787
I'm pretty sure there's a way to do it.

2555
01:22:50,827 --> 01:22:51,827
- He did it. - I did it.

2556
01:22:52,997 --> 01:22:54,696
- He did it. - Did you get the hang of it?

2557
01:22:54,697 --> 01:22:56,026
- I did. - How is it done?

2558
01:22:56,027 --> 01:22:57,395
- It has to be done slowly? - Slowly?

2559
01:22:57,396 --> 01:22:58,736
- When it's losing its speed. - Right.

2560
01:22:58,737 --> 01:23:02,406
It's around when it's about to fall.

2561
01:23:02,407 --> 01:23:04,836
- Right before it falls? - Then let's call it out.

2562
01:23:04,837 --> 01:23:06,236
Look.

2563
01:23:06,237 --> 01:23:07,746
- It won't work at this speed. - Right.

2564
01:23:07,747 --> 01:23:08,777
But...

2565
01:23:09,207 --> 01:23:10,546
Gosh! Jae Suk!

2566
01:23:11,716 --> 01:23:12,776
(He succeeds consecutively.)

2567
01:23:12,777 --> 01:23:13,877
He really got it.

2568
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:16,345
(Surprised)

2569
01:23:16,346 --> 01:23:17,645
- He got it. - Do it the exact same way.

2570
01:23:17,646 --> 01:23:19,286
- Let's go right away. - Let's go!

2571
01:23:19,287 --> 01:23:21,456
- Let's go! He got it. - Let's go!

2572
01:23:21,457 --> 01:23:22,725
- Let's get it. - Here we go!

2573
01:23:22,726 --> 01:23:23,756
Go first, Yeon Seok.

2574
01:23:24,327 --> 01:23:26,425
- I don't feel confident. - What?

2575
01:23:26,426 --> 01:23:27,656
Why won't you do it first in the actual game?

2576
01:23:27,657 --> 01:23:28,965
- He got the hang of it. - Here I go.

2577
01:23:28,966 --> 01:23:30,826
- Jae Suk got the hang of it. - Get ready.

2578
01:23:30,827 --> 01:23:32,787
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 2.)

2579
01:23:34,167 --> 01:23:35,636
Take it slow. Don't rush it.

2580
01:23:37,237 --> 01:23:38,276
You got it.

2581
01:23:38,277 --> 01:23:39,877
- That was close. - All right.

2582
01:23:40,777 --> 01:23:41,976
All right.

2583
01:23:42,577 --> 01:23:44,546
- That was close. - All right.

2584
01:23:44,676 --> 01:23:45,676
We don't have time.

2585
01:23:47,346 --> 01:23:48,346
Take it slow.

2586
01:23:49,886 --> 01:23:51,056
(Fail)

2587
01:23:51,087 --> 01:23:52,087
All right.

2588
01:23:55,827 --> 01:23:56,827
All right.

2589
01:23:58,957 --> 01:24:00,295
She's strong.

2590
01:24:00,296 --> 01:24:01,966
- Three, two... - Gosh!

2591
01:24:02,327 --> 01:24:04,497
- Gosh! - She did it!

2592
01:24:04,636 --> 01:24:06,396
- She did it! - She did it!

2593
01:24:07,737 --> 01:24:10,636
(She got it!)

2594
01:24:11,377 --> 01:24:12,377
- Gosh! - Two...

2595
01:24:12,378 --> 01:24:16,446
- She did it! - She did it!

2596
01:24:16,447 --> 01:24:18,276
(Hae Ri has done it!)

2597
01:24:18,277 --> 01:24:21,686
- She did it! - She did it!

2598
01:24:22,117 --> 01:24:23,386
- She did it! - She did it!

2599
01:24:24,787 --> 01:24:27,487
(Screaming)

2600
01:24:31,226 --> 01:24:33,855
- Gosh, Hae Ri. - Nice one, Hae Ri!

2601
01:24:33,856 --> 01:24:37,166
- Hae Ri. - What just happened?

2602
01:24:37,167 --> 01:24:38,497
(Looking amazing)

2603
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:46,207
(Getting it neatly)

2604
01:24:46,407 --> 01:24:49,505
With just 0.15 seconds left.

2605
01:24:49,506 --> 01:24:51,175
- With just 0.15 seconds left. - She did it!

2606
01:24:51,176 --> 01:24:52,576
(Thank you!)

2607
01:24:52,577 --> 01:24:54,246
- She did it. - That was amazing!

2608
01:24:54,247 --> 01:24:55,685
- That was amazing. - In two tries.

2609
01:24:55,686 --> 01:24:57,215
- I just got goosebumps. - That was amazing.

2610
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:59,616
- All right. As a result, - That was amazing. The wine cellar!

2611
01:24:59,617 --> 01:25:01,185
- we secured the wine cellar. - Round One.

2612
01:25:01,186 --> 01:25:03,925
(They secure the wine cellar in Round 1!)

2613
01:25:03,926 --> 01:25:06,555
All right. You can decide to carry on with Round Two.

2614
01:25:06,556 --> 01:25:08,395
- This feels great! - All right, Ji Hye.

2615
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:09,426
Yes?

2616
01:25:09,667 --> 01:25:11,496
You have to decide to go or stop.

2617
01:25:11,497 --> 01:25:13,265
- You can decide to stop. - Right.

2618
01:25:13,266 --> 01:25:15,936
But we do have a lot of attempts left.

2619
01:25:16,266 --> 01:25:17,366
- Right. - Right.

2620
01:25:17,367 --> 01:25:18,476
- Go! - Go!

2621
01:25:18,777 --> 01:25:19,906
Gosh.

2622
01:25:19,907 --> 01:25:21,605
- They should go. - I thought they would stop.

2623
01:25:21,606 --> 01:25:22,976
We have to do at least two rounds.

2624
01:25:23,606 --> 01:25:25,276
"We started with a secondhand tent."

2625
01:25:25,277 --> 01:25:27,077
"We want great camping gear now."

2626
01:25:27,747 --> 01:25:29,246
- "Snow Peak Tent." - The Snow Peak Tent.

2627
01:25:29,247 --> 01:25:30,916
- Really? - That's expensive!

2628
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,763
- Isn't that really expensive? - It's expensive!

2629
01:25:32,787 --> 01:25:34,116
It's a really nice tent.

2630
01:25:34,117 --> 01:25:36,027
- Snow Peak Tent? - That's really expensive.

2631
01:25:36,056 --> 01:25:37,327
It's an expensive one.

2632
01:25:37,487 --> 01:25:39,126
But if we fail, they will take that back again.

2633
01:25:39,127 --> 01:25:40,355
- Everything will be gone. - Right.

2634
01:25:40,356 --> 01:25:41,465
This is amazing.

2635
01:25:41,466 --> 01:25:42,866
We can do this. We gained confidence.

2636
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:43,896
Let's go for it.

2637
01:25:44,636 --> 01:25:45,965
- We gained confidence. - It's Round Two now.

2638
01:25:45,966 --> 01:25:47,166
(Round 2)

2639
01:25:47,167 --> 01:25:49,566
(The coin is smaller.)

2640
01:25:49,567 --> 01:25:51,175
- Gosh. - The ten-cent coin?

2641
01:25:51,176 --> 01:25:52,805
- Are you serious? - Will it be harder then?

2642
01:25:52,806 --> 01:25:53,877
It...

2643
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:58,146
(The coin has gotten smaller.)

2644
01:25:58,346 --> 01:25:59,776
I didn't know it would be like this.

2645
01:25:59,777 --> 01:26:01,686
- But you got the hang of it now. - Right.

2646
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:03,246
- You've got this, so we're good. - You can do it.

2647
01:26:03,247 --> 01:26:05,207
Right. You guys both have a good feel for it now.

2648
01:26:05,317 --> 01:26:06,515
There's still a lot left.

2649
01:26:06,516 --> 01:26:08,126
Right. You've got this, so we're good.

2650
01:26:08,127 --> 01:26:09,226
They could do it, right?

2651
01:26:09,686 --> 01:26:11,456
(Practicing for now)

2652
01:26:11,457 --> 01:26:13,157
- Okay. Min Kyung, try it. - Yes?

2653
01:26:14,726 --> 01:26:16,466
- Hey. - Hey, you got it.

2654
01:26:17,766 --> 01:26:19,496
(Did she succeed on her first practice?)

2655
01:26:19,497 --> 01:26:21,567
- You got it at this speed... - No, that's not it.

2656
01:26:23,106 --> 01:26:24,906
(She successfully got it between the prongs.)

2657
01:26:24,907 --> 01:26:27,706
(But unfortunately, the coin slipped out.)

2658
01:26:27,707 --> 01:26:29,505
- You got it at this speed... - No, that's not it.

2659
01:26:29,506 --> 01:26:31,246
- Did you really get it? - The smaller coin works better.

2660
01:26:31,247 --> 01:26:32,546
- What? - Really?

2661
01:26:33,417 --> 01:26:35,162
- I'm telling you. - But you have to keep it standing.

2662
01:26:35,186 --> 01:26:36,417
All right.

2663
01:26:36,947 --> 01:26:39,016
Gosh, you're being so picky.

2664
01:26:39,256 --> 01:26:40,416
I said I got it.

2665
01:26:40,417 --> 01:26:42,256
You're saying it over and over again.

2666
01:26:42,426 --> 01:26:43,527
Seriously.

2667
01:26:45,896 --> 01:26:48,596
Min Kyung's annoyance bursts out at once.

2668
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:50,126
- I'm dying to do this. - Small annoyance, big annoyance.

2669
01:26:50,127 --> 01:26:51,295
- Small annoyance, big annoyance. - Small annoyance, big annoyance.

2670
01:26:51,296 --> 01:26:52,736
- He was being annoying. - Your annoyance bursts out at once.

2671
01:26:52,737 --> 01:26:54,765
- He's being so annoying. - "All right."

2672
01:26:54,766 --> 01:26:55,907
My goodness.

2673
01:27:00,237 --> 01:27:01,377
I think I got it.

2674
01:27:01,747 --> 01:27:03,145
- Did you do it? - It slips out.

2675
01:27:03,146 --> 01:27:05,376
- Is it hard to keep it standing? - Right, this one is...

2676
01:27:05,377 --> 01:27:07,817
It's easy to get it in the fork, but it slips out easily too.

2677
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:09,816
- Then you can follow it like this. - Since the coin is small,

2678
01:27:09,817 --> 01:27:11,045
- keep following it as it moves. - Right.

2679
01:27:11,046 --> 01:27:12,255
(You must keep it from falling out.)

2680
01:27:12,256 --> 01:27:13,417
You have to hang in there.

2681
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:17,127
There... Oh, I was a bit slow.

2682
01:27:21,667 --> 01:27:22,726
Was that an actual try?

2683
01:27:23,327 --> 01:27:24,496
No, we didn't say so.

2684
01:27:24,497 --> 01:27:25,795
- That was so good, though. - Shall we try it?

2685
01:27:25,796 --> 01:27:26,916
- Let's try it. - All right.

2686
01:27:27,237 --> 01:27:29,465
Then, the 3rd try for Round 2.

2687
01:27:29,466 --> 01:27:30,466
In 1, 2, 3.

2688
01:27:30,467 --> 01:27:31,753
- Let's go! Here we go! - Here we go!

2689
01:27:31,777 --> 01:27:33,176
- I'll go first. - Okay.

2690
01:27:33,577 --> 01:27:35,206
- If we fail, we should fail sooner. - It keeps falling out.

2691
01:27:35,207 --> 01:27:37,046
Get ready.

2692
01:27:38,117 --> 01:27:39,146
Oh, goodness.

2693
01:27:39,646 --> 01:27:40,917
- You got nervous. - I did.

2694
01:27:42,487 --> 01:27:43,516
(Fail)

2695
01:27:44,317 --> 01:27:46,716
- Get ready. - Oh, darn it!

2696
01:27:47,317 --> 01:27:48,926
(Two of them fail in a flash.)

2697
01:27:52,556 --> 01:27:53,657
(Fail)

2698
01:27:54,157 --> 01:27:55,226
Oh, no.

2699
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:56,997
Oh, no.

2700
01:27:57,596 --> 01:27:59,237
- Slowly. - You've got this.

2701
01:28:00,037 --> 01:28:01,037
Slowly.

2702
01:28:01,038 --> 01:28:02,166
(Yeon Seok is the only one left.)

2703
01:28:02,167 --> 01:28:03,337
- Slowly. - You've got this.

2704
01:28:14,686 --> 01:28:16,987
(He got it!)

2705
01:28:17,947 --> 01:28:20,417
(Shouting)

2706
01:28:21,587 --> 01:28:24,657
(Exclaiming)

2707
01:28:29,567 --> 01:28:32,037
(Moving off-course)

2708
01:28:32,737 --> 01:28:33,765
(They succeed in Round 2 in 3 tries, the least number of tries ever!)

2709
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:35,766
- You did so well! Amazing! - My gosh!

2710
01:28:36,837 --> 01:28:38,706
- Success! - Did you see it?

2711
01:28:38,707 --> 01:28:40,135
- That was amazing! - My gosh!

2712
01:28:40,136 --> 01:28:41,407
Hey, you really did it today.

2713
01:28:41,546 --> 01:28:42,707
- Yoo One Shot! - Come on.

2714
01:28:44,577 --> 01:28:47,475
(The coin stopped in place!)

2715
01:28:47,476 --> 01:28:48,916
Hey, you really did it today.

2716
01:28:48,917 --> 01:28:50,116
- Yoo One Shot! - Come on.

2717
01:28:50,117 --> 01:28:52,086
- Gosh, Yeon Seok, you did so well. - My goodness.

2718
01:28:52,087 --> 01:28:53,886
- Nice. That was great. - That was insane.

2719
01:28:54,516 --> 01:28:56,956
- Seriously insane. - Round Two, success!

2720
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:58,026
(They win the wine cellar and dome tent!)

2721
01:28:58,027 --> 01:28:59,056
All right. Hang on.

2722
01:28:59,457 --> 01:29:01,096
Now, for Round Three...

2723
01:29:01,697 --> 01:29:03,765
- Gosh, with this mood... - This is...

2724
01:29:03,766 --> 01:29:04,895
This is something you should think carefully about.

2725
01:29:04,896 --> 01:29:07,095
- All right. You have to be serious. - That was awesome.

2726
01:29:07,096 --> 01:29:08,105
You really have to think seriously about this.

2727
01:29:08,106 --> 01:29:09,635
- This is... - The coin will get even smaller.

2728
01:29:09,636 --> 01:29:10,836
- Right. - The game will get harder.

2729
01:29:10,837 --> 01:29:12,175
- Or... - Then we can't go for it.

2730
01:29:12,176 --> 01:29:13,706
- Or we'll have fewer seconds. - We have to give up.

2731
01:29:13,707 --> 01:29:15,076
- Or two people... - Or...

2732
01:29:15,077 --> 01:29:16,675
- might have to succeed. - two people will have to get it.

2733
01:29:16,676 --> 01:29:18,276
- It will get harder. - No, you can't go for it.

2734
01:29:18,277 --> 01:29:19,616
- You can't. Let's finish here. - Think realistically.

2735
01:29:19,617 --> 01:29:21,377
You have to think about it with a cool head.

2736
01:29:21,417 --> 01:29:23,587
- I got everything I wanted now. - Oh, really?

2737
01:29:23,686 --> 01:29:25,185
- Will you decide? - All right.

2738
01:29:25,186 --> 01:29:26,555
- I don't want anything else. - You can discuss it.

2739
01:29:26,556 --> 01:29:29,027
- Discuss it and make your choice. - Yes.

2740
01:29:29,527 --> 01:29:30,656
- Let's stop here. - Three...

2741
01:29:30,657 --> 01:29:32,156
- Oh, okay. - Okay.

2742
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:34,596
- But there are seven tries left. - Come on!

2743
01:29:35,027 --> 01:29:36,067
Should we go for it?

2744
01:29:36,396 --> 01:29:38,336
Oh, we're on the 4th... Since we only had 3 tries,

2745
01:29:38,337 --> 01:29:40,736
we have eight tries left.

2746
01:29:40,737 --> 01:29:41,737
Let's go for it.

2747
01:29:41,766 --> 01:29:43,237
- In 1, 2, 3. - Go where?

2748
01:29:43,766 --> 01:29:44,876
- Go! - Go!

2749
01:29:44,877 --> 01:29:46,206
(They suddenly changed their mind.)

2750
01:29:46,207 --> 01:29:47,277
Where?

2751
01:29:47,506 --> 01:29:49,105
- We're doing it again? - They're going for Round Three.

2752
01:29:49,106 --> 01:29:50,706
- Gosh, but this is... - All right.

2753
01:29:50,707 --> 01:29:52,846
- They had to go for it. - Okay, let's go.

2754
01:29:53,346 --> 01:29:55,586
- But we do have many tries left. - But they could lose everything.

2755
01:29:55,587 --> 01:29:57,086
- If the coin gets even smaller, - They could lose everything.

2756
01:29:57,087 --> 01:29:58,316
- it'll be really hard. - I think it'll be hard.

2757
01:29:58,317 --> 01:29:59,716
We shouldn't do this.

2758
01:29:59,856 --> 01:30:02,327
I think it'll be hard. We shouldn't do this.

2759
01:30:02,527 --> 01:30:05,096
"On our days off, the campsite is our home."

2760
01:30:05,226 --> 01:30:07,532
- "LG Wireless TV for camping?" - "LG Wireless TV for camping?"

2761
01:30:07,556 --> 01:30:09,666
- Is that what I think it is? - A wireless TV?

2762
01:30:09,667 --> 01:30:10,827
The LG one?

2763
01:30:11,327 --> 01:30:13,036
- The StanbyME Go? - What?

2764
01:30:13,037 --> 01:30:15,066
Oh, the one with the bag too?

2765
01:30:15,067 --> 01:30:16,435
(LG Wireless TV for camping)

2766
01:30:16,436 --> 01:30:17,805
- For camping... - The thing that looks like...

2767
01:30:17,806 --> 01:30:18,975
a turntable?

2768
01:30:18,976 --> 01:30:20,505
Campers love this so much.

2769
01:30:20,506 --> 01:30:22,476
We just watch videos on our phones.

2770
01:30:23,447 --> 01:30:24,927
- Goodness. - No, but the thing is...

2771
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:29,416
- We have to win this for them. - We must.

2772
01:30:29,417 --> 01:30:30,545
We're on a roll today.

2773
01:30:30,546 --> 01:30:32,086
- It's really... - But what is the game?

2774
01:30:32,087 --> 01:30:33,586
- Let's do this. - All right. Let's go.

2775
01:30:33,587 --> 01:30:35,086
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2776
01:30:35,087 --> 01:30:36,586
(Round 3)

2777
01:30:36,587 --> 01:30:41,026
(1 person spins 3 coins, )

2778
01:30:41,027 --> 01:30:44,795
(and if the 3 other people get at least 1 coin, they succeed.)

2779
01:30:44,796 --> 01:30:48,036
(However, they can only begin after all the coins are spinning.)

2780
01:30:48,037 --> 01:30:50,066
Oh, one person spins the coins?

2781
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:52,175
- One person spins all three coins? - Yes.

2782
01:30:52,176 --> 01:30:53,536
- Oh, someone else? - Then, it has to be quick...

2783
01:30:53,537 --> 01:30:54,805
- You should spin it. - I should do it.

2784
01:30:54,806 --> 01:30:56,746
- You can spin them quickly. - He's quick.

2785
01:30:56,747 --> 01:30:58,105
- One person spins them, - So...

2786
01:30:58,106 --> 01:30:59,816
- and three have to stab. - The remaining three...

2787
01:30:59,817 --> 01:31:01,886
- What about the time limit? - Twenty seconds

2788
01:31:02,046 --> 01:31:03,446
- All right. - You're really good at this.

2789
01:31:03,447 --> 01:31:05,456
- I have to spin them quickly... - Yes, you have to be quick.

2790
01:31:05,457 --> 01:31:07,386
All three have to be spinning?

2791
01:31:07,716 --> 01:31:09,756
- But in that case... - No, you can't go yet!

2792
01:31:12,356 --> 01:31:13,395
(Feeling embarrassed)

2793
01:31:13,396 --> 01:31:14,396
Hae Ri...

2794
01:31:14,497 --> 01:31:16,366
- Hang on. - He's working so hard to spin them,

2795
01:31:16,367 --> 01:31:17,607
and you're stabbing it already?

2796
01:31:18,497 --> 01:31:20,337
- You're being so hard... - No, I just...

2797
01:31:20,497 --> 01:31:21,636
Are you her mother?

2798
01:31:22,237 --> 01:31:23,406
Are you Min Kyung's mother?

2799
01:31:23,407 --> 01:31:24,807
- My goodness. - Min Kyung's mom...

2800
01:31:25,037 --> 01:31:27,076
- We have to practice. - I wasn't thinking straight.

2801
01:31:27,077 --> 01:31:28,846
All right. One, two...

2802
01:31:29,006 --> 01:31:30,675
All right. One, two...

2803
01:31:30,676 --> 01:31:31,946
(They start practicing for now.)

2804
01:31:31,947 --> 01:31:32,947
This one...

2805
01:31:32,948 --> 01:31:34,988
- It's nerve-racking. - They die out in the middle.

2806
01:31:35,947 --> 01:31:37,515
(The coins he spun first die out midway.)

2807
01:31:37,516 --> 01:31:39,555
- It's hard just to spin them. - Yes, spinning them is hard.

2808
01:31:39,556 --> 01:31:41,416
- It's hard to take them out. - Right.

2809
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:42,526
Then should we hand them to you 1 by 1?

2810
01:31:42,527 --> 01:31:44,386
- Please do. - All right. You should do it.

2811
01:31:44,587 --> 01:31:46,255
- Hand them to him, Hae Ri. - All right.

2812
01:31:46,256 --> 01:31:47,872
- I'll hold them. - Okay, I'll spin them hard.

2813
01:31:47,896 --> 01:31:49,466
- One. Oh, no. - Okay. Oh, goodness.

2814
01:31:50,997 --> 01:31:52,067
Oh, goodness.

2815
01:31:52,796 --> 01:31:54,697
Seriously. This is a disaster.

2816
01:31:55,667 --> 01:31:56,836
(Trembling)

2817
01:31:56,837 --> 01:31:58,506
Jae Suk, your hands are shaking so much.

2818
01:31:58,777 --> 01:31:59,805
- Jae Suk. - Let me see them.

2819
01:31:59,806 --> 01:32:01,906
- I felt too much pressure. - Let me try it.

2820
01:32:01,907 --> 01:32:03,576
- Let me try it once. - I felt too much pressure.

2821
01:32:03,577 --> 01:32:04,877
The pressure to do it quickly.

2822
01:32:05,447 --> 01:32:06,975
- I'll try it again. - Is this even possible?

2823
01:32:06,976 --> 01:32:08,896
- Let me see. - I don't think we can even start.

2824
01:32:09,317 --> 01:32:10,386
Okay. One.

2825
01:32:11,247 --> 01:32:12,657
- Two. Darn it. - Goodness.

2826
01:32:14,457 --> 01:32:16,487
(This time, the coins collide.)

2827
01:32:16,827 --> 01:32:18,227
- Seriously. - This is infuriating.

2828
01:32:18,327 --> 01:32:19,997
It's driving me crazy. All right.

2829
01:32:20,256 --> 01:32:21,925
- But 1... - You can go if there are 2...

2830
01:32:21,926 --> 01:32:23,795
- Is that right? - Once you hit the third coin...

2831
01:32:23,796 --> 01:32:24,826
Oh, good.

2832
01:32:24,827 --> 01:32:26,036
- Is that so? - We can go if two are spinning?

2833
01:32:26,037 --> 01:32:27,266
- Oh, okay. - I see.

2834
01:32:27,567 --> 01:32:29,067
I'll give you one.

2835
01:32:29,337 --> 01:32:30,635
- Then, one goes this way. - Yes.

2836
01:32:30,636 --> 01:32:31,805
- Okay. - Nice direction.

2837
01:32:31,806 --> 01:32:33,337
- And one over here. - Nice direction.

2838
01:32:34,737 --> 01:32:35,746
There we go.

2839
01:32:35,747 --> 01:32:36,806
Nice direction.

2840
01:32:38,207 --> 01:32:39,916
- There we go. - We got it.

2841
01:32:39,917 --> 01:32:40,946
(Hae Ri succeeded this time again.)

2842
01:32:40,947 --> 01:32:42,345
- I didn't... Did you get it? - All right. Let's try it now.

2843
01:32:42,346 --> 01:32:44,246
- Oh, you did? Okay, let's try. - Let's give it a try.

2844
01:32:44,247 --> 01:32:46,192
- Let's try it, then. - Since we have eight tries...

2845
01:32:46,216 --> 01:32:48,186
- Let's go for it. - Let's try it.

2846
01:32:48,457 --> 01:32:49,626
In 1, 2, 3.

2847
01:32:49,627 --> 01:32:50,726
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2848
01:32:51,056 --> 01:32:52,056
- All right. - Ready...

2849
01:32:52,057 --> 01:32:53,095
Here we go.

2850
01:32:53,096 --> 01:32:54,126
Set...

2851
01:32:54,127 --> 01:32:56,066
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 4.)

2852
01:32:56,067 --> 01:32:58,266
- Oh, goodness. - Let it go.

2853
01:32:59,436 --> 01:33:01,496
- Oh, goodness. - Let it go.

2854
01:33:01,497 --> 01:33:03,765
(They just get rid of one coin.)

2855
01:33:03,766 --> 01:33:05,006
All right. I've got it.

2856
01:33:07,606 --> 01:33:08,846
All right. I've got it.

2857
01:33:13,247 --> 01:33:14,476
I'm the absolute worst.

2858
01:33:15,587 --> 01:33:17,347
Gosh, that was a great performance, Jae Suk.

2859
01:33:18,317 --> 01:33:20,256
These guys had a great connection.

2860
01:33:21,587 --> 01:33:22,755
That felt so futile.

2861
01:33:22,756 --> 01:33:24,756
(They failed before they could even try properly.)

2862
01:33:24,997 --> 01:33:26,026
That was so annoying.

2863
01:33:26,027 --> 01:33:28,667
- That was a big annoyance. - We blew a chance in vain.

2864
01:33:29,327 --> 01:33:30,696
Do you want to try spinning, then?

2865
01:33:30,697 --> 01:33:31,996
- Should I try? - Yes, you should try it.

2866
01:33:31,997 --> 01:33:33,066
- All right. - We need a fresh new start.

2867
01:33:33,067 --> 01:33:34,566
- Right. - Yes, we do.

2868
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:35,866
Then, is this our sixth try?

2869
01:33:35,867 --> 01:33:37,605
- Gosh, what do we do? - We're losing tries so quickly.

2870
01:33:37,606 --> 01:33:38,813
- In 1, 2, 3. - This is driving me crazy.

2871
01:33:38,837 --> 01:33:40,837
- Here we go! Let's go! - Let's go!

2872
01:33:41,407 --> 01:33:42,407
Ready.

2873
01:33:42,707 --> 01:33:44,206
- Hang on. - Set...

2874
01:33:44,207 --> 01:33:45,376
(He places them carefully.)

2875
01:33:45,377 --> 01:33:47,777
- Okay. - Ready, set...

2876
01:33:51,447 --> 01:33:53,086
- Nice. Good. - You spun them well.

2877
01:33:53,087 --> 01:33:55,127
Nice spin. This one is mine.

2878
01:33:55,726 --> 01:33:57,355
(He succeeds in spinning the coins.)

2879
01:33:57,356 --> 01:33:58,796
Take one each.

2880
01:34:00,827 --> 01:34:01,925
(They both fail.)

2881
01:34:01,926 --> 01:34:03,396
- Oh, no! - Gosh, that was so close!

2882
01:34:04,127 --> 01:34:06,266
(Now, Jae Suk is their last hope!)

2883
01:34:09,537 --> 01:34:11,806
(Fail)

2884
01:34:13,077 --> 01:34:15,345
I almost stabbed it.

2885
01:34:15,346 --> 01:34:16,576
- You almost had it. - Right?

2886
01:34:16,577 --> 01:34:18,417
Yes, at first. Slightly...

2887
01:34:20,377 --> 01:34:21,817
Are we on our seventh try already?

2888
01:34:22,716 --> 01:34:24,145
- Then, how many... - So, 7, 8, 9, and 10,

2889
01:34:24,146 --> 01:34:25,457
- plus the bonus. - Yes.

2890
01:34:25,856 --> 01:34:28,086
- That's okay. You can do it. - That's okay. You can do it.

2891
01:34:28,087 --> 01:34:29,662
(They keep telling themselves that it's okay.)

2892
01:34:29,686 --> 01:34:32,246
All right. Yeon Seok, you're good at spinning. You should do it.

2893
01:34:32,997 --> 01:34:34,526
- Let's cheer. Our seventh try. - Let's go.

2894
01:34:34,527 --> 01:34:35,566
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2895
01:34:35,567 --> 01:34:36,696
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 7.)

2896
01:34:36,697 --> 01:34:38,367
Gosh, we really have to...

2897
01:34:38,697 --> 01:34:40,166
- We have to give this to them. - We can do it.

2898
01:34:40,167 --> 01:34:41,236
You spun it well.

2899
01:34:41,237 --> 01:34:42,907
Ready, set...

2900
01:34:44,537 --> 01:34:46,105
- That one is yours. - Okay.

2901
01:34:46,106 --> 01:34:47,377
Okay, two.

2902
01:34:48,306 --> 01:34:49,806
- Three. - No, I hit it too hard.

2903
01:34:50,146 --> 01:34:52,216
- Three. - No, I hit it too hard. Two.

2904
01:35:04,027 --> 01:35:06,396
- No, it definitely went in... - It dropped.

2905
01:35:06,697 --> 01:35:08,027
But the table was too small.

2906
01:35:08,356 --> 01:35:09,867
The table was too small.

2907
01:35:12,237 --> 01:35:13,996
- It went in, but it dropped. - Right then...

2908
01:35:13,997 --> 01:35:15,105
(It was so close.)

2909
01:35:15,106 --> 01:35:16,106
What a shame.

2910
01:35:17,136 --> 01:35:18,675
(They fail on their seventh try.)

2911
01:35:18,676 --> 01:35:20,005
Hey, let's use the bonus this time.

2912
01:35:20,006 --> 01:35:21,975
- Right. - Let's refresh the mood now.

2913
01:35:21,976 --> 01:35:23,475
- Yes, let's go. - Let's try it.

2914
01:35:23,476 --> 01:35:25,145
- Hang on. This is... - But you were right.

2915
01:35:25,146 --> 01:35:26,746
- Let's do this. - It has to pause, right?

2916
01:35:26,747 --> 01:35:28,586
Let's hope for a miracle.

2917
01:35:28,587 --> 01:35:30,885
- Let's go. - Let's hope for it.

2918
01:35:30,886 --> 01:35:32,886
- We'll practice. - I'll spin it for you.

2919
01:35:32,987 --> 01:35:34,317
Practice stabbing it.

2920
01:35:37,226 --> 01:35:38,756
If you wait, you'll get a feeling.

2921
01:35:39,697 --> 01:35:41,057
- The coin calls your name. - Hey!

2922
01:35:43,266 --> 01:35:45,096
(He did stab it!)

2923
01:35:45,396 --> 01:35:48,096
- After you stab, just hold on... - Right there...

2924
01:35:48,506 --> 01:35:49,965
- Stab. - If it doesn't work...

2925
01:35:49,966 --> 01:35:51,836
- But he did it so well. - Yes, he did.

2926
01:35:51,837 --> 01:35:52,906
Let's try it, then.

2927
01:35:52,907 --> 01:35:54,606
- Let's try it. - You can do it!

2928
01:35:55,377 --> 01:35:56,645
- Here we go. - Here we go.

2929
01:35:56,646 --> 01:35:57,675
Ready.

2930
01:35:57,676 --> 01:35:59,345
(Bonus coupon round)

2931
01:35:59,346 --> 01:36:00,377
Slowly.

2932
01:36:00,917 --> 01:36:02,117
Nice, you did well.

2933
01:36:02,447 --> 01:36:03,487
Oh, nice.

2934
01:36:03,886 --> 01:36:04,886
Oh, nice.

2935
01:36:05,216 --> 01:36:06,556
(Fail)

2936
01:36:06,957 --> 01:36:09,127
(The last person remaining is Young Jin!)

2937
01:36:13,896 --> 01:36:16,225
(Reading her face)

2938
01:36:16,226 --> 01:36:17,567
- Is it over? - Yes.

2939
01:36:18,867 --> 01:36:20,067
- Just like that? - Yes.

2940
01:36:22,337 --> 01:36:23,366
- Really? - I feel...

2941
01:36:23,367 --> 01:36:24,406
Come here.

2942
01:36:24,407 --> 01:36:25,737
(They fail the bonus round.)

2943
01:36:26,277 --> 01:36:27,776
- What do we do? - Gosh, this is...

2944
01:36:27,777 --> 01:36:29,606
We have three tries left.

2945
01:36:30,476 --> 01:36:32,076
- How do we do this? - What do we do?

2946
01:36:32,077 --> 01:36:34,277
- This is too hard. - A scientific approach.

2947
01:36:34,747 --> 01:36:37,347
- Gosh, this is driving me nuts. - Yeon Seok has to stab it once.

2948
01:36:37,516 --> 01:36:38,715
Then should I spin them?

2949
01:36:38,716 --> 01:36:39,886
- Well... - No.

2950
01:36:41,287 --> 01:36:42,356
No.

2951
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:44,626
(He got it!)

2952
01:36:44,627 --> 01:36:46,725
- Yeon Seok. - I know. He has to...

2953
01:36:46,726 --> 01:36:48,055
- stab it. - He has to stab it.

2954
01:36:48,056 --> 01:36:49,426
Yeon Seok, you have to stab it.

2955
01:36:49,567 --> 01:36:50,626
Yeon Seok, you stab it.

2956
01:36:50,627 --> 01:36:51,666
- I will... - Jae Suk, you spin them.

2957
01:36:51,667 --> 01:36:53,507
- Yeon Seok has to stab it. - Okay, here I go.

2958
01:36:53,966 --> 01:36:55,567
When I stabbed it earlier...

2959
01:36:55,737 --> 01:36:57,236
As you stab it,

2960
01:36:57,237 --> 01:37:00,175
if you stab like this, it goes down at an angle.

2961
01:37:00,176 --> 01:37:02,446
Make sure the fork prongs are standing upright.

2962
01:37:02,447 --> 01:37:04,105
- Okay. - Like this, as much as possible?

2963
01:37:04,106 --> 01:37:06,246
- As upright as possible. - So it doesn't lean.

2964
01:37:06,247 --> 01:37:07,916
- Like this? - Yes, you have to stab like this.

2965
01:37:07,917 --> 01:37:09,816
- Oh, at 90°? - Does that make sense?

2966
01:37:09,817 --> 01:37:11,486
- That's right. - Okay.

2967
01:37:11,487 --> 01:37:13,185
- At a 90° angle. Okay. - Right.

2968
01:37:13,186 --> 01:37:14,286
Nice.

2969
01:37:14,287 --> 01:37:16,156
This is our eighth try. Let's say a cheer.

2970
01:37:16,157 --> 01:37:17,855
Hang on, Jae Suk. You should practice spinning once.

2971
01:37:17,856 --> 01:37:18,896
Shall I?

2972
01:37:19,226 --> 01:37:20,996
You've lost your touch since you took a break.

2973
01:37:20,997 --> 01:37:22,367
- Yes, you ran away. - Okay.

2974
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:26,496
- Okay. - Okay.

2975
01:37:26,497 --> 01:37:28,296
- Okay, good. - Get ready...

2976
01:37:28,436 --> 01:37:29,836
- Oh, that one was bad. - Oh, okay.

2977
01:37:32,877 --> 01:37:34,105
- Hey, you had it. - Yeon Seok,

2978
01:37:34,106 --> 01:37:35,706
- Yeon Seok can do it. - you've got it.

2979
01:37:35,707 --> 01:37:37,446
- Do you think so? All right. - Yes.

2980
01:37:37,447 --> 01:37:38,777
All right, then.

2981
01:37:39,216 --> 01:37:41,246
- Let me see. - Let's see.

2982
01:37:41,247 --> 01:37:42,617
- Okay. Here we go! - Here we go.

2983
01:37:42,947 --> 01:37:44,045
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2984
01:37:44,046 --> 01:37:45,117
Ready,

2985
01:37:45,756 --> 01:37:46,816
set...

2986
01:37:46,817 --> 01:37:52,696
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 8.)

2987
01:37:52,697 --> 01:37:53,826
Is it just me?

2988
01:37:53,827 --> 01:37:56,426
(Only one coin is spinning.)

2989
01:37:57,527 --> 01:37:58,567
Is it just me?

2990
01:37:59,396 --> 01:38:01,367
- Okay, I'll do it. - Go for it.

2991
01:38:01,867 --> 01:38:02,867
Okay, I'll do it.

2992
01:38:05,636 --> 01:38:07,436
(I'll do it.)

2993
01:38:08,907 --> 01:38:10,407
See? He almost had it.

2994
01:38:10,606 --> 01:38:12,793
- I should've done... - You had it. It was three in a row.

2995
01:38:12,817 --> 01:38:14,376
- It'll work. - Right, you just have to...

2996
01:38:14,377 --> 01:38:16,515
- You nearly had it. - Jae Suk, please spin all three.

2997
01:38:16,516 --> 01:38:19,116
- Gosh, this is driving me nuts. - We need to have all three chances.

2998
01:38:19,117 --> 01:38:20,317
Let me try spinning them once.

2999
01:38:20,356 --> 01:38:22,396
- The three... - We need to have all three chances.

3000
01:38:22,426 --> 01:38:24,555
- I should go this way. - It's hard to get them spinning.

3001
01:38:24,556 --> 01:38:27,527
- The table is too small. - That way.

3002
01:38:28,396 --> 01:38:30,666
- That way. - Okay, very good.

3003
01:38:30,667 --> 01:38:32,066
- And right here. This way. - You're doing well.

3004
01:38:32,067 --> 01:38:34,666
Oh, that was great!

3005
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:35,906
- Okay. - Try it.

3006
01:38:35,907 --> 01:38:37,567
- I stabbed it! - Darn it.

3007
01:38:40,506 --> 01:38:42,145
(She stabbed it...)

3008
01:38:42,146 --> 01:38:44,006
(but lost it.)

3009
01:38:46,646 --> 01:38:47,646
Hae Ri.

3010
01:38:48,377 --> 01:38:50,145
You have to hold it well after you stab it.

3011
01:38:50,146 --> 01:38:51,246
- Right. - We should do it like this.

3012
01:38:51,247 --> 01:38:53,116
- I'll spin them. - Follow the coin.

3013
01:38:53,117 --> 01:38:54,255
Okay, let's try it now.

3014
01:38:54,256 --> 01:38:55,925
- Let's try it. - All right, the ninth try!

3015
01:38:55,926 --> 01:38:57,827
- In 1, 2, 3. Here we go! - Here we go!

3016
01:38:57,926 --> 01:38:59,526
- Please! - Let's go!

3017
01:38:59,527 --> 01:39:01,127
- Just get all three spinning. - Please.

3018
01:39:01,197 --> 01:39:02,225
Ready...

3019
01:39:02,226 --> 01:39:03,326
Let's make this legend come true.

3020
01:39:03,327 --> 01:39:08,737
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on try number 9.)

3021
01:39:12,907 --> 01:39:14,207
There. It's alive.

3022
01:39:14,907 --> 01:39:16,306
There. One, two...

3023
01:39:16,506 --> 01:39:18,247
(All three are spinning.)

3024
01:39:18,676 --> 01:39:20,817
There you go. Please.

3025
01:39:37,803 --> 01:39:38,933
There.

3026
01:39:41,133 --> 01:39:43,673
(Fail)

3027
01:39:50,883 --> 01:39:51,954
(Reading their faces)

3028
01:39:54,214 --> 01:39:55,284
What do we do?

3029
01:39:55,454 --> 01:39:56,654
Why did you go for it?

3030
01:39:58,523 --> 01:40:00,523
You need to know how to be satisfied in life.

3031
01:40:01,294 --> 01:40:03,562
- Do we have 1 try left? - Yes, just 1.

3032
01:40:03,563 --> 01:40:05,133
- We're in trouble. - What do we do?

3033
01:40:05,864 --> 01:40:06,893
Jae Suk, what do we do?

3034
01:40:07,133 --> 01:40:08,864
Gosh, we'll lose everything.

3035
01:40:09,704 --> 01:40:11,632
Will they lose all three before their eyes?

3036
01:40:11,633 --> 01:40:12,834
Gosh, this is seriously...

3037
01:40:13,374 --> 01:40:15,802
Right, they said this earlier.

3038
01:40:15,803 --> 01:40:17,444
They were satisfied with the 1st 2.

3039
01:40:19,473 --> 01:40:20,873
Can you just keep spinning them?

3040
01:40:20,874 --> 01:40:23,274
- We did have many tries left. - Let's just keep practicing.

3041
01:40:23,614 --> 01:40:24,982
It is possible.

3042
01:40:24,983 --> 01:40:26,653
(Focused)

3043
01:40:26,654 --> 01:40:28,382
- Let's just try it. - I can see something now.

3044
01:40:28,383 --> 01:40:29,682
- When it's about to die out... - You can see something?

3045
01:40:29,683 --> 01:40:30,683
I can see it now.

3046
01:40:31,324 --> 01:40:32,393
No, I can't.

3047
01:40:32,624 --> 01:40:34,153
You have to stab it when it's about to die out.

3048
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:35,423
No, I see the nucleus here.

3049
01:40:35,964 --> 01:40:37,262
(They start practicing like mad before their last try.)

3050
01:40:37,263 --> 01:40:38,694
- This is so hard. - Again.

3051
01:40:40,593 --> 01:40:41,933
Gosh, it won't work.

3052
01:40:44,034 --> 01:40:45,074
That was so close.

3053
01:40:45,504 --> 01:40:47,273
This is seriously infuriating.

3054
01:40:48,173 --> 01:40:50,504
Don't you think you'll dream about these coins?

3055
01:40:51,173 --> 01:40:52,573
(Their bright smiles are gone.)

3056
01:40:52,574 --> 01:40:53,914
- What do we do? - Go again.

3057
01:40:54,513 --> 01:40:55,584
One.

3058
01:40:56,114 --> 01:40:57,343
- Two. - Okay.

3059
01:40:58,044 --> 01:40:59,414
- Three. - Three. Okay.

3060
01:41:00,714 --> 01:41:01,983
- Three. - Three. Okay.

3061
01:41:05,994 --> 01:41:08,364
(He stabbed it!)

3062
01:41:09,494 --> 01:41:11,433
- Please. That's it. - Yeon Seok.

3063
01:41:11,694 --> 01:41:12,932
He can do this.

3064
01:41:12,933 --> 01:41:14,732
(Their hope is rekindled.)

3065
01:41:14,733 --> 01:41:15,863
You can totally do this.

3066
01:41:15,864 --> 01:41:17,380
- Yeon Seok, you can do this. - That's how you do it.

3067
01:41:17,404 --> 01:41:18,703
- Do you remember? - Yeon Seok.

3068
01:41:18,704 --> 01:41:20,302
- I see the nucleus. - That's how you do it.

3069
01:41:20,303 --> 01:41:21,472
All right. Don't do it too quickly.

3070
01:41:21,473 --> 01:41:23,142
- I can see the nucleus of the coin. - You saw the nucleus, right?

3071
01:41:23,143 --> 01:41:24,743
- All right. - He said he saw the nucleus.

3072
01:41:24,744 --> 01:41:26,113
- If I go like this... - That's how you do it.

3073
01:41:26,114 --> 01:41:27,812
- Okay. - Look at the nucleus.

3074
01:41:27,813 --> 01:41:29,083
- All right. Look. - The nucleus.

3075
01:41:29,084 --> 01:41:30,983
- You have to wait long enough. - Okay.

3076
01:41:31,084 --> 01:41:32,382
- All right. - This is our last try.

3077
01:41:32,383 --> 01:41:34,023
All right. Seriously. We're so desperate.

3078
01:41:34,824 --> 01:41:36,453
All right. In 1, 2, 3.

3079
01:41:36,454 --> 01:41:37,552
- Let's go! - Here we go!

3080
01:41:37,553 --> 01:41:39,823
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their final try.)

3081
01:41:39,824 --> 01:41:41,344
- Look at the nucleus. - That's right.

3082
01:41:42,063 --> 01:41:43,863
- Ready. - Standing up is a good idea.

3083
01:41:43,864 --> 01:41:45,132
- You can go down straight. - Set...

3084
01:41:45,133 --> 01:41:47,432
(They can't back out any further.)

3085
01:41:47,433 --> 01:41:49,704
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their final try.)

3086
01:41:50,534 --> 01:41:51,603
Watch it for long enough.

3087
01:41:52,103 --> 01:41:53,423
You have to watch it for a while.

3088
01:41:54,133 --> 01:41:55,173
Hang on.

3089
01:41:55,744 --> 01:41:56,744
Watch it for a while.

3090
01:41:57,744 --> 01:41:58,813
Hang on.

3091
01:41:59,714 --> 01:42:01,243
We have to do it again, because...

3092
01:42:01,244 --> 01:42:02,284
Hang on.

3093
01:42:03,084 --> 01:42:04,683
We have to do it again, because...

3094
01:42:04,813 --> 01:42:07,513
- He didn't spin them all. - I didn't spin all the coins.

3095
01:42:08,423 --> 01:42:10,683
(The last try was suddenly paused.)

3096
01:42:10,723 --> 01:42:12,293
(He's trying to patch things up.)

3097
01:42:12,294 --> 01:42:13,653
- I didn't spin all the coins. - He didn't do it.

3098
01:42:13,654 --> 01:42:15,262
- I didn't spin all the coins. - He didn't spin the third one yet.

3099
01:42:15,263 --> 01:42:16,823
- This could happen. - He didn't spin the third one yet.

3100
01:42:16,824 --> 01:42:18,369
- No, this could happen. - But the third one...

3101
01:42:18,393 --> 01:42:20,163
- This could happen... - But the third one wasn't...

3102
01:42:20,164 --> 01:42:21,533
- This could happen, right? - He didn't spin...

3103
01:42:21,534 --> 01:42:22,602
- the third one yet. - This is so funny.

3104
01:42:22,603 --> 01:42:23,932
- I wasn't entirely ready yet. - No, just...

3105
01:42:23,933 --> 01:42:25,972
- I have to say, "Here we go." - He didn't spin the third one.

3106
01:42:25,973 --> 01:42:27,233
He didn't spin the third one.

3107
01:42:27,673 --> 01:42:29,102
He didn't spin the third one.

3108
01:42:29,103 --> 01:42:30,704
(Threatening them with a fork)

3109
01:42:31,273 --> 01:42:32,773
I have to say, "Here we go."

3110
01:42:33,813 --> 01:42:35,682
Gosh, I wasn't warmed up yet.

3111
01:42:35,683 --> 01:42:37,563
(Just throwing out any word that comes to mind)

3112
01:42:37,813 --> 01:42:39,573
- I wasn't warmed up yet. - Gosh, seriously.

3113
01:42:39,683 --> 01:42:41,659
- Gosh, I wasn't warmed up yet. - This is so funny.

3114
01:42:41,683 --> 01:42:44,052
- Hey, Jae Suk. - I wasn't warmed up yet.

3115
01:42:44,053 --> 01:42:45,623
- You can do it. - All right.

3116
01:42:45,624 --> 01:42:47,693
- Let's do it! - Let's go!

3117
01:42:47,694 --> 01:42:50,463
- You nearly hit the last one too. - I almost did.

3118
01:42:50,464 --> 01:42:51,863
- But no, he didn't. - We didn't say, "Here we go."

3119
01:42:51,864 --> 01:42:53,034
Wasn't that quite smooth?

3120
01:42:53,864 --> 01:42:55,403
(Almighty Yoo is the best.)

3121
01:42:55,404 --> 01:42:58,164
- Seriously, that was scary. - I can't forget his tone of voice.

3122
01:42:58,733 --> 01:43:00,673
Hang on, Jae Suk. Take a deep breath.

3123
01:43:01,173 --> 01:43:02,173
(Exhaling)

3124
01:43:02,343 --> 01:43:03,903
- Okay, here we go. - All right. Let's go!

3125
01:43:03,904 --> 01:43:04,914
- Let's go. - Let's go.

3126
01:43:05,273 --> 01:43:06,273
Here we go.

3127
01:43:06,274 --> 01:43:08,354
(Out of 10 total tries, they're on their final try.)

3128
01:43:08,513 --> 01:43:11,313
(This is really their last try.)

3129
01:43:20,654 --> 01:43:23,522
(All three are spinning well!)

3130
01:43:29,750 --> 01:43:33,521
(They just have to stab one!)

3131
01:43:42,120 --> 01:43:43,159
The end.

3132
01:43:43,160 --> 01:43:45,290
(The end)

3133
01:43:47,731 --> 01:43:49,171
- Let's take out the prizes. - Okay.

3134
01:43:51,170 --> 01:43:52,610
- Let's take out the prizes. - Okay.

3135
01:43:54,571 --> 01:43:56,011
- Let's take out the prizes. - Okay.

3136
01:43:56,710 --> 01:43:57,910
"Let's take out the prizes?"

3137
01:44:00,410 --> 01:44:02,240
- We can't help it. - It's okay.

3138
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:04,390
- It's okay. - It's okay. They're leaving.

3139
01:44:04,750 --> 01:44:06,221
- Bye. - Bye.

3140
01:44:08,321 --> 01:44:10,401
- If it's heavy, you can leave it. - We're so sorry.

3141
01:44:10,521 --> 01:44:12,351
"If it's heavy, you can leave it?"

3142
01:44:14,761 --> 01:44:17,691
They're really just taking them out right away.

3143
01:44:19,160 --> 01:44:21,029
- Gosh, I'm so stressed. - We're really sorry.

3144
01:44:21,030 --> 01:44:22,800
- Gosh, you worked so hard. - Gosh, don't be.

3145
01:44:22,801 --> 01:44:24,300
You worked so hard.

3146
01:44:24,301 --> 01:44:26,340
(You worked so hard.)

3147
01:44:27,901 --> 01:44:29,669
Gosh, this is...

3148
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:31,810
This is a small gift.

3149
01:44:31,811 --> 01:44:33,140
(Giving them their souvenir)

3150
01:44:33,141 --> 01:44:35,539
- What is it? - Pardon?

3151
01:44:35,540 --> 01:44:37,356
- Who is it? - The Whenever Possible souvenir.

3152
01:44:37,380 --> 01:44:39,521
- Oh, Whenever Possible. - Goodness, thank you.

3153
01:44:41,151 --> 01:44:43,151
- Gosh, we're sorry. - No, don't be.

3154
01:44:43,490 --> 01:44:45,391
- It was hard. - We got too greedy.

3155
01:44:45,651 --> 01:44:46,761
No, but...

3156
01:44:49,460 --> 01:44:52,159
- On their anniversary... - This is...

3157
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:54,840
They have to open for business soon, but we really killed the mood.

3158
01:44:55,931 --> 01:44:58,571
- It's sad. - I'll have to open with a drink.

3159
01:44:59,301 --> 01:45:00,839
The mood was great earlier.

3160
01:45:00,840 --> 01:45:02,339
Seeing the prizes taken out right before your eyes...

3161
01:45:02,340 --> 01:45:03,840
(Solemn)

3162
01:45:04,811 --> 01:45:06,110
So,

3163
01:45:06,111 --> 01:45:09,111
I wonder how you will make this meaningful for your anniversary.

3164
01:45:11,210 --> 01:45:13,051
- It's the 22nd, right? - Yes.

3165
01:45:13,580 --> 01:45:15,851
Oh, maybe it disappeared because it was 2 minus 2.

3166
01:45:16,590 --> 01:45:17,721
Oh, my. I must be crazy.

3167
01:45:19,290 --> 01:45:21,520
- Why am I putting meaning to that? - Are you teasing them?

3168
01:45:21,521 --> 01:45:23,460
- I'm really sorry. - That was the worst.

3169
01:45:23,861 --> 01:45:25,090
I was just so upset.

3170
01:45:25,861 --> 01:45:29,430
Well, it was your anniversary yesterday,

3171
01:45:29,431 --> 01:45:31,400
and we are a day late, but congratulations to you both.

3172
01:45:31,401 --> 01:45:33,140
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

3173
01:45:33,141 --> 01:45:34,999
- Congratulations. - Anyway,

3174
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,409
we had Min Kyung and Hae Ri of Davichi,

3175
01:45:38,410 --> 01:45:41,310
who is back with a new song. I had so much fun today.

3176
01:45:41,311 --> 01:45:43,010
- We had fun too. - Yes, thank you.

3177
01:45:43,011 --> 01:45:44,710
- We have a new song. - Yes.

3178
01:45:44,780 --> 01:45:46,580
- Could you sing the highlight? - Yes, a bit.

3179
01:45:47,981 --> 01:45:52,589
("Stitching" by Davichi)

3180
01:45:52,590 --> 01:45:53,660
They're so good.

3181
01:45:55,620 --> 01:45:57,861
(Touched)

3182
01:46:02,261 --> 01:46:04,141
Until the very end, you're being so annoying...

3183
01:46:04,670 --> 01:46:06,669
- What are you trying to do? - Why look at her like a stranger?

3184
01:46:06,670 --> 01:46:09,839
- Why did you drop out like that? - Why look at her like a stranger?

3185
01:46:09,840 --> 01:46:11,110
- You were so pretty. That's all. - Oh, is that why?

3186
01:46:11,111 --> 01:46:12,610
- Oh, that was it. - She looked pretty as she sang.

3187
01:46:12,611 --> 01:46:14,980
Still, you sang a nice song for them on their anniversary.

3188
01:46:14,981 --> 01:46:16,350
- Yes, really. - Thank you so much.

3189
01:46:16,351 --> 01:46:19,380
- Thank you. - Congratulations.

3190
01:46:20,080 --> 01:46:23,891
Still, they tried so hard for us,

3191
01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:25,691
so I don't have any regrets. It's okay.

3192

3193
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:28,919
- love each other. - love each other.
