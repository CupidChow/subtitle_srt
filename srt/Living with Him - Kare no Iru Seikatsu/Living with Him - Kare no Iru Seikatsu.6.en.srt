1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
All done.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Natsukawa.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Natsukawa.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Natsukawa, hurry up!

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
But...

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Here, I guess?

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Hmm?

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Yes, I win!

9
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:02,000
No, no no, how did you win? Geez.

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Middle school, huh...

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
You're still planning to join

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the baseball club?

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah, that's the plan.

14
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
They'll welcome you with open arms,

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
youth baseball superstar.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I wonder...

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And you, any club activities?

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Nope, I need to cook for my sisters.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I see.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I wonder if we'll end up in

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the same class again.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Hmm, well, there'll be more classes too.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But we've got three years, right?

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We'll end up together some year.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Yeah!

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Alright then,

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
let's play again!

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Alright!

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Seriously, go to bed already.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
- Shall we sleep?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hey,

32
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
are you asleep already?

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Mmm...

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Not yet.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Almost, maybe.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Almost.

37
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Hey,

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
even if we don't end up

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
in the same class,

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
we're still friends, right?

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
That's a given.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Goodnight.

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Goodnight.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Come on, wake up,

45
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
don't you have morning practice?

46
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm leaving then.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
In the end,

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
we never ended up in the same class

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
in middle school.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
And we went to different high schools.

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
By the way,

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I ran into Ryota's mom the other day.

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Oh, really?

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Ryota isn't joining any clubs

55
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
even in high school, did you know?

56
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Is that so?

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
- Huh, you didn't know?
- Nope.

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Oh my, really? You two were so close.

59
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
That's just how it is.

60
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
That's just how it is?

61
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Well, I'm off.

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
- Take care.
- Yeah.

63
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
(Living With Him)

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
(Episode 6)

65
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Natsukawa.

66
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Hey.

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Shopping?

68
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Yeah, something like that...

69
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
What's wrong?

70
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
That is...

71
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you sure?

72
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It tastes good for sure.

73
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
- Let me try some.
- Yeah.

74
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Bill please.

75
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Huh, buying underwear?

76
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Keep it down.

77
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Hey.

79
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You're buying it?

80
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's play baseball.

81
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
- Huh?
- Yeah?

82
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Let’s play baseball!

83
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What about the underwear?

84
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Saeko-san? It's been a while.

85
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's been a while. How are you?

86
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm good, I'm good. What's up?

87
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Well, Kazuhito-kun almost won

88
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the prefectural tournament...

89
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
That's why you called?

90
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Because he was so close to Koshien.

91
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Yeah.

92
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
He's still in grade 11,

93
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
maybe next year, right?

94
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Umm..

95
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Yes?

96
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I watched your game, I was so impressed.

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Oh, thank you.

98
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
- Umm...
- Yes?

99
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I'm Murabayashi from Grade 10.

100
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
If you don't mind, would you go out...

101
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Go out?

102
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Um, well, excuse me...

103
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Oh, wait.

104
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
You are...

105
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
- We're in the same class.
- Yoshida.

106
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You could at least remember my name.

107
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Sorry.

108
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
So, what did you want...

109
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
If you don't mind,

110
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
would you go out with me?

111
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Uh... I'm sorry.

112
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
- Huh? Why?
- I want to focus on my club activities.

113
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I see.

114
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'll find another moment.

115
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Huh?

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Another moment?

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Please go out with me!

118
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Please go out with me!

120
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
- Please, go out with me!
- I'm sorry!

122
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Why?

123
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I promise I won't interfere

124
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
with your club activities.

125
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Please, let try dating.

126
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Think of it as saving a life, please.

127
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Fine.

128
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Yoshida's a nice girl.

129
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I know.

130
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
It's not like you're getting

131
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
married or anything.

132
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Try dating in a way that

133
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
doesn't affect baseball.

134
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Or is there someone else you like?

135
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Sorry, I took long choosing my outfit.

136
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
- Let's go then.
- Yeah.

137
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
It's been years since

138
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I went to the movies.

139
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

140
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Wow, this is delicious!

141
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
What about yours?

142
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Hey, Kazuhito, hey!

143
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Oh, sorry, sorry.

144
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is yours good?

145
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You're really not interested in me,

146
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
are you?

147
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
No, it's not like that.

148
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Because you're always thinking

149
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
about something else.

150
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Kazuhito,

151
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
there's someone else you like, right?

152
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Forget it,

153
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
let's stop this.

154
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Huh?

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Wait.

156
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
And now, in the bottom of

157
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
the ninth inning,

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
with two outs and two strikes.

159
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In this tense atmosphere,

160
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
the high school senior pitcher,

161
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Tanaka Kazuhito,

162
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
needs just one more strike for

163
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
a complete shutout and

164
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
to advance to the top 16!

165
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
He winds up

166
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and throws!

167
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
- Missed three times in a row!
- Yay!

168
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
- Amazing!
- Three outs!

169
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
- Wonderful!
- I'm so glad!

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The high school senior pitcher,

171
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Tanaka Kazuhito, did it!

172
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He led the team to the last 16 round!

173
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Amazing!

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Have you decided on a university yet?

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Not yet.

176
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Still undecided between the three?

177
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
With sports recommendation?

178
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
No, it's four.

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They all have good conditions,

180
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
so it's hard to choose.

181
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Oww...

182
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's been happening a lot lately.

183
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Why don't you go see a doctor?

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,000
So, can I continue playing baseball?

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
It might be difficult.

186
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Why?

187
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Why?

188
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Hey,

189
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yoshida said there's someone else

190
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
you like, right?

191
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
If you really do like someone else,

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
at times like this,

193
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
it's okay to rely on them, isn't it?

194
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
(Natsukawa)

195
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Kazuhito!

196
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
- Oh!
- Long time no see.

197
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
What's up?

198
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Umm, I just happened to be passing by...

199
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Man, amazing job at Koshien!

200
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, thanks.

201
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I was really moved

202
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
you got into the final 16 teams.

203
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
That's too much.

204
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Is something wrong?

205
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
No, it's nothing.

206
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Well, that's good then.

207
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
See ya.

208
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Oh right,

209
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
here,

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
take this.

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
- But it's yours.
- It's fine.

212
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,000
- Hey, Natsukawa.
- Huh?

213
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
What do you think you should do

214
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
when you feel like

215
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
you're losing yourself?

216
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Sudden deep question, huh?

217
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I don't even know what I'm saying.

218
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Sorry, forget it.

219
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I don't think you need to do anything.

220
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Because you're you.

221
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I mean,

222
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I had all sorts of plans

223
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
for my high school and everything,

224
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,000
but in the end, I ended up like this.

225
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Just like when I was a kid.

226
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I guess deep down,

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
we don't really change.

228
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
So, you don't need to do anything.

229
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Huh? Sorry! Did I say something weird?

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
No.

231
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You're amazing, Natsukawa.

232
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But I don't want to hear that from you.

233
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're really cool.

234
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
No, I'm not.

235
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
- You're so cool.
- Not at all.

236
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
- As expected, you're awesome.
- No need to praise me.

237
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
- What about this?
- This one isn't hard at all.

238
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
- How?
- You have to get the point.

239
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
- Okay, okay.
- That's it.

240
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
But I understand this one.

241
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
- Then trying doing it.
- Yeah.

242
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
This question might appear on the exam.

243
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I also think so.

244
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Sometimes it's on the exam.

245
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
What is it?

246
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
- Hmm?
- What are you looking at?

247
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Where are you stuck?

248
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Here.

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
So that's how it is.

250
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Here we have to substitute values

251
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
for A and B.

252
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
- Yeah.
- Try substituting the values

253
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
and solve the problem.

254
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I think this should be B.

255
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
- Right.
- Yeah.

256
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You're right. Yeah.

257
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,000
(Announcement of Soto University
entrance examination results)

258
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Ah, Mom.

259
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
What a relief.

260
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I'm back.

261
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Welcome back.

262
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So, I bumped into

263
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Ryota-kun's mom earlier,

264
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
and guess what? Ryota-kun seems to be

265
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
heading to the same university as you.

266
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And then, us parents got all excited

267
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
and started talking about

268
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
having you two share a house.

269
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
But well, after giving it some thought,

270
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
it's a bit much, don't you think?

271
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Should we decline?

272
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Let's decline, yeah, let's do that!

273
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Ah, wait.

274
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Hey, let's get going.

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
Welcome!

276
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Excuse me, I'll have

277
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
some cheesecake, please.

278
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Sure, one piece?

279
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
No, two.

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
With your girlfriend?

281
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Umm, no...

282
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
With someone I like.

283
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Natsukawa.

284
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I'm relieved.

285
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I...

286
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
After that, you collapsed.

287
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Really?

288
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
How are you feeling?

289
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Can I borrow your hand for a moment?

290
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
My hand?

291
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Sure.

292
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
It's cool and feels nice.

293
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Is your fever getting worse?

294
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Maybe.

295
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Hey, Kazuhito.

296
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Huh?

297
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Is it okay with just your hand?

298
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
(Next episode)

299
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Natsukawa is so warm.

300
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,000
When people are sick,

301
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
they often need warmth, right?

302
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Natsukawa is a kind person.

303
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
So I understand what you're doing.

304
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Even though I understand,

305
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I can't help having a bias for myself.

306
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Being liked by someone like Kazuhito

307
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
makes me nervous.

308
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Because I like him,

309
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I can't say I like him easily.
