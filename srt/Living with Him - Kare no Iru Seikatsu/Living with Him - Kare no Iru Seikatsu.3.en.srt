1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
Can you kiss me?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Kiss?

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Ah.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Kiss Natsukawa?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I can't do it.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Right, sorry, I asked something weird.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Let's eat, come on, tonkatsu, tonkatsu.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
- Listen, Natsukawa...
- You like fried food, right?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Fried food is really the best.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
- Natsukawa.
- Could you get the plates ready?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'll cut them.

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
- Natsukawa!
- Huh?

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Oh, sorry.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
I mean, I really want you

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to forget about that,

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
it was just a joke.

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
A joke?

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Yeah, I was just kidding. A joke, yeah?

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, it fell flat though.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I see, just a joke?

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Yeah.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright, I'll go wash my hands.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
- Hello?
- Yoo-hoo!

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
- Brother, come on, open up.
- Open up.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
(Living With Him)

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
(Episode 3)
Yoo-hoo!

27
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
- Sorry to intrude.
- Sorry to intrude.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Amazing, what a nice room.

29
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's perfectly clean.

30
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ah!

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
If you're coming over,

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
give us a heads-up.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Oh my, Kazuhito-kun, it's been a while!

34
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Indeed. You're as beautiful as ever.

35
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Geez, I get that a lot.

36
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
- Hey, do you remember me?
- What about me?

37
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
- Ma ma...
- Sa sa...

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Mana-chan, Saki-chan,

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
of course, I remember.

40
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Oh, is your foot okay now?

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It's fine now, I'm invincible.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
- I invited Yurie-san too, you know.
- My mom?

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yes, but she said the inn is busy.

44
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh?

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
- Is this dinner?
- Yes, it's time.

46
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Oh no, I already bought some.

47
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I didn't know and you should have

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
let us know if you were coming.

49
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
- We did! We messaged in the afternoon!
- Huh?

50
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
- Oh, you didn't read it.
- Geez.

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're right. Sorry about that.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
- Geez!
- Read your messages!

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
- Sorry, sorry!
- Why didn't you read it?

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
- Wow.
- Amazing.

55
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

56
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Bon appétit.

57
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Of all things, why...

58
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Because Ryo-kun likes tonkatsu.

59
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
We'll finish it because

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Kazuhito-kun is here.

61
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Unlike our brother,

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
club athletes are always hungry.

63
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I haven't been exercising much lately.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Huh, what about baseball?

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Huh?

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You see, about baseball...

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Umm...

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Sorry,

69
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I should've mentioned it to them first.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- No, it's fine.
- Huh, what?

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Umm...

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
When I was a third-year in high school,

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I injured my shoulder,

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
so I couldn't play baseball anymore.

75
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Huh? Really? I'm sorry.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
It's okay.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Alright, I'll have this one then.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Delicious!

79
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Even though it's annoying,

80
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
but the shop one is delicious!

81
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Well then, I'll have some too.

82
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Delicious!

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Don't force yourself too much.

84
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
In the end, Kazuhito-kun's

85
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the only one eating, huh?

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Even if you change your hair color,

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
your personality remains the same.

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yeah.

89
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Who wants more tea?

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
- Me.
- Me.

91
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
But seriously, Kazuhito-kun is amazing.

92
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Like a character from a manga,

93
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
perfectly eating tonkatsu.

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
What do you mean by

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
'perfectly eating tonkatsu'?

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
But, he's always been like that, right?

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He can do anything.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Don't you have any weaknesses?

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Like, ghosts!

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
No, remember?

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
When he stayed over at our house...

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please take a look at this.

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
At night, it'll open by itself...

104
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm airing this urgently.

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
(Scary videos)
Here it is, a mysterious phenomenon...

106
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What?

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
- Huh?
- Huh?

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
- Who came?
- Huh?

109
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
- What's wrong?
- No need to be scared.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
It's fine.

111
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Seriously, he's perfect in every way!

112
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Well, in reality, it's not like that...

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
- Geez...
- He even went to Koshien...

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
- I'm really sorry!
- Don't worry about it at all.

115
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Oh no, his mental state is perfect too!

116
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're making him feel troubled

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
by saying that.

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
There he comes, the jealous monster!

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Who's a monster?

120
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Just eat and go home already.

121
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
- No going.
- In your dreams.

122
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
- How mean.
- Thank you.

123
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

124
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Ugh, lonely. I'm so, so lonely.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't forget us, okay?

126
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Absolutely, I mean it!

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I won't forget.

128
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
- When should we come next time?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
- When are you free again?
- What is it?

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You and Ryo-kun

132
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
don't have any problems, right?

133
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What's this all of a sudden?

134
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Well, you know, back in the day,

135
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
when you were troubled,

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
you made tonkatsu.

137
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Oh...

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Well,

139
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
even when things get tough,

140
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
just don't lie to yourself.

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Hmm?

142
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you lie,

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
you won't be able to

144
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
act normal, right?

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Behaving normally is the best.

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Okay?

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Alright, stop bothering him already.

148
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
- Thank you.
- No problem.

149
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Please say hi to Yurie-san for me.

150
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Yes.

151
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
- Well then.
- Yes.

153
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
- Bye-bye!
- See you later!

154
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We'll visit again.

155
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Bye-bye!

156
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I messed up.

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Right?

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
- What's wrong?
- About baseball...

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Why didn't you tell us about it earlier?

160
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I said I'm sorry.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
He told us not to worry about it, but...

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I wouldn't want to

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
bring it up if I were him.

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Right?

165
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yurie-san also mentioned

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
how he was quite down when he realized

167
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
he couldn't play baseball anymore.

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
- Ah...
- Ah...

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But she said

170
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
he managed to switch gears after a while

171
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and returned to his usual self,

172
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
so it'll be fine.

173
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Being able to switch gears by himself...

174
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
that's amazing,

175
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
- seriously amazing.
- Right?

176
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yurie-san and I

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
were saying how blessed we are

178
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to have such sons.

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
- Including our brother?
- Yeah.

180
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Well,

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
he's been looking after

182
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the Natsukawa family.

183
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Well, that too,

184
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
but there's more to it than that.

185
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yeah.

186
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Um,

187
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
sorry about my sisters

188
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
being so noisy earlier.

189
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
It's fine.

190
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Really?

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
That's not it.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Earlier, when I said it was a joke...

193
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Umm... Yeah?

194
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Actually, it wasn't really a joke.

195
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I mean, it's so embarrassing

196
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to even say it aloud.

197
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It might sound like I'm being conceited,

198
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I was wondering if you might like me,

199
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
and not as a friend.

200
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Umm, sorry. I'm really sorry.

201
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
And in order to confirm it,

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I tried to see if we could do something

203
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
that we don't do as friends,

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
and while trying to test

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
whether you would touch me or not,

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
it felt a bit weird.

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I see.

208
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Umm... I'm really sorry!

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It was so stupid of me,

210
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
and disrespectful to you.

211
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I won't do something like that again.

212
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,000
No, I should be the one who apologize.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How should I put it?

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I might have made you misunderstand.

215
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Misunderstand?

216
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
It's not that I don't want to kiss you,

217
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I just I couldn't.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Because, if you're not interested,

219
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I shouldn't be able to.

220
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I don't like the idea of it happening

221
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
impulsively or by force.

222
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Wait, are you saying...

223
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I...

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'm serious about you, Natsukawa.

225
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I like you.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But I don't want to force you,

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I want to respect your feelings.

228
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I don't need an answer or anything,

229
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I just wanted you to know that...

230
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
that's how I feel.

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Let's head back.

232
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
My feelings...

233
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Ugh! Sorry!

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I can't even understand my own feelings.

235
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Living with you has been so much fun.

236
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
But maybe it's just because

237
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
we get along so well...

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I just thought that living together...

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Never mind.

240
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I said I wouldn't kiss.

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
If trying this out

242
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
makes you uncomfortable,

243
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'll be shocked.

244
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
- But...
- You wouldn't know, right?

245
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Yeah...

246
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
If you feel forced living with me,

248
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
just say it,

249
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I'll leave.

250
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Yeah.

251
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
If Natsukawa is okay with it,

252
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'll continue living this way.

253
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I understand.

254
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I wasn't going to tell you,

255
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
but you found out.

256
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Hey.

257
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Huh?

258
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Other than kissing,

259
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is there anything else?

260
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Something you'd like me to do,

261
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
within my capabilities?

262
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Maybe that's not it.

263
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
It's not like that, right?

264
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
But, isn't it tough?

265
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Living together while

266
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
holding onto feelings like that,

267
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
pretending like nothing happened?

268
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So,

269
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I thought if there's anything

270
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I could do, I'd try,

271
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
but I can't think of anything,

272
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
and I can't do anything.

273
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
No, thanks for thinking of me.

274
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No...

275
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Then,

276
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
since you brought it up,

277
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
just one thing.

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It's been a while since a sleepover.

279
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
We do this every day, though.

280
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
That's not what I mean by sleepover.

281
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
This is cramped, huh?

282
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Should I sleep on the floor?

283
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Then it wouldn't be a sleepover.

284
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Is that so?

285
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
But I don't think I can sleep.

286
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Wait, before going to bed,

287
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
how about it?

288
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Huh?

289
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
A match.

290
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Huh?

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
So nostalgic! You still had that?

292
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
We used to play this a lot

293
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,000
during sleepovers.

294
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Yeah! We'd bring loads of snacks.

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And cola.

296
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
- Right, cola! Let's do it!
- Yeah.

297
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Well, since we're playing...

298
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Exactly!

299
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
(Crispy sweet potatoes)

300
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
- Found it!
- Oh yeah, that's it.

301
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
And maybe these ones too?

302
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
- Oh!
- I'm getting excited!

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
- Me too.
- Let's head back, quickly!

304
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Welcome.

305
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
How is it?

306
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
First things first, gotta have the cola.

307
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You're right.

308
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There's nowhere left for you to place.

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Wait, just a sec.

310
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Can't find it. Wait a moment.

311
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
There's really no place.

312
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
How come there's none?

313
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
There has to be one.

314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Impossible. There must be some place.

315
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Is there really none? Wait a sec.

316
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Hurry up, Natsukawa.

317
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Can I pass?

318
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't think I'll make it.

319
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You can still place it.

320
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
- Look closer.
- I can't find it.

321
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
This!

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I win!

323
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
No, that doesn't count!

324
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
I win!

325
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Please, one more time, just one more!

326
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
- Alright.
- Okay.

327
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Natsukawa.

328
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Cover yourself properly.

329
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
There's nowhere to escape to.

330
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And I already conveyed my feelings.

331
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
It's unfair.

332
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Can't sleep?

333
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Sorry for waking you up.

334
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
It's okay.

335
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Are you feeling unwell?

336
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
No, it's nothing.

337
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Huh, you're scared of ghosts too?

338
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Then, when we were watching the TV...

339
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Yeah, anyone would be scared by that.

340
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's normal.

341
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
- Normal?
- Yes.

342
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But, Natsukawa, you can still sleep,

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
that's amazing.

344
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well, that's because

345
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
you're here next to me.

346
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I see, then...

347
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
My mom does this

348
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
for my sisters sometimes.

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
They say

350
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
animals feel reassured

351
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
when they hear a heartbeat.

352
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Is that so?

353
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Besides, you seem to have it tough.

354
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You don't have to be

355
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
perfect in front of me.

356
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Yeah.

357
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Goodnight.

358
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Thank you.

359
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Can't sleep?

360
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Scary, isn't it?

361
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Are you half asleep or what?

362
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Then...

363
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Ah!

364
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
(Next episode)

365
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Haruna,

366
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
let's say we like someone

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
we're really close to.

368
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
If the other party says they feel good

369
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
but doesn't know if it's love or not,

370
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
What would you do?

371
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
There are people who keep waiting

372
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and people who look for feelings

373
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
A love without a solution is painful.

374
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,000
and give up.

375
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I'll probably quickly give up

376
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,000
and find someone new.

377
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Is that so?
