"Living With Him"
(Episode 8)

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I can't sleep.

3
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
(Sorry for the sudden notice,)

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
(but I think I'll be able to
come home tonight)

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Alright!

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
(Asuka Festival)

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Huh, it's today?

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If you can't make it home early,

9
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
how about going to

10
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
the festival together?

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
No, no, no,

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
that's not it at all.

13
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Ugh, seriously!

14
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Alright!

15
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Just taking care of the futon

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
should be alright.

17
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Excuse me.

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Alright then.

19
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Hmm?

20
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
(Room for rent)

21
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
He's moving out?

22
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
No. No way.

23
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
No,

24
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
this is fine.

25
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But

26
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
what should I do?

27
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Hmm?

28
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Ryota.

29
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Oh!

30
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Huh? You guys live here?

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Yeah. Wait, you live around here?

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
No, I'm on my way back

33
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
from staying at a friend's.

34
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Ah, I see.

35
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hey,

36
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
are you free?

37
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Excuse me.

38
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Just sit wherever you want.

39
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
By the way, how long is

40
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Tanaka going to be absent?

41
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He's supposed to be back today.

42
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I see.

43
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
No wonder the room looks so clean.

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's not like it's extra clean

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
or anything.

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I see.

47
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
So, are you two dating already?

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Huh? Why would you think that?

49
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Ryota,

50
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
do you know my hobby?

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Huh? No, I don't.

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's observing people.

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I can tell by looking at you guys,

54
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
especially Tanaka.

55
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Don't you feel disgusted?

56
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
What's disgusting about liking someone?

57
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Huh?

58
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Can I eat this?

59
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The last question you asked me

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
was also about you, wasn't it?

61
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
So,

62
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
did you figure out

63
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
your feelings for Tanaka?

64
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I figured it out.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But I don't dare say it.

66
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Not everyone is like Haruna.

67
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I don't want Tanaka to be

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
looked at weirdly

69
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
for choosing me as a partner.

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
He's a serious guy,

71
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
he'd probably cherish me a lot

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
if we get together.

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I can't create a future with that guy.

74
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
So I want him to be happy

75
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
without wasting his time with me.

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Wasting his time?

77
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yeah, if he dates someone he likes,

78
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
he'd probably dote on them,

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
always be by their side, hug them,

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
kiss them, and shower them with

81
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
a lethal dose of affection.

82
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yeah, I guess so.

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Well, whether you respond to

84
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Tanaka's feelings or rejects them,

85
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
it's up to you.

86
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
You have the freedom to make decisions.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But...

88
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You have no right to decide

89
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
what makes Tanaka happy.

90
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
About what the world thinks of him

91
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
and his future,

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
do you think that

93
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
a cautious guy like him,

94
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
has never worried
about things like that?

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Even so, why do you think

96
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
he confessed to you?

97
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hey, Ryota,

98
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You hope for that guy to be happy

99
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but you'll deny the happiness he wants?

100
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Also, when you talk

101
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
about Tanaka's future,

102
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
do you realize you could say

103
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
the same about yourself?

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Do you think dating Tanaka would be

105
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
a waste of your time and happiness?

106
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I...

107
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I...

108
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Huh?

109
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
My feelings for Kazuhito...

110
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Wait, tell that to him.

111
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm going to see him.

112
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Wait, calm down,

113
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
wipe your tears first.

114
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Huh? Oh, sorry, I just felt relieved...

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm back.

116
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Oh.

117
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
What did you do, Haruna?

118
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Don't make such a scary face.

119
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
- What are you doing?
- Wait, Kazuhito...

120
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I didn't do anything to make you angry.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Then why is Natsukawa crying?

122
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
No, it's just...

123
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So you're able to get angry too.

124
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
- That's not what I'm asking.
- Stop it!

125
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You're the cause.

126
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Huh?

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Why would I...

128
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:30,000
There, you guys talk about it properly.

129
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, I'm going now.

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Natsukawa, hang in there.

131
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Yeah.

132
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Umm...

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
What happened?

134
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
No,

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
just like Haruna said,

136
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
nothing unpleasant happened.

137
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
But, your tears...

138
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I'm really sorry,

139
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
even though I'm all grown

140
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I still cry in front of others.

141
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What about my being the cause?

142
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
About that...

143
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I knew it.

144
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I troubled you, right?

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
That's not it!

146
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Then why?

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I felt lonely without you.

148
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Huh?

149
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Are you crying because you're lonely?

150
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Oh, wait, no.

151
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
No, that's correct.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Without you, I felt lonely.

153
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
And I didn't want someone else

154
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
hitting on you at the party.

155
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
But, when I think about the future,

156
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I thought that

157
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I wouldn't be good enough,

158
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
so I didn't dare say anything.

159
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You've been through a lot,

160
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
and I know it's too late now,

161
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
but

162
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'll do my best to make you happy.

163
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I want to be with Kazuhito.

164
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Natsukawa.

165
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I really do like Kazuhito.

166
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
No way.

167
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
It's true!

168
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Oh, now I'm crying again,

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
how embarrassing.

170
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Ow, hey! That hurts!

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Are you hurt?

172
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
But I'm glad.

174
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's not a dream, right?

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
It's not a dream.

176
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I like you, Kazuhito.

177
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Oh man,

178
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
what do I do?

179
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
This is the happiest moment of my life.

180
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Kazuhito.

181
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I'm also like Kazuhito.

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've also fallen deeply

183
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
in love with you,

184
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
so I kissed you.

185
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
When you're embarrassed,

186
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
you always switch to polite language.

187
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Huh? That's not true.

188
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hey,

189
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I want to be with you forever,

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so please don't move out,

191
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
don't stop being roommates.

192
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Huh?

193
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Don't stop being roommates?

194
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What are you talking about?

195
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
No, I mean, you...

196
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I found this in your room.

197
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Oh,

198
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I just used it as a coaster

199
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
when I ate ramen.

200
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Huh, so you're not moving out?

201
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
No, I'm not moving out.

202
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
This is so embarrassing.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Hey, Natsukawa.

204
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Huh?

205
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Alright, let's go.

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

207
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Phew, finally done.

208
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Good job. Want something to drink?

209
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hey, there you are!

210
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Hey, hey, hey!

211
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
So, there's this

212
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mitarashi Festival in Shibuya.

213
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Do you want to go together?

214
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
- Hmm?
- Shibuya, huh? Seems crowded.

215
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You sound like an old person again.

216
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Isn't there any festival around here?

217
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Well, the one here ended

218
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
quite a while ago.

219
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh, that one.

220
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
- Which one?
- Forget it.

221
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Oh Natsukawa, it's time.

222
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
- Right,
- Let's go.

223
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
See you later then.

224
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
See you later.

225
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Hey, lend me your ear.

226
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Even now, I still kind of

227
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,000
really want to date Kazuhito.

228
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,000
But whenever I see him with Ryo-chan,

229
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I feel all squishy

230
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
and gooey inside.

231
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
What's up with that?

232
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Mmm.

233
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I see, you too.

234
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Huh? What?

235
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Welcome aboard.

236
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Welcome aboard?

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I see,

238
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
so the festival ended on that day.

239
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
But the situation on

240
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
that day was unsuitable.

241
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
You were really looking forward

242
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
to that festival?

243
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Well, you know, festivals mean...

244
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
yukatas and stuff.

245
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
So, should we do it?

246
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Huh?

247
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
What's with the sudden need for yukatas?

248
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I need them. I'll return them soon.

249
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You don't have to return them.

250
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Huh?

251
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You're going to wear them

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,000
with Ryo-kun, right?

253
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I thought so,

254
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
so I quickly re-tailored it.

255
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Thank you.

256
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
See you.

257
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
What's the matter?

258
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
It's nothing.

259
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
He used to have that

260
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
exact same expression when he was a kid.

261
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

262
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
How refreshing.

263
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Thank you.

264
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

265
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
How is it?

266
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Delicious!

267
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I'm glad.

268
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
- Delicious.
- Really? That's good.

269
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Let me try some.

270
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
This was my first try,

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
so I wasn't sure how it would turn out.

272
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
- Delicious?
- It's sweet.

273
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I really like this kind of firework.

274
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
- Like this?
- Yeah.

275
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
This is good.

276
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Careful now.

277
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Amazing.

278
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Be careful.

279
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
- Amazing!
- So beautiful.

280
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Right? It's so beautiful?

281
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
The red has now turned green.

282
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
- Brother's here.
- Quick, check the pictures!

283
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Whoa, he's too handsome.

284
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
And I told him solo shot.

285
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
He's so cool.

286
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
- So handsome.
- What are you two looking at?

287
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Wow, amazing.

288
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
- I'll forward it to you.
- Forward it.

289
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
- Looks good.
- Looks good.

290
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
- Beautiful.
- Right?

291
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Let's compete.

292
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
- Huh?
- It fizzled out.

293
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I won.

294
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
How did I lose?

295
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Good morning.

296
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Were you awake?

297
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
No, I was asleep.

298
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I see,

299
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
sorry.

300
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Natsukawa.

301
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I love you,

302
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
more than anyone in the world.

303
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Me too.

304
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Wow, this is restaurant-level.

305
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Once you get the hang of flipping it,

306
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
it's not that hard.

307
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I see.

308
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
It's all about timing, too.

309
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
If you're too early, it gets messed up,

310
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
and if you're too late, it burns.

311
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You have to get it just right.

312
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Are you listening?

313
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Yeah, I'm listening, I'm listening.

314
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
- Hey, Natsukawa.
- Hmm?

315
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Go on.

316
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Huh? Go on?

317
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
That's not fair.

318
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Here.

319
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
I'm sure there will be times

320
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
when things don't go well,

321
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
and things that will spin out of control

322
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
in the future.

323
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
But even so,

324
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
this life with you,

325
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
- is something incredibly precious.
- is something incredibly precious.

326
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
- Like omurice.
- Mmm.

327
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
- Omelet.
- Yeah.

328
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Or scrambled eggs.
