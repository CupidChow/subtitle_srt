1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
How about we go somewhere on Sunday?

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Oh,

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
of course, you don't have to

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
if you don't want to,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
and you might not be convenient.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Seriously? I'm in!

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Natsukawa, lower your voice.

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, sorry, I got too excited.

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I didn't expect you to be so happy.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Of course I'm happy,

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I'll come up with a few plans!

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Am I getting too carried away?

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Well,

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
honestly, I thought you might say no.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'm happy.

16
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
(Episode 5)

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Oh!

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Not many people know about this place.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Yeah, it's really nice here,

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
but it's empty.

21
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Oh, no,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I wasn't looking for an empty place.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I was actually looking for a spot,

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it happened to be like this.

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I know that, thank you for checking.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Alright, so first, the tent?

27
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Yeah.

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Have you ever been camping?

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Never, what about you?

30
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Me neither.

31
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
But I did extensive research for today,

32
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This camping trip will be perfect.

33
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Just leave it to me.

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh!

35
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Huh? Wait a second... I can't do it.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Is it this side?

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You're right.

38
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay, okay.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ready, set, go!

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait!

41
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Huh? It's so hard.

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Let me try.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Done.

44
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Huh? Why is it unstable?

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Maybe it's supposed to go here.

46
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Done.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Alright.

48
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Wow!

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Huh? This is food?

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
- Just leave it to me!
- Yeah.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Since it's camping...

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
ta-da! Let's use this.

53
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Oh, this feels so professional!

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Right?

55
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Get ready for some delicious food.

56
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
(Living With Him)

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Sorry,

58
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I couldn't get the fire going,

59
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
and I forgot to bring a lighter.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I couldn't do it either. It's fine.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
- What about here?
- Sounds good.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Nice weather.

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
They might have a lighter.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Let me ask them real quick.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
No, I'll go.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Excuse me,

67
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
do you happen to have a lighter?

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
- Would it be okay if we borrow it?
- Of course.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
- Thank you.
- Wait,

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
are you from Koshien by any chance?

71
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Ah, yes.

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
- Wow, it's really him!
- No wonder he seems familiar.

73
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I've always watched you!

74
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Thank you very much.

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
- Feel free to come and chat.
- We always welcome you.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
- Thank you. I'll borrow it.
- Sure.

77
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
- Wow, so handsome!
- So cool!

78
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let's set up a tent.

79
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Here, I borrowed it.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Thank you.

81
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Sounds exciting.

82
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
- Huh?
- I mean, those people.

83
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Oh, looks like someone remembers me

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Koshien really is something, huh...

85
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
So?

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So?

87
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
They know you and that's it?

88
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, yeah.

89
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I see.

90
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, they were just being polite

91
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and invited we over for a meal.

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I see. And?

93
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,000
So I said I wanted to eat with you.

94
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Wow!

95
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's ignited.

96
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Or do you want to

97
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
eat together with them?

98
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
No, I also preferred just the two of us.

99
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
- I'll go return it.
- Wait.

100
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
I'll go.

101
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
- Natsukawa.
- Hmm?

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How much should I peel?

103
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Peel until the brown disappears.

104
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Oh, got it.

105
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Oops, I get nervous when

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
someone watches me cut.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's fine.

108
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Oh no.

109
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Where should I start?

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
- Where should I start peeling?
- Right there.

111
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
The meat we got

112
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
this time is really good.

113
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Oh, is that so?

114
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yeah, it's definitely

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
tastier than our usual!

116
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
- You're right!
- Right?

117
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
- Hot!
- Careful!

118
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hot!

119
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's hot!

120
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Delicious.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Hey, can I take a picture of you eating?

122
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tasty, Absolutely delicious.

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Let me try this.

124
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Seafood.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'm taking picture, smile.

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Bon appétit.

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Mmm, delicious.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Here.

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Huh?

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Here.

131
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Huh? Seriously?

132
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Could it be, finally,

133
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
finally,

134
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
finally...

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Did I lose?

136
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Woo!

137
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Is this my first victory

138
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
in how many years?

139
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
As usual,

140
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
you are no good with this kind of thing.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yeah.

142
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
For Kazuhito-kun the scaredy-cat...

143
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Ta-da!

144
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
With these, even if ghosts show up,

145
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
you won't be scared.

146
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You gotta have these

147
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
coming to such place.

148
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
- Right.
- Yeah.

149
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But we don't have fire.

150
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Ah.

151
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Looks like they left.

152
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Well, maybe next time.

153
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
It's like we didn't get a proper finale.

154
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What's that supposed to mean?

155
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Let's play one more round.

156
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
- Another round?
- Another round.

157
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
- I won't let you win this time.
- Dream on.

158
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I want this moment to last forever.

159
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I find myself keep thinking

160
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
about such things,

161
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I...

162
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
By the way,

163
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,000
how about doing that thing tonight?

164
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That park across from

165
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
the family restaurant

166
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
- supposedly allows fireworks.
- Sorry.

167
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have a drinking party

168
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
that I mentioned tonight.

169
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,000
- Oh, right, sorry, I forgot.
- No, it's fine.

170
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
What time do you think you'll be back?

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I'm not sure,

172
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
but I'll try to come back

173
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
as soon as possible.

174
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No, it's okay, have fun.

175
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What are you going to do?

176
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Maybe I'll make some pasta and relax.

177
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I see.

178
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, I'll try to come back early.

179
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
- I told you...
- If I can make it,

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
let's play with the fireworks.

181
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
- Okay.
- Yeah.

182
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
But don't push yourself for me.

183
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Yeah, understood.

184
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Hey,

185
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Haruna calls you 'Ryota, ' right?"

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Yeah.

187
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Should I call you that too?

188
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Ah.

189
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You've always called me

190
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
'Kazuhito, ' right?"

191
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Well, either one is fine.

192
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I see.

193
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Want to try calling me that?

194
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
- Huh, your name?
- Yeah.

195
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Ryota.

196
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Sorry, let's stick with

197
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Natsukawa for now!

198
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Yeah, that's probably for the best!

199
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Oh, I have to go!

200
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
- I'll take care of it.
- Thanks.

201
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
- I'll quickly return.
- Take care.

202
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now I know my heart clearly.

203
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Thank you, everyone.

204
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Let's have a drink tonight,

205
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
cheers!

206
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

207
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
- To all of you, thank you very much.
- Likewise.

208
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Thank you very much. Drink up.

209
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- Thank you, drink up!
- Thank you, manager!

210
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Tanaka-kun, mind if I sit next to you?

211
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
- Umm, well...
- Please, go ahead.

212
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
- Thanks, Yoshi Eri-chan.
- No problem.

213
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Wait.

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
So, what are you going to eat?

215
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I don't know.

216
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
By the way,

217
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
what do you usually eat?

218
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You live alone, right?

219
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No, I live with someone.

220
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Oh, a girlfriend?

221
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
No, it's my childhood friend

222
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
from elementary school.

223
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Is that so?

224
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Then you probably cook

225
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
bachelor-style meals.

226
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Actually, he cooks most of the time,

227
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
but it's quite decent, you know...

228
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
And it's quite delicious.

229
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Not two.

230
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Just one.

231
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I wonder if he's having fun.

232
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You take leave quite often.

233
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's for personal business.

234
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Where did you go?

235
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Saitama.

236
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
- Saitama?
- That's so close.

237
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Saitama?

238
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Um, manager, I should...

239
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
- Let's have a chat first.
- There you are,

240
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
finally found my Tanaka-kun.

241
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Wow.

242
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But seriously,

243
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
you're so handsome and cool.

244
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Thank you very much.

245
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Hey, you don't have a girlfriend, right?

246
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
- No, I don't.
- I see.

247
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Teshigawara-san.

248
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Please give up on him.

249
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Huh, why? He's single.

250
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I won't let him go.

251
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
- I'd go for it.
- Oh!

252
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Umm, sorry,

253
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
actually, there's someone I like.

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Oh, really?

255
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
That's the first time

256
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I've heard that from you.

257
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I've kept it a secret.

258
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Well, it was pretty obvious.

259
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:19,000
- Huh?
- So, it's a one-sided crush?

260
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I don't have much hope,

261
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
but I'm waiting for an answer.

262
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
What? Tanaka? Unbelievable!

263
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Isn't he just being led on conveniently?

264
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I don't know.

265
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm sorry,

266
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
but I think it's time for me to...

267
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Let me teach you how to win them over,

268
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
shall I?

269
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
- Hello.
- Brother.

270
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
The girls in class want to see

271
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
the latest pics of Kazuhito-kun,

272
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Can you send them over?

273
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Take a great picture, okay?

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
There's none.

275
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
What?

276
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You don't have one in your stock?

277
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Some good-looking ones?

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Fine, I'll find something.

279
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Thanks.

280
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
So rush.

281
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
He's probably popular even

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
at the drinking party.

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
How slow.

284
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Listen, someone like Tanaka-kun

285
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
has to surround himself with girls.

286
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
- Is that so?
- Yes.

287
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Yeah, you need to play around a bit,

288
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
make them feel a little jealous,

289
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
ignite the flames of envy.

290
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Flames of envy?

291
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Just imagine,

292
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
they're burning up

293
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
with jealousy for you.

294
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Sounds good.

295
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
See? See?

296
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
That's why

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
we're gonna party until morning!

298
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
- Karaoke!
- Yay!

299
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
- Morning ramen!
- Exactly!

300
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But I'll pass on that.

301
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Umm...

302
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I want them to be jealous.

303
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
But I don't want to test them

304
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
or make them worry.

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I'll patiently wait.

306
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Please marry me!

307
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Yeah, that was definitely

308
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
an excellent response.

309
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hey, are you sure

310
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
he's not just being fooled?

311
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah.

312
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Alright, alright,

313
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Kazuhito is leaving.

314
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
- Let him go.
- Don't go yet.

315
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,000
- Stop, don't touch him.
- I haven't touched him.

316
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
- Kazuhito.
- Please stay.

317
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
- Try keeping him here.
- Do your best!

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
- See you later.
- See you later.

319
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Bye-bye!

320
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Thanks for helping.

321
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
It's nothing.

322
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
But are you sure you'll be okay?

323
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Totally. If things get rough,

324
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll just leave you behind.

325
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I see.

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Hey, Kazuhito.

327
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
I'm not going to pry into

328
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
who you're interested in or anything,

329
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
but I'm rooting for you.

330
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Thanks, I appreciate it.

331
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Bye.

332
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Wait.

333
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
There's a weather alert.

334
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
A weather alert?

335
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Rain.

336
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
The weather forecast was way off.

337
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Looks like he'll return in the morning.

338
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I see.

339
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
(An all-nighter, huh?)

340
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,000
(Take care of Kazuhito for me)

341
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
There's no need to care.

342
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
Hello.

343
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Huh, Kazuhito hasn't come back yet?

344
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Wasn't it an all-nighter?

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
No, the photo from earlier

346
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
was taken a while ago.

347
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Kazuhito already left.

348
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I thought he was already home by now.

349
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Sorry, goodbye.

350
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
The number you have dialed

351
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
is currently switched off...

352
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
What? Kazuhito? Huh?

353
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
Sorry for being late,

354
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I wanted to let you know,

355
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
but my phone died.

356
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
What about your umbrella?

357
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
They were all sold out.

358
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Just get in already!

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The train stopped because of the rain,

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
so I ran.

361
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
No need to speak, wait here for a sec.

362
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
Here!

363
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
If rains that bad, you should've

364
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
gone back to the store.

365
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
But...

366
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You're freezing!

367
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Take off your clothes!

368
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Yeah.

369
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Cover yourself.

370
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Sorry for the trouble.

371
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Dummy!

372
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It's moments like these

373
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
when you should rely on me.

374
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Learn to lean on me properly.

375
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'll go run the bath.

376
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,000
