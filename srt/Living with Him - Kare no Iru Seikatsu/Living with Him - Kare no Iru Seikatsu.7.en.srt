1
00:00:01,406 --> 00:00:02,843
Uh, no, not at all...

2
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,439
You're...

3
00:00:13,463 --> 00:00:14,627
willing to lend me more

4
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:15,752
than just your hand?

5
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:52,615
Thank you.

6
00:00:55,113 --> 00:00:56,456
Don't worry about it.

7
00:01:02,789 --> 00:01:04,789
Natsukawa, you're warm.

8
00:01:12,686 --> 00:01:13,686
Alright,

9
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,866
enough with the cuddling.

10
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,592
When people are sick,

11
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:22,952
they crave human warmth.

12
00:01:24,235 --> 00:01:25,409
Yeah.

13
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,357
Natsukawa, you're kind,

14
00:01:28,365 --> 00:01:30,299
So I understand what you're doing.

15
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:32,217
No...

16
00:01:34,865 --> 00:01:36,865
Even though I understand...

17
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,495
Don't look at me like that.

18
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:49,150
I can't help having a bias for myself.

19
00:01:52,184 --> 00:01:53,503
Kazuhito.

20
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,324
I'll get something to drink.

21
00:02:01,225 --> 00:02:02,225
Hey.

22
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,414
Hmm?

23
00:02:13,571 --> 00:02:15,486
You know...

24
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,655
I...

25
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,782
about you...

26
00:02:29,328 --> 00:02:30,591
Aren't you going to get that?

27
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:34,301
Oh, it's okay.

28
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:35,986
What were you about to say?

29
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:38,339
No, I can tell you anytime.

30
00:02:38,363 --> 00:02:41,679
It might be an important call.

31
00:02:44,035 --> 00:02:46,351
- Sorry, just a moment.
- Yeah.

32
00:02:52,317 --> 00:02:53,657
What's up?

33
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,542
A mixer?

34
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,263
No way.

35
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:06,207
Even if they insist...

36
00:03:09,841 --> 00:03:11,841
I'm not popular or anything.

37
00:03:18,782 --> 00:03:21,954
Sorry, can you decline for me?

38
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:25,626
Yeah.

39
00:03:27,602 --> 00:03:30,022
Oh, thank you.

40
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:32,509
I'll treat you to something next time.

41
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:36,007
Yeah.

42
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:37,842
Bye.

43
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:44,797
Sorry, what were you going to say?

44
00:03:47,804 --> 00:03:50,330
I'd better not say it today.

45
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,997
I'll leave it for another time.

46
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:24,597
Because I like him,

47
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,144
I can't say I like him easily.

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,593
Natsukawa,

49
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:46,609
can I have a bit of your time?

50
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,737
What is it?

51
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,778
Just listen to me in there.

52
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,895
Huh?

53
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,802
You're having trouble

54
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:02,884
with your responding, right?

55
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,858
No, it's not like that.

56
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,287
You see,

57
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,538
I said I didn't want to pressure you,

58
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,474
but I knew it would trouble you.

59
00:05:25,346 --> 00:05:28,887
I'm such a jerk, right?

60
00:05:31,989 --> 00:05:33,207
I knew from the start

61
00:05:33,216 --> 00:05:34,653
that you wouldn't reject me,

62
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,629
that even if you

63
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,997
didn't feel the same way,

64
00:05:39,021 --> 00:05:40,701
you'd still face me.

65
00:05:42,726 --> 00:05:44,779
- Kazuhito, I...
- I knew,

66
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:48,783
and I still said I liked you.

67
00:05:53,322 --> 00:05:55,204
I secretly think that

68
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,010
if you had a little bit of feelings for me,

69
00:05:58,783 --> 00:06:00,368
it would be good.

70
00:06:07,912 --> 00:06:09,928
I wanted to take advantage

71
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:16,218
of your kindness.

72
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:19,586
That's not true.

73
00:06:34,001 --> 00:06:36,442
Thank you for thinking about it.

74
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:44,088
But it's okay now.

75
00:08:02,562 --> 00:08:05,318
(Living With Him)

76
00:08:07,362 --> 00:08:09,989
(Episode 7)

77
00:08:11,643 --> 00:08:13,216
So sleepy...

78
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,768
You might not want matching mugs,

79
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,995
but are you interested?

80
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:25,002
If you're okay with it.

81
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,071
Ow, dammit!

82
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,878
You're up early, Natsukawa.

83
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,082
I just couldn't sleep. What about you?

84
00:08:51,914 --> 00:08:54,549
I slept fine.

85
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,219
You've got an orichalcum heart.

86
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,141
Is that a compliment?

87
00:09:00,165 --> 00:09:01,438
Yeah, it's a compliment.

88
00:09:01,446 --> 00:09:02,930
Do you want something to drink?

89
00:09:03,745 --> 00:09:05,618
Ah, thank you.

90
00:09:15,106 --> 00:09:17,648
- Sorry, Kazuhito! I'm really sorry!
- No, it's fine.

91
00:09:17,672 --> 00:09:19,164
I swear it wasn't on purpose,

92
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,103
really sorry!

93
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,746
I said, it's fine.

94
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,039
- I'll fix it with some glue.
- I said it's enough!

95
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:27,151
Kazuhito...

96
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,926
Don't worry about it,

97
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,637
it was cheap.

98
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:37,999
But...

99
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,779
I'll buy new one.

100
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:47,552
I've got an early shift

101
00:09:47,568 --> 00:09:48,646
at my part-time job,

102
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,177
so I need to get ready.

103
00:10:12,849 --> 00:10:14,872
Today...

104
00:10:14,896 --> 00:10:16,896
You're coming back, right?

105
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:21,457
Yeah. I should be back by evening.

106
00:10:22,402 --> 00:10:25,468
Okay, I'll whip up something for dinner.

107
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:31,324
Thank you, see you.

108
00:10:56,239 --> 00:10:57,683
Yes?

109
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:06,181
(To Ryo-kun, feed Kazuhito-kun well)

110
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,185
(From Saeko)

111
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,852
Alright, alright, I get it.

112
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:13,724
Work on the vegetables

113
00:11:13,748 --> 00:11:15,084
that spoil quickly first...

114
00:11:47,588 --> 00:11:49,104
That should do it.

115
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,911
Kazuhito.

116
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,928
- What's up?
- Ah, Natsukawa.

117
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,168
Sorry for the short notice,

118
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,722
but I need to go to my family's place.

119
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,961
Huh? Right now? Why?

120
00:12:29,321 --> 00:12:31,133
One of the senior staff at the inn

121
00:12:31,141 --> 00:12:32,914
sprained his waist this morning.

122
00:12:33,656 --> 00:12:35,356
Seriously?

123
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,867
They have a large group of guests

124
00:12:36,876 --> 00:12:37,980
coming in tonight.

125
00:12:38,004 --> 00:12:39,371
So my mom wants me to help out

126
00:12:39,387 --> 00:12:40,392
for about a week.

127
00:12:40,416 --> 00:12:42,416
I see.

128
00:12:42,786 --> 00:12:43,841
I'm counting on you to

129
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:44,833
take care of the house.

130
00:12:44,857 --> 00:12:47,076
Don't worry about it.

131
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,232
Thanks, see you.

132
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,149
Helping out at the inn?

133
00:12:58,528 --> 00:12:59,703
I wonder if he'll be wearing

134
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:00,953
a samue outfit.

135
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,450
No, no, no.

136
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,635
Bon appétit.

137
00:13:38,179 --> 00:13:40,179
A week, huh.

138
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:45,192
It's going to be long.

139
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,189
Mom, where should I take these?

140
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,449
- The Tsubaki Room.
- Got it.

141
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:02,525
After I drop these off,

142
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:03,752
I'll go pick up the guests from

143
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:04,728
the Fuji Room at the station.

144
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,215
Thank you.

145
00:14:14,747 --> 00:14:16,957
Hey, what did you get?

146
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,960
Brown sugar warabi mochi anpan bread.

147
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,984
I see.

148
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:23,881
It's good, I'm telling you.

149
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:25,758
If you want, you can have these.

150
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,968
Huh, why?

151
00:14:26,992 --> 00:14:28,928
I just made too much.

152
00:14:28,952 --> 00:14:30,702
Oh, did you accidentally make

153
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:32,101
Kazuhito's portion too?

154
00:14:32,903 --> 00:14:34,308
That's not it.

155
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:38,643
Wow.

156
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:41,482
Amazing.

157
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,901
This is perfect.

158
00:14:45,393 --> 00:14:49,323
I can make something like that too.

159
00:14:52,862 --> 00:14:54,219
Oh.

160
00:14:54,243 --> 00:14:56,789
Huh, that's so cute.

161
00:14:57,422 --> 00:14:58,757
I used to make them

162
00:14:58,766 --> 00:15:00,082
for my little sisters.

163
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,422
Your sisters got to eat

164
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,371
something this cute every day?

165
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,589
They're picky eaters.

166
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,289
I see.

167
00:15:07,313 --> 00:15:08,641
Hey, is there an opening

168
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,337
for an older sister?

169
00:15:10,921 --> 00:15:12,020
Huh?

170
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,230
Am I overdoing it?

171
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:47,381
Please enjoy your stay.

172
00:15:48,869 --> 00:15:50,563
Excuse me.

173
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:14,028
Bon appétit.

174
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:32,227
- Hello.
- Brother!

175
00:16:32,251 --> 00:16:33,510
Oh, it's you guys.

176
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,557
We just needed a dose of Kazuhito-kun's

177
00:16:35,581 --> 00:16:37,889
dreamy voice to recharge ourselves.

178
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,874
Our limbs are going numb

179
00:16:39,898 --> 00:16:41,578
from the withdrawal.

180
00:16:41,581 --> 00:16:44,354
- I'm hanging up.
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!

181
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,525
- Kazuhito isn't here.
- Why?

182
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:51,370
He's at his family's place.

183
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:52,687
Tch!

184
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,249
His family runs an inn, right?

185
00:16:55,265 --> 00:16:56,945
He's helping out there.

186
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,892
Wait, an inn?

187
00:16:58,917 --> 00:17:01,371
So that means...

188
00:17:02,082 --> 00:17:03,183
Isn't Kazuhito-kun in

189
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,374
the samue outfit awesome?

190
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,398
Wait, just imagining that.

191
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,656
- It's awesome.
- Super awesome, right?

192
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,175
I thought the same thing.

193
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,594
So you're home alone, feeling lonely?

194
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,921
I'm not lonely!

195
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,251
Man, living with Kazuhito

196
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,599
must be such a dream.

197
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:21,818
Totally, it's the best thing

198
00:17:21,842 --> 00:17:22,841
this year.

199
00:17:22,865 --> 00:17:23,771
You keep saying that,

200
00:17:23,796 --> 00:17:24,905
but what would you do if you

201
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,812
actually lived with him?

202
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:28,245
- If possible, he might fall for me!
- If possible, he might marry me!

203
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:29,324
Mmm.

204
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,783
Are you put off by that?

205
00:17:31,807 --> 00:17:33,598
No,

206
00:17:33,622 --> 00:17:35,029
but don't you think it'd be stressful

207
00:17:35,045 --> 00:17:36,256
if someone like him liked you?

208
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,158
Why?

209
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,494
Because many people are drawn to him.

210
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,877
Wouldn't you worry if you were

211
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,127
good enough for him?

212
00:17:44,243 --> 00:17:45,868
- Nope.
- Nah.

213
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:50,032
I'll think of myself as the chosen one.

214
00:17:50,056 --> 00:17:51,298
I'm so attractive that

215
00:17:51,323 --> 00:17:53,003
Kazuhito-kun likes me.

216
00:17:54,057 --> 00:17:56,051
You have strong mental fortitude.

217
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,654
Isn't it disrespectful to doubt yourself

218
00:17:57,678 --> 00:18:00,365
if someone like him likes you?

219
00:18:21,753 --> 00:18:23,753
Disrespectful?

220
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:40,392
Kazuhito?

221
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,684
(Hey, how are you? I'm overworked here,
it's like a sweatshop from morning till night)

222
00:18:51,124 --> 00:18:52,274
Wait,

223
00:18:52,298 --> 00:18:54,568
was I just smiling like crazy just now?

224
00:18:58,863 --> 00:19:00,780
Geez...

225
00:19:12,512 --> 00:19:13,922
I ended up coming.

226
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:19,276
But...

227
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,512
is it weird to show up unannounced?

228
00:19:25,145 --> 00:19:27,510
Alright, I'll just go back!

229
00:19:28,098 --> 00:19:29,952
Oh, Ryo-kun!

230
00:19:29,976 --> 00:19:32,136
- Auntie, hello.
- Hello.

231
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,441
Did you come to visit?

232
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,776
Oh... I just happened to be nearby.

233
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,321
Please, come in, come in.

234
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,634
Sorry, Kazuhito went out shopping.

235
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:01,709
No problem.

236
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:03,553
It's nice of you to visit

237
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,248
even though you live together.

238
00:20:05,273 --> 00:20:07,116
You two are really close, aren't you?

239
00:20:07,576 --> 00:20:09,576
Well, to a certain extent.

240
00:20:11,423 --> 00:20:14,064
Ryo-kun, have you found a girlfriend?

241
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,550
No, not at all.

242
00:20:17,097 --> 00:20:18,909
Since Kazuhito never talks

243
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:21,067
about those things, I worry...

244
00:20:22,173 --> 00:20:24,245
Eventually, I want him to

245
00:20:24,262 --> 00:20:26,480
run this inn with his wife.

246
00:20:28,731 --> 00:20:29,949
If you find a nice person,

247
00:20:29,965 --> 00:20:31,434
introduce them to him, okay?

248
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,532
Sure, leave it to me.

249
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:43,518
But Kazuhito is late.

250
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,578
Two, three.

251
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,848
One, two, three.

252
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,197
One, two, three.

253
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:55,794
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

254
00:20:55,818 --> 00:20:58,192
Did you pass Ryo-kun?

255
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,818
- Huh, Natsukawa?
- Yes.

256
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,244
He was here?

257
00:21:01,268 --> 00:21:03,444
But he left a moment ago.

258
00:21:03,468 --> 00:21:05,715
He left? Why?

259
00:21:05,739 --> 00:21:08,339
I don't know why.

260
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,913
Did you say anything weird to Natsukawa?

261
00:21:12,349 --> 00:21:14,364
I didn't say anything strange.

262
00:21:14,395 --> 00:21:17,106
Oh, I just told him to

263
00:21:17,122 --> 00:21:19,256
introduce a nice person to you.

264
00:21:24,615 --> 00:21:27,012
Kazuhito?

265
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:36,685
Pick up, Natsukawa.

266
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,964
(Welcome to Tsurumaki Onsen)

267
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,508
(Next episode)
I can't create a future with that guy.

268
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,375
So I want him to be happy without

269
00:23:29,384 --> 00:23:31,010
wasting his time with me.

270
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,250
You have no right to decide

271
00:23:33,282 --> 00:23:35,431
what makes Tanaka happy.

272
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:37,180
You hope for that guy to be happy

273
00:23:37,196 --> 00:23:39,353
but you'll deny the happiness he wants?

274
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:41,813
- What are you doing?
- So you're able to get angry too.

275
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,440
That's not what I'm asking.

276
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:45,257
You're the cause.

277
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:47,911
Hey.

278
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,989
I want to be with you forever.

279
00:23:51,904 --> 00:23:53,687
So...
