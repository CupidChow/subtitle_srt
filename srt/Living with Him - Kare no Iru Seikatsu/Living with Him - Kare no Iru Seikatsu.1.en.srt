1
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
I couldn't tell.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Due to work.

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
And my two younger sisters

4
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
are pretty carefree.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
(Brother, we'll leave it to you
Mana, Saki)

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
My high school life,

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
thanks in part to being the eldest,

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
was filled with

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
chores, chores, chores, chores,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
taking care of my sisters,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
chores, chores, chores...

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
And finally, I...

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
A club, huh...

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
My long-awaited life of living alone,

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
now I can finally use time for myself.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Natsukawa.

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Are you free?

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Living together begins.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
- You hold that side.
- Okay.

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
One, two...

21
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
- Wait.
- Hmm?

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Did you dye your hair?

23
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Yeah, you know, we're in university...

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Looking good.

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Thanks.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
- Alright, let's do this.
- Yeah.

27
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
One, two...

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Turn, turn, turn!

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Let's put it down here.

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
- What do you think?
- A little further back, I think.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
- A little further?
- Alright.

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
- One, two!
- It's collided!

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
(Living With Him)

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
(Episode 1)

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Sorry.

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Oh, right.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You can have this.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Huh?

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Huh, homemade?

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Yeah, my sisters made them for you.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Ah, Mana-chan and Saki-chan.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
It's edible because I made 90% of them.

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I see.

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ah, maybe it was better

45
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
if you didn't know.

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
That's not true, I'm happy.

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I see.

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Kazuto has always been perfect.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
- Huh?
- Huh? Roommates?

50
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Yes, Kazuhito's mother and I think that

51
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
if Kazuto-kun and you

52
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
attend the same university,

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
it would be great to live together

54
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
and save on rent, you know.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Hey, why are you deciding things

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
without any permission?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
- It's awesome, big brother!
- How come?

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Because Kazuto-kun's a star,

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
sparkling and all.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
What sparkling?

61
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Because he's been to Koshien,

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
so he's shining.

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Well, maybe you're right.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Well, it's settled then,

65
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
there's no helping it.

66
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Oh, now we can get to meet him!

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
- And often, too!
- Yeah, you're right!

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Hey hey, when are we going?

69
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Can we stay over? Please please!

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
- Let's stay over!
- So we'll meet him!

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
- I want to see him!
- Let's stay over!

72
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Delicious.

73
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I mean, it's too pushy, isn't it?

74
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Huh?

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Our parents get along,

76
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
but they should've asked first.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Could it be, you didn't want to

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
share a room with me?

79
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's not like I'm against it.

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
But honestly, I'm hesitant.

81
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Even though we're childhood friends,

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
it's been years since

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
we've properly seen each other,

84
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and in reality,

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
we're practically strangers.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Huh?

87
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
But we used to get along

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
in elementary school.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Plus, I often sleep over at your house.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
But in middle school,

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
we were in different classes,

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and in high school,

93
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
we were in different places,

94
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
and you were in the popular group,

95
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and I was in the normal group.

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Huh? What's that supposed to mean?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I'm actually looking forward

98
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
to living with you.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
You haven't changed at all.

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Really?

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Yeah, weird as always.

102
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Umm...

103
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You mean my weirdness

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
hasn't changed at all?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Hmm? I guess.

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But seriously,

107
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
you'll probably stop saying

108
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you're looking forward

109
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
to living with me soon.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Because it'll be awkward to

111
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Why's that?

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
bring a girlfriend over,

113
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
you know, with me around.

114
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
A girlfriend?

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Or, give me some advance notice,

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
so I can leave.

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Well, that's not a situation I'll be in.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I don't really

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
have long-lasting relationships.

120
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Changing your girlfriends constantly?

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not like that,

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm the one who gets dumped quickly.

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Huh?

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Huh? Huh?

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I've been bombarded with stories

126
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
about you being popular by my sisters...

127
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
- I'm serious.
- Then why? What's the reason?

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I wonder why.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Who would believe that.

130
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Oh, by the way,

131
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Want to go grab something

132
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
to eat tonight?

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I can cook.

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Huh?

135
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Well, Saeko gave me some ingredients,

136
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
- oh, Saeko is...
- Your mom, right, I remember.

137
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Anyway, I need to

138
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
clear away the ingredients.

139
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But aren't you tired?

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Oh, then I'll help with something too,

141
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
but I'm not good at cooking...

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's fine,

143
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and it's a hassle to go out.

144
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Then, I'll do the dishes.

145
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please? Please?

146
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Leave it to me!

147
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Just as I thought.

148
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Who would believe that.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yeah. Who would believe that.

150
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It's done.

151
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
- Let's eat.
- Yeah.

152
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Delicious.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Hmm?

155
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Maybe it's because you eat with

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
such distinct habits that you

157
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
keep getting dumped, you know?

158
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Are we back to that topic again?

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
But I just can't believe it.

160
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You're handsome, kind,

161
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
and your baseball skill

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
is attracting attention.

163
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Did I not mention it?

164
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Last year, I injured my shoulder,

165
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
so I can't play baseball anymore.

166
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
- Ah, sorry, I didn't know.
- No worries at all.

167
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
But even without baseball,

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
you're still a super catch.

169
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I must have other faults

170
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
in my girlfriend's eyes.

171
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Like what?

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Forget it. Let's not talk about me.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Got it.

174
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Then I'll find out why

175
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
you keep getting dumped.

176
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
- Huh?
- Do you have time tomorrow?

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I have work in the evening.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Then let's explore

179
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
the neighborhood until then.

180
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll find your faults from

181
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
a girlfriend's perspective.

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What's with that face?

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Just leave it to me!

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Got it.

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, I'm counting on you.

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Yeah.

187
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Hot hot hot hot,

188
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Kazuto, the bath's open...

189
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Huh?

190
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Kazuto-kun,

191
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
you've already finished

192
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
your summer homework?

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Well, sort of...

194
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But you've been practicing

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
baseball every day, right?

196
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
And you've been helping out

197
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
at the inn, too, right?

198
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I only do that when I can.

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Amazing!

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
- Oh!
- Did you both hear that?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
- Hello.
- He's finished his homework.

202
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
- I bet you two haven't finished yet.
- Never mind, Mom.

203
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
How could I?

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
This box...

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh, that's a souvenir cheesecake.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Wow!

207
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
- I'll have some too!
- Me too!

208
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Kazuto can eat too, right?

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Sure.

210
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Okay.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Here you go, Kazuto.

212
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Thanks.

213
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
- Here, Mom.
- Thank you.

214
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
- What about ours?
- What about ours?

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I'm getting them ready, so wait a bit.

216
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

217
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Oh, I might have forgotten to buy them?

218
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
- Huh? Stop teasing.
- Geez, Mom.

219
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Just kidding.

220
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Natsukawa.

221
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Natsukawa.

222
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Natsukawa.

223
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Whoa!

224
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Are you okay?

225
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Oh, sorry.

226
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
You're cold.

227
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
When did you come to sleep here?

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I got out of the bath yesterday

229
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
and just nodded off here.

230
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I can't believe it.

231
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Here.

232
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'll make some coffee now.

233
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
What?

234
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Where are the coffee cups?

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I probably didn't bring them.

236
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Seriously?

237
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I don't have any either.

238
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Oh well,

239
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
let's take a shower then!

240
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Alright, I'll take a quick shower,

241
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
and then we can go on

242
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
our 'finding faults' tour.

243
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
- Just hurry up!
- Okay.

244
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Do you know this area well?

245
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Not at all. Are you sure you're okay?

246
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I'm fine.

247
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
By the way, your outfit...

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

249
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I don't think it's a problem.

250
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What's that supposed to mean?

251
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Honestly, I don't really get fashion,

252
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
but other than that, I'll be strict

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
- in finding your faults.
- Yeah.

254
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
So, where should we go?

255
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Then,

256
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
how about we start with my specialty?

257
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
But your shoulder...

258
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Let's go!

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
One more time.

260
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
It's no good.

261
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Just playing around.

262
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Easy!

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Home run!

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Alright!

265
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
- Amazing.
- I'm just playing around.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You're amazing.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Nah, not really. You're pretty good too.

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
- Really?
- Yeah.

269
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
But I think it's difficult.

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,000
- number one, please?
- Sure, number one, got it.

271
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,000
- Excuse me,
- Yes?

272
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Number one.

273
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

274
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Would you like to use this?

275
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Thank you!

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Grandpa!

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

278
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
That one, that one.

279
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Not bad.

280
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Hey!

281
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Hey!

282
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Hey!

283
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
- This isn't bad.
- Yeah.

284
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Well?

285
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
This one's good.

286
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Is it soft?

287
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
How is it?

288
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
It's comfortable.

289
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Oh!

290
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
(30% OFF if you buy a pair)

291
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Hey.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Hmm?

293
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
You might not want a matching mugs,

294
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
but are you interested?

295
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
If you're okay with it.

296
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Great, so what color should we choose?

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
- Which color?
- What about this?

298
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
No, then.

299
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Your order, sir.

300
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Please enjoy.

301
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

302
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Mm, delicious.

303
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
What a relief.

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Choosing the restaurant was great, too.

305
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
So, how was I today?

306
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How?

307
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I think you're a pretty good guy.

308
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
What about my faults?

309
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Mm.

310
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Couldn't find any,

311
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
rather, it seems like you'd be popular.

312
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
What are you talking about?

313
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
No, seriously,

314
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I can't see any reason why

315
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
you'd get dumped,

316
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
maybe your ex's standards

317
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
were just too high.

318
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Well, I don't know.

319
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
But I think...

320
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
you couldn't tell.

321
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I couldn't tell.

322
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I couldn't tell.

323
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I couldn't tell.

324
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Dammit.

325
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm overthinking.

326
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
My head feels heavy.

327
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I'm home.

328
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Again?

329
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Natsukawa, you'll catch a cold.

330
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Natsukawa.

331
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Huh?

332
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Natsukawa?

333
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Natsukawa.

334
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Cold.

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Hey, can you get up?

336
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Hold on to me.

337
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Ah.

338
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
It's warm.

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
What's this?

340
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Good morning.

341
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Don't 'good morning' me, huh...

342
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Well,

343
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
when I came back yesterday,

344
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you were on the sofa

345
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
and then you complained about being cold

346
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
and didn't let go of me.

347
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Seriously?

348
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Sorry.

349
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Are you feeling better?

350
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm fine.

351
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
That's good.

352
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
But honestly, I don't get it.

353
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
If I were a girl, I'd totally be

354
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
swooning over this kind of thing.

355
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
You went that far and still got dumped?

356
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
That's not it.

357
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Huh?

358
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
I've never done anything

359
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
like this with a girlfriend.

360
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I actually tried to avoid

361
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
touching them as much as possible.

362
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
The usual breakup line for me is,

363
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
'You must like someone else, right?'

364
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Hmm.

365
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Want some coffee?

366
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Sure.

367
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Hmm.

368
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Hmm?

369
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Never done anything

370
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
like this with a girlfriend?

371
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Oh,

372
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I bought some cake yesterday, want some?

373
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Sure.

374
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Cheesecake, my favorite.

375
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
- You're right.
- Yeah.

376
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

377
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Delicious! Amazing!

378
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
- I'm glad.
- Yeah.

379
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
- Is it actually good?
- Yeah, try it.

380
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It's so soft.

381
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Delicious.

382
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,000
Where did you buy it?

383
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,000
A newly opened shop

384
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
in front of the train station.

385
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Really? The cheese is rich in flavor.

386
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Is it expensive?

387
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
- No.
- Really?

388
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
(Next episode)
How is it living together?

389
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
He must have some kind of problem

390
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
so his relationships were never long.

391
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
And he's the one who got dumped.

392
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
And he might already

393
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
have someone he likes.

394
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
He actually has someone he likes.

395
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
My sisters want me to

396
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,000
treat them to dinner.

397
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
Let's go to the place I'm working at.

398
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Kazuhito also knows the shop?

399
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm working there.

400
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
About what you told me before,

401
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
that you ex's thought you already

402
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
have someone you like,

403
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
I think...
