1
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What a nice smell.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

3
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
You wake up so early.

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I got into the habit of

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
waking up early for

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
morning practice back in high school.

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Did you make breakfast for me too?

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Yeah, but it's something simple.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But I'll get better at it eventually,

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
so next time, teach me properly.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Yeah.

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Natsukawa.

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Natsukawa.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Cold.

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Hey, can you move?

16
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Hold on to me.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Ah.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
It's warm.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's not it.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Huh?

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I've never done anything

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
like this with a girlfriend.

23
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I actually tried to avoid

24
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
touching them as much as possible.

25
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The usual breakup line for me is,

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
'You must like someone else, right?'

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Huh?

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm going to carry them away.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Yeah.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
In 10th place, Aries,

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
unexpected outcomes may arise

32
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
from following others' opinions.

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
- Here.
- Thanks.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
- Believe in yourself and take action.
- Did Cancer appear yet?

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
In 11th place, Capricorn,

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
changing goals may

37
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
lead to unexpected pitfalls.

38
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Don't forget your original intentions.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
And today's lowest-ranked is...

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
- Cancer!
- Gah.

41
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
(12th place Cancer)

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You might experience some

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
hardships in areas you're not good at.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
At times like this,

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
rely on your friends.

46
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Ugh.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
- Your lucky item is...
- What?

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Mimolette cheese!

49
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Huh? Mimo?

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Mimo...

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Stop laughing!

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's with 'Mimo something'?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Isn't it just regular cheese?

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Right?

55
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Sorry.

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Hey.

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Living together is going smoothly.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
(Living With Him)

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
(Episode 2)

60
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I should have chosen Spanish

61
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
as my second foreign language.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Then why did you choose Italian?

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's stylish, you know.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
There it is, Natsukawa's 'stylish'.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Hey, don't tease me about that,

66
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
it's a delicate matter.

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You don't have to worry about it.

68
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Then, tell me, is this stylish?

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Yeah. It suits you well.

70
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
That's not an answer.

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I've always lived without

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
paying much attention to style,

73
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
so I don't really get it.

74
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Whatever I choose ends up

75
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
looking normal.

76
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Normal is fine.

77
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Even if you say that...

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
How about next break,

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
let's go buy clothes together.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Kazuhito!

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh.

82
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Next is economics, right?

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Yeah, that's right.

84
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Huh?

85
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
- Ah.
- Huh?

86
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Ah!

87
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Natsukawa-kun?

88
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Yes.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I knew it,

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're living with Kazuhito, right?

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
- He's...
- Umm...

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Ah. I'm Yoshida Eri, nice to meet you.

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm Haruna Keita, nice to meet you.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm Natsukawa Ryota.

95
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
These guys are friends from high school.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Yeah.

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's already time.

98
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Yeah, I'm off.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
- See you later.
- Yeah.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
See you later.

101
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
- Hey, Natsukawa-kun.
- Yes?

102
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
- You can use casual language with me.
- Understood.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
So, how is it living with Tanaka?

104
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
How is it?

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He's so perfect, isn't he?

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Well...

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I want to know his weaknesses.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Weaknesses?

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
So I can use those weaknesses

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
to manipulate him as I please.

111
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Really?

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm just kidding.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But I do think there's something.

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Even if he gets a girlfriend,

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
it never lasts,

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
- and he always gets dumped.
- Yeah.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Also, perhaps there is someone he likes.

118
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
- Did you already have that talk?
- Yeah.

119
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
So he does like someone after all.

120
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Curious?

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Not so much curious,

122
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
but I can't really picture it.

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Is it a girl from high school?

124
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Or middle school?

125
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You're interesting, Natsukawa-kun.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Huh... what do you mean?

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Ah! Natsukawa-kun!

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Oh.

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
- Want to grab lunch together?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sorry, she's been pestering me

131
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
to talk to you more.

132
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
- Oh.
- I have lots of things I want to ask!

133
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Don't bother him too much.

134
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Huh? You're not bothered, right?

135
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
- Well, not really.
- See?

136
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
- So, let's exchange contact info.
- Huh?

137
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Huh?

138
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Because with Kazuhito around,

139
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
it's annoying,

140
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
and there are things

141
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to talk about secretly.

142
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
- Come on, let's share!
- Umm...

143
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Cut it out. Can't you see he's troubled?

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Huh? He said he's not bothered!

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That's because Natsukawa is kind.

146
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You didn't have to say that,

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm just for asking his contact info.

148
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Calm down, ah...

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
- It's okay, answer it.
- Yeah, go ahead, answer!

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Well then...

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's normal to ask for contact info.

152
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
- But he's troubled by it.
- There was no need to feel troubled.

153
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Hey, big brother,

154
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
are you free tonight?

155
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Yeah, why?

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You see, we're going there, you know.

157
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
We won tickets for the

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
'Mitarashi senentai'

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
IG live event in Shibuya!

160
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
So, we thought you might as well

161
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
get us some food while we're at it.

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Might as well?

163
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Take us somewhere nice!

164
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Oh, there's a family restaurant nearby.

165
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
- That's not what we mean!
- That's not what we mean!

166
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
We'll leave

167
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
the restaurant choice to you.

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It has to be somewhere nice!

169
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Well, even if you say that...

170
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What's up?

171
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Well, my sisters are asking me

172
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
to bring them out for dinner today.

173
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
And they want to go somewhere nice.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I'm not really familiar

175
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
with those kinds of places.

176
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
- I see.
- Why don't you come to where I work?

177
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
It's a café-bar,

178
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
but the food is delicious,

179
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and it has a nice atmosphere.

180
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
- Right?
- Yeah.

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I can make a reservation now.

182
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Kazuhito, you know this place too?

183
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I work there.

184
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
- Oh, so you two...
- Yeah.

185
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
We work at the same place.

186
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
- Originally Yoshida was working there,
- Yeah.

187
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
and the conditions were good,

188
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
- So you work together.
- Yeah.

189
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
But seriously, it's a great place.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
What kind of food do you want to eat?

191
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,000
- I'll make a reservation for three.
- Thanks.

192
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Both Yoshida and I will be there,

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
so if anything happens, just tell us.

194
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
You know,

195
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Yoshida-san is a really nice person.

196
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Well, she's not a bad person, I guess.

197
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
And she's pretty good-looking too.

198
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Huh? Is that so? I'm not really sure.

199
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
By the way,

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
about what you mentioned the other day.

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Hm?

202
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
The thing about having

203
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
feelings for someone else.

204
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Oh.

205
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was thinking...

206
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
No, it's nothing.

207
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
- What is it?
- Sorry, sorry.

208
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Well, I'm counting on you for tonight.

209
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Thanks.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Yes? Hello?

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Big brother, sorry, we can't make it.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Huh?

213
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Really sorry about that.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Wait, I made a reservation.

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Saki was so excited about the live event

216
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that she slipped on the stairs at home,

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
- and fell down.
- Wait, is she okay?

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
She just sprained her ankle.

219
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
But now that

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
she can't go to the live event,

221
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
she's really down.

222
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Going alone seems a bit daunting to me.

223
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Alright.

224
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I'll cancel the reservation then.

225
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
- In that case, why don't you go alone?
- Huh?

226
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Going alone?

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
We'll probably head over there

228
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
one day anyway.

229
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You can tell us what was good

230
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
and all that, like a preview.

231
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
No, no, no...

232
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But Saki also mentioned it

233
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
while crying and

234
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
holding her hurt foot...

235
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
But...

236
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
A place like this...

237
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
It's no good.

238
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Welcome!

239
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
- Sorry for the sudden cancellation.
- It's fine, don't worry about it.

240
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Anyway, since you're here,

241
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
might as well eat something.

242
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Well, that's...

243
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Come on, it'll be delicious.

244
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Right, Kazuhito?

245
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Yeah.

246
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
But, forcing you might not be right,

247
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
But I guarantee

248
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
you won't be disappointed. Oh.

249
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
- Alright, let me know when you decide.
- Yeah.

250
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Excuse me!

251
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Yes, coming.

252
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Kheer and Red Eye, please.

253
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Certainly.

254
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
- He's so handsome.
- Yeah.

255
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
So cool.

256
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He looks good and has a nice body.

257
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Oh you...

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
- Do you want to place an order?
- Umm...

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
May I take your order?

260
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Umm, sorry, I'll have... Sorry!

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
- Are you okay? Did you get wet?
- I'm fine, really, I'm sorry.

262
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
- I'll get a napkin for you.
- It's okay.

263
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll take care of it.

264
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
We're acquaintances.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Alright, then.

266
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I'm really sorry.

267
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It's fine, it's fine.

268
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Just forget about it for now.

269
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Today, I have a dish

270
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
that I want you to try.

271
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
May I serve it?

272
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
It's on me. Please?

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Yeah.

274
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Here.

275
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Here's the baby leaf and arugula salad.

276
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Did you want to try this?

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yeah.

278
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Well, I like salads.

279
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Thanks.

280
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Huh? Why are you laughing?

281
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's that, the orange one.

282
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
- This?
- Yeah.

283
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
That's the Mimolette cheese.

284
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Mimo...

285
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mimo...

286
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Ohhh! This?

287
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Oh...

288
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
- With this, you'll have good luck.
- Yeah.

289
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
- Bon appétit.
- Yeah.

290
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
How is it?

291
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Well, it's Mimolette cheese.

292
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What's that?

293
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
- What else do you want to eat?
- Any recommendations?

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Maybe pasta or risotto

295
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
for the chef's recommendation.

296
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Yeah.

297
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Natsukawa.

298
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Sorry, they tag along.

299
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Why did you apologize?

300
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Natsukawa-kun also wanted to see us.

301
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
And thanks for the other day.

302
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
- Yeah, come again.
- Yeah.

303
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Hey, Tanaka!

304
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Takahashi-sensei's calling you!

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Oh, seriously?

306
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
- Well, then, you guys...
- Take care!

307
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Don't tease Natsukawa too much.

308
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
We haven't teased him at all.

309
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
See you later.

310
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Geez...

311
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Hey, I noticed when we were at the cafe,

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you and Kazuhito-kun

313
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
are really close, huh?

314
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Oh, you think so?

315
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Yeah, really.

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He didn't do that head pat thing

317
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
when we were together.

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Huh? When you were together?

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You didn't know?

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm Kazuhito's ex.

321
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
- It was just for a moment.
- Shut up.

322
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,000
- It was a forced relationship.
- Shut up!

323
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
- Forced?
- It's not like that.

324
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
How do I put it?

325
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You see,

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Kazuhito is ridiculously popular

327
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
and usually turns down confessions

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
saying he wants to

329
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
focus on club activities,

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
he turned me down normally at first too.

331
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
- Then, Yoshida started stalking him.
- That's not it!

332
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Well, no, but,

333
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I was so aggressive that

334
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I told him I won't interfere

335
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
with club activities

336
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I thought, why not give it a try?

337
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
You know, Kazuhito is so kind,

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
- that kindness, it's like...
- It made you took advantage of it.

339
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
Well, I won't deny it,

340
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
but in the end,

341
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
he dodged my attempts,

342
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
he wouldn't even hold my hand,

343
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
let alone pat my head.

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Is that so?

345
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
So, I realized.

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
When he says he's busy

347
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,000
with club activities,

348
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
it's just camouflage.

349
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
There's definitely someone he likes.

350
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
And then you broke up with him first.

351
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Well,

352
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
even I couldn't handle it that far.

353
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
- I see.
- Yeah.

354
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Oh, I want head pats.

355
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
I want head pats!

356
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
By the way, don't you have to go now?

357
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Oh, shoot. Well, see you.

358
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Did you think it was Yoshida

359
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
that Tanaka likes?

360
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Yeah.

361
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Well, ever since they were dating,

362
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
I don't think it's her.

363
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Really?

364
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because, you know, you can tell

365
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
from their face when someone's in love.

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Face?

367
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
It's like the feeling is overflowing?

368
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Overflowing...

369
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Hmm?

370
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No, no, no, no, no.

371
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You're amusing, Natsukawa-kun.

372
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
No way.

373
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
No.

374
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
But...

375
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm actually looking forward

376
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
to living with you.

377
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why?

378
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I don't understand.

379
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Should I ask the person himself?

380
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But how? Directly?

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Like, do you like me?

382
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
If I'm wrong, it'll be quite painful.

383
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Huh?

384
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Skinship should be an indicator.

385
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Because friends don't go overboard.

386
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm back.

387
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Oh, I'm so hungry.

388
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
What's for dinner?

389
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
- Natsukawa.
- Ah.

390
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I've been talking to you for a while.

391
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Is that so? Welcome back.

392
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Wow!

393
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Tonkatsu today, huh? Amazing.

394
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Fried food is the best, right?

395
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
- Hey, Kazuhito.
- Huh?

396
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
There's something I want to ask you.

397
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Yeah?

398
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Can you hold my hand?

399
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Huh?

400
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No, even friends can do it.

401
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Then, how about this?

402
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
What's with you?

403
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
This also feels somewhat different.

404
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Oh, how about this?

405
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Can you kiss me?

406
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Kiss?

407
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,000
Ah.

408
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
(Next episode)
Yoohoo!

409
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Kazuhito-kun, it's been a while.

410
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
How are you?

411
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
You're still beautiful as always.

412
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Geez, everyone says that.

413
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Kazuhito-kun has always been like this.

414
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
He will do whatever he's asked.

415
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I apologize for my nosy sisters.

416
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No.

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
That's not it.

418
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Earlier, I said I was kidding,

419
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
actually, I wasn't kidding.

420
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It might sound like I'm narcissistic,

421
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:45,000
But I think you might like me.

422
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
And not as a friend.

423
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
No, I'm the one who should apologize.

424
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Maybe I've made you misunderstand.

425
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
It's not that I don't want to kiss.

426
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,000
But it's because I can't.
