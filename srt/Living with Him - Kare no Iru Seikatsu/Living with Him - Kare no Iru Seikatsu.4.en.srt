1
00:00:02,172 --> 00:00:03,195
I...

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,588
I'm serious about you, Natsukawa.

3
00:00:13,831 --> 00:00:14,831
I like you.

4
00:00:18,807 --> 00:00:21,385
But I don't want to force you,

5
00:00:22,563 --> 00:00:26,260
I want to respect your feelings.

6
00:00:34,326 --> 00:00:36,011
Let's head back.

7
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:41,461
My feelings...

8
00:00:43,027 --> 00:00:44,309
Ugh! Sorry!

9
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,648
I can't even understand my own feelings.

10
00:00:47,673 --> 00:00:50,485
Living with you has been so much fun.

11
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,883
But maybe it's just because

12
00:00:51,908 --> 00:00:53,337
we get along so well...

13
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,943
I just thought that living together...

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:04,913
Never mind.

15
00:01:18,627 --> 00:01:21,412
There's nowhere to escape to.

16
00:01:21,436 --> 00:01:23,148
And I already conveyed my feelings.

17
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:29,334
It's unfair.

18
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:34,699
Can't sleep?

19
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:40,916
Scary, isn't it?

20
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,200
Are you half asleep or what?

21
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,713
Then...

22
00:01:48,738 --> 00:01:49,738
Ah!

23
00:02:28,014 --> 00:02:29,406
Ow!

24
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:32,147
Natsukawa, good morning.

25
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:33,885
Yeah.

26
00:02:35,609 --> 00:02:37,091
What's wrong?

27
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:39,758
Had a bad dream?

28
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,523
No.

29
00:02:43,014 --> 00:02:46,309
Your head is going to get a bump, right?

30
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:47,926
I'm gonna take a shower,

31
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:49,840
I think I broke into a strange sweat...

32
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,898
No, I don't mean strange in a weird way.

33
00:03:11,417 --> 00:03:13,378
I...

34
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,078
I'm serious about you, Natsukawa.

35
00:03:21,378 --> 00:03:23,378
I like you.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,321
Ah! It's hot!

37
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,813
(Living With Him)

38
00:04:33,103 --> 00:04:35,426
(Episode 4)

39
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,610
Natsukawa? Are you listening?

40
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,629
Huh? Yeah, of course I'm listening.

41
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,843
Really?

42
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:46,173
Sorry, what were you saying?

43
00:04:47,213 --> 00:04:49,041
What, are you spacing out?

44
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,500
Ah, sorry, you startled me.

45
00:04:52,524 --> 00:04:54,562
No, I'm sorry.

46
00:04:57,385 --> 00:05:01,569
Lately, it's been warm and balmy...

47
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:04,572
The sound of 'balmy' is cute, isn't it?

48
00:05:06,309 --> 00:05:07,797
You're acting weird.

49
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:10,452
Huh? Weird?

50
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:12,038
Is that so?

51
00:05:13,635 --> 00:05:16,924
Natsukawa, there's a leaf on your head.

52
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,353
Huh? Really?

53
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,701
Kazuhito! Ryo-chan!

54
00:05:23,725 --> 00:05:25,725
Hey, Yoshida, good morning.

55
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:29,263
You're coming next Wednesday, right?

56
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,891
It's mandatory, right?

57
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,048
Good,

58
00:05:33,073 --> 00:05:35,540
it's more fun with people you know.

59
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:41,529
It's the drinking party from work.

60
00:05:41,554 --> 00:05:42,625
I see.

61
00:05:43,502 --> 00:05:44,519
Ah.

62
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:47,391
- Ah!
- Huh, what is it?

63
00:05:47,977 --> 00:05:50,492
Ryo-chan, are you lonely by yourself?

64
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,242
No way, I'm not a kid.

65
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:54,496
Why don't you come along?

66
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,780
I'd totally stand out.

67
00:05:56,687 --> 00:06:00,127
Anyway, I was told to bring you.

68
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,378
By who?

69
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,468
Senior colleagues who

70
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,741
have their eyes on you.

71
00:06:03,978 --> 00:06:05,675
There's no such thing.

72
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,140
That's why unaware handsome guys

73
00:06:08,148 --> 00:06:09,348
are a headache.

74
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,474
Well, I have a lecture starting.

75
00:06:12,498 --> 00:06:14,123
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

76
00:06:17,636 --> 00:06:20,254
- You'll help me out today, right?
- Sure.

77
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,323
Next time, we'll continue from

78
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,643
where we left off today.

79
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:42,430
Where did my focus go?

80
00:06:47,449 --> 00:06:50,386
- Kazuhito!
- Unfortunately, it's me.

81
00:06:51,034 --> 00:06:52,972
Haruna? Why?

82
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,119
I'm also taking this class.

83
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:56,362
I didn't know we'd be in

84
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:57,651
the same one, though.

85
00:06:58,046 --> 00:06:59,125
I see.

86
00:06:59,816 --> 00:07:00,877
Hey,

87
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,362
How about going to eat

88
00:07:02,371 --> 00:07:03,855
the Habanero Hell Curry right now?

89
00:07:04,299 --> 00:07:05,650
I'll pass.

90
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:08,195
What's wrong?

91
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,078
You seem a bit tired.

92
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:15,200
- Haruna-san.
- Hmm?

93
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,499
Never mind.

94
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,569
I'm curious,

95
00:07:20,593 --> 00:07:21,999
if you were about to say something,

96
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,952
just spit it out.

97
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,130
Well, let's see...

98
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:29,519
Let's say I told someone very close

99
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,120
to me that I like them.

100
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:32,594
And?

101
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,836
And if the other person says that

102
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,336
they like you but doesn't know

103
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:38,032
if it's love or not.

104
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:40,273
Haruna, what would you do?

105
00:07:40,298 --> 00:07:41,432
Hmm?

106
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
Tough one.

107
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,785
Right?

108
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:49,986
Is the lovestruck boy

109
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,494
waiting for an answer?

110
00:07:51,573 --> 00:07:53,175
Huh? Umm...

111
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,299
Not really, it's just...

112
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:57,265
Hmm?

113
00:07:57,301 --> 00:07:58,496
What is it?

114
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,215
It's nothing.

115
00:08:00,239 --> 00:08:03,751
Forget it! Just pretend I didn't say it.

116
00:08:03,776 --> 00:08:06,001
- But seriously,
- Huh?

117
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,085
There are those who can wait

118
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,045
for as long as you need,

119
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,077
and there are those

120
00:08:10,102 --> 00:08:11,187
that can easily give up.

121
00:08:13,122 --> 00:08:14,124
Honestly,

122
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,530
a love with no outlet

123
00:08:15,555 --> 00:08:16,516
is just painful.

124
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,171
It's normal to want

125
00:08:18,196 --> 00:08:19,702
to move on quickly, right?

126
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:24,774
Right.

127
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:31,641
Natsukawa!

128
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,270
Kazuhito?

129
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,846
What are you talking about?

130
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:39,237
- The lovestruck boy...
- Uh, I gotta go!

131
00:08:39,261 --> 00:08:40,497
What we just talked about

132
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:41,409
is off the record.

133
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:43,478
- Catch you later, Kazuhito.
- Yeah.

134
00:08:43,502 --> 00:08:46,004
But we'll meet at home. Never mind. Bye.

135
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:48,449
Natsukawa...

136
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:52,238
Tanaka.

137
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:54,877
- Let's go eat Habanero Hell...
- I have a part-time job.

138
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,623
(Brasserie Taille)

139
00:09:04,472 --> 00:09:06,472
What would you like to order?

140
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,340
The Bagna Cauda and Nachos, please.

141
00:09:10,365 --> 00:09:12,365
Please wait a moment.

142
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:17,359
Ordering Bagna Cauda and Nachos.

143
00:09:17,383 --> 00:09:18,589
Yes.

144
00:09:19,835 --> 00:09:20,977
Tanaka.

145
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,788
We have a reservation

146
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,748
for 9 o'clock, right?

147
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:25,362
For 8 people, right?

148
00:09:25,386 --> 00:09:27,585
That one got canceled.

149
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:29,854
Seriously?

150
00:09:29,878 --> 00:09:31,671
That's why, if you want to leave early,

151
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:32,715
feel free to do so.

152
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:34,665
- I want to leave!
- An immediate answer.

153
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,595
- Yes.
- How badly do you want to go home?

154
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,264
Umm, it's not like that.

155
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,386
Oh.

156
00:09:42,298 --> 00:09:44,782
Okay, I got it.

157
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,319
Kazuhito?

158
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,771
What are you talking about?

159
00:09:49,795 --> 00:09:53,234
- The lovestruck boy...
- Uh, I gotta go!

160
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,663
What we just talked about

161
00:09:54,688 --> 00:09:55,688
is off the record.

162
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,074
Catch you later, Kazuhito.

163
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:01,041
But we'll meet at home. Never mind. Bye.

164
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:07,192
- Umm... Manager.
- Huh?

165
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:10,763
- I'll stay until the end after all.
- Huh? Which one?

166
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
But...

167
00:10:14,839 --> 00:10:17,383
Is it that hard of a decision?

168
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:18,432
Just give me a little

169
00:10:18,456 --> 00:10:19,667
more time to think.

170
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:23,722
Ah, sure, okay.

171
00:10:52,224 --> 00:10:53,553
So spicy!

172
00:10:54,949 --> 00:10:56,726
Wait, ah!

173
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,906
Ah, it's so spicy!

174
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,557
Aren't you gonna eat?

175
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:05,909
After seeing your reaction,

176
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:07,252
I lost my appetite.

177
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:10,020
It's so spicy.

178
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,653
Wait, now the habanero is catching up.

179
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,346
Oh, it's spicy!

180
00:11:19,337 --> 00:11:21,008
I'm going home.

181
00:11:22,867 --> 00:11:24,168
Wait.

182
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,831
Geez.

183
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,767
Why is this so spicy?

184
00:11:33,574 --> 00:11:36,083
It's hellish!

185
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:49,066
Tanaka.

186
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,982
Tanaka-kun.

187
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,190
Tanaka-kun!

188
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,525
Ah, yes?

189
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:58,465
Sorry to disturb you

190
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,684
while you're still thinking,

191
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,129
but you can leave now.

192
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:06,157
Good job.

193
00:13:10,585 --> 00:13:12,377
Huh, the last train left already?

194
00:13:12,401 --> 00:13:13,944
I had too much drink

195
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:15,491
that I forgot about the time.

196
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:18,473
You can crash at my place.

197
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:21,527
Really! Thanks a bunch!

198
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,886
Don't cling to me like that,

199
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,535
people will misunderstand.

200
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,503
Thank you very much.

201
00:13:26,527 --> 00:13:29,937
Don't cling to me, it's hot.

202
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,817
- Welcome back.
- Whoa!

203
00:13:42,356 --> 00:13:44,356
You were awake?

204
00:13:45,265 --> 00:13:47,339
I couldn't sleep.

205
00:13:53,312 --> 00:13:54,418
Ah.

206
00:13:58,171 --> 00:14:00,171
Speaking of which...

207
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:02,966
Yeah.

208
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,252
I didn't eat dinner.

209
00:14:08,378 --> 00:14:09,408
Why?

210
00:14:11,374 --> 00:14:13,393
Went out to eat with Haruna,

211
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:15,049
but I just didn't feel like eating...

212
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:19,937
Is that so?

213
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,566
Do you want to eat together?

214
00:14:25,164 --> 00:14:26,267
Sure.

215
00:14:32,778 --> 00:14:34,184
I asked you to eat,

216
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,082
but there's nothing here.

217
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,583
True.

218
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,990
How about cup noodles?

219
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,783
- Right.
- Yeah.

220
00:14:59,411 --> 00:15:00,411
Here.

221
00:15:01,387 --> 00:15:02,409
Thank you.

222
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,528
Right, I'll boil some water.

223
00:15:06,553 --> 00:15:09,483
Then I'll grab the chopsticks.

224
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:10,732
Sure.

225
00:15:50,444 --> 00:15:51,803
Cup noodles eaten at midnight

226
00:15:51,828 --> 00:15:53,662
taste unbelievably good, don't they?

227
00:15:55,911 --> 00:15:56,647
Yeah,

228
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:59,455
there's this sense of taboo.

229
00:16:06,007 --> 00:16:07,007
Wanna add some rice

230
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,108
to the leftover soup?

231
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:20,019
Let's not do that after all.

232
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:25,298
Sorry, I want to eat the yakisoba.

233
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:42,170
Eat it then.

234
00:17:09,085 --> 00:17:10,646
Hello?

235
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,200
Huh? That's too selfish, isn't it?

236
00:17:17,595 --> 00:17:19,859
And what did Saeko say?

237
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:23,620
Seriously?

238
00:17:25,454 --> 00:17:26,885
Then it looks like I'm the only one

239
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,971
who's complaining.

240
00:17:28,898 --> 00:17:29,898
Yeah.

241
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,925
That's true.

242
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,260
Okay, so my schedule doesn't matter?

243
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,608
I know.

244
00:17:44,977 --> 00:17:46,198
What's wrong?

245
00:17:46,721 --> 00:17:49,112
I mentioned I was going home, right?

246
00:17:49,137 --> 00:17:51,171
- Sunday, right?
- Yeah,

247
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,195
it's not happening.

248
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,108
What?

249
00:17:55,133 --> 00:17:57,199
I even cleared my schedule.

250
00:17:59,096 --> 00:18:01,764
Wait, are you free on Sunday?

251
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,236
All because of my selfish sister.

252
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:08,269
Then...

253
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,782
But...

254
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,992
Natsukawa, can I have a little time?

255
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:22,017
Yeah. For what?

256
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:40,554
Natsukawa, this Sunday...

257
00:18:40,993 --> 00:18:42,819
Sorry, it's a call.

258
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,226
It's Haruna.

259
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:49,172
- Haruna?
- Hello. What's up?

260
00:18:49,186 --> 00:18:51,252
Yeah, I'm free.

261
00:18:51,276 --> 00:18:54,740
Huh? Isn't that your business?

262
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:58,509
Yeah, yeah, I know.

263
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:09,838
This might be helpful too.

264
00:19:10,753 --> 00:19:12,419
Sorry for dragging you into this.

265
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,604
It's fine,

266
00:19:13,636 --> 00:19:15,636
I have reports to work on too.

267
00:19:16,656 --> 00:19:18,300
Thank you, Ryota.

268
00:19:18,324 --> 00:19:20,015
Hmm? Ryota?

269
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,128
Well, since Yoshida

270
00:19:21,153 --> 00:19:22,338
calls you 'Ryo-chan.'

271
00:19:23,599 --> 00:19:25,425
That's true.

272
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:26,764
Huh?

273
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,285
Don't tell me you don't like it?

274
00:19:29,898 --> 00:19:32,397
It's not that I don't like it.

275
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,421
Okay, Ryota it is then.

276
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:36,499
Popular folks really know

277
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:37,913
how to close the distance.

278
00:19:38,849 --> 00:19:39,874
As thanks for today,

279
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:41,154
I'll treat you to a meal.

280
00:19:41,178 --> 00:19:44,201
Seriously? Sushi? No, maybe tempura?

281
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:46,731
But sukiyaki sounds good too.

282
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:49,233
That's a choice fit for a foreigner

283
00:19:49,257 --> 00:19:50,728
visiting Japan for the first time.

284
00:19:50,752 --> 00:19:52,334
It's not a big deal.

285
00:19:52,851 --> 00:19:55,514
Do you usually cook for yourself?

286
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:57,539
Yeah. I'm good at household chores.

287
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,651
Impressive!

288
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:02,084
I wish I had a Ryota at my place.

289
00:20:02,108 --> 00:20:04,179
I'm not a commodity.

290
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,700
Can you do my cleaning and laundry?

291
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:11,837
How about the pay?

292
00:20:11,862 --> 00:20:13,440
Of course, I'll pay.

293
00:20:13,449 --> 00:20:14,792
How about this Sunday?

294
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:16,468
Yeah, sure.

295
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,562
- No way!
- Kazuhito.

296
00:20:20,145 --> 00:20:22,738
Why not?

297
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,659
Natsukawa is not a housekeeping service!

298
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,626
Kazuhito, lower your voice.

299
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,996
But Ryota is fine with it.

300
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,330
- Ryota?
- Right?

301
00:20:33,007 --> 00:20:34,960
Well, it's not a big deal.

302
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,374
Well, I'm not okay.

303
00:20:36,399 --> 00:20:38,701
I have plans with Natsukawa this Sunday!

304
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:39,798
Huh?

305
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:42,675
Dang, he's not free?

306
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,894
Oh, it's almost time

307
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,090
for my part-time job.

308
00:20:47,482 --> 00:20:49,315
Thank you, Ryota.

309
00:21:03,603 --> 00:21:05,657
Natsukawa, sorry for saying

310
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,707
I had plans without asking you first.

311
00:21:07,731 --> 00:21:09,731
It's fine, really.

312
00:21:12,338 --> 00:21:14,338
- Natsukawa.
- Yeah?

313
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,845
Kazuhito.

314
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:23,800
How about we go somewhere on Sunday?

315
00:21:25,191 --> 00:21:26,183
Oh,

316
00:21:26,207 --> 00:21:27,425
of course, you don't have to

317
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:28,511
if you don't want to,

318
00:21:28,527 --> 00:21:30,140
and you might not be convenient.

319
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:31,808
Seriously? I'm in!

320
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,832
Natsukawa, lower your voice.

321
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,689
Oh, sorry, I got too excited.

322
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,471
I didn't expect you to be so happy.

323
00:21:40,495 --> 00:21:41,737
Of course I'm happy,

324
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,597
I'll come up with a few plans!

325
00:21:46,413 --> 00:21:49,325
Am I getting too carried away?

326
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,401
Well,

327
00:21:50,636 --> 00:21:53,036
honestly, I thought you might say no.

328
00:21:55,949 --> 00:21:56,995
I'm happy.

329
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:32,448
(Next episode)
Oh!

330
00:22:32,472 --> 00:22:33,996
Not many people know about this place.

331
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,664
Have you ever been camping?

332
00:22:35,688 --> 00:22:37,291
Never, what about you?

333
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,361
Me neither.

334
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:40,970
But I did extensive research for today.

335
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,275
This camping trip will be perfect.

336
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,225
Just leave it to me.

337
00:22:43,249 --> 00:22:45,396
Oh, this feels so professional!

338
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,842
Right?

339
00:22:47,712 --> 00:22:53,492
I want this moment to last forever.

340
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,560
I'm rooting for you.

341
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,965
I find myself keep thinking

342
00:22:58,981 --> 00:23:00,421
about such things, I...
