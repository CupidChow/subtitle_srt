=Episode 40=

27
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,440
I’m not very patient.

28
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,960
If you tell me in advance,

29
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,760
I don’t need to be concerned or worried.

30
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,120
But if I learn from someone else
what you have done,

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,480
I won’t show any mercy.

32
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,480
Qingke,

33
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,280
read the message to him.

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,320
It says

36
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,080
Miss Li along with Zhang Yuqing

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,400
is on the way to the capital.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
They’ll arrive in less than three days.

39
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,750
When they arrive,

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,160
they can confront those men

41
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,240
who know what happened that year.

42
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,080
I confess. I confess.

43
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:37,960
I’ll tell you everything.

44
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,240
Your Grace,

45
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
please spare my life.

46
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,720
Empress Dowager Cao was
quite out of favor that year.

47
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,150
Then she ordered some killers

48
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
to massacre the Li Village.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,800
She asked me to fetch
The Book of Supreme Weapons

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,240
and give it to the late emperor.

51
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,400
On that day, Yongqing armies
happened to invade the village.

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
Empress Dowager Cao then

53
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,560
shifted the blame on them.

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,440
After offering the book,
she became the empress.

55
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,880
I was only ordered to aid them

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,160
and get The Book of Supreme Weapons.

57
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,560
I didn’t know they would

58
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,000
kill all the villagers!

59
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,880
I have a guilty conscience.

60
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,960
So many people

61
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,160
died before my eyes.

62
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,600
So, this is the truth.

63
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:42,125
(Gate of Divine Might)

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,560
Your Highness.

65
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,920
Follow them

66
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,800
and see who dares to spy on the Palace.

67
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,150
The Palace is heavily guarded.

69
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,320
We haven’t seen Jiang Baoning
after waiting for so long.

70
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,480
Looks like we must find another way out.

71
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,625
Your Majesty,

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,880
we’ve got some unexpected news.

73
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,760
I heard Lord Xin, Li Qian,

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,280
was exiled out of town.

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,875
Now, he’s on his way

76
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:32,775
back to the capital.

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,355
Now that we can’t see Jiang Baoning,

78
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,330
we can deal with Li Qian.

79
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,125
(Qinzheng Hall)

80
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,160
I asked permission in private
to arrest Lord Xin.

81
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,760
I plead guilty.

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,040
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for not punishing me.

83
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,880
If it weren’t for the sake of my aunt,

84
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,640
I would teach you a lesson.

85
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,520
You were quite daring!

86
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Don’t be angry, Your Majesty.

87
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,450
Today, I came

88
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,425
to ask permission
to exterminate Qing Tai and his remnants

89
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,680
so that I can make amends.

90
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,240
You know where Qing Tai is?

91
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,880
After he was defeated in Yongqing,

92
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,120
as reported,

93
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,000
he came to our state.

94
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,320
I’ve dispatched secret sentries in town.

95
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
Once they find out Qing Tai’s base,

96
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,640
I’ll go personally

97
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,760
to exterminate him and his remnants.

98
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:26,600
Good!

99
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,920
I’ll leave it to you.

100
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:30,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,925
By the way,

102
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,320
I asked Lord Cao’s men

103
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,640
to go meet your escort.

104
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,120
Make sure Lord Xin comes back safely.

105
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

106
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:43,800
How is it?

107
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,160
Have Li Qian and Lord Cao come back?

108
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Not... not yet.

109
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,000
Baoning.

110
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,440
Sit down for a rest.

111
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,360
It’s not a long trip.

112
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,160
They’ll be back soon.

113
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,000
I hope Zhao Xiao will

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,480
bring Li Qian back safely.

115
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,400
Don’t worry.

116
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,960
Cao Xuan is there, isn’t he?

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,240
His Majesty asked Cao Xuan
to escort Lord Xin

118
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,200
just to avoid Marquis Jinghai’s men.

119
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:14,880
No.

120
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,080
I’m still worried.

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,640
Qingke, get the sedan chair ready.

122
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,880
Let’s go wait for him at the city gate.

123
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,760
Your Grace,

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,440
don’t you remember the message

125
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,360
His Majesty has just sent?

126
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,360
The Palace is perilous lately

127
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,800
and it’s heavily guarded.

128
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,760
We shouldn’t go out unless we have to.

129
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Her ladyship made sense.

130
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,280
Lord Xin will arrive in half a day.

131
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,040
Fine, then.

132
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,125
Xiaoman.

133
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:35,645
Ah?

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,000
Go stay at the city gate.

135
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
Take him to me as soon as he arrives.

136
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:39,425
Ah?

137
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,880
Be quick.

138
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
Yes, Your Grace.

139
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,425
Your Highness,

140
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
I tracked them down

141
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,520
and those who spied on the Palace

142
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,000
turned out to be
Qing Tai and his remnants.

143
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Great.

144
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Why did you come back,

145
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:04,850
instead of stalking them?

146
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,040
Don’t worry, Your Highness.

147
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,120
I asked our men
to keep a close eye on them.

148
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
Then I came back to tell you about it.

149
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,920
But what they did

150
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,040
was quite weird.

151
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,700
After leaving the Gate of Divine Might,

152
00:07:19,025 --> 00:07:20,500
they headed for the suburb

153
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,640
and followed Li Qian’s escort.

154
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,480
Li Qian?

155
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,760
Sounds like Qing Tai wants
to kill Li Qian.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,160
What do we do then?

157
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,720
I can’t kill Li Qian.

158
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,360
But if Qing Tai wants to kill him,

159
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,960
there’ll be nothing I can do about it.

160
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,160
Lord Cao is also there.

161
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,480
I’m afraid...

162
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,200
What are you afraid of?

163
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,600
Cao Xuan is guarding against me.

164
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,160
He won’t expect Qing Tai
to kill Li Qian.

165
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,560
Send our men to spy on them.

166
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,000
Yes.

167
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,160
Don’t blame us, my lords.

168
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,360
You’re recalled to the capital.

169
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,640
But you’re guilty, anyway.

170
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,320
You have to wear shackles.

171
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:12,880
Please take a rest.

172
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,080
Rest in place.

173
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,840
Stay on the alert.

174
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,480
- Yes.
- Yes.

175
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,275
Li,

176
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,840
have some water.

177
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,880
No.

178
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Thank you.

179
00:08:40,425 --> 00:08:41,039
Li,

180
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,960
His Majesty asked me to escort you.

181
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,000
I’m sure he trusts you.

182
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:47,640
After we

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,760
meet His Majesty in the Palace,

184
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,560
everything will be clear.

185
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,960
As long as Baoning trusts me,

186
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,440
I expect nothing more.

187
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,400
You have a deep love for her.

188
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
I admire that.

189
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,450
Don’t you also have true love

190
00:09:11,075 --> 00:09:12,450
for Township Mistress Qinghui?

191
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,360
Cao!

192
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:32,450
Beat him!

193
00:09:38,575 --> 00:09:39,320
Withdraw!

194
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,080
Chief, shall we go after them?

195
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,920
Why?

196
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,400
Don’t you understand
what His Highness wants?

197
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
Someone, protect Lord Cao!

198
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,280
- Yes!
- Yes!

199
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,520
Your Grace, a letter from Miss Dong.

200
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,200
Your Grace,

201
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,720
what happened in Bingzhou?

202
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,320
You look so happy.

203
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,560
It’s the good news from Shanhu.

204
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,360
She talks more and more
about Jin Xiao in the letter.

205
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,360
Though she complains about him,

206
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,880
she indeed likes him.

207
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,480
Maybe with a favorable chance,

208
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,080
they’ll be together.

209
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,240
I deliberately picked this shortcut.

210
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
Let’s go faster.

211
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,240
Miss Li is waiting for me.

212
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,600
Shall we turn left

213
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,680
or turn right here?

214
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,040
I always forget.

215
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,360
Let go of me.

216
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
I’ll kill you!

217
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,880
Look what condition you’re in.

218
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,760
I’ll kill you instead.

219
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,880
He said he would kill Dong Shanhu.

220
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
Look what a coward he is.

221
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,360
I don’t think he dares.

222
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,920
He’s just bluffing.

223
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,520
What are you waiting for?

224
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,440
Come and punch her!

225
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,040
Punch a girl?

226
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,125
- I admire your principle.
- Come and do it!

227
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,960
- But I can’t control my feet.
- How dare you talk back!

228
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,960
Sorry,

229
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,040
but I can’t help kicking you!

230
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,960
How dare you talk back!

231
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,040
How dare you!

232
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,725
Oh, my gosh!

233
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,680
Jin Xiao!

234
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,840
Jin Xiao.

235
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,640
Stop beating him. Stop.

236
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
Or he’ll die.

237
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:43,640
Spare my life.

238
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,520
Shanhu, how are you?

239
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,320
Are you all right?

240
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,520
I’m a bit painful because I’m tied up.

241
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,600
Let’s go.

242
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,080
Go.

243
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,575
Quickly.

244
00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:59,575
Let’s go quickly.

245
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,560
Why did they tie you up?

246
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,960
It’s no big deal.

247
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,400
Shopkeeper Wang

248
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,960
was sticky-fingered.

249
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,600
I then fired him.

250
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,840
He hated me

251
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,240
and asked two gangsters to punch me
to vent his anger.

252
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,600
It doesn’t matter.

253
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,400
I’m fine. I’m fine.

254
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,240
Come on. How careless you are!

255
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,960
Three men tied you up

256
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,160
in such a lonely lane.

257
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,760
If I hadn’t come in time,

258
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,080
the consequences
would have been ghastly.

259
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,160
But you came.

260
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,280
I don’t imagine things
that haven’t happened.

261
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:36,840
Jin Xiao,

262
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,160
look at my face.

263
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,800
Is it all right?

264
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,040
It is.

265
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:46,840
You’re still beautiful.

266
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,000
Shanhu.

267
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,650
Mm?

268
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,560
I like you, too.

269
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,625
Ah?

270
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:57,925
I mean,

271
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,900
if you still like me,

272
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,440
I like you, too.

273
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,040
What if I no longer like you?

274
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,320
I’ll fall in love with you first

275
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,640
and then make you like me again.

276
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,560
Jin Xiao,

277
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,560
you finally confessed your love.

278
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,640
Naughty boy.

279
00:13:31,725 --> 00:13:34,550
(Three Abodes of the East)

280
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,560
Your Grace,

281
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,240
here’s another letter.

282
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
Is it also from Miss Shanhu?

283
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,320
Qing Tai kidnapped Li Qian.

284
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,100
Well...

285
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,040
Go tell Madam!

286
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,240
Go! Quickly!

287
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,800
- Go get Madam here!
- Madam!

288
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,760
Wendie, what happened?

289
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,720
My lady,

290
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,560
Lord Cao...

291
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,680
When Lord Cao escorted Lord Xin back,

292
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,160
he was assassinated
and fell into a coma.

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,400
He just woke up.

294
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,520
My lady!

295
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,200
Why? Why would this happen?

296
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:18,200
- My lord...
- Cao Xuan.

297
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
Cao Xuan,

298
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,760
are you wounded?

299
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,200
Physician Tian,

300
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,120
how badly is he wounded?

301
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:34,840
My lady,

302
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,040
he isn’t badly wounded.

303
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,840
Are you sure?

304
00:14:39,075 --> 00:14:39,640
Yes!

305
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,280
Physician Tian, thank you for coming.

306
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,880
The carriage has been made ready
for you.

307
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,120
I’ve got business to do
in the Imperial Hospital.

308
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,760
I’ll leave you alone.

309
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,200
Don’t bother to walk me out.

310
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,160
Are you keeping something from me?

311
00:15:14,575 --> 00:15:15,175
No.

312
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,840
If you don’t want to tell me,
that’s fine.

313
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,320
Darling,

314
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,320
I’ll take good care of you.

315
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,320
By the way,

316
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,920
how’s Lord Xin?

317
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,040
He... he was kidnapped by Qing Tai.

318
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,040
Has Baoning known it?

319
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:48,800
I asked my men

320
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,320
to send a message to His Majesty.

321
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
Her Grace will soon know it.

322
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,760
But now we don’t know

323
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,600
where Qing Tai is

324
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,800
and why he kidnapped Li Qian.

325
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,760
Ask someone to get Liu Xiaoman back.

326
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,080
I did.

327
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,600
Your Grace,

328
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,880
is that the Book Qing Tai asked for?

329
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,880
Can we really exchange it for Lord Xin?

330
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,225
Mm.

331
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,080
But if Qing Tai has the Book,

332
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,560
the consequences will be terrible.

333
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,080
What do I do?

334
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,600
Your Grace,

335
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,280
shall we ask His Majesty

336
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,160
to assign more guards to go with us?

337
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,200
You’re after all...

338
00:16:43,825 --> 00:16:44,480
No way.

339
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,040
We can’t let His Majesty know it.

340
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,400
Qing Tai is a lunatic.

341
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:51,920
If we don’t do as he asked,

342
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,360
Li Qian will be in danger.

343
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
I must keep him safe.

344
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,560
Your Grace, have some tea.

345
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,720
Leave me alone.

346
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,760
I hope

347
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,400
we can have a child.

348
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,920
It doesn’t matter
whether it’s a boy or girl

349
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,160
or whether we have one or two.

350
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,760
We lost a child.

351
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,280
It’s you who got me

352
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,000
out of the pain.

353
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,480
Later, I thought

354
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,600
if we could have another child,

355
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,850
I would show you

356
00:18:02,850 --> 00:18:04,200
a braver me.

357
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:07,400
I would let my child

358
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:09,160
have a stronger mother.

359
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,600
My lord,

360
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,440
your wound isn’t serious.

361
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,840
All you need is recuperation.

362
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,480
But considering the wounded part,

363
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,320
I’m afraid you can hardly have a child.

364
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,200
My lord,

365
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,360
here’s your medical decoction.

366
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,000
Darling,

367
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,560
why didn’t you let Wendie and me
take care of you?

368
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,280
I just need some medical decoction.

369
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:10,775
You don’t need to bother.

370
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,785
Look what I’ve brought you.

371
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,760
It’s an inkstone from Yu’s Store.

372
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,400
I have it customized.

373
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,040
It has just been sent today.

374
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Look and see if you like it.

375
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,820
The inkstone made by Yu’s Store

376
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,710
is always the best.

377
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,300
Mm.

378
00:19:59,975 --> 00:20:00,800
I don’t like it.

379
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,480
Take it away.

380
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,120
Darling,

381
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,800
what’s wrong?

382
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,600
Since you were wounded,
you’ve been behaving weirdly.

383
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,120
Are you keeping something from me?

384
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:15,560
Su,

385
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,880
let’s break up.

386
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,120
Cao Xuan,

387
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,400
what exactly happened?

388
00:20:32,175 --> 00:20:33,215
I didn’t marry you

389
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,200
because I loved you,

390
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,840
but because I wanted
to assume my responsibility.

391
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,600
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

392
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
Better late than never.

393
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,740
Then how can you explain

394
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,160
why you were so nice to me?

395
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:05,960
I simply had pity on you.

396
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,400
Your Grace,

397
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,120
you didn’t want to tell His Majesty.

398
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,600
But when we go alone,

399
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,960
can we save Lord Xin?

400
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,560
When I left the Palace,

401
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,640
I sent a pigeon mail to Dongdong

402
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,480
and Jin Xiao.

403
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,800
Time is pressing.

404
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,320
We must stall Qing Tai.

405
00:22:15,225 --> 00:22:15,850
Mm.

406
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,200
Stop struggling.

407
00:22:38,225 --> 00:22:39,600
It won’t help.

408
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,120
You’re captured by me.

409
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,520
You’ll never get out

410
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:43,680
of here.

411
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,480
You were expelled
by the Yongqing people, right?

412
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,750
Now you have to live underground.

413
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,720
Yongqing is nothing.

414
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,645
Mu’an is nothing, either.

415
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,680
When Commandery Princess Jia’nan,

416
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,400
I mean Princess Jia’nan,

417
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,560
gives me what I want,

418
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,960
I’ll rule the whole world.

419
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,160
What will you do to Baoning?

420
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,920
Keep a close eye on him.

421
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,800
If he struggles,

422
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,720
beat him until he stops.

423
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,680
Qing Tai,

424
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,080
what will you do to Baoning?

425
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,720
I dare you to hurt her!

426
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:22,760
Qing Tai!

427
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,400
Stop looking around.

428
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,720
Only the three of us, as agreed.

429
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,600
There’s no one else.

430
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,480
Where’s Lord Xin?

431
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,520
Bring him out.

432
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,720
Don’t play tricks.

433
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,000
I have great martial arts.

434
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,720
Follow up.

435
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,120
Your Grace,

436
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,400
they want us to jump in the mud.

437
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,000
What’s there underground?

438
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,480
Is there a secret place underground?

439
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,625
If we jump

440
00:23:57,625 --> 00:23:58,520
but fail to go down,

441
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,360
will we break our heads and bleed?

442
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,280
No time to hesitate.

443
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,120
Let’s just try.

444
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,560
Xiaoman, stay here.

445
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:05,900
Let’s go.

446
00:24:07,525 --> 00:24:08,050
Mm.

447
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,640
Your Grace.

448
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,380
Your Grace.

449
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,040
All you all right, Your Grace?

450
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,080
I’m fine.

451
00:24:24,675 --> 00:24:25,280
Come on.

452
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,960
Are you really all right?

453
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,160
Do you feel unwell?

454
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,120
I’m fine. Don’t worry.

455
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:35,650
Mm.

456
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,680
Where are they?

457
00:24:40,325 --> 00:24:40,925
Let’s go have a look.

458
00:24:40,925 --> 00:24:41,450
Mm.

459
00:25:00,075 --> 00:25:00,640
Go.

460
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,320
Come on.

461
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,240
Come on.

462
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,280
Be seated.

463
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,600
Aning.

464
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:17,960
Master?

465
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,000
I should call you Your Grace.

466
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,320
Master,

467
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,600
just call me Aning.

468
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,120
I should respect my master.

469
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,800
Thank you for saving Her Grace.

470
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,080
Come on. Be seated.

471
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,200
Master,

472
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,200
you met Li Qian here?

473
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,560
Do you know where he is?

474
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,800
Since Qing Tai knew we met,

475
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,280
he’s been hiding Li Qian somewhere.

476
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,040
I tried several times
but didn’t find him.

477
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
Looks like Qing Tai

478
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,520
won’t give Li Qian to me

479
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,040
until he gets
The Book of Supreme Weapons.

480
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,640
Did you really bring it?

481
00:25:53,725 --> 00:25:54,275
Mm.

482
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,240
So, Master,

483
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,760
are you trapped here by Qing Tai?

484
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,440
Qing Tai kidnapped me before Li Qian.

485
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
He asked me to stay

486
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,160
and make weapons for him day and night.

487
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,680
So, the arrows

488
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,320
from the stone walls...

489
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,760
You made them?

490
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,960
- I didn’t know they were used on you.
- Are you all right?

491
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,720
Why did Qing Tai do that?

492
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,240
Because of his tyranny,

493
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,280
Qing Tai was expelled
by the Yongqing people.

494
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,160
Troops he has now

495
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,800
can’t fight Mu’an armies.

496
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,360
So, he’s anxious to get

497
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,640
the legendary Book of Supreme Weapons.

498
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,040
He wants to make
the most powerful weapon

499
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,480
and then rule the world.

500
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,680
He’s quite ambitious.

501
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,680
So, are you really going

502
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,800
to give him the Book?

503
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,760
Trust me.

504
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:47,080
Speaking of that,

505
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,280
could you do me a favor, Master?

506
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,280
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)

507
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:26,175
(The Book of Supreme Weapons)
Here’s the Book.

508
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,440
Give Li Qian to me.

509
00:27:37,575 --> 00:27:38,150
Yes.

510
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:46,640
Go.

511
00:27:48,725 --> 00:27:49,525
Baoning.

512
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,840
I give you the Book and you give me him.

513
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,760
If you play tricks,

514
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,440
I’ll tear it up.

515
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,800
I’ll give Li Qian to you.

516
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,680
I give him to you

517
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:04,840
and you give the Book to me.

518
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,680
You can’t give it to him.

519
00:28:07,075 --> 00:28:09,235
Baoning, leave!

520
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,160
Let him go.

521
00:28:17,575 --> 00:28:18,200
Baoning.

522
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,280
Baoning.

523
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,360
I’ll go get the Book back.

524
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,240
Don’t.

525
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,000
Let’s get out first

526
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
and come up with a plan.

527
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,560
Go.

528
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,800
What’s wrong with the arrows?

529
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,160
Where’s Siqin?

530
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:49,932
Hey.

531
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:52,800
Go.

532
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,680
After them!

533
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,320
- Yes!
- Yes!

534
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,400
It’s collapsing!

535
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,160
Go!

536
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,200
Your Majesty,

537
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,560
shall we send men to go after them?

538
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,200
Don’t bother.

539
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,280
This is enough.

540
00:29:29,875 --> 00:29:33,347
(Joy and Happiness)

541
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:56,960
Cao Xuan.

542
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,080
There you are.

543
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,920
This is my home.

544
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,880
Why can’t I be here?

545
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,200
I don’t mean that.

546
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:14,160
I mean...

547
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,560
What’s your decision

548
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,690
about what I proposed?

549
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,560
I’ve made up my mind.

550
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,560
We won’t break up.

551
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,680
I know you don’t mean
to break up with me.

552
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,360
I’ve thought it over.

553
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:29,960
If you don’t want to explain,

554
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,760
let me do it.

555
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,360
When Physician Tian treated you,

556
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,960
he found that you were dying.

557
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,800
In case I got sad,

558
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,960
you tried to keep the secret from me.

559
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,000
You want to arrange everything
for me before you die.

560
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,360
Am I right, Cao Xuan?

561
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,200
No.

562
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,640
If you still keep it from me,

563
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:59,000
we’ll really get divorced.

564
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,240
I’ll confess.

565
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,160
You were half right

566
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,120
about the truth.

567
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,160
What does that mean?

568
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,440
Tell me!

569
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,600
I’m not dying.

570
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,200
I’m just wounded.

571
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,440
We can’t have a child.

572
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,520
So, you’re not badly sick.

573
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,960
You said you wanted a child.

574
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,640
But I can’t ever have a child

575
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,040
with you.

576
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,600
Tell me.

577
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,640
If I were infertile,

578
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,920
would you leave me?

579
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,880
I wouldn’t.

580
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,640
We’re a couple.

581
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:35,360
You are the most precious person to me.

582
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,200
You asked me to divorce you

583
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,320
because you didn’t trust me enough.

584
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,160
I’m sorry.

585
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,800
You haven’t recovered yet.

586
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Don’t jump to conclusions.

587
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,160
If we can’t have a child as we wish,

588
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:01,160
we can adopt those orphans

589
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,360
who don’t have parents.

590
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,200
As long as we treat them
as our children,

591
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,440
we’ll be a real family.

592
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,520
Don’t you think so?

593
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,600
Darling,

594
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,520
you got me out of the darkness.

595
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,520
From now on, let me protect you.

596
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:49,800
Does it hurt?

597
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,190
Gao Miaorong told me the truth.

598
00:33:56,975 --> 00:34:00,175
I misunderstood you
for my grandmother’s death.

599
00:34:02,175 --> 00:34:03,295
Do you believe me, then?

600
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,600
You can explain to me in detail.

601
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,880
I’ve found out the truth
about the Li Village, too.

602
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,199
Let’s talk about it, then.

603
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:15,900
Mm.

604
00:34:34,025 --> 00:34:35,280
I’m sorry.

605
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,679
Grand Empress Dowager
was your closest family.

606
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,719
When she suddenly died,

607
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,520
you must have been very sad.

608
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,600
I understand your bad feelings.

609
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,480
You don’t need to say sorry.

610
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,400
First,

611
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,400
I suspected your father
because of the jade pendant

612
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,520
so that there was a huge wedge

613
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,080
between you and me.

614
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,840
Then when your grandmother died,

615
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,240
I failed to accompany you.

616
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,440
I’m sorry to you.

617
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,440
I had it fixed.

618
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,120
I thought you had thrown it away.

619
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,320
I’ve been keeping it

620
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,360
as if you were always by my side.

621
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,680
Shall we not leave each other again?

622
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,680
Why does the chain look better?

623
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,640
This is a new chain.

624
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,240
It’s more durable.

625
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
In this way,

626
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,440
you can’t ever get away again.

627
00:35:45,525 --> 00:35:46,120
By the way,

628
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,760
we didn’t get the Book back today.

629
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,480
You asked me to trust you.

630
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,880
What’s the secret?

631
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,575
(Zhang Zeshi)

632
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,560
So, this is the key

633
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,880
to making the supreme weapon?

634
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:24,595
Mm.

635
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,360
Think about it.

636
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,120
My master escaped with us.

637
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,160
With his help,

638
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,280
we can make

639
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,760
a perfect supreme weapon.

640
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:33,760
By then,

641
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,160
we can use it to fight Qing Tai
and his imperfect weapons.

642
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,920
Won’t it be easy?

643
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,000
Your Grace, here’s your medicine…

644
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:45,900
Well…

645
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,720
What medicine do you mean?

646
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,760
My lord,

647
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,160
it’s for miscarriage prevention.

648
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:54,840
What did you say?

649
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,480
My lord,

650
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,040
Her Grace rushed to save you.

651
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:00,240
The baby she’s carrying

652
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,720
- suffered a lot.
- Mm.

653
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,640
Let her take the medicine.

654
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,360
Baoning,

655
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,280
what does that mean?

656
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,600
Just the literal meaning.

657
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,280
Be quick.

658
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,360
Give it to me.

659
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,275
Quickly.

660
00:37:12,275 --> 00:37:12,775
All right.

661
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,000
Be careful.

662
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,480
Thank you

663
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:31,760
for not giving up on our child.

664
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,280
Don’t say that.

665
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,800
I won’t give our child up
in a fit of anger.

666
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,440
Now that the child comes to this world,

667
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,080
he/she has the right to live.

668
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,520
I wish our child would be a girl,

669
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,800
as brave and clever as you.

670
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,880
If we really have a daughter,

671
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,080
let’s call her Li Ancheng.

672
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,480
It means bringing peace

673
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,640
to the whole world.

674
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:02,725
Mm.

675
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,000
Li Ancheng.

676
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,640
Quickly.

677
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,160
How much longer do you need?

678
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,400
We’ll be faster.

679
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,300
Done. Done.

680
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,120
It’s done!

681
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,360
Done.

682
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,200
Great.

683
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,600
The supreme weapon is

684
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:43,280
indeed different from ordinary weapons.

685
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,320
It’s really supreme.

686
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,040
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!
- Congratulations, Your Majesty!

687
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:50,920
My lord,

688
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,480
I finally found you.

689
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,800
Wei Shu?

690
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:56,640
My lord,

691
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,600
after I noticed Her Grace
leaving the capital,

692
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,360
I tracked her down with a team.

693
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,360
But I was still late.

694
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,880
Please punish me!

695
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,560
Come on. Stand up.

696
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:07,920
Her Grace and I are all right.

697
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,000
Stand up, all of you.

698
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,200
- Thank you, my lord.
- Thank you, my lord.

699
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,000
My lord,

700
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,680
on my way here,

701
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,120
I happened to find out
where Qing Tai was hiding.

702
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:19,075
Ah?

703
00:40:27,625 --> 00:40:28,240
Your Highness,

704
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,600
we tracked them down to this place.

705
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,200
Qing Tai and his remnants are here.

706
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,760
Is Li Qian there, too?

707
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:36,960
I’m not sure.

708
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,880
We tracked them down
to sea buckthorn woods

709
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,520
where Qing Tai and his men
suddenly disappeared.

710
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,240
Later, I followed some Yongqing soldiers

711
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:46,680
to this place.

712
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,640
If Li Qian is also there,

713
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,320
I’m afraid he’s hopeless.

714
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,000
After being expelled from Yongqing,

715
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,440
Qing Tai is powerless.

716
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,400
I’ll see what else he can do.

717
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,560
Do you mean

718
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,000
we’ll take the opportunity

719
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,640
to kill them all?

720
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:03,675
Exactly.

721
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,400
Li Qian isn’t the only capable official.

722
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:10,040
I’ll show His Majesty and Baoning
what I can do.

723
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,040
All right.

724
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,475
Go.

725
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,840
Quickly.

726
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,440
Report.

727
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
Your Majesty, some people are coming.

728
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,600
I can just try

729
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,000
how powerful the supreme weapon is.

730
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,080
Get me my armor.

731
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:43,680
Yes.

732
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,000
An assassin!

733
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,120
- Kill!
- Kill!

734
00:42:36,125 --> 00:42:36,800
Zhao Zhong!

735
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,120
Zhao Zhong!

736
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,080
Zhao Zhong! Zhao Zhong!

737
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,440
You took so few guards?

738
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:57,120
You really underestimated me.

739
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,040
Qing Tai,

740
00:43:15,775 --> 00:43:17,255
you can’t get away today!

741
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:39,680
Leave!

742
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:43,000
Wei Shu, take him away!

743
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,000
Yes, my lord!

744
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:45,840
Go, Zhao Xiao.

745
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:46,760
Go.

746
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:47,760
Go!

747
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:49,280
Quickly.

748
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,520
Your Majesty.

749
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,640
Assemble all our troops
hiding in different places.

750
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,680
Li Qian, wait and see.

751
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,640
None of you can get away this time.

752
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:13,525
(Border Battalion)

753
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,480
How did you get away from Qing Tai?

754
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,720
How did you know Qing Tai kidnapped me?

755
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,280
Then do you know

756
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,280
Lord Cao was wounded because of me?

757
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:43,600
Let’s not beat about the bush.

758
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,200
You must have known

759
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,360
that I asked my men
to let their guard down

760
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,680
so that Qing Tai managed to kidnap you.

761
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,320
You indeed want me to die.

762
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,360
When you’re dead,

763
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,040
Baoning will be mine.

764
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:10,560
Zhao Xiao,

765
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,600
why do you still not understand?

766
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,920
Let me explain to you, then.

767
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,200
Baoning has never loved you.

768
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,200
You always have one-sided love for her.

769
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,920
This is the first reason.

770
00:45:25,275 --> 00:45:26,599
I took the contest for marriage
on your behalf

771
00:45:26,750 --> 00:45:28,100
not because I wanted her.

772
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,880
Later, when I knew Qing Tai’s evil plan,

773
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,080
I told you immediately, too.

774
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,200
When the Treasure House was on fire,

775
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:37,120
I got Baoning out of it.

776
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:40,360
I gave you two chances
to get close to her.

777
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,160
But you failed to seize them.

778
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,560
This is the second reason.

779
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,600
After I married Baoning,

780
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,880
we loved each other.

781
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:51,720
We had little tiffs,

782
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,840
so you took the chance to break us up.

783
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,920
That was unjust.

784
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,840
This is the third reason.

785
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:02,200
Zhao Xiao!

786
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:07,520
I hope you can behave yourself

787
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,440
and no longer try to steal my wife.

788
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:10,360
Li Qian!

789
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,960
I have nothing more to say about this.

790
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,960
But today,

791
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,160
I have something more important
to discuss with you.

792
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,680
Let’s join hands.

793
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,800
We still have enemies to get rid of.

794
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,080
To protect Baoning

795
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,040
or to defend our state,

796
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,240
I just want us

797
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,120
to let go of our grudges

798
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,640
and fight our enemies together.

799
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,560
Why must I join hands with you?

800
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,760
Qing Tai’s weapon
can’t be underestimated.

801
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,120
I believe you witnessed that.

802
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,080
You lost half of your men, didn’t you?

803
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,960
What other plan do you have?

804
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:02,320
But according to Baoning,

805
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:04,520
the weapon Qing Tai holds

806
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:06,680
isn’t the real supreme weapon,

807
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,440
but a defective one.

808
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,960
If he uses it forcibly, he’ll get hurt.

809
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:13,800
Baoning is working

810
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,240
on the real supreme weapon.

811
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,160
Before that,

812
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,920
I hope we can join hands

813
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,880
and defend our state together.

814
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,280
Trust me

815
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:27,840
and let’s cooperate.

816
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,080
Will you?

817
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,200
Hope you’ll think carefully about it.

818
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,440
Li Qian.

819
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:51,880
Let’s have a try.

820
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:03,520
You and Zhao Xiao
will fight Qing Tai together?

821
00:48:07,875 --> 00:48:08,475
Mm.

822
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,680
I must hurry up.

823
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:22,840
You’ve been trying hard enough.

824
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,240
But remember.

825
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,360
Your health matters most.

826
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,040
Zhao Xiao and I

827
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,720
will keep a close eye on Qing Tai.

828
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:32,760
Don’t worry too much, okay?

829
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,960
Your Highness, may I see you?

830
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:51,680
Baoning?

831
00:48:52,280 --> 00:48:53,120
Leave us.

832
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:10,280
I didn’t expect you to come and meet me.

833
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,200
I also didn’t expect you

834
00:49:14,725 --> 00:49:16,925
to fight Qing Tai together with Li Qian.

835
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:20,320
I overreached myself.

836
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,120
Only by fighting with Li Qian

837
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:25,160
can I defeat Qing Tai.

838
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,320
Li Qian was imprisoned and exiled
after unfair trials.

839
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,000
Then he was kidnapped by Qing Tai.

840
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:34,600
Lord Cao was wounded, too.

841
00:49:36,050 --> 00:49:37,520
It’s all because you broke us up,

842
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:38,720
isn’t it?

843
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,520
Baoning, let me explain.

844
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,520
I’ve always had true love for you.

845
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,080
- I...
- In the name of loving me,

846
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,880
you keep hurting
my families and friends.

847
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:51,160
Do you have true love

848
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:53,480
or are you just selfish and stubborn?

849
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,550
Anyway,

850
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:03,925
I’m still grateful

851
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,640
when you choose to fight with Li Qian.

852
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,760
You’re a man of great righteousness.

853
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:09,760
And you’re a gentleman.

854
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:11,280
A gentleman is open and poised.

855
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:13,840
He does something he should
and doesn’t do anything he shouldn’t.

856
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:19,440
Hope you won’t let us down.

857
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:50,800
Dongdong.

858
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:51,525
Mm?

859
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:52,475
Have you made up your mind?

860
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:54,400
I’m the Second Prince of Yongqing.

861
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,800
It’s my duty to hunt down Qing Tai.

862
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:58,280
When you go with me,

863
00:50:58,920 --> 00:51:01,400
if anything goes wrong, you’ll die.

864
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,040
Didn’t I tell you?

865
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,360
I don’t care who you are.

866
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,560
I’ve got nothing to be afraid of.

867
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,160
I’m ready to live or die with you.

868
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:10,520
You’d better be ready, too.

869
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:15,840
Besides, Baoning sent me a message.

870
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:17,600
I must go with you to help her

871
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,840
so that we can kill Qing Tai
as early as possible.

872
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:38,800
Baoning,

873
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,520
I once dreamed

874
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,040
of what’s going on now.

875
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,480
Your dream has come true, then.

876
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,120
How would you like to thank me?

877
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:50,840
After we kill Qing Tai,

878
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,320
I’ll do less work

879
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,360
and take you to travel around the world,

880
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,920
looking for all kinds of mechanisms.

881
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:00,520
I like that.

882
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,280
The stone

883
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,320
grows in nature

884
00:52:10,560 --> 00:52:11,960
and collects its essence.

885
00:52:12,680 --> 00:52:14,800
It’s endowed with spirit and life.

886
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:16,920
In the plateau area,

887
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:19,040
many people pile stones for praying.

888
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:21,320
The higher the stone piles,
the more effective it is.

889
00:52:31,550 --> 00:52:32,950
Don’t make trouble.

890
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:42,120
With me,

891
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,600
your wish would never collapse.

892
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,000
What’s your wish now?

893
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:50,600
I wish to defeat Qing Tai,

894
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,440
retire from office,

895
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,240
and live a peaceful life
with you in Bingzhou.

896
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,640
That will certainly come true.

897
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:00,575
Mm.

898
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,840
I had planned to fight in hot pursuit.

899
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,160
Unexpectedly, the supreme weapon

900
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:13,080
went wrong after only being used once.

901
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:16,520
It took quite a lot of time
to assemble it.

902
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:17,400
Your Majesty,

903
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,760
the scent of victory is in the air.

904
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,240
You’re right.

905
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:27,160
Go transmit my order.

906
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:28,760
We’re setting out!

907
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:31,080
Assemble the soldiers

908
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,160
and let’s set out!

909
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:32,640
Yes!

910
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:40,720
Report!

911
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:43,840
My lord, Qing Tai is coming
to attack us with his troops.

912
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:49,920
We can’t avoid it.

913
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,400
Go inform all our soldiers.

914
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,000
Get ready for a fight!

915
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:55,800
Yes!

916
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,040
Today, I’ll put an end to our fight.

917
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:31,760
Qian.

918
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:53,120
Yun Lin!

919
00:55:58,400 --> 00:55:58,960
Are you all right?

920
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,000
I’m fine.

921
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:02,760
Yun Lin.

922
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:51,640
Qian!

923
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,800
Oh, no! He hasn’t recovered yet.

924
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:44,000
Li Qian, it’s your luck

925
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,400
to be killed by the supreme weapon.

926
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,880
Qian!

927
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:36,720
How do you feel?

928
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,560
I’m fine.

929
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,040
Why?

930
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,600
Why did this happen?

931
00:59:48,440 --> 00:59:50,160
You were wrong from the very beginning.

932
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,120
Weapons

933
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:53,800
are never developed to start a war.

934
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:55,080
Instead,

935
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,080
they’re made to protect
civilians and states.

936
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,800
The world belongs to all.

937
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,240
Peace leads to prosperity.

938
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,600
You’re born to be cruel and evil.

939
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:06,480
Now you’re killing yourself.

940
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,320
You’re paying for your evildoing.

941
01:00:18,525 --> 01:00:19,160
Qian.

942
01:00:40,550 --> 01:00:41,270
Your Majesty,

943
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:42,800
Qing Tai is dead.

944
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:46,080
Second Prince Qing An took the throne

945
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,840
and promised to be
on friendly terms with our state.

946
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:53,560
Besides,

947
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,120
Master Siqin from Yongqing and I

948
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:57,680
tested many times

949
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,600
and finally made the supreme weapon.

950
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:04,040
This weapon is very powerful.

951
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,440
I’ve had it and its drawing sent to you.

952
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,800
Hope you’ll use it

953
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,400
to defend our state.

954
01:01:15,560 --> 01:01:16,200
Your Majesty,

955
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,720
the future of our state counts on you.

956
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,120
I’m going to travel with my husband.

957
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,280
Don’t miss me.

958
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:25,920
I’m so envious of Aunt.

959
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:27,640
Your Majesty.

960
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,080
Let’s go.

961
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:32,320
I’ve got a lot of memorials to review.

962
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,000
His Majesty has grown up.

963
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,080
Your Majesty, wait for me.

964
01:01:41,720 --> 01:01:43,289
Marquis Jinghai, Zhao Xiao,

965
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:46,425
killed Consort Qin Yu
of the deceased King of Yongqing,

966
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:49,440
framed Lord Xin up several times,

967
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,640
and let Lord Cao get wounded.

968
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:55,720
He has pleaded guilty.

969
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,800
For the sake that he fought Qing Tai,

970
01:01:59,120 --> 01:02:02,000
he’s deprived of all titles

971
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,840
(Prisoner)
and exiled to Eastern Guizhou.

972
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:05,680
Unless summoned,

973
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:10,200
he can’t come back to the capital.

974
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:15,000
Take care, Baoning.

975
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:31,676
(Li’s Mansion)

976
01:02:31,771 --> 01:02:32,350
Come.

977
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:33,320
Come over.

978
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:34,440
The bride is coming out.

979
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:38,800
Congratulations, bride!

980
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:40,840
Congratulations!

981
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:41,900
There she is.

982
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:44,650
The bride has come out.

983
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:48,525
She’s so beautiful.

984
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:54,600
Father, Mother,

985
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,320
Qian, Baoning,

986
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,160
take care.

987
01:03:00,120 --> 01:03:00,880
I’m leaving.

988
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,880
Darling, what’s wrong?

989
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,200
When she didn’t want to get married,

990
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:11,520
you kept nagging.

991
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,320
Now she’s getting married.

992
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:15,080
But you don’t want her to leave.

993
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:17,800
You don’t understand.

994
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:18,320
You...

995
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:20,520
I want her to get married.

996
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,000
I just don’t want her

997
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,000
to go far away to Yongqing.

998
01:03:24,200 --> 01:03:25,120
If I knew it,

999
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,240
I wouldn’t force her to get married.

1000
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:28,080
How about

1001
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,280
not getting married?

1002
01:03:30,520 --> 01:03:33,280
Mother, what are you talking about?

1003
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:34,720
Mother,

1004
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:36,680
the new king Qing An

1005
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:38,400
has true love for Dongdong.

1006
01:03:38,520 --> 01:03:40,125
- She’ll live a very happy life.
- Mm.

1007
01:03:40,125 --> 01:03:40,725
Mm.

1008
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:41,500
Dongdong.

1009
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:41,975
Mm?

1010
01:03:41,975 --> 01:03:42,855
Come back often.

1011
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:43,725
Mm.

1012
01:03:43,725 --> 01:03:44,240
I will.

1013
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,880
Don’t come back often
unless you have to.

1014
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,520
Anyway,

1015
01:03:47,920 --> 01:03:49,200
I won’t miss you.

1016
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:50,400
- What?
- Humph.

1017
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:52,440
If Qing An dares to bully you,

1018
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:53,320
I’ll go teach him a lesson

1019
01:03:53,320 --> 01:03:55,040
without any delay.

1020
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:55,760
All right.

1021
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,000
Don’t worry about them.

1022
01:03:57,000 --> 01:03:58,400
Think more about you and Shanhu.

1023
01:03:58,640 --> 01:03:59,400
Yeah.

1024
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:01,960
Your Grace, don’t make fun of me.

1025
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:03,920
All right. Say no more.

1026
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:05,400
It’s time to go.

1027
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:06,680
Get in the sedan chair.

1028
01:04:10,640 --> 01:04:11,160
Mother.

1029
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:26,200
I’m leaving.

1030
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:32,440
Look at her.

1031
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:57,746
(Five years later)

1032
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,320
Listen.

1033
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,840
Protect Madam carefully.

1034
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:10,440
Wherever she goes, you go with her.

1035
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,480
If she’s even a little bit hurt,

1036
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:13,400
you’ll take the whole responsibility!

1037
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:14,160
Yes!

1038
01:06:15,120 --> 01:06:16,080
Don’t bother.

1039
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:17,640
I’ve been doing business for years.

1040
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:19,440
Can’t I even protect myself?

1041
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,680
A few years ago,

1042
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,200
some gangsters kidnapped you.

1043
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:25,880
I don’t think

1044
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,440
you can protect yourself.

1045
01:06:28,440 --> 01:06:30,080
It happened years ago.

1046
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,120
Why are you more scared than me?

1047
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:34,800
You’d better be careful
when you’re away from home.

1048
01:06:35,900 --> 01:06:36,475
Wait.

1049
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,360
Darling, are you going out?

1050
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,680
Wait for me. Let’s go together.

1051
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,280
Wendie, do it faster.

1052
01:06:45,560 --> 01:06:46,360
All right.

1053
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:47,320
Nianci,

1054
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,880
be careful not to fall.

1055
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,400
Mm.

1056
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:50,160
Su,

1057
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:51,480
I’m back.

1058
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,920
So early?

1059
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:54,160
Are you tired?

1060
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:56,250
No.

1061
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,080
Jinwen,

1062
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:00,800
your mother

1063
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,880
has to take care of you

1064
01:07:02,160 --> 01:07:03,400
as well as your elder sister.

1065
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:04,760
She’s more tired than me,

1066
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:06,120
isn’t she?

1067
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:09,400
Father, you’re back?

1068
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:13,080
Let me have fun with you.

1069
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:14,080
Shall we go watch a play?

1070
01:07:14,080 --> 01:07:14,840
Yes.

1071
01:07:15,520 --> 01:07:16,440
It’s quite a good thing

1072
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,320
when you and Lord Cao

1073
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,120
adopted Miss Nianci.

1074
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:22,760
Brought up by you,

1075
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:24,200
she’s getting more lively and lovely.

1076
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,150
She looks different

1077
01:07:26,150 --> 01:07:27,100
from what she was as a baby.

1078
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:28,280
Keep your voice down.

1079
01:07:29,600 --> 01:07:31,640
Nianci is our real daughter.

1080
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:35,880
She, my husband, Jinwen, and I

1081
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,080
are always a family.

1082
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,720
Don’t cry, baby. Don’t cry.

1083
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,760
Ancheng,

1084
01:07:42,760 --> 01:07:44,920
it’s dangerous on the tree. Come down.

1085
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:45,680
I won’t.

1086
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,960
I’ll run away from home

1087
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:48,480
where I feel so sad.

1088
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:49,880
But why?

1089
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,440
My father bullied me.

1090
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:52,640
He no longer loves me.

1091
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,240
He even spanked me.

1092
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,240
My father spanks me, too.

1093
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:57,920
Together with my mother.

1094
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,120
Shall we run away from home together?

1095
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:04,400
But we’ll be hungry.

1096
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,600
Don’t be afraid.

1097
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,720
We can beg for food.

1098
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:10,040
My mother has said
that the world is at peace.

1099
01:08:10,040 --> 01:08:11,960
Even beggars won’t die from hunger.

1100
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:13,920
Oh, I see.

1101
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,359
I’ll think about it, then.

1102
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:17,560
Oh, my God!

1103
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:19,120
I’ve been looking for you!

1104
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:20,560
Your Grace,

1105
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:21,960
why are you up on the tree?

1106
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,319
It’s dangerous. Come down.

1107
01:08:23,479 --> 01:08:24,120
I won’t.

1108
01:08:24,279 --> 01:08:25,439
I’ll run away from home.

1109
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:26,800
- Run away from home?
- Your Grace.

1110
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,439
Your Grace, you can’t do that.

1111
01:08:28,439 --> 01:08:29,439
Somebody! Somebody!

1112
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,680
- Get Her Grace off the tree.
- Somebody!

1113
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,000
- Wait, I’ll go get the ladder.
- Wait a second.

1114
01:08:32,319 --> 01:08:34,160
Ancheng is getting naughtier.

1115
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:36,800
Yesterday, you punished her
for not getting up early for calligraphy.

1116
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:37,800
She got angry.

1117
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:40,040
She clamored to run away from home
the whole night.

1118
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:41,439
But of course,

1119
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:42,960
I’m her mother

1120
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,399
and I won’t be led by the nose.

1121
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:48,120
She has grown up
and she must take care of herself.

1122
01:08:48,479 --> 01:08:50,240
Let’s just enjoy ourselves.

1123
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:51,840
You’re Ancheng’s mother.

1124
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:54,479
She has your temper.

1125
01:08:55,359 --> 01:08:56,840
Nonsense.

1126
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:58,120
I’ve always been a good girl.

1127
01:08:58,399 --> 01:09:00,240
Grandmother always urged me
to learn to behave properly.

1128
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:03,680
Anyway, Father told me that

1129
01:09:04,120 --> 01:09:05,040
someone used to be

1130
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,439
the leader of children.

1131
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:08,080
He led other children

1132
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:10,120
to make trouble even three times a day.

1133
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:11,800
I just had prestige.

1134
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,240
How shameless!

1135
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:26,479
It’s nice.

1136
01:09:27,399 --> 01:09:28,920
Everyone has a happy ending.

1137
01:09:31,240 --> 01:09:33,479
Wind blows in two directions
to the branches of a tree.

1138
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,040
Warm in the south and cold in the north.

1139
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:40,640
I’m jealous of nothing,

1140
01:09:42,359 --> 01:09:44,920
but warm branches in the south.
