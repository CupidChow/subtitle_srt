1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,240

3
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,840
Wow, you crazy bastard. Jeez.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,960
Then what am I supposed to do? I don't have any ideas.

5
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:31,790
But this book does.

6
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,660
I think I am finished. It's perfect.

7
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:35,870
They will fall in love.

8
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:38,510
I'm going to tell Samshin everything.

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:40,260
Tell me what?

10
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,370
- I brought clementines. 
 - Grandma.

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:44,540
You thought he was writing every line with care, right?

12
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,210
It's all copied. He's plagiarizing human destiny right now.

13
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,080
Even if I am,  does he have any right to badmouth me?

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,910
This is my first time copying.

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,680
You on the other hand don't want to "be responsible for human fate."

16
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,900
So you wrote just one, and then you copy and paste from it!

17
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,830
I copy myself. My work is original.

18
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:01,410
- I never copy someone else's! 
 - I...

19
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:04,700
just don't understand love. That's why.

20
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,540
I just copied a little bit about love.

21
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,240
It was one attempt out of many to get a high quality end result.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,420
Still, don't you feel ashamed as a god?

23
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,910
If you don't understand love, ask me.

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:18,150
Even if I do everything else half-assed, I am incredible with love.

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,850
First, sparks fly and you have a fling.

26
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,020
You grab her hand and hold it.

27
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,900
Then, I make sure to add a lot of care for the part where you passionately express love.

28
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,160
- You know, right? 
 - You are disgusting. Go away.

29
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,270
Where are you stuck?

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,380
This is a crucial moment. Okay, for love to happen, you need to isolate them first.

31
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,170
Isolation?

32
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,830
I see that you can hear everything.

33
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:43,530
Like they go on a hike, get lost, and face danger?

34
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,380
Usually it's an island, noob. They visit an island, but there are no more returning boats.

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,820
When that happens, the inn usually only has one room left.

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,270
This is truly unpleasant.

37
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,700
Would it still work if I change the island to a mountain?

38
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,120
Look at him plagiarizing again.

39
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:02,140
- Fine. Ramen or naengmyun, island or mountain— 
 - Shut up.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:14,300

41
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:18,940

42
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,030
Go Hui Jeong?

43
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,590
 Daegwallyeong?

44
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,540
 Did we have relatives in Daegwallyeong?

45
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,500
 On your dad's side.

46
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,130
 I never met her either, but I just got a call that she passed away. So what can we do?

47
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,400
 I can't go because of the coffee shop, so do me a favor.

48
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,510
Excuse me.

49
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,860
Is this the funeral for Go Hui Jeong?

50
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,410
Yes. That's correct.

51
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:45,380
But, from what I was told, the deceased was a woman.

52
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,470
I heard that she is my father's aunt.

53
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,510
He is my mother's uncle.

54
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,940
Go, Hui, Jeong.

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,490
 Sorry, I can't answer the phone right now.

56
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,540
 I vote for the white shirt.

57
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,830
We have the same taste.

58
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,350
Sorry.

59
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:15,210
Did you get a new shirt? 
Oh, Station Director is looking for you.

60
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,800
Got it. I'll head there right away.

61
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,540
Yes.

62
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:28,620
Hey you, why aren't you picking up your father's calls?

63
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,730
Did Daddy call?

64
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,460
"Daddy?"

65
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,420
You want me to crack your head wide open?

66
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,540
I was just trying to make you laugh, Hyung.

67
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,480
Why? Did my dad tell you to fire me?

68
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,770
Yeah, man. He wants me to fire you.

69
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,460
Get back on a plane before both Uncle's and my guts burst from frustration.

70
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,600
I told you at my interview.

71
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,430
- I want to die making K-dramas. 
 - Save it. Okay?

72
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,040
You have a Sundance nomination. You think you can make a soap opera if we tell you to?

73
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,190
People kept calling it a melodrama, so I looked up what that meant.

74
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,100
"A blind end in a mine gallery."

75
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:04,190
So, the soap opera genre is about showing what choices human beings make

76
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:06,930
when they're under extreme circumstances.

77
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,420
And the piece that gave that genre believability and made it addictive

78
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,530
is "Accounting for the Married."

79
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:14,620
- Should I keep going? 
 - Fine. Give it a try.

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,580
Be the assistant director to "Accounting for the Married" Writer Yang Mi Soon's next drama.

81
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,510
Really? Don't change your mind. What should I do first?

82
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:25,030
Your first task. Get Kim Yeong Rae over here.

83
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:28,200
Not working on storyboards or anything like that? But this?

84
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,820
I told you, it was a totally random person.

85
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,510
How can you make a mistake like that?

86
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:34,350
I told you, I got a text.

87
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:37,350
I got a text about the funeral. Then how did they get my number to text?

88
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,180
I don't know. I'm going to visit the sheep farm since I'm already here.

89
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,100
I've always wanted to go.

90
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:45,230
Go make some money. I'll call you later. Bye.

91
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,320
Hello? Hello?

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,310
She always hangs up as soon as she's done talking!

93
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,910
She went to the sheep farm when she was in college and caused so much trouble.

94
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,940
So why does she talk as if she never went there?

95
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,400
Che Gyeong?

96
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,300
What brings you here?

97
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,710
How about you, Ba Reum? Do you have a shoot?

98
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:25,370
I don't have a shoot today. I'm chasing a runaway.

99
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,560
You looked like a lost little lamb just now.

100
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:31,430
If I have to be an animal, can I be a wolf instead?

101
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Anyway, it's so neat that we're meeting here again.

102
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,480
A sunbae ran off here because he didn't want to work.

103
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,070
I came to bring him back. I was cursing him on my way here,

104
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,440
but now I'm thankful.

105
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,910
He should have just quit the job. Why run away? What a weirdo.

106
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,780
I hope you catch him. Fighting!

107
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,030
That's how you're leaving me?

108
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,150
Hold on!

109
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,040

110
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,250

111
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,700
Some kind of destiny.

112
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,700
- I told you it should have been an island! 
 - This woman, Go Che Gyeong, is the weird one.

113
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,140
An unexpected encounter at an unexpected location.

114
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,420
Sheep running around.

115
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:25,220
Shouldn't your heart be fluttering like crazy? Right?

116
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:27,060
Am I wrong?

117
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,140
Maybe the mood isn't set.

118
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,700
What mood? How do you get into the mood?

119
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:36,770
- First, a little alcohol? 
 - Alcohol?

120
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,290
I see. Should we also get a lamb? Lamb skewers as a side dish?

121
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,980
Lamb skewers. I think this is a good idea.

122
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,520
Am I bad, or are you guys bad?

123
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,150
I think you guys are bad.

124
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:54,090
Let the poor lambs roam free and isolate the two of them already!

125
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,720
If a man and a woman are going to fall in love, they need to be alone and something has to fall out of the sky.

126
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,690
Whether it be stars or sesame seeds that fall! 
  (TN: Seeds falling refers to being lovey-dovey)

127
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:04,890
Stars are supposed to, but seeds? From the sky?

128
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,940
Stop right there. If you ask me sesame or perilla, I'll kill you.

129
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,700
Geez, I was kidding.

130
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:14,260
- It was sesame seeds. 
 - You crazy bastard!

131
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:17,620
"Ch"?  You wrote "Ch"! Once you start writing, you can't delete anything!

132
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,460
What are you going to do now?

133
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,540
I told you I was kidding.

134
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,980

135
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,490
You said something just has to fall out of the sky.

136
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,750
 Lightning and thunder above Che Gyeong's head.

137
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,210

138
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,180
 Rain falls from the sky.

139
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:54,580
♫  A little story in a fairy tale  ♫

140
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,150
♫  That's how I achieved happiness  ♫

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,010
Che Geyong, you never have an umbrella on you.

142
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:02,230
You even stole mine.

143
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:06,340
Stole? It's just right before I'm about to return it.

144
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,450
But why do you think it always rains when we meet?

145
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,560
I might've prayed desperately for it to rain until next year.

146
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,020
- Should we get out of the rain first? 
 - Yes.

147
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:22,050
♫  A destiny which always has the same fixed ending  ♫

152
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,600
- Yes! 
 - Yes! If they go to the hut, it's game over!

153
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,980
They got rained on, they're cold, and their clothes are wet.

154
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,290
If only they start a fire, then we're 90% there.

155
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,350
Now if the woman collapses as soon as they walk in,

156
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,110
then 100%.

157
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,860
A fire? In the 21st century?

158
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:05,120
Why would she collapse as soon as they walk in?

159
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,620
It doesn't seem like a probable plot.

160
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,040
- Do you have other ideas? 
 - They'll probably talk about lamb skewers.

161
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,690
You said you liked where this was going a moment ago.

162
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:16,780
A woman always falls for a man who takes care of her when she's sick.

163
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,840
Under one condition.

164
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,320
He has to be good-looking.

165
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,730
Jeong Ba Reum is good looking enough.

166
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,960
Really?

167
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,360
Get her sick all of a sudden?

168
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,140
Fine then.

169
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,000
Che Gyeong, are you okay?

170
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,950
Che Gyeong!

171
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:48,720
You are burning up! Che Gyeong, can you hear me?

172
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,580
Give me a minute. My head is ringing.

173
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,900
I don't know what's wrong with me all of a sudden.

174
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,780
Let me start a fire.

175
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,760
I'll go and get some branches.

176
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,330
Don't worry. I was a boy scout through middle school.

177
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,990
Shut up. Don't make a fire.

178
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,740
Don't think about doing anything and call 911.

179
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,840
Don't even think about nursing me here or something like that.

180
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,240
That's not going to fly.

181
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,960
Nothing is working.

182
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,100
Why are you standing up? Aren't you going to fix this?

183
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,770
I'm going to go fix it.

184
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,920
I have no idea where they'll go with this.

185
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,840
I need to watch them directly while I write.

186
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,170
- This is Jeong Ba Reum.
 - Hey! This is Kim Yeong Rae.

187
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:02,270
I heard you're at Daegwallyeong to get me. But why aren't you looking for me?

188
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,590
 Why aren't you out to get me? You only tried calling me once.

189
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:05,960
Where are you right now?

190
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,920
Guardian, please take your call outside.

191
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:12,020
 Hello? Hello?

192
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,990
I'm okay. You can go.

193
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:18,090
Then I'll be back as soon as possible. Get hydrated with an IV drip while you wait.

194
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,120
And make sure to pick up your phone.

195
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,660
-   Hey! Are you ignoring me on purp—  
 - I'm on my way.

196
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,000
Where are you right now?

197
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,670
Okay, then I'll go there.

198
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,370

199
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,170
Who on earth is writing Director Kim Yeong Rae's book?

200
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:01,630
Ba Reum?

201
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,760
Blood pressure, normal. Temperature, normal. The doctor says you are normal all over.

202
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,590
Why are you here? Today is so weird!

203
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,430
That's the second time I've asked that question today.

204
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,920
- Coincidentally? 
 - It doesn't make any sense.

205
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,290
Probability is important to me, too.

206
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,510
But life is a series of improbable coincidences.

207
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,010
If you keep saying nonsense, I'll tell the nurse to kick you out.

208
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,390
I was visiting someone else here and while passing by the emergency room, I saw a familiar face.

209
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,370
The nurse said your guardian ran out the door.

210
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,990
Are you two eloping or something? I wasn't sure if I should tell your mother.

211
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,390
Anyway, I couldn't just leave.

212
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,170
I don't understand, but thanks.

213
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:52,210
It's because I haven't eaten all day.

214
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,030
I couldn't mooch off at the funeral I accidentally crashed.

215
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:59,830
Let's go get some food then.

216
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:09,050
Do you perhaps like lamb skewers?

217
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:14,420
I do but lamb skewers for my first meal of the day?

218
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,520
I knew I shouldn't have just let them roam free.

219
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:23,620
When you come to a place like this, don't you wish you could live here for a year or so?

220
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,150
You want to experience all four seasons or something like that?

221
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:30,250
Living somewhere like this, the year wouldn't be about the seasons.

222
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,330
Dureup pancakes in the spring, makguksun ( buckwheat noodles ) in the summer,

223
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:35,630
pine mushrooms in the fall, and sandfish stew in the winter.

224
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:38,240
I can eat them all.

225
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,280
Azaleas  in the spring, bellflowers in the summer,

226
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,140
chrysanthemums in the fall, and snowflakes in the winter.

227
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,420
I can see them all.

228
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:53,060
They're all edible flowers, too.

229
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,290
The first snow would be so pretty here, right?

230
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,940
Do you have anyone to see the first snow with?

231
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,910
Why do you need to see the first snow with someone?

232
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,710
On the day of the first snow, your first love comes true. Don't you know?

233
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,110
If your first love comes true every time it snows for the first time, would the world be left standing?

234
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:11,150
Every time you open your mouth, my temper refuses to be left standing. You know that?

235
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,870
Is the coffee shop doing well?

236
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,040
Thank you for asking.

237
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,070
You must have been starving. Should I order another one?

238
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,380
You should have asked me when I was ordering.

239
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,800
It's fine. I'm done.

240
00:14:33,990 --> 00:14:38,310
It's because weird things keep happening to me, which is causing me stress.

241
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:43,400
Some people accept their fate, and some go against it.

242
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,670
If you try to go against it as you do, it can be taxing.

243
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,700
Taxing for me, too.

244
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:54,810
Sometimes, it's good to just go with the flow.

245
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,660
That's all I'm saying.

246
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,620
Thank you for the advice. You borrowed my literary magazine from my mom, right?

247
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,190
Was that a literary magazine that I borrowed?

248
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:06,280
There is no way you read it, right?

249
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,580
 Are you copying that?

250
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:11,540
 Here, you can see the depth within humans which is beyond divine comprehension.

251
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,550
 Cringe-worthy. Heartbeat skipping.

252
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:15,660
 I like cheesy stuff.

253
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,580
Do you like eating potatoes at rest stops in the winter?

254
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,980
Let's go. I think you'll run into him if we leave now.

255
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:24,590
- Who? 
 - Your first love.

256
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,930
What is he talking about?

257
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,310
Gosh, so embarrassing!

258
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,670
He read it. He totally did.

259
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,190
It's the first snow.

260
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,590
It's snowing.

261
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,200
Yes, it is.  It's the first snow.

262
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,940
♫  But you went the long way around to come back here  ♫

263
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:26,320
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

264
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:31,920
♫  Again, I'll engrave you  ♫

265
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,030
♫  Even if it's too late and we are too far apart it will be us again  ♫

266
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,520
- Damn it.
 - Damn it.

267
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,020
I can see how this sucks for me, but why does it suck for you?

268
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,910
I was going to use this at the rest stop.

269
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:44,580
But I guess someone else used it first.

270
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:48,600
- Uselessly so here. 
 - Uselessly?

271
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:51,420
I have no interest in spending this precious first snow with you either.

272
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,850
Fine. Then let's go.

273
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:00,900
I'm only going because it's free.

274
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,540
You must have humble tastes.

275
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,500
I can't believe you rushed here to eat rest stop potatoes.

276
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:25,500
I'll go get potatoes. Stay here. Don't move.

277
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,690
Unbelievable.

278
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,790
You think I won't move because you tell me so?

279
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:36,470
Wow!

280
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,990
It's tiring to be surprised at this rate, right?

281
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,800
I heard you left the hospital all of a sudden

282
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,250
but you weren't answering your phone either, so I was worried.

283
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:45,220
I happened to run into my neighbor.

284
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:48,330
It's not easy to get a free ride.

285
00:17:50,430 --> 00:17:52,570
What's wrong?

286
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:57,690
Is the person you're here to get Director Kim Yeong Rae?

287
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:59,150
You know Hyung Yeong Rae?

288
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:02,510
You must really like RBS dramas.

289
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,830
You're right. He's going to direct Yang Mi Soon's next drama.

290
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,430
He's my next drama director?

291
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,510
What?

292
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,960
I mean, so he is going to be

293
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,020
the director for the next drama by the writer of the drama I'm watching?

294
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,640
You don't seem happy about it.

295
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,880
And I'm the assistant director.

296
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,210
What?

297
00:18:25,210 --> 00:18:26,790
Now you really don't seem happy.

298
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,400
Why? Will you leave comments saying I suck?

299
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,640
I was so happy to be a part of this piece.

300
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,110
I meant to say congratulations.

301
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:50,680
 You're not leaving? You want to live here?

302
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,570
 Are you going to leave next year?

303
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,880
Okay, got it.

304
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,410
It's the alcohol talking.

305
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:02,060
He has had a few beers.

306
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,450
Your fever is gone.

307
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:11,930
I think I need to leave first. See you back in Seoul.

308
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,500
Okay.

309
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,350
Gosh, I really hoped it was anyone but Kim Yeong Rae.

310
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,870
I shouldn't have said I was okay with anyone.

311
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:44,940
I'm going to find out what dude is writing for Kim Yeong Rae no matter what.

312
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,500
Geez, we haven't even eaten. What the heck are we doing?

313
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,070
You had potatoes and beer earlier.

314
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,260
This punk, you're talking back to me?

315
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:59,770
Hey, tell the station tomorrow that you can't be the assistant director for Yang Mi Soon's drama.

316
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,760
I heard you did some stuff in the US.

317
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,230
What, Sundance? Sundance is nice.

318
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:08,800
But now you're going to direct that trashy script from Yang Mi Soon?

319
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:12,300
Never mind the script. Do you know how rude she is?

320
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,840
She wants to have script meetings over KakaoTalk. Crazy b****.

321
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
If you're a newbie, act like a newbie by just writing what I tell you to write.

322
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,200
How dare she be so arrogant?

323
00:20:23,130 --> 00:20:24,610
Hey.

324
00:20:24,610 --> 00:20:28,450
Your respected sunbae is speaking. How dare you try to answer a personal call?

325
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:31,310
I don't think it's personal.

326
00:20:31,310 --> 00:20:32,670
Yes, go ahead.

327
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:34,680
 Hey, did you ignore your dad's call again?

328
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,340
 You're dead, man.

329
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,870
He's your cousin?

330
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:41,830
Wrap it up over there. I need you to do something, so call me as soon as you get to Seoul.

331
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,790
What's your ETA? Did you get Yeong Rae?

332
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,120
Yes, Station Director!

333
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,790
He didn't find me. I made myself be found.

334
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:52,030
So we're on our way back to Seoul together.

335
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:55,000
Station Director, I think you'll have to make a choice.

336
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,680
Is it Director Kim or Writer Yang?

337
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:04,610

338
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,460
Hey, where are you going? Stop right there!

339
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:18,670
Abandoning your sunbae is a crime!

340
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:23,930
Hey, younger cousin of the Station Director, sir! You can't be like this!

341
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:28,010
 Pick out a cake and flowers to send to Writer Yang Mi Soon.

342
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,320
 Pick something that would appeal to a woman's sense.

343
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,180
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

344
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:34,550
 No need to go yourself. Get it delivered.

345
00:21:34,550 --> 00:21:37,270
What is the most beautiful flower in the shop?

346
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:39,840
What's the age range of the recipient?

347
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,010
Well? I'm not sure exactly.

348
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,970
Just get me a bouquet this big and make it really pretty.

349
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,410
What is this? Why am I here?

350
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:55,470
I am certain I asked for delivery.

351
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,090
 Ba Reum runs to his destined partner with flowers in hand.

352
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:02,880
 Today is Day 1 of their romance.

353
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,950
There he is.

354
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:15,040

355
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:20,620

356
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:30,300
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

357
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,800
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

358
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,360
♫  I wanna fallin' love love love love  ♫

359
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:38,430

360
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:43,490
♫  Once the moment which brushed by  ♫

361
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:48,090
♫  Stays with me  ♫

362
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:51,400
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

363
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:56,610
♫  The wind blows, taking us somewhere  ♫

364
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:01,230
♫  Without a word  ♫

365
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,600
♫  No one knows  ♫

366
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,120
♫  Just leave with the flow  ♫

367
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,770
♫  Close your eyes and fly  ♫

368
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,230
♫  Beyond the skyline  ♫

369
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,560
♫  Our own skyline  ♫
