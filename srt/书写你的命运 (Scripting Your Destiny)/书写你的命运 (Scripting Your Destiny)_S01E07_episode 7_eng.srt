1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:10,120

2
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,020
 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 7

3
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,840
This is your last chance to give up and get out.

4
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,470
Are you sure you won't regret this?

5
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,210
Yes.

6
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,100
It's a pass! A pass! Congratulations!

7
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,410
You clap, too. Hurry.

8
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,250
I just don't get it.

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,960
Do you think I do?

10
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,110
You said to come to work at 12:30 tomorrow, right?

11
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,120
I'll get going now.

12
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:58,160
No need to bring anything. Just bring yourself. Just yourself!

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,500
- Are you really going to be like this? 
 - LIke what?

14
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,920
How do you expect me to hire my landlord as my assistant writer? That's awkward.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,310
Shouldn't it be more comfortable since I'm a landlord?

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,700
You can fire me more comfortably.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:15,780
Even if you fire me, I won't starve nor will my future be hopeless.

18
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,420
Your lines are good.

19
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:20,420
All right.

20
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,580
But do you know exactly whose assistant writer you've just been hired as?

21
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:27,500
I know. That you're Writer Yang Mi Soon.

22
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:30,080
You really did know everything.

23
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,930
But no matter how I look at it, it's so weird.

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,800
There are exactly three people who know I'm Yang Mi Soon.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,200
My mom, me, and the RBS station director.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,100
You said it wasn't my mom, and it wasn't me.

27
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,190
- Do you know our station director? 
 - No, I don't.

28
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,760
Then you really figured it out just by looking at the rental contract?

29
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,450
Let's say it's because of inevitable fate

30
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,720
that your landlord is your assistant writer.

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,900
Are you good now?

32
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,710
Not good.

33
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,900
- We haven't fixed this yet.
- Damn ...

34
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:07,540
Is he in a cult or something? Always talking about fate...

35
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,410
What the. Why is it not moving?

36
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:15,300
Is he just pretending to leave?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
No way. What?

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
This is totally broken, isn't it?

39
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,100
 I'll take 20 hotdogs.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,750
- Hi.
- Hi.

41
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,300
- Are you getting a hotdog, too? 
 - Huh? Yeah.

42
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,690
I'll take one hotdog.

43
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:41,300
Give hers first since she's only getting one.

44
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,730
You didn't have to...

45
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,110
You live in this alley, too?

46
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,610
I am in charge of this area, yes.

47
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,400
I'll pay for hers as well.

48
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Yes.

49
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,740
This oppa will buy you one. Enjoy.

50
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,010
Oppa...

51
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:00,160
You say "Oppa" ... You are probably way younger than me.

52
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,270
What?

53
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:05,120
You get cuter every time I see you.

54
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,280
No way. Do I have the same symptom as Ho Yoon?

55
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,720
Sunbaenim, this is not about me but about a friend of mine.

56
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,800
Yes, not you but your friend. Let's hear it.

57
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,240
- By the way, what is that? 
 - It's a hotdog.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,080
You know God of Destiny, Samshin,

59
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,150
God of Land, God of Water, et cetera.

60
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,110
There are lots of gods, you know.

61
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,420
Do the gods experience heartaches

62
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,600
where their hearts throb and break?

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,900
Why would anyone go around and spill useless feelings on a human?

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,150
Apparently, that's what they say when it's their time to die.

65
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,330
Die?

66
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:57,370
To be exact, they get eliminated.

67
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,260
What does getting eliminated mean?

68
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:02,640
All memories are deleted and they disappear from the world for a period of time.

69
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,950
When a god has personal feelings toward a human,

70
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,480
the order of the universe falls apart. So that rule was set.

71
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,370
Recently, one punk...

72
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,800
Well...

73
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,960
- What's that, by the way? 
 - It' s a hotdog.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,540
Up to what extent does "personal feelings" cover?

75
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,180
Bliss, sorrow, love, hatred.

76
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,080
Sometimes, even a mere shard of pity.

77
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:28,320
In my 117th or 118th year,

78
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,730
I heard a rumor that someone got eliminated on his first day of being a god.

79
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,200
Really? Who was it?

80
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,030
That I don't know. The higher-ups keep their mouths shut.

81
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:40,500
He must've fallen in love on his first day.

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,770
No.

83
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,240
No.  I heard he saved somebody's life.

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:48,300
Sometimes gods who've been scripting destinies for a long period of time make such mistakes

85
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,600
because they get too close to humans.

86
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:55,700
But that stupid punk, apparently, did that on his first day in the world.

87
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,370
Where have you been roaming about all day?

88
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,370
- What are you holding in your hands? 
 - I'm not sure.

89
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:31,920
Out of bliss, love, sorrow, and hatred, which do you think it is?

90
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,290
What's with you now?

91
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,980
- I've made up my mind. 
 - Don't!

92
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,590
I've never seen a decision lead to a good outcome.

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,530
You know I lived a long time, right?

94
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,200
- What is she eating? 
 - A hotdog. It's yummy even though it has become cold.

95
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,360
I bet it's killer when it's warm.

96
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,940
I want to wear a school uniform and eat hotdogs.

97
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,720
- I want to go to school! 
 - School?

98
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,130
That's ridiculous.

99
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,970
No one here has been to school. School, yeah right.

100
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,940
Right?

101
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,800
You're the one who's being ridiculous.

102
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,730
I'm clocking out.

103
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:06,110
Hey, why did you look at me like that just now?

104
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,890
By chance, have you attended school?

105
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:11,840
I want to go to school.

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:26,660
When he gets here tomorrow, we'll write the contract first thing.

107
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,500
 Standard Employment Contract

108
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,890
Wow, I don't even know his name yet.

109
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,570
 Real Estate Rental Contract: Shin Ho Yoon

110
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,890
I see... His name is Shin Ho Yoon.

111
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,520
 Shin Ho Yoon!

112
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:59,680
Oh, I have heard his friend call him that.

113
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,440
Pull yourself together.

114
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,620
Gosh, Mom.  Somebody might think we're newlyweds.

115
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:28,120
♫  Suddenly, when you look at me  ♫

116
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,420
♫  You seem to see more than anyone before  ♫

117
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,060
♫  I'm all tingles and chills  ♫

118
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:47,050
Have you gone mad, Go Che Gyeong? Why are you imagining such a thing?

119
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,290
Mom!

120
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,350
I'm imagining weird st—

121
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,740
No, I mean, I think I need to drink a restorative tonic!

122
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:56,010
 RBS

123
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,940
 Sky Cash.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,100
It's scheduled to air starting June 12.

125
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,840
I guarantee that next year's grand prize will come from Sky Cash.

126
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,490
All right. Kim Yeong Rae says he'd rather die.

127
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:12,900
Who'd like to receive next year's grand prize?

128
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,300
Would you like to receive it as a group? Co-direct?

129
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,790
Seriously, no one is going to raise their hand?

130
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,100
Me.

131
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,500
What?

132
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,800
I'll do it.

133
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,610
Mom.

134
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,480
I came at the time you told me to,

135
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,570
I came at the time you told me to, but you must tend to be late.

136
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,660
Mom's not here?

137
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,680
She told me the ten commandments of assistant writers,

138
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:48,240
gave me coffee, then took off for work.

139
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,520
Ten commandments...

140
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,800
According to number eight on the ten commandments of assistant writers, I should open the door.

141
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:15,170
What's this? Why are you in this house?

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,850
- I got hired as an assistant writer. 
 - Assistant writer?

143
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,900
- Really? 
 - Yes.

144
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,830
After Hyung Yeong Rae left, it's been decided today that I'll direct Sky Cash.

145
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,360
Finally, you took your first step toward becoming a famous director.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
Assistant writers don't butt in on conversations like this.

147
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,670
I...

148
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,800
I ... I mean, my mom will be happy.

149
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,200
-  You're happy too, right? 
 - I couldn't ask for more.

150
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
I'm here, Ms. Writer!

151
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,180
Oh, Mom's not here right now.

152
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:45,440
So it was just the two of you here?

153
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,060
Why are you calling the coffee shop owner "Ms. Writer"?

154
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,700
She's not the writer. She is.

155
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,170
I was waiting...

156
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:56,320
for you to be comfortable enough to tell me, Che Gyeong.

157
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,800
Wait a second.  So right now, I am the only one now who didn't know?

158
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,450
You both knew who I am?

159
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,090
When did you find out?

160
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:09,400
I've known for quite a long time. Quite a long time.

161
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,600
That's quite vague.

162
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,300
I've known since day one.

163
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:18,900
Quiet, the two of you and sit down right there.

164
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:30,220
Did either of you ever tell anyone that I'm Yang Mi Soon?

165
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,720
Never.

166
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,240
You sound so different from when you talk to me.

167
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,810
- When will you clock out? 
 - I just came to work.

168
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,700
Did you hire him, Writer Go?

169
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,200
What do I do...

170
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:50,200
Wait... I was only joking.  Did I go too far?

171
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
It's not that.

172
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:59,020
This is the first time someone other than Station Director called me "Writer Go."

173
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,900
I'm just happy.  I had to hide it all this time.

174
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,800
You scared me. You're the best, Writer Go.

175
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,720
Writer Go, we should get to work.

176
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,700
What is he staring at so diligently? I didn't assign him any tasks.

177
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:51,310
Just now. Clearly...

178
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,340
What's wrong with me these days?

179
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,720
 Ten Commandments of an Assistant Writer

180
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,680
 Number one. When she asks, "What's the best drama you've seen lately?"

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:06,460
 grill her meat.

182
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,000
 When she says, "Isn't that writer so good?"

183
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,100
 grill her meat.

184
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:19,410
- Which high school did you graduate from? 
  - Why are you asking?

185
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,740
An interview is standard procedure among others when hiring an assistant

186
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,150
but we skipped all that, so I'm getting to it at least now.

187
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,130
You're saying you have lots of questions.

188
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,380
- What's the next question? 
 - When was your first love?

189
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,200
Why ask such a personal question when you're hiring an assistant writer?

190
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,340
- You asked me when we first met. 
 - I don't remember.

191
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,620
First love? Ridiculous.

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,100
It's true.

193
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:41,470
You were dumped. Big time, too.

194
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,780
You had a crush on the prettiest girl in school.  Get to work.

195
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:48,210
Come up with five incidents from when Geum Gang Seok was in high school.

196
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,000
 I'm just surprised.

197
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,600
 I've never taken such a long walk with someone before.

198
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,250
 When Go Che Gyeong approaches me, my heart heats up.

199
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:48,250
 It throbs when I'm looking at her face.

200
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:50,650
 I can't bear it when our eyes meet.

201
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:57,200
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

202
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:02,300
♫  Again, I'll engrave you  ♫

203
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:07,460
♫  Even if it's too late and we are too far apart it will be us again  ♫

204
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:10,730
♫  If it is destiny  ♫

205
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,600
Is the time now?  To show her a god's dignity.

206
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,730
 Go Che Gyeong

207
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,800
 Go Che Gyeong lifts her head and looks at the assistant writer.

208
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,190
Do you want to eat ramen?

209
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:47,410
I've seen that movie.

210
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,400
Wow. We have a nickel silver pot at home?

211
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:04,400
In TV dramas and movies, they always cook it in this.

212
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,890
The real cliché of a ramen scene is this.

213
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,900
When a man and a woman eat ramen, they always bite onto a single noodle together.

214
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,900
Then their eyes always meet. Cue romantic sound effect.

215
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,870
 You let go. I'm the main writer.

216
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,800
 You let go. I'm a god of destiny.

217
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,850
 You must be blind to your own fate.

218
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:45,320
 I have no mercy when it comes to food.

219
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,270
 You are being competitive over such a weird thing.

220
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,900
 No, this is just me cussing. 
 (TN: "seung-boo-yok" is competitiveness, "yok" is cussing)

221
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,200
 All right, don't regret it.

222
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:11,320
I won!

223
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,700
Wow, what a pretty diary.

224
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:19,900
Make it a love journal.  You should fall in love next year. Lovey-dovey!

225
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,500
Oh, my, my, my. You're crazy! Crazy! Love, my foot.

226
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,400
Why not? Che Gyeong will take good care of her baby sibling.

227
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,830
I had a tiger dream last night.

228
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:31,900
No matter how I look at it, it was a conception dream.

229
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,400
You buy it, Mother. Does a tiger mean it's a son?

230
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,310
Hey, I had a tiger dream when I had Che Gyeong.

231
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,610
Could that have been why? Everyone asked if she was my son.

232
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:43,600
Even when I put on a pink hairpin, everyone said she is fit to become a general.

233
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,260
Everyone said, "She's dashing."

234
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,480

He got it as a gift from a five-year-old boy.

235
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,900
 A friend he can't see anymore or something like that.

236
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:09,300
 It's a piece of memory from 20 or 30 years ago.

237
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,410
♫  Carefully realize who you are...  ♫

238
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,490
♫  How you swept away by your lullaby  ♫

239
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,950
What's up?

240
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:27,330
What do you mean?

241
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,300
How could you put that on your dashboard without any contact info?

242
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,580
How long is "Just a moment"? I was just thinking those thoughts.

243
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,900
If someone is waiting, I'll know. Like just now.

244
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:44,200
Were you looking down from up above or something?

245
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,400
Go Eun Seon!

246
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:50,700
♫  Don't you know  ♫

247
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,420
Who's this?

248
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,900
This is my best friend.  This is my assistant

249
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:02,930
Wow. Go Che Gyeong, you really were a general.

250
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,010
Did you save a country in your past life?

251
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,790
Want me to check?

252
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,010
What?

253
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,790
He has a unique character. Let's go.

254
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,900
Bye.

255
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,680
Go Eun Seon?

256
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:46,230
 Wow, daebak. It's been a gazillion years.  Did you always have this picture?

257
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,810
What?

258
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:15,270
 - Go Eun Seon! 
 - Shin Ho Yoon!

259
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:43,930
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

260
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:46,270
♫  I wanna make love  ♫
