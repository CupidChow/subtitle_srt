1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,140

3
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:30,150
Samshins write destiny books after undergoing lengthy training. 
  (Grandma Samshin is a mythical goddess of childbirth).

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,340
With wishes on laurel trees and the Milky Way Galaxy,

5
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,670
a precious book is created.

6
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:40,060
We hope for the writing of a good destiny.

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:45,310
But! How can you write this book so sloppily?

8
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:48,210
Born in 1997. Entered elementary school in 2004.

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:51,810
Graduated in 2011. Military Service.

10
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:57,100
Whatever. Lives happily ever after, then dies.

11
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,000
What's the problem, samshin trainee?

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,800
Even a resume is longer than that.

13
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,950
Human stories are all the same.

14
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:04,430
Besides, we're in Korea.

15
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,660
For life through high school, you can basically copy and paste.

16
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:07,960
And honestly, adults are the same.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,470
We can make templates for every neighborhood and occupation.

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,170
Ctrl + C, Ctrl +V work, pretty much.

19
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,680

20
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,290
- The date's wrong.
 - Again?

21
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:21,620
You know what's written in the book happens, right?

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,030
Thanks to you, this child will repeat one year of elementary school.

23
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,780
Then he can just graduate a year early.

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,020
Please watch Ho Yoon and learn.

25
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:33,600
Starting at birth, each and every story line he laid out comes true every year.

26
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:36,770
Every book he writes is  a piece of art, a masterpiece.

27
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,660
- Aren't you ashamed of yourself? 
 - Every god has his own style.

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,230
I'm aiming for lives with blank spaces.

29
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:44,590
That "blank space" leads humans to die from accidents.

30
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:46,700
Hey, Grandma. Get lost.

31
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,340
For an apprentice, you nag like an elder.

32
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:51,860
I'm not a grandma. Right?

33
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,100
According to our culture, samshins are grandmas from birth. Right?

34
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,770
What is love?

35
00:01:57,770 --> 00:01:59,420
- What? 
 - What?

36
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,170
It was the sweetest first date in years.

37
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:05,370
Why didn't they fall in love yet?

38
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,520
Does it make sense that after sharing an umbrella on a rainy day,

39
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,210
the girl and guy didn't even exchange phone numbers  before they separated?

40
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,820
I wanted to return it, but I don't have his number. Why don't you give it to Sunbae Min Chang?

41
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,130
Sunbae often comes to your bank, right?

42
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,640
Is that the issue here?

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,620
Are you saying Jeong Ba Reum walked you home last night?

44
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,300
 What? Che Gyeong really left?

45
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,850
 She did.

46
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:31,090
 Sunbae, why did you bring a guy like that?

47
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,410
 He's weird.

48
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,450
 I agree.

49
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:37,020
 Aren't you all friends?

50
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,410
 He's not my friend. He's his friend.

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,760
 What's the friend's phone number?

52
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,300
 - Mine? 
 - No, not yours. Your friend's.

53
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,080
 The one who ran off.

54
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,010
 Go ask her yourself.

55
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,720
 Then I should run.

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,460
 I'm leaving. Bye.

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,020
 - What's wrong with him? 
- I know.

58
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:01,800
 He should go right, but he's going left.  Go right! Right!

59
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,990
Goodness. He was running not knowing left or right.

60
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,880
So?

61
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,600
I didn't realize it, but he got on the same bus.

62
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,920
You know how it rained all of a sudden?

63
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,480
I had to get off, but it was raining, and I was umbrella-less.

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,620
I thought I was screwed, but guess what?

65
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,800
I got off the bus, and it suddenly stopped raining.

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:31,380
Just above my head.

67
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,500
Daebak. It was Jeong Ba Reum.

68
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,790
Yeah, he was holding up an umbrella.

69
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,710
Not even noticing his back was getting wet.

70
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,430
 You don't have an umbrella, right?

71
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:46,850
 Even if you do, don't take it out, so I won't feel awkward.

72
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,530
 I didn't realize you lived in my neighborhood.

73
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,290
 I don't live in this neighborhood.

74
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,690
 I live in Cheongdam-dong.

75
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,850
 So why did you get on the bus to this neighborhood?

76
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,640
 Because you were on it?

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,990
 I followed you, Che Gyeong.

78
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:06,000
 At eleven o'clock on a rainy Sunday night?

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,740
 I should be terrified right now, right?

80
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,470
 Is that how it goes?

81
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:12,940
 My back is all wet.

82
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:16,190
 I'm only holding the umbrella over you, Che Gyeong.

83
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,160
 I'm sorry.

84
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,710
 I am being a bit strange today.

85
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:24,690
 All of a sudden, I was on the bus.

86
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:27,510
 All of a sudden, I was off the bus.

87
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,810
 I wish it would keep raining until next year.

88
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,520
 Maybe I'm just losing it.

89
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,950
But you know, I felt strange, too.

90
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,530
Strange, how?

91
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:43,580
A rainy night. A bus stop. A man you just met. An umbrella.

92
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,660
Doesn't that remind you of anything?

93
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:48,050
Not really?

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,560
Oh. I just thought of something.

95
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
Magenta Pink Rain?

96
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,760

97
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,790
 "Under a small umbrella..."

98
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,530
 "the two of their shoulders almost touched, then didn't..."

99
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,900
 Hey, are they going to kiss? Are they?

100
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,300
 Crazy b****. They just met. Just wait.

101
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:15,270
 The two of them stood awkwardly at the crosswalk.

102
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:18,500
 The red light flashes in front of them.

103
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,620
 As the raindrops get thicker...

104
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:24,900
 their breathing gets closer, too. But right then...

105
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:28,620
 Vroom! A car drives past, threateningly.

106
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,420
 The man pulls the woman's arms toward him.

107
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:46,710
♫  Carefully realize who you are...  ♫

108
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,860
 They are so close that they can feel each other's breathing.

109
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,960
♫  Got swept away by you  ♫

110
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,640
 You're not hurt, right?

111
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,140
 Yes, I'm fine.

112
00:05:57,140 --> 00:06:00,700
 You should look to make sure you're okay.

113
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:05,090
 I did. I don't think I'm hurt.

114
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,220
 But you've ruined your clothes.

115
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,980
 I'll go get some tissues or something.

116
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:11,380
 Tissues won't help anyway.

117
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:15,520
 If I walked you home looking like this, I probably wouldn't win your number.

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,240
 Let's see each other again sometime when I'm dry.

119
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,630
 I'm all wet anyway.

120
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,210
 You take this, Che Gyeong.

121
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,060
 I'll get going.

122
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,400
Where did he go? He was already wet! Why did he leave?

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,070
Who cares about dry clothes? You should have dried off together!

124
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,290
Hey.

125
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,180
But even the dialogue feels similar.

126
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,960
I know.

127
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,750
It has to be a coincidence, right?

128
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,070
It's fate. So what did he say after he got home? Look at your Kakao.

129
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:59,910
I don't even have his number. Why would I have his Kakao?

130
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:01,540
You are so stupid.

131
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,770
Hey. He left you his umbrella.

132
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,410
You should've said, "Hey, I need your number to return your umbrella."

133
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,590
What? Does he not look cute when he's soaked?

134
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,490
No. The opposite.

135
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,560
At that moment, Jeong Ba Reum was so handsome.

136
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:19,940
His hair was all glistening...

137
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,290
He took me in his arms and looked down at me. The angle...

138
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,840
But why didn't I get butterflies?

139
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,150
You really are stupid.

140
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,100
Hey. If he is attractive, that should give you butterflies.

141
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,640
Fine. It's over now.

142
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,170
Have you heard of "Accounting for the Married"?

143
00:07:38,010 --> 00:07:40,320
- What? 
 - I heard the writer is named Yang Mi Soon.

144
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,400
That's your mom's name, right? Daebak! That's so cool!

145
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,680
I feel like I know her. I love it.

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,360
But do you watch that drama?

147
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,920
I have no time to watch a drama with my new job.

148
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,120
Look. I'm already late. I have to go.

149
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,230
Okay. Bye!

150
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,850
Go Eun Seon! I mean, Go Che Gyeong!

151
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:14,120
It's raining again. Even the heavens say this umbrella belongs to you. Bye.

152
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,300
I haven't heard "Go Eun Sun" in a while.

153
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,450

154
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:36,220

155
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:40,520
This person is fated to have three names.

156
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,540

157
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:04,340

158
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,790

159
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,730
You can have the book. Can you let go of my finger?

160
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,300
Why would you let it go?

161
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:29,380
- It's good for the book to sell more copies. 
 - You think I'm going to buy a copy?

162
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,980
Or don't. This book is in high demand. Sold out everywhere.

163
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:38,290
Actually, I'm more interested in the writer than the drama.

164
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,440
What do you want to know?

165
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,170
What kind of men does she like?

166
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,680
What?

167
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:49,480
You can buy this book. A book is nicer than an e-file anyway.

168
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:55,110
What was that?

169
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,690
Does he know who I am?

170
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,870
 Number 4444.

171
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,980
 That's the landlord of our building.

172
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,460
He's the landlord?

173
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:22,360
I thought he looked young from afar.

174
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,470
But up close, he looks like a kid.

175
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,110
Gosh, must be nice

176
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:28,510
to be a kid and own a building.

177
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:31,420
- Get in. 
 - Me? Why?

178
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,260
I'm on my way to the coffee shop. Get in.

179
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,420
You recognized who I am.

180
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,260
Your mom must have told you about me very often.

181
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,620
To set you up with me, no?

182
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,140
Not very often.

183
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,400
She mentioned you one time. Just one time.

184
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,520
But how did you know my mom runs the coffee shop?

185
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,080
You look exactly like your mom.

186
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,440
You have a sense of humor. Where are we going?

187
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,390
If you told me you were a time-traveling version of your mother, I would believe you.

188
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:04,550
I get why my mom likes you.

189
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:07,710
Handsome, insincere men are my mother's kryptonite.

190
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,520
Is that it? Am I kryptonite-level good-looking?

191
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:14,260
You didn't hear the "insincere" part?

192
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,750
I heard the coffee shop is doing very well now.

193
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,600
 I guess he is a wannabe writer. He's always writing.

194
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,700
 That reminds me. Can you read his stuff later?

195
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:32,050
 No way.  A privileged kid going after my job? I'm not helping.

196
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:35,450
 I'm worried he's going to quit writing and try to take over our shop.

197
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,230
 If a coffee shop does well,  the landlord always seems

198
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,070
 to try to take over and run it themselves.

199
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,760
 Our fate is in our lord's hands.

200
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,810
 Our landlord is really like that?

201
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,790
 - What is he like, really? 
 - Well, you saw.

202
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,300
 He's handsome. Tall.

203
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,280
 He has a full head of hair. He's easy on the eyes.

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,020
 Does that constitute a personality for you, Mom?

205
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,090
I don't know if it's doing well,

206
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,070
but my mom says this often these days

207
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:00,320
that our landlord has such a nice personality.

208
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,140
He's good, not greedy.

209
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:04,010
A rare gem. She talks about you every day.

210
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,140
Your mother is lying to you.

211
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,320
She told me money is everything.

212
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,430
She told me that's why she likes me.

213
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,110
I have too many books, don't I?

214
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,460
No matter how many I buy, I can't keep up with my reading pace.

215
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,460
Your buying can't keep up with your reading pace? Not the other way around?

216
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,450
You can't catch up to your buying pace?

217
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,720
But if you read a lot,

218
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,600
don't you become more perceptive to grammar and spelling?

219
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,940

220
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,090
I am, but this isn't my car.

221
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,460
It's a friend's car.

222
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:46,420
He got it as a gift from a five-year-old boy.

223
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,420
A friend he can't see anymore or something like that.

224
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:53,990
It's a piece of memory. From twenty, thirty years ago.

225
00:12:54,710 --> 00:12:57,150
Sorry. I was out of line.

226
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,550
But your friend had a car 20 years ago?

227
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,710
Probably more like from 120 years ago?

228
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,790
If he had a car then, wasn't he a Japanese collaborator?

229
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:08,420
I heard he was in Manchuria back then.

230
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,970
He had mandoo? ( Dumpling )

231
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,270
Should we change the subject? How was your first love?

232
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,090
You just met me and want to talk about my first love?

233
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:18,270
That's... quite an extreme shift.

234
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:20,240
What if you were someone else's first love?

235
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,060
And then you met him at a fateful moment?

236
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,700
You couldn't help but fall in love, right?

237
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,960
Keep your eyes on the road ahead, please.

238
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,400
Actually, watching the road ahead means little to me.

239
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,500
 What the? He's a total nutjob.

240
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:46,490
Please keep your eyes on the road ahead. Drive.

241
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:52,200
He won't tell us to move out, will he?

242
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,140
Mom, did you show a picture of me to the landlord?

243
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,010
- No. 
 - Then...

244
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,910
Did you tell him I write for TV?

245
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,270
No way!

246
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,170
You really didn't?

247
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:12,710
The minute he saw me, he knew I was your daughter.

248
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,690
That's because you and I look so alike.

249
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:16,590
That makes no sense!

250
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:19,720
But you met with our lord? How? Where? What did you do?

251
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,120
Did it feel natural?

252
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,920
 I gave Jeong Ba Reum your number.

253
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,990
 I told you not to! Why?

254
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,180
 Do you remember?  In the novel you wrote,

255
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,660
 the main character's friend always gives out her number.

256
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,830
So freaking awkward.

257
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,990
 Ba Reum sent a photo

258
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,300
 The shirt that drowned in the dirt is getting resuscitated at the laundromat.

259
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,280
 I just heard the prognosis. It seems like it won't survive.

260
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,790
 I'm going shopping to ease my grief. What kind of shirt should I get?

261
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:47,570
 Oh, by the way, it's Jeong Ba Reum.

262
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:49,710
Does he want me to pay for it?

263
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,460
In "Magenta Pink Rain," this is when he calls... Oh!

264
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:10,830
Hello?

265
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,560
 It's Jeong Ba Reum.

266
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,160
I know.

267
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,700
Why is your timing always so right on?

268
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,490
 Is it? Then I'm glad I called.

269
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,230
You have to return my umbrella.

270
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:24,920
Oh, your umbrella. I was going to give it to Sunbae Min Chang.

271
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,350
No.

272
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,970
I'd like to use this as an excuse to see you.

273
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,590

274
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,360
 Daebak. Your piece is in this!

275
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,370
 Our Korean teacher must be crazy. Something like this exposes me to being made fun of.

276
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:39,880
 Why is this in the school lit magazine?

277
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,470
 Hey. Even in Times New Roman, it's so good.

278
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:46,800
 "I'd like to use this as an excuse to see you."

279
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:52,880
 "Should we meet at that bus stop then?"

280
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,620
Where should I meet you?

281
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:00,200
Should we meet at that bus stop then?

282
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,500
Che Gyeong?

283
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,360
Hello?

284
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,300
What's wrong? Who called?

285
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,530
Mom, where's my copy of the lit magazine from high school?

286
00:16:22,530 --> 00:16:24,150
Which box did you put it in?

287
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,950
The boxes are at home.

288
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,900
- But I lent out the lit magazine. 
 - To whom?

289
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,860
- The landlord. 
 - The landlord?

290
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,840
Why would you lend that to him?

291
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:37,050
I ran into him in the elevator, and he had such a sad face.

292
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,710
 I'm looking for something, but it hasn't been easy to find.

293
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:43,490
 Do you maybe like romance movies or novels?

294
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:48,260
 Is there any particular book  that you've read recently that you really liked?

295
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,500
 I'm busy with the coffee shop. I don't have time to read...

296
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:56,560
 Oh. I was cleaning the house and read something my daughter wrote.

297
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,960
Stop it. Don't do this.

298
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:01,330
 - Was it enjoyable? 
 - Of course. My daughter wrote it.

299
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:02,980
 Stories of first love are always great.

300
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,770
 Could I read that?

301
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:06,690

302
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,060

303
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:18,160
Why is her name Go Eun Seon?

304
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,420
Is it a typo?

305
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:30,960
What is this?

306
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,340
The last guy was so sloppy with this.

307
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,130
No wonder he got eliminated.

308
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,970
Hey, Shin Ho Yoon!

309
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,460
I finally found a bottle of Romanée Conti from 1972!

310
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:47,430
I told you not to bring in western alcohol into the sacred Chilsung Hall.

311
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,430
Jeong Ba Reum again? Just stop it.

312
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,270
Feeling affection for humans never ends well.

313
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,590
Don't insult me. I'm not that stupid.

314
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:06,500
I am creating a perfect piece of art through cold-hearted calculations.

315
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,540
What are you doing?

316
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:12,920
Are you copying that? A high school lit magazine?

317
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,940
Here, you can see the depth within humans which is beyond divine comprehension.

318
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,140
Cringe-worthy. Heartbeat skipping. I like cheesy stuff.

319
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,250
Is that why you're plagiarizing now?

320
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,600
You're using a novel that a human wrote to write a human's destiny?

321
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,630
Plagiarizing? Can you use less disparaging language?

322
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,300
Hey. How can a god plagiarize someone's destiny?

323
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,130
It's different. They eat ramen here, but in my version, they eat naengmyun.  (Two kinds of noodles)

324
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:38,740
- Are they the same? 
 - Wow, you crazy bastard.

325
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:41,760
Then what am I supposed to do? I don't have any ideas.

326
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,120
But this book does.

327
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,420

328
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:46,930
He borrowed it about a week ago.

329
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:49,250
He must really like it if he's had it that long.

330
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:52,080
Never mind. What's his number? No, where does he live?

331
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,060
I think I am finished.  It's perfect.  They will fall in love.

332
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,630
If you don't understand love, ask me.

333
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:01,200
Even if I do everything else half-assed, I am incredible with love.

334
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,340
First, sparks fly and you have a fling.  You grab her hand and hold it.

335
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,050
For love to happen, you need to isolate them.

336
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,410
They visit an island, but there are no more returning boats. When that happens, the inn usually only has one room left.

337
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:12,500
Would it still work if I change the island to a mountain?

338
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,100

339
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:28,030
♫  Carefully what you've done with your wings now  ♫

340
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,730
♫  Carefully realizing you are  ♫

341
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,500
 But why do you think it always rains when we meet?

342
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,390
 I might've prayed too hard for it to rain until next year.

343
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,160
♫  Magical, mystical  ♫

344
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,960
 Perfect.

345
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,600
 I think they will fall in love.

346
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,880
I confessed my feelings first at last, and this how you respond?

347
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,990
Isn't this enough—

348
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:10,950

349
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,190
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

350
00:20:14,190 --> 00:20:16,430
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

351
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:22,380
 Scripting Your Destiny

352
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,350
♫  Once the moment which brushed by  ♫

353
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:31,960
♫  Stays with me  ♫

354
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,380
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

355
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:40,600
♫  The wind blows, taking us somewhere  ♫

356
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:45,180
♫  Without a word  ♫

357
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:47,240
♫  Nobody knows  ♫

358
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,070
♫  Just leave with the flow  ♫

359
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,680
♫  Close your eyes and fly  ♫

360
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,510
♫  Beyond the skyline  ♫
