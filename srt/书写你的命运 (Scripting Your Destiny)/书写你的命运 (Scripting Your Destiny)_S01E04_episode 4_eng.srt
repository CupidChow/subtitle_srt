1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:10,000

2
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,300
 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 4

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,590
Caramel macchiato for my lord.

4
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:29,590
Espresso for his friend.

5
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,480
This is on the house.

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,010
- Why? 
 - I heard you gave my daughter a ride.

7
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,280
She never leaves the house. She's so busy.

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,690
But it's so funny that the very day she left the house, she ran into you!

9
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:41,760
So it must be fate.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,740
Actually, it's a coincidence.

11
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:45,760
If she is so busy that she never leaves the house, she must've never dated.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,970
She couldn't. She couldn't.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,420
She has to leave the house to meet people for something to happen.

14
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,850
She just starting a new project. She'll be homebound for another year.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,420
If she's going to date, it has to be someone who lives in our building.

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,590
There's no other way. No other way.

17
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:04,680
You'll be set up for a date at this rate.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,970
I will make sure to send you to hell with my own two hands.

19
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,040
Gosh, your drink looks way too sweet.

20
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Your drink looks way too bitter.

21
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,680
Oh, right.

22
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,020
You know, right?

23
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,440
If two destinies contradict one another, the one written first comes true.

24
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:23,890
I realized it while going through my books yesterday.

25
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,900
I write the book for Jeong Ba Reum's cousin.

26
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:28,310
- Station Director Jeong? 
 - Yeah.

27
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,960
Jeong Ba Reum is about to be dragged back to the US.

28
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,520
I already wrote it all down like that.

29
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,750
It might end before he even tells her how he feels.

30
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,390
I'll kill you, then go to hell myself.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,960
 Ba Reum runs to his destined partner with flowers in hand.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,070
 Today is Day 1 of their romance.

33
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,320
He should know what to do with this.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,160
He's here.

35
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,570
 Today is Day 1 of their romance.

36
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:05,560
 Why is he going that way?

37
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:11,100
It must be because of this.

38
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,790
What happened?

39
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,270
"Today is Day 1 of their romance." It's gone!

40
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:19,710
A destiny that's been erased cannot be rewritten.

41
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,400
Excuse me.

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,000
I have a flower delivery. Is there a Yang Mi Soon here?

43
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,370
That's me.

44
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,170
Oh, my goodness! So beautiful!

45
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,670
- You're the one? 
 - Yes, I am Yang Mi Soon!

46
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,710
Who sent me such gorgeous flowers?

47
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,170
Well...

48
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:41,260
Nice to meet you, Ms. Writer. I am Assistant Director Jeong Ba Reum from RBS.

49
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,360
Let's go talk somewhere quiet.

50
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,270
Sure.

51
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:47,520
 Next up on tonight's news.

52
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:51,220
 Yang Mi Soon, who hit a home run with her debut drama "Accounting for the Married,"

53
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:54,190
 has returned with her next project, "Sky Cash."

54
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,980
 Geum Gang Seok is the richest man in South Korea.

55
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:59,490
 Eun Soo Jeong is a woman who loses her memory and her fortune.

56
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,680
 She is Geum Gang Seok's first love.

57
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,450
 The two lovers consummate their romance through perfect revenge.

58
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,480
 The drama is known to be a mystery revenge romance.

59
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,700
 I wonder what kind of sensational hit Yang Mi Soon will give us this time.

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:18,190
 Scene 2. At the resort.

61
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,120
Thank you again to our honored guests who made time to attend today.

62
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,490
We will now conduct the cutting ceremony!

63
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,620
Applause, please!

64
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,100
Thank you!

65
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,930
 The handsome man cutting the ribbons...

66
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,060
 The landlord?

67
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,670
What was that?

68
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,770
Get it together, Go Che Gyeong!

69
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,620
Kim Woo Bin is your male lead.

70
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,090
Why would the landlord just randomly pop up there?

71
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,980
I think someone just talked trash about me.

72
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,710
You deserve it.

73
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:02,680
What percentage of the people whose destiny you wrote win the lottery?

74
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,160
That's being human.  Sometimes, one moment of sweet luck

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,030
can give a person the strength to endure a long life.

76
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:13,800
I aspire for a life strengthened through suffering rather than chasing shallow luck.

77
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,450
Selfish bastard.

78
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,640
You say that while you have a freaking sweet drink.

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,030
I'll see you both later.

80
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,370
I have a very important guest, so...
  Jeong Ba Reum

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,160
Have a seat. Just a moment.

82
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,980
Yes, Ms. Writer. Feel free to speak casually around me.

83
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,920
Oh, of course. Of course.

84
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,400
 You don't have an umbrella, right?

85
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:48,800
 Even if you do, don't take it out, so I won't feel awkward.

86
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:59,020
Where are you?  Hey, something came from the station.

87
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,450
- From the station? 
 -  The assistant director brought it himself.

88
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:05,960
Who brought what?

89
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,440
Che Gyeong?

90
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,860
How are you here?

91
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,190
What? What happened?

92
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,740
Is Che Gyeong your daughter, Writer Yang Mi Soon?

93
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,100
Well...

94
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,540
Che Gyeong is Yang Mi Soon's daughter. That's correct.

95
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,640
But how do you know each other?

96
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,490
Oh, my friend went to school with Che Gyeong.

97
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,430
We met for the first time over drinks.

98
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,900
What a big coincidence!

99
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:47,080
Why did the station director send someone without telling me?

100
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,920
So what do your parents do?

101
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,570
They have a business in Los Angeles.

102
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,400
My goodness.

103
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,950
They must be worried sleepless, sending their handsome son to Korea.

104
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,220
When they can't fall asleep, they watch dramas.

105
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,150
- "Accounting for the Married"
 - Oh, wow, wow!

106
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,720
Mr. Assistant Director, you're so witty!

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,080
Gosh, look at me!

108
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,970
Let me get you something to drink.

109
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:17,670
Okay.

110
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:28,080
 White Ending

Why does this keep happening? It's like a lie.

125
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,370
Why are these here?

126
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,260
Should we go out to talk?

127
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:45,670
My mom has to work...

128
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,030
Sure.

129
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:48,580
Ms. Writer! I'm heading out.

130
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,840
But you haven't had your tea!

131
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,230
We can have one at the cafe. Mom, go ahead and work.

132
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:54,890
You need to work on episode seven.

135
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,210
What kind of coffee do you like?

136
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,930
Just an Americano, please. Hot.

137
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,220
The flowers weren't completely useless.

138
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,930
She likes edible flowers, though.

139
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,690
Don't you need to work?

140
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:22,730
I have 5,900 new books to go through.

141
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:28,700
Where was the restroom again...

142
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,350
I heard he wants to be a writer.

143
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,190
 Baek Hye Joo

144
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,030
  That's being human.

145
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,050
 Sometimes one moment of sweet luck

146
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,990
 can give a person the strength to endure a long life.

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,110
Did you buy something?

148
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,860
Odor remover for my fridge.

149
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:13,540
I work late every day. I don't have time to clean the fridge.

150
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,240
I feel like my Yoo Bin's baby food smells like kimchi.

151
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:20,480
Yoo Bin is handling the treatment well, right?

152
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,060
He's just a kid, but he's doing better than I would.

153
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:30,020
What is that? They must be giving out prizes.

154
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,610
It's a lottery ticket.

155
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:33,690
Probably just a "Good luck next time!"

156
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,880
No, no. You must believe that luck is around the corner.

157
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,040
 Everyday Store Giveaway: Refrigerator

158
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,900
- Daebak! 
 - Oh, my!

159
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,480
Look at that!

160
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,820
She bought an odor remover for her fridge and won a fridge?

161
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:48,790
Yeah. The newest model, too. Daebak, right?

162
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,260
Maybe God really does exist.

163
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:53,500
Nah. No such thing.

164
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,380
Hold on.

165
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,900
Are Ba Reum and Eun Seon doing well?

166
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,670
It's not happening.

167
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,970
Also, she changed her name to Go Che Gyeong years ago.

168
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,690
Why still call her Eun Seon?

169
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:06,120
I don't see her often.

170
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,240
Why did she suddenly change her name in college?

171
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:11,080
Did something happen?

172
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,700
She was acting weird for a while.

173
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,760
Like she had a loose screw. Right?

174
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,290
What do you mean she was acting weird?

175
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,960
She changed her name, and she was at the top of her class. Then she was so successful.

176
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,620
That's why people change their names.

177
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,460
She's not doing so great these days, though.

178
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,410
I think she even quit preparing for her civil service exam.

179
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:30,550
Please tell the director thank you for the flowers and the cake.

180
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:35,120
But please don't tell anyone that you met my mom today.

181
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,060
She doesn't even meet with the director, so...

182
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,500
I get why you were so passionate about the "Accounting for the Married" now.

183
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,390
Don't worry. My personality sucks, so I don't have close friends.

184
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:55,360
Wow. Are they still together?

185
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,920
This is a good sign.

186
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,650
Maybe he'll tell her how he feels today.

187
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,160
He can't.

188
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,500
"Today is Day 1 of their romance" got erased.

189
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,010
They might start dating out of their free will, starting tomorrow.

190
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,290
I was in a car accident once.

191
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,760
- When?
 - Before I started my military service.

192
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,520
I had to be hospitalized for quite a long time, so I was sad.

193
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,020
I told myself I will walk out of the hospital with a great script.

194
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:23,940
I tried to put a positive spin on it, but...

195
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,260
- I didn't write a single line.
 - Why not?

196
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:31,150
At the time, I was really into "White Ending," written by the writer Go'spresso.

197
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:35,960
Actually, that Go'spresso is my first love.

198
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,490
What? Why? How?

199
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,710
Go'spresso is just a pseudonym for a writer, no?

200
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,510
I respected her.

201
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,400
She seemed cool. I envied her.

202
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,960
And I wanted to meet her someday.

203
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,150
Every line I read made my heart beat fast.

204
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,000
If that's not love, I've never been in love.

205
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:10,470
You're one of those people I've heard about, who learned about love from books.

206
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,660
I guess.

207
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,840
But I saw that you had all those books at your house.

208
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,240
The collector's edition that I couldn't even get my hands on.

209
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,720
R-Really?

210
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,840
We have such things at my house?

211
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,110
Yes.

212
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,360
So I learned something very important.

213
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,310
So, Che Gyeong, my first love...

214
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,870
is your mother.

215
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:33,350
What?

216
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,400
- Whoa. 
 - That idiot?

217
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:38,600
I feel like all of this is fate.

218
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,380
I like that you are the daughter of my first love.

219
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:45,020
So I was thinking...

220
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,510
Do you want to...

221
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,420
be a couple, starting the day after tomorrow?

222
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,500
You want to date the daughter of your first love, starting the day after tomorrow?

223
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,790
Isn't that a little melodramatic?

224
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:10,350
And why the day after tomorrow?

225
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,750
Why? You're busy today and tomorrow?

226
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:16,100
First of all, I don't want to get dumped today and tomorrow.

227
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:20,400
And there's one more thing I want to ask you.

228
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,940
- What is it? 
 - The person you got a ride from the rest stop at Daegwallyeong.

229
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:28,780
is that person over there, right?

230
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,620
Oh. Yeah.

231
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,520
But he's not your boyfriend, right?

232
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,180
Gosh, what are you talking about? He  is the landlord.

233
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,460
I just happened to run into him then.

234
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,430
Good, then. Hold on a second.

235
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,900
Excuse me, do you know me?

236
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,100
- Why are you asking? 
 - I saw the notebook earlier on your table.

237
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,780
It had my name on it.

238
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,800
Jeong Ba Reum is not a common name.

239
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,400
- I think you saw it wrong. 
 - I think I am correct.

240
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,540
Let me take a look.

241
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,860
 Baek Hye Joo

242
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,410
Can someone explain to me what's going on?

243
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:29,610
Earlier, he spilled my friend's coffee.

244
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,440
And ruined something valuable.

245
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,790
So I thought he was coming over to apologize.

246
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,950
And I was going to generously accept his apology,

247
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:38,200
but he's acting quite belligerently.

248
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,600
He wouldn't do that for no reason.

249
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,940
I'll pay you for the coffee.

250
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:49,290
If it ruined your clothes, send me the dry cleaning bill.

251
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,170
Save it. It's bad for the earth.

252
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:03,120
Coffee money doesn't mean that much to me.

253
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,500
Let's go.

254
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,840
A relationship starting the day after tomorrow...

255
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,110
That was a good move.

256
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:17,870
See you again.

257
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,240
Wow, that was freaky.

258
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,730
Jeong Ba Reum managed to see it in that split second.

259
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,440
Maybe you can see your own name extra clearly.

260
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,900
This has never happened before. There's no way to know.

261
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,810
Don't do anything yet.

262
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,350
Don't report it. You'll get in big trouble.

263
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,470
Mind your own business.

264
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:41,390
And remember. If I get in trouble, I'll say I was sitting next to you.

265
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,060
- What about it? 
 - You were sitting with me,

266
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,400
but you didn't try to stop me, and I will be sure to tell them that.

267
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,670
I hate you.

268
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:55,090
We need to talk for a second. 
Give me back my literary magazine.

269
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,950
You live in the penthouse, right?

270
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,050
I'll wait in front of the door.

271
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,310
That's not going to work. It's not here. I have it at my other place.

272
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,140
And I don't know when I'm going to go there.

273
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:06,030
I ordinarily go maybe once a year.

274
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,890
- Are you kidding me? 
 - It's from your school days.

275
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,260
- Do you really need it right now? 
 - Yes. Right now.

276
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:14,110
I know this is going to sound strange,

277
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,900
but strange things keep happening to me lately.

278
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:20,420
What happened in the story keeps happening to me.

279
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,340
Don't look at me like that. I know I sound weird.

280
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,590
Anyway, I'm losing sleep and can't work. I'm going insane.

281
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,160
Hurry and give it back. It's mine.

282
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,610
- Go Che Gyeong. 
 - Yes?

283
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:39,730
- The coffee shop is doing well, right? 
 - You used that line last time!

284
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:47,510
Aren't you getting out? You live on the 13th floor.

285
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:52,120
I'll get out when you answer me. When are you going to return my magazine?

286
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,510
First, give me your number.

287
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:57,610
You won't get through to him anyhow. Talk to me.

288
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:00,340
My voice happens to sound as sweet as honey.

289
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,800
Hey, look!

290
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,800
What are you doing right now?

291
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,100
Giving you his number.

292
00:17:09,830 --> 00:17:12,400
You know you guys are both really weird, right?

293
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,710
You're really weird... but thank you.

294
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,900
By the way, this is my phone. He doesn't have one.

295
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,560
Are you kidding me? Then how do I get in touch with the landlord?

296
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,250
There's a suggestion box next to the mailboxes on the first floor.

297
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,550
You can put in your suggestions to the landlord there.

298
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,990
Are we in the Joseon Dynasty? Send letters?

299
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,930
You're not going to date him nor be friends.

300
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,470
So you won't be writing letters that often anyway.

301
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:42,740
But if you're not in a position to write a letter to put in the box,

302
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,350
then call me at the number I gave you.

303
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,610
Why would I call you?

304
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,920
I owe you, Go Che Gyeong.

305
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:56,400
I was lazy and put your fate in the hands of that guy.

306
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,520
5,900 books just sounded way too good.

307
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:06,250
Okay. Have a lovely, peaceful afternoon.

308
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,460
Gosh, I got mixed up with such weirdos.

309
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:22,520
But his lines are cheesy and good. I'll have to use them.

310
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,910
 Suggestion Box: Chilsung

311
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,020
He doesn't own a phone, and he has to be reached by letters?

312
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,770
How pretentious.

313
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:37,730
I hate wannabe writers who act fake like this.

314
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,030
 I'll see you both later.

315
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,940
 I have a very important guest, so...

316
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,850
 This way.

317
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,000
 Jeong Ba Reum

318
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:07,200
I am sure it said Jeong Ba Reum.

319
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,440
Was the story you were copying written by Go Che Gyeong?

320
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,530
It's here. Why did you lie and say you didn't have it?

321
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,970
 Where Dreams and Leaves Grow

322
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,920
- I want to see often. 
 - Go Che Gyeong?

323
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,280
No, the ending.

324
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:42,150
I didn't know when she'd ask for it back, so I copied it right away.

325
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,910
That is called plagiarism.

326
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:50,390
This is Jeong Ba Reum and Go Che Gyeong's ending?

327
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,140
- Will you really do this? 
 - Yeah.

328
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,660
Pretty good fate, right?

329
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,860
Go Che Gyeong is a genius.

330
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:07,000

331
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,190

332
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,780
 He meets his destiny that he's been searching for.

333
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,170
 He falls in love with her at first sight.

334
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,110
 He is happy with his fated love, but then one day...

335
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,210

336
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:30,100
 he loses her to an accident.

337
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:34,000
♫  If I had known  ♫

338
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,300
 Scripting Your Destiny

339
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:46,200
♫  The one person who could comfort my tired heart is still you  ♫

340
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:50,600
♫  I would have been a little warmer and affectionate to you  ♫

341
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:58,300
♫  And quickly hugged you tightly first  ♫

342
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,790
♫  But you went the long way around to come back here  ♫

343
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:10,200
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

344
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,400
♫  Again, I'll engrave you  ♫
