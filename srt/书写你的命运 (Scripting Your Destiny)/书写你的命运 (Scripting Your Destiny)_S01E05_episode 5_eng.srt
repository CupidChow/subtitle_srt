00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,060
 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 5 

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,940
He's going to lose her to an accident?

3
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,460
Are you touched?

4
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,960
Such a special love story.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,800
A love for the ages always ends in tragedy.

6
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,800
Won't it be a shock to Jeong Ba Reum to learn his fate?

7
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,400
Of course.  He will be shocked when he finds out.

8
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,500
How did I get mixed up with a crazy dude who messed up my life?

9
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,640
Are you saying Jeong Ba Reum's fate is so-so?

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,390
Look at Romeo and Juliet.

11
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,540
They're icons who represent immortal love.

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,810
You call Shakespeare the greatest writer in the world. Why not me?

13
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,180
- What are you reading?
 - Macbeth. Hamlet.

14
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:10,190
- King Lear. 
- Studying for a college exam?

15
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,380
He wrote a lot of comedies. Why are you only reading tragedies?

16
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,670
Stop acting ignorantly.

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,010
This tragedy is the quickest route to Jeong Ba Reum's success.

18
00:01:17,010 --> 00:01:19,280
Jeong Ba Reum is going to be the best director in Hollywood.

19
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,200
In order for that to happen, he needs to experience the full spectrum of human emotions.

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,730
Of course, emotions are not familiar to us.

21
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:27,770
But the world's greatest literature classics told me that

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,500
a tragic love like this can contain the entire universe.

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,400
Universe?

24
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,920
Look, you idiot. Where did your head go wrong?

25
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,030
You judge your fate only at the end of your life.

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:42,670
Jeong Ba Reum will say on his last day of life:

27
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,500
"My life was a turbulent but a beautiful journey."

28
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,300
You get it, right?

29
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,900
Why are you making her cry, you jerk!

30
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,600
Gosh, don't cry.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,500
Don't cry.  Stop it. It's okay.

32
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,000
Samshin blesses people with children.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
Hoping the children will lead happy lives, she brings them into the world.

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,300
I never thought such a sad fate  would be written into a book.

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,770
Every writer has a specialty genre: romance, comedy, horror.

36
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,450
Gods of destiny are like that, too.  We each have our own colors for writing destinies.

37
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:24,000
That's why there are a million different kinds of human beings.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,300
I wish you and Ho Yoon were merged into one.

39
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,530
Why... why are you crying again?

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,670
This is so delicious.

41
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,920
In the midst of all this, how could I...

42
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,260
I feel so pathetic.

43
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:47,350
 Samshin is so young and immature. 

44
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:50,230
The shortcomings we each have actually complete the universe.

45
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:52,720
Is that why you half-a** the books?

46
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,040
That's right. That's my intention.

47
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,600
Let humans fill in the blanks that the gods left for them.

48
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,900
Look at Go Che Gyeong.

49
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,400
Well, I didn't look closely before I transferred her to Ho Yoon.

50
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,500
But I'm sure she fills every page of her life to the brim, every day.

51
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,900
 Scene 3. A large, opulent party room. 

52
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:19,100
 From the rear we see Geum Gang Suk and Secretary Kim. 

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:24,700
 A large chandelier. Geum Gang Suk holds a whiskey on the rocks. 

54
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,000
 Go Che Gyeong's draft that no one has read. 

55
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,600
Am I the first viewer of "Sky Cash"?

56
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:45,330
Eun Soo Jeong is not dead.

57
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:46,660
Chairman...

58
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:50,970
Secretary Kim, I was born blind.

59
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:55,500
How beautifully a spring day's haze shimmers and

60
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,100
the mystique of the green fireflies on a summer day

61
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,100
were introduced to me by Eun Soo Jeong.

62
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,630
I have a way to find Eun Soo Jeong.

63
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:08,240
Once she is within a kilometer radius of me,

64
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,310
I will smell her scent.

65
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,660
Sorry?

66
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:13,750
- So you have a dog's nose? 
- Correct.

67
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:17,110
Due to my vision loss, my sense of smell is 10,000 times more sensitive than the average human's.

68
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:19,250
Of course, after my surgery at Johns Hopkins

69
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,050
my eyesight is 1.5 left and 2.0 right now.

70
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,070
But I maintain my canine-like sense of smell.

71
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:27,200
So we will have a party at our resort.

72
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:30,700
Invite all the "Soo Jeongs" in the country.

73
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,800
Chairman!

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Why did the landlord pop up again?

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,900
Go Che Gyeong, you are always slighting your own work.

76
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,200
Gosh! I've lost my juju.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,920
 Station Director, here is the script for episode seven. 

78
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,580
 I will write episode eight ASAP. 

79
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,950
If Shakespeare returns from the dead

80
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:10,830
and is programmed in the same time slot as Yang Mi Soon's "Sky Cash,"

81
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,500
I will not hesitate to champion Yang Mi Soon over him.

82
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,600
Now, get excited.

83
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,600
We will show you the finest melodrama there can be.

84
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:23,100
From the first episode to the last, if we don't break 20% viewership on every...

85
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,100
Yang Mi Soon. I will not forgive you.

86
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,800
Jeong Ba Reum?

87
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,800
I definitely will not forgive you.

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
 Episode seven script was so funny. 

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,480
 I read it standing up as soon as I got it. 

90
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,500
 I haven't had this much fun in ages. 

91
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,100
 As everyone has a unique fingerprint, 

92
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:30,600
 writing also bears the imprint of the author's' fingerprint. 

93
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,500
 You can hide behind a different name, 

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,600
 but you cannot hide your writing style. 

95
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,730
 But I saw that you had all those books at your house. 

96
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,950
 Why are these here? 

97
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,500
 Really? We have those at the house? 

98
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,000
 Isn't Go'spresso just a writer's pseudonym? 

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,300
Go'spresso.

100
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,200
Go's Espresso?

101
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Go Che Gyeong.

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,300
Go Che Gyeong is Yang Mi Soon.

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,900
Are you scripting Kim Yeong Rae's destiny?

104
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,200
 Kim Yeong Rae 

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,700
I was right.

106
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,500
Do it right, man.

107
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,500
What's wrong with my Yeong Rae?

108
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
"Your" Yeong Rae?

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I looked into your Yeong Rae. He is a no good.

110
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,600
He bullies his colleagues and subordinates and runs off.

111
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,080
Have him quit to come to his senses or send him out of the country.

112
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,900
Get him out of my way.

113
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,100
Ho Yoon, are you scripting Jeong Ba Reum's destiny, by chance?

114
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,800
So what if I am?

115
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,750
How can you abandon someone on the side of a highway?

116
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,090
- A sunbae, at that.
 - What sunbae?

117
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,880
He pissed him off first. Did I hit him? Kill him?

118
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,100
I just had to give someone acting out a time-out. So what of it?

119
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,570
To begin with, Jeong Ba Reum has no respect for sunbaes.

120
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,400
You are being very reckless right now.

121
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,480
Gods of destiny must not have personal feelings towards a particular human.

122
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,360
Didn't you learn that on your first day?

123
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,900
I think you're being more reckless than me, Ho Yoon.

124
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,000
I didn't go to see you because of Yeong Rae, did I?

125
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,700
Hey, if you are running off to avoid me, you lose!

126
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,500
You lost! You lost, okay?

127
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,250
You already saved up 1.3 million won.

128
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,760
What are you going to do with this money?

129
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,870
- I want to buy a house in Seoul. 
 - I see.

130
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:37,370
But if you're depositing 100,000 won each time to buy a house in Seoul,

131
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,100
it might take about 800 years.

132
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,000
Eight hundred years passes rapidly.

133
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,000
You're cute.

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Here.

135
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,500
This is a gift we only give to our VIPs.

136
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,600
But I'm giving it to you because you're cute.

137
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
It looks like the book.

138
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
Huh?

139
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,500
You were always nice to other people ever since you were little.

140
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,000
You grew up nice, girl.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Thanks for the book.

142
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:22,600
I have the same book now, too.

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,010
 Suggestion Box: Chilsung 

144
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,600
 To the Landlord. 

145
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,290
 To: Landlord. 
 Dear Landlord. 

146
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,050
 Hey, are you reading these? 

147
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,100
 Please reply. 

148
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,650
 You thought I'd be tired by now? I am not giving up. 

149
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,000
After this, she must resort to foul language.

150
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,100
What did you just do?

151
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,110
I saw you, so don't lie to me.

152
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,870
Recycling.  I thought I told you. The earth is hurting.

153
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,770
You should have still read them!

154
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,030
I don't need to read them to know what's inside.

155
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,140
How would you know if you didn't read? Are you a god or something?

156
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:06,350
It's predictable what you'd say. You probably asked for your magazine.

157
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,500
You're a writer, so they probably were well written.

158
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
Why do I need to waste my time?

159
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:18,200
Are you disrespecting me to my face now?  Dumbass.

160
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,100
Wait, did he just call me a writer?

161
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,660
Mom!

162
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,550
I think the landlord knows I'm Yang Mi Soon.

163
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,200
- He just called me a writer. 
 - Oh, no. That's really bad!

164
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,180
What if he hikes the rent because you're a successful writer?

165
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,800
The rent? I didn't think that far.

166
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,600
-  Are you sure you didn't tell him? 
 - I said I didn't.

167
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,200
 Where Dreams and Leaves Grow 

168
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,600
I can't put it off any longer.

169
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,800
I'll return it to her.

170
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,600
 Go Che Gyeong goes to the convenience store at the intersection to buy yogurt. 

171
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,750
The rental contract!

172
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,070
It says "Yang Mi Soon" on it.

173
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,460
Wow, this moron.

174
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:19,270
That's why he tested me at the bookstore.

175
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:22,810
Was he messing with us to hike the rent all this time?

176
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,040
Gosh, I am so mad. My blood sugar is dropping.

177
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,200
I have yogurt. Have some.

178
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,630
Where is it?

179
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:36,020
Mom, you've been so forgetful recently.

180
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,000
It's okay. I'll go get some.

181
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,800
You scared me!

182
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,100
What? Are you following me?

183
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,600
I returned it. So stop putting letters into the suggestions box.

184
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,300
Bye now.

185
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,500
Wait!

186
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,550
Wait a moment.

187
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,990
Did you read my novel that's in here?

188
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,060
No.

189
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,580
No. I just read up to senior, class 2.

190
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,930
You did read it.  I was a senior, class 3.

191
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:12,730
Why would you tell me you stopped precisely at class 2?

192
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,120
I was afraid you'd say I copied it.

193
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,500
You copied it? You plagiarized?

194
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,310
I have no intention of publishing it or financially benefitting from it.

195
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,570
It's just for myself.

196
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:23,220
Daebak, so shameless! I thought you were  an aspiring writer!

197
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,670
I have  a lot of pride in my work.

198
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:28,950
But love stories are not my forte.

199
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,030
I gave you an opportunity to contribute to a masterpiece.

200
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:35,760
Since we're talking, tell me what kind of love you want to be in.

201
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,190
We're not strangers anymore. Because we've met multiple times,  can you at least tell me that much?

202
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:43,000
Why do you keep bringing up "love" whenever you see me?

203
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
Do you think I'm pretty?

204
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,970
Does the sun shine extra brightly around me?

205
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:50,550
Do you hear bells?

206
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,400
Bells?

207
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:55,800
I see. That's what it takes.

208
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,180
It was sunshine. Not rain.

209
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,640
No wonder it didn't work.

210
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,260
You are certified insane.

211
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,400
How am I supposed to talk about rent with him?

212
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:10,000
I have one more question.

213
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,120
While everyone says my romance plots are unique and elegant,

214
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,600
the readers' responses are so...

215
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:20,000
 Hey, you psycho. Where did your head go wrong? 

216
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,720
They are angry at me, cry, and yell at me.

217
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,510
They might beat me up next time. It might hurt.

218
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,350
Are readers naturally wary of a romance?

219
00:13:29,350 --> 00:13:30,710
Not at all.

220
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:33,600
Not at all.  That's not romance. That's horror.

221
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,400
 I know a lot of stories like this.  

222
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:42,130
 For instance, the Bluebeard's Wife or Saw. 

223
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,300
 Recently, a masterpiece called Get Out. 

224
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,670
 What the three stories have in common... 

225
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,000
 is that the landlord is the murderer! 

226
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,600
What? What? Is someone following us?

227
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,700
This is an unfamiliar scene.

228
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,870
Do you know Go Che Gyeong?

229
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:10,500
She made Shin Ho Yoon walk.

230
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,470
Without a purpose.

231
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,580
Without a destination.

232
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,860
For 20 minutes.

233
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,480
I've never taken such a long walk with someone before.

234
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,200
You must be used to flying, not walking?

235
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,400
It's possible, but I try not to.

236
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,600
I really hate you in a new way every day.

237
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,130
I mean, the two of us really should not be talking.

238
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:38,680
What's the big deal in a landlord and tenant talking to each other?

239
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,790
You are so...

240
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:44,350
It's not because I'm landlord.

241
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,900
You are talking to a god of destiny right now.

242
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:52,000
Oh, god of destiny is your pseudonym?

243
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:59,800
Every human being has a god in charge of scripting their destiny.

244
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,600
I am one of those gods.

245
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,630
Oh really? You're one of the gods of destinies?

246
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:09,400
Is that a new Nike outlet or something?

247
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,380
Fine. What the hell is scripting  my destiny that

248
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,800
I lost my father at 15...

249
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,610
That wasn't me.

250
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,450
I started working at age 19 to pay my family's debt.

251
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
That also wasn't me.

252
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
Then what have you written?

253
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,600
I...

254
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,030
 He is happy with his fated love. But then one day... 

255
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:42,840
  he loses her to an accident.  

256
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,800
   

257
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

258
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,850
You have nothing to say, so you're using your good looks?

259
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,700
So why did you come up with this unbelievable, silly god of destiny or whatever?

260
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,000
Whoa, Shin Ho Yoon, you can't say a word.

261
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,200
Nice. You are going to learn a big lesson today.

262
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,600
 Go Che Gyeong walks for a long, long time, until the sun sets. 

263
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,800
 With the god of destiny. 

264
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,300
Should we keep walking?

265
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,030
Out of the blue? So random?

266
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,530
Myeong, you crazy bastard...

267
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,280
Do you dislike walking that much?

268
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,700
Random? Crazy bastard?

269
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,040
♫  Standing several steps apart  ♫

270
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:00,650
♫  You and I are at this place  ♫

271
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:05,640
♫  Two people are looking like this  ♫

272
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,760
♫  Some coincidences like small dots coming together  ♫

273
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:13,360
- You want one? 
 - Do you only have strawberry flavor?

274
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:15,740
Yes, I only have strawberry flavor.

275
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,270
Don't you dare ask me for it again.

276
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:25,680
♫  If I had known  ♫

277
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:32,800
♫  The one person who could comfort my tired heart  ♫

278
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,700
♫  is still you  ♫

279
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,020
Are you the kind of person who needs to be pushed?

280
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,590
Why can't you just take it when I offer it?

281
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:48,740
♫  And quickly hugged you tightly first  ♫

282
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:53,800
♫  But you went the long way around to come back here  ♫

283
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:59,200
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

284
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,800
♫  Again, I'll engrave you  ♫

285
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:09,810
♫  Even if it's too late and we are too far apart it will be us again  ♫

286
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:13,500
♫  if it is destiny  ♫

287
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:17,700
- I heard you went on a very long walk. 
 - Yeah.

288
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,840
But why are you sitting still?

289
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,830
I thought you'd be debating whether to kill Myeong.

290
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,630
Sure.

291
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:26,400
I do.  It's strange.

292
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,100
I should be writing a petition to send Myeong straight to hell.

293
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,400
That is my ultimate goal, my big source of joy.

294
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,100
But...

295
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,500
I want to do something else now.

296
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:55,900
Gosh, I must be crazy. How far did I walk?

297
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:58,400
Right, the magazine.

298
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:03,850
He better not have drooled all over my magazine-

299
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,400
What is this?

300
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,700
Why is this page ripped out?

301
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,200
Did he rip out a page?

302
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,700
Why?

303
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,800
But why...

304
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,900
Out of the blue, why do I want yogurt again?

305
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,940
 Go Che Gyeong goes to buy yogurt again. 

306
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,500
Hey, Seul Ah.

307
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,300
 When are you free? We have our calendars. 

308
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,500
 Go Che Gyeong,  don't you have lovely things to write in your calendar tomorrow? 

309
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,900
Did anything new happen with Jeong Ba Reum?

310
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,990
 Today is the day after tomorrow. 

311
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,790
Why are you keeping track of that? I'm ignoring it.

312
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,300
Why are you ignoring it?

313
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,830
Everything he says is basically from Magenta Pink Rain. Plus, he's hot.

314
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:59,730
 So ... Don't you remember Magenta Pink Rain's ending? 

315
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,900
 The ending? They were totally in love... 

316
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:06,000
 and they go abroad, right? 

317
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,940
There's an accident before they go abroad.

318
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:12,690
If Magenta Pink Rain comes true, I'm screwed, you dummy.

319
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,480
 That's right.  What was the exact line? 

320
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:25,990
 He was happy with his fated love. But then one day... 

321
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:28,510
 But then one day, he loses her to an accident. 

322
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:48,790
♫  If I could return  ♫

323
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:54,300
♫  Once again to that time  ♫

324
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,600
♫  Even if my heart aches and feels sad  ♫

325
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Seul Ah, let me call you back.

326
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,530
I don't want you to die.

327
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,990
Don't fall in love for the ages.

328
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:11,160
♫  Rewind the day  ♫

329
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:15,080
♫  Even if the day is far away  ♫

330
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,710
 The first rule that gods of destiny must obey. 

331
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,700
 Do not pity humans. 

332
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,180
 The moment you develop feelings for a human... 

333
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:27,400
 you are in great danger. 

334
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:32,400
♫  So that we will be closer  ♫

335
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,200
♫  I want you  ♫

336
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,450
♫  I know it's not so, I know  ♫

337
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:43,940
 Scripting Your Destiny 

338
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:47,000
♫  But I can't stop it any more  ♫

339
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,100
♫  I can't let go  ♫

340
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:58,400
♫  Of that mournful time  ♫

341
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,920
♫  My life, everything brushes by and passes  ♫

342
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:10,200
♫  Leaving me behind  ♫

343
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:16,100
♫  I don't know. Why me?  ♫

344
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:20,500
♫  Before it's too late  ♫
