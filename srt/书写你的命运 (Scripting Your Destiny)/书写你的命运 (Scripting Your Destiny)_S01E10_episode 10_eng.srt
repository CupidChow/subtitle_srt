 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 10

2
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,730
 Ten Commandments of an Assistant Writer

3
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,460
Here's the draft of episode nine.

4
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:34,630
Please check for typos before I send it to the broadcast station.

5
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,190
Okay.

6
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:47,370
"Finally, Geum Gang Seok and Eun Soo Jeong meet."

7
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,970
Yes, finally.

8
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:53,730
I've been mulling over how to reunite them

9
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,340
but there was only one answer.

10
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,810
If you're destined to meet, somehow you will ultimately meet.

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,290
 Chairman, I brought the caramel macchiato you requested.

12
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,500
 Set it down there.

13
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,630
 Yes, I will do that.

14
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,620
 Ms. Eun, do you perhaps

15
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:50,160
 - smoke marijuana? 
 - Pardon?

16
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,830
 How can you say that? No, never.

17
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:55,590
 I don't. You shouldn't misunderstand me.

18
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,160
 I don't think it's a misunderstanding, but a fact.

19
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,600
 What do you mean it's a fact? It's not that...

20
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:06,990
 It's because I went to my hometown over the weekend.

21
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,140
 It was a day to harvest hemp.

22
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,570
 They were short-handed.

23
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:14,750
 Burlap cloth is made out of hemp.

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,700
 The smell of hemp is very nice in the summertime.

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,990
 - So that's what it was. 
 - Pardon?

26
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:22,320
 Pardon?

27
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,080
 Sometimes you can only see the truth when you close your eyes.

28
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
 TN:  The only difference between hemp and marijuana is the level of the chemical THC.

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,710
 I've been searching for so long

30
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,830
 and I finally realized it when I closed my eyes

31
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,390
 that your scent was reminiscent of hemp.

32
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,970
 - I finally found you, my Eun Soo Jeong. 
 - My Geum Gang Seok!

33
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,390
 "Gang Seok and Soo Jeong embrace passionately. "

34
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,900
Did you review everything? How is it?

35
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,800
- It's funny.  
 - It's funny?

36
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,300
Yes.

37
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,920
I mean...

38
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,460
I mean, it was a carefully crafted scene.

39
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,380
You could say I intentionally made it slightly kitschy.

40
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:07,180
It's crucial to establish a scene like this as a meme.

41
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,990
- Yes, that's what I meant.
 - I don't think so.

42
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:14,430
Is my stuff funny, but other works are well-made?

43
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,560
You can go home now.

44
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,800
Should I start all over... No, let's just die...

45
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,600
"Should I start over? Let's just die."

46
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,700
You just said so.

47
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:32,600

48
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:44,040
Rare or well done? Which do you prefer?

49
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,100
This is rare.

50
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,500
The beef is too dry.

51
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,450
I'll teach you how to grill meat later.

52
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,210
You'll open up a BBQ place after three weeks as an assistant writer. Okay?

53
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:01,580
I'll eat later.

54
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,270
Number ten of Ten Commandments of an Assistant Writer.

55
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:14,800
"If she doesn't eat meat after you grill it for her,

56
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,660
it means she's exhausted.

57
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,990
Don't say anything and hold her tight."

58
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:31,500
I'm not exhausted. ... So ...

59
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,570
don't be late tomorrow and come in on time.

60
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:42,700
Just try to come in tomorrow. You'll never get to go home.

61
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,200
You should say, "Yes."  The main writer is talking to you.

62
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:57,080
Yes.

63
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:00,700
When I come back to work,

64
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:05,490
make sure I can never go home again.

65
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,900
How weird. I was on my way to see you, too.

66
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,630
Of course. I wrote it that way.

67
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,900
What are you talking about?

68
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,300
 Jeong Ba Reum

69
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,800
That's...

70
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,170
That's the one I saw last time, right? With my name on it.

71
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,620
That's right.

72
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:53,760
So read this first.

73
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,810
Call me when you finish reading it.

74
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,170
I don't even know your number.

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,500
You'll know after you read this.

76
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:15,070
 Jeong Ba Reum's mom holds his hands and starts bawling...

77
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:17,150
 The boy's face kept crossing his mind...

78
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,820
 He focused on college and going to the military...

79
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,500
 The doctor explained to Jeong Ba Reum about rehabilitation...

80
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,240
 Jeong Ba Reum and Go Che Gyeong stood awkwardly at the crosswalk...

81
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,700
 He is happy with his fated love. But then one day, he loses her in an accident.

82
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,300
How could this be?  Is this for real?

83
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,700
 Call me when you finish reading it.  You'll know after you read this.

84
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:19,560
 At 8:10 a.m., Jeong Ba Reum

85
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,050
 meets Go Che Gyeong's assistant writer in the parking lot again.

86
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,450
No way...

87
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,090
I thought you'd get angry and start yelling at me.

88
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:59,120
No. I'll do this instead.

89
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,700
Did you just hit a god of destiny?

90
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,060
I didn't know if I could actually hit you, but it works.

91
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,000
I guess you deserved to be hit even within the context of a cosmic providence.

92
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,300
So? Will you hit some more and fight?

93
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,000
You don't seem to be in any pain.  That pisses me off.

94
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:20,590
 Jeong Ba Reum  
 I read everything.

95
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,650
What's with the last sentence?

96
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:25,200
Do I lose the love of my life due to an accident?

97
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:29,680
At the time, I thought that was the perfect fate. Somewhat foolishly.

98
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,950
And  is Go Che Gyeong the love I'll lose?

99
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,990
- You're right. 
 - And then you've fallen ...

100
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
in love with that Go Che Gyeong, right?

101
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,430
- Right.  
  - So you want to save  Go Che Gyeong, right?

102
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,020
Is that why you showed this to me?

103
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,160
That's right.

104
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,740
Once destiny has been written, not even a god of destiny can erase it.

105
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:01,830
The only person who can erase that fate is the owner of the fate, you.

106
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:05,990
So erase the part about losing Go Che Gyeong from your destiny.

107
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,490
And tell me what you want.

108
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:11,980
Not what I want, but the destiny that Jeong Ba Reum wants for himself.

109
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,130
You have no idea what I'll write.

110
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,670
The sheep farm?  But why are you going there again?

111
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,080
I think I left something there last time I was there.

112
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,820
I think I'll be reminded if I go there again.

113
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,560
I'll be back.

114
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,520
 Ahjussi!

115
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,720

Ahjussi, what's your phone number?

116
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,220
 Write it there.

117
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,360
 It's you from earlier.

118
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,760
 I'm not in the mood to think about that stuff.

119
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,730
 Especially for you, who got rid of my newbie.

120
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:05,300
 Your newbie? What's that?

121
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,900
 Anyway, the neighbors are saying that you're useless.

122
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:13,460
 They're badmouthing you.

123
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:16,960
 Since there's no phone number on your car,

124
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,980
 be sure to write it down there.

125
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:21,320
 Go Eun Seon, let's go home!

126
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,980
 Okay, Mommy!

127
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,160
 Wentout for a second pleese wait

128
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,990
They're so much alike. So nosy.

129
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,860
Did you attend my school?

130
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,710
- I'm being transferred. 
 - Really?

131
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,480
- Which class? 
 - I don't know yet.

132
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,670
Give me your phone.

133
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,680
Text me when you find out which class you're in.

134
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,100
I don't have a phone.

135
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,870
But I have this.

136
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:09,060
Your parents must be very strict.

137
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,510
- But it's brand new. 
 - Yeah.

138
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:13,820
I'm mulling over what to write on the first page.

139
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,590
♫  I see your face before me wherever I go  ♫

140
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,000
♫  You're on my mind, all the time  ♫

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,100
Here you go.

142
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,650
Let me know when you find out which class you're in.

143
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,280
♫  I can't live without you  ♫

144
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:35,200
 Kim Dong Hyeon 010-345-3250  
 I guess your name goes on my first page.

145
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:39,590
Kim Dong Hyeon? Is it that guy?

146
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,840
Ho Yoon, what brings you here?

147
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,150
Dong Hyeon is lucky.

148
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,720
Some day when he holds your hand and walks you to Chilsung Hall,

149
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,960
I will kill him. Good timing.

150
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,640
Why is it good timing now?

151
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,930
- Because it's time for me to say goodbye. 
 - Goodbye?

152
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,950
In the precious books that you made

153
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:59,460
with wishes on laurel trees and the Milky Way Galaxy,

154
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,580
I'm sorry I couldn't script better destinies.

155
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,130
Bye.

156
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,600
♫  Carefully what you've done with your wings now  ♫

157
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,610
♫  Carefully realizing you are  ♫

158
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:24,940
♫  You're chaotic  ♫

159
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,340
♫  You're chaotic  ♫

160
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,890
 God of destiny Shin Ho Yoon told Jeong Ba Reum all about the book...

161
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:33,010
 From now on...

162
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:36,990
 Jeong Ba Reum has no god of destiny.

163
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,550
 Jeong Ba Reum's destiny belongs to Jeong Ba Reum alone.

164
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,000
 Jeong Ba Reum

165
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:51,480
♫  Magical, mystical tragedy  ♫ 
  Jeong Ba Reum

166
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,050
♫  You'll never know  ♫

167
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:03,680
What are you doing there alone?

168
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,960
I was waiting for you to give this to you.

169
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,560
- Hey, you crazy bastard! 
 - I'll be eliminated soon, as you know.

170
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,550
No, not this time. Never.

171
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,650
You used up all three chances. This was your last return.

172
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:38,480
If you get eliminated this time, you'll be gone for good.

173
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,620
I know.

174
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,130
- So I have a favor. 
 - Don't say it.

175
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:46,110
Whatever it is, I won't do it. Don't even—

176
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,030
♫  Even if my heart aches and feels sad  ♫

177
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:53,620
This is a farewell in advance.

178
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,200
Goodbye, my friend.

179
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,500
Geez, you d**ned bastard. 
 ♫  My life, everything brushes by and passes  ♫

180
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:09,020
♫  Leaving me behind  ♫

181
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,740
 I beg you.

182
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:13,170
 Please.  I'm sorry but write it one more time.

183
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:16,100
 Write that Go Che Gyeong walks alone for a long, long time.

184
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:20,890
 Write that she never discovers her beloved god of destiny while walking.

185
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,300
 I want to see her like that in my last moments.

186
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:30,240
The sun will come down soon. The sunset will be beautiful.

187
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,790
♫  That I want you too  ♫

188
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:36,530
♫  I want to say  ♫

189
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:40,650
♫  I want to make you laugh  ♫

190
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:45,620
 Go Che Gyeong walks alone for a long, long time.

191
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,960

192
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:51,150
 #LittleThings ♫  I want to tell you  ♫

193
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:57,390
♫  Please stay with me  ♫

194
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:19,590
 And ... even after the god of destiny was eliminated,

195
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:22,060
 she remembers everything.

196
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,640
 Forever.

197
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:25,760
 At any given moment.

198
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,200
What's going on?

199
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,230
What's this...

200
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,760
I remember everything.

201
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:50,210
 Mom, that man's not getting rained on.

202
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:52,660
 When I was five years old...

203
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,360
 You have to use an umbrella when it rains.

204
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,320
 My name is Shin Ho Yoon.

205
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,790
 I must've been pretty fresh and youthful just now.

206
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:01,100
 Go'spresso.

207
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,650
 Did you know my family runs a cafe?

208
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:05,200
 I just thought you always smelled like coffee.

209
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,760
 It's the first snow!

210
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,250
 Back in high school...

211
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,490
 #Little Things  
  And here, too...

212
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:18,000
 #Little Things

213
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,500
Shin Ho Yoon!

214
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,470
I remember everything about you! Where are you?

215
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:39,680
Did you disappear again?

216
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,780
I miss you...

217
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:02,070
♫  If I had known  ♫

218
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:09,800
♫  The one person who could fill an empty day  ♫

219
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,400
♫  Is still you  ♫

220
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,530
Shin Ho Yoon?

221
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,370
Stay right there! I'm coming!

222
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,990
 If you're meant to meet, you meet no matter what.

223
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,950
♫  But you went the long way around to come back here  ♫

224
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:34,210
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

225
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,910
 Do you have anyone to see the first snow with?

226
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,890
 Why do you need to see the first snow with someone?

227
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,730
 On the day of the first snow, your first love comes true. Don't you know?

228
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,010
♫  Now, meeting you in this place again  ♫

229
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,260
♫  If it is destiny  ♫

230
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,560
 If your first love comes true every time it snows for the first time,

231
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,030
 would the world be left standing?

232
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:05,010
♫  This road I'm going on  ♫

233
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:08,900
♫  The road you are walking  ♫

234
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:17,800
♫  If it is fate that we will eventually meet at the end  ♫

235
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,400
♫  We accumulate a feeling  ♫

236
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,730
♫  Which hesitates and loses out  ♫

237
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,650
♫  Here, fearlessly  ♫

238
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:35,420
♫  I will let go of the painful times  ♫

239
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:40,610
♫  If we are destined  ♫

240
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,550
 Suggestion Box: Chilsung

241
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:10,910
 Suggestion Box: Chilsung

242
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,910
Are you here to interview for an assistant writer position?

243
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,210
- Please wait a moment. 
 - Okay.

244
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,440
My regular customer?

245
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,560
Yes. Long time no see.

246
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:46,830
Unni, are you interviewing too?

247
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:51,030
Did she ask you to do the dishes, when you're applying for a job?

248
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:53,730
Wow, I cannot stand bosses like this.

249
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,310
That's great. Me neither.

250
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,640
I enjoyed the sample writing you sent me.

251
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,710
How did you get to  read my writing, Eonni?

252
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Nice to meet you. I'm Yang Mi Soon.

253
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,810
I look forward to working together. You pass.

254
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,890
My gosh! Daebak!

255
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,940
Thank you!

256
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:17,740
 Five years have passed, and I'm still living as Yang Mi Soon.

257
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,240
 And...

258
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:28,830
 to reach the top floor of this building, I've been pressing the button for five years.

259
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:31,520
 But I have never succeeded.

260
00:20:33,870 --> 00:20:35,970
Yes, Director.

261
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,370
Do you really want these?

262
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:46,030
Of course. I've been wanting it all my life.

263
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:49,130
Getting an autograph from my first love on the Go'spresso collection.

264
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,930
You know who Go'spresso is.

265
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,820
That's right.

266
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,580
You know you were my first love, right?

267
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,750
You made me feel fulfilled and happy.

268
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,440
You're speaking in the past tense for the first time.

269
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,870
Yes. I'm going to New York to receive an award tomorrow.

270
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,930
Thank you for writing a fun script for me.

271
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:08,410
You did a great job of shooting, Director. Congratulations.

272
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,120
Do you feel refreshed now?

273
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,100
- No. I'm sad. 
 - Me, too.

274
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,400
"The day after tomorrow" lasted too long, huh?

275
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,590
I'm sorry for holding onto you too long.

276
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,700
You're a really wonderful person, Director.

277
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,150
I wish you luck.

278
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,010
To you, too, Writer Go.

279
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,520
Hurry up and sign your autograph.

280
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,940
You have to put a grand finale to my first love.

281
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,400
 To Director Jeong Ba Reum, in friendship. 
It's been my honor. From Go'spresso, Go Che Gyeong

282
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:04,140
♫  Carefully what you've done with your wings now  ♫

283
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:08,520
 Go Che Gyeong walks alone for a long, long time.

284
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,130
 And...

285
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,280
 even after the god of destiny was eliminated,

286
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,660
 she remembers everything.

287
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,230
 Forever.

288
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,600
 At any given moment.

289
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,020
With this, I've paid for all of my laziness, Go Che Gyeong.

290
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:30,860
I hope you complete the last page of your destiny with your bravery.

Are you a god of destiny, too?

Wait. That book...

313
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,790
Give it back right this minute!

314
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,500
Did you write in it? For real?

315
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,400
It's my destiny. Of course, I should write it.

How did you think to do that? You're fearless.

Gosh, what happens now?

318
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:55,580
Let's say we never met.

319

This isn't my jurisdiction.

320
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:00,050
Wow, this is huge.

321
00:25:00,830 --> 00:25:04,270
You never saw me. I didn't see anything.

322
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,140
God of destiny...

323
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:11,390
Everyone I meet are all...

324
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,480
You're all just tall.

325
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,040
All right then.

326
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:28,570
No, I can't. I can't look at it.

327
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:30,490
I can't get involved.

328
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:40,890
 Go Che Gyeong will meet her first love, second love,

329
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,160
 and her third love again no matter what.

330
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,520
 Quickly, hurry, soon, immediately, rush, this minute, fast, now, right now!

331
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:54,100

332
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:07,050
It's the first snow.

333
00:26:08,050 --> 00:26:12,050
 Thank you to the entire Scripting Your Destiny Team

334
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:17,060
 Thank you to Channel Manager rribeiro05_178

335
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:22,080
 Thank you to the editors: cgwm808 (Chief), SignsofSerendipity, and Translation Editors monstertop and bluewind

336
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,060

337
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,940
♫  A little story in a fairy tale  ♫

338
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,500
♫  That's how I achieved happiness  ♫

339
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,990
 Go Che Gyeong...

340
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,090
 will meet her first love,

341
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:46,380
 second love,

342
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:51,810
 and her third love again, no matter what.

343
00:26:53,910 --> 00:27:01,420
♫  A destiny which always has the same fixed ending  ♫

344
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:08,170
♫  If something is more important than that  ♫

345
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:15,100
♫  It is to always to be together  ♫

346
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:19,810
 When Go Che Gyeong meets her first love again,

347
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:23,260
 she does not tell him that he is a god of destiny

348
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:26,540
 or that she loves him.

349
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,990
 She does not tell him.

350
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,660
 So...

351
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:39,190
 Go Che Gyeong keeps her unrequited love to herself forever

352
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,070
 and therefore,

353
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:45,420
 she doesn't lose Shin Ho Yoon for a long time.

354
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:51,180
♫  I will be there for you  ♫

355
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,470
 Because if you're destined to meet,

356
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:03,810
 you'll some way or another ultimately meet.

357
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:24,870
Hey, newbies.

358
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,590
Are you also a god of destiny?

359
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,750
Welcome. Show me your arms.

360
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,890
It's my first time seeing guys return after being eliminated.

361
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,480
What does "return after being eliminated" mean?

362
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:52,500
I don't know what that is. I think you're rambling some secret.

363
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,180
It's our first meeting, and I'm so offended.

364
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:56,360
You, too? Me, too.

365
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,600
You guys are in the 21st century. There are no secrets here.

366
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,700
They'll write up comments on Instagram.

367
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,510
They'll say, "Congrats on your return from being eliminated."

368
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:15,150
 Suggestion Box: Chilsung

369
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:21,810
 Why don't you come? Why don't you come to work?

370
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:25,380
 I was waiting for you, and here I am with my suggestion again.

371
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:36,190
 I'm telling you. You'd better come back to work quickly.

372
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,110
 I'm not very patient.

373
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,750
 I might reveal that you're a god of destiny to the world.

374
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,080
Who pulls pranks like this?

375
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:48,770
My predecessor got caught. That idiot.

376
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,430
 You think I can't do that, huh?

377
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:53,460
I'll say you're tall, have a great voice,

378
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,210
and you make my heart beat as if the world is mine only by looking into your eyes.

379
00:29:57,210 --> 00:29:59,660
I'll tell the whole world!

380
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,930
He's very similar to me.

381
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:04,380
People might mistake him for me.

382
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,110
Who is this?

383
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,270
 Go Che Gyeong

384
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:11,380
Go Che Gyeong?

385
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,960
Newbie, this is Shin Ho Yoon.

386
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,790
Where is Go Che Gyeong's book?

387
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:24,240
♫  I wanna make love  ♫

388
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,170
♫  I wanna make love  ♫
