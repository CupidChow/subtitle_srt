00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,990
 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 9 

2
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,070
 Wentout for a second pleese wait 

3
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,930
- Go Eun Seon. 
 - Huh?

4
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,370
Now is not the time for you to be engrossed in leisurely reverie.

5
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:52,570
- Why? What? 
 - Who was that guy earlier?

6
00:00:52,570 --> 00:00:55,280
You said he's an assistant writer. What assistant writer?

7
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,620
See? Look at you.

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,100
It wasn't just one or two things I was suspicious about since you started preparing for the civil service exam.

9
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,940
I figured you'd tell me when it's time. But what now, an assistant writer?

10
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,650
What is this?

11
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,600
I lied to you about something.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,020
But promise me you won't hit me.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,390
Let me hear it first. What is it?

14
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,350
I'm Yang Mi Soon.

15
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:19,730
What are you talking about? Why are you Yang Mi Soon?

16
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:21,000
Your mom's Yang Mi Soon.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,670
Not my mom Yang Mi Soon. The "Accounting for the Married" writer Yang Mi Soon.

18
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,340
The writer behind the daebak RBS soap drama.

19
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,120
Writer Yang Mi Soon. That's me.

20
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,550
No way.

21
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,500
So while you were ghosting me, you were writing a drama?

22
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,970
You're crazy!

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,010
You! Go Che Gyeong, you!

24
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:45,190
Never mind. Just come out with me for now.

25
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,360
Where are we going? It's cold outside. Beat me up here!

26
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,730
How many times do I have to tell you? You have to use an umbrella when it rains.

27
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:07,010
Gangnam Chilsung Hall has requested cooperation.

28
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,680
That memo.

29
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:13,050
You said some boy gave it to you, right?

30
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,620
- Why, out of the blue?
 - What kind of boy was he?

31
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,580
Well, I guess he was the great guy-type.

32
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,730
Get in. We don't have time.

33
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,610
These seems like they belong to Yongsan Chilsung Hall.

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,830
Why are they here in Gangnam?

35
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,470
Seong Woo was eliminated, so Yongsan's in mourning.

36
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,530
They want help, but we're not lazing around either.

37
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,610
There's no room for these in the library.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,490
How come there are so many blank pages in this book?

39
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,290
Oh, that's Seong Woo.

40
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,860
When a god of destiny is eliminated,

41
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,400
a human loses all memories related to him.

42
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:09,460
 What is this? 

43
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:13,800
 Look at the sloppy work by the predecessor. 

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:16,850
 This is why he was eliminated. 

45
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,260
So much was erased.

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,220
There must've been lots of memories.

47
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,550
Who cares? Seong Woo was eliminated because of it.

48
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:25,440
She'll end up getting the 5 million won taken away.

49
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,240
Gosh, how many part-time jobs does she juggle?

50
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,510
Put it down if you aren't going to write the book.

51
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:33,270
Where will she get it taken away?

52
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,310
Where's her part-time job right now?

53
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,000
 Choi Min Ji 

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,660
Cheers.

55
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:46,100
Congratulations! I'm so proud of you!

56
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,100
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you this whole time.

57
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,580
You know how I feel, right?

58
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,280
You have gotten better at acting cute. Could it be because of the assistant writer?

59
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,430
I was wondering why you weren't into a good guy like Jeong Ba Reum.

60
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,570
- Are you two dating? 
 - No way.

61
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,400
Not dating. It's more like the first stage of an unrequited love.

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,750
Unrequited love?

63
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,790
You idiot! By yourself?

64
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,520
- Why? 
 - That's what I'm wondering. Why!

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,190
I didn't know that it was just me, either.

66
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:17,210
But the way he looks at me is a little weird.

67
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:18,740
How does he look at you?

68
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,470
Like a landlord looking at his tenant.

69
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,580
I don't think so.

70
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,020
Is that how a landlord looks at his renter?

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,370
 Why are those two here? 

72
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,610
Welcome!

73
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,550
Hello.

74
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:37,400
Hello.  Do you work here part-time?

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,750
Yes, just on the weekends.

76
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,430
I take it you received payment for the yogurt.

77
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:44,630
Have a seat over here.

78
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,680
Hey friend, we've met before, right?

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,610
He came to the cafe the other day and asked if we went to Danpoong High.

80
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,710
How did you know that?

81
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,610
What was that about paying for the yogurt earlier?

82
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:09,380
Oh, that day.

83
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,730
All he was missing was a dagger but I thought he was a robber.

84
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:15,300
Are you talking about when we met alone together during the wee hours?

85
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,890
Meet alone together during the wee hours? Why?

86
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:20,980
You're giving them the wrong idea by saying it like that. When did we meet alone together?

87
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,460
Bookstore, sheep farm,

88
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,270
around the neighborhood frequently at all sorts of hours of the day?

89
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:28,170
Those were all coincidences!

90
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:30,820
Hey. You have no conscience if you're calling all of them coincidences.

91
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:33,080
Which town's coincidence happen at all hours of the day?

92
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,140
At this point, you've practically skipped flirting and went straight to dat-

93
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,320
Hey, why did you step on my foot?

94
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,900
What are you talking about? That wasn't me.

95
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,990
Here's your order. The low-protein, high-calorie dish isâ€”

96
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,610
Huh? Go Eun Seon. Lee Seul Ah.

97
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,270
Kim Cheol Sum,  it is really you! You work here part-time?

98
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,860
I'm the owner. My dad set the place up for me.

99
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,330
You're the owner...

100
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:03,480
The place is awesome. The lighting's awesome, too.

101
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,270
Kim Cheol Su, you too, a bit.

102
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,900
You're the only one who doesn't know I'm awesome. Since forever ago.

103
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,880
Boyfriend?

104
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,320
Who's the boyfriend? It's not that.

105
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,220
Then why is he glaring at me like that?

106
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,450
He looks similar to the transfer student you had a crush on.

107
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:23,360
You used to like a transfer student, huh?

108
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,720
There was no such person.

109
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,870
It's been forever since we've met yet you're spouting nonsense.

110
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,720
What transfer student? Do you know?

111
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,520
No. Was there a transfer student in our class?

112
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,330
What was his name?

113
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,850
Sir.

114
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,520
I'm sorry, but could we have some water?

115
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,300
Yes. Just a moment.

116
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,430
 When a god of destiny is eliminated, 

117
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:52,800
 a human loses all memories related to him. 

118
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:58,460
Let us know if your boss mistreats you.

119
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,660
 Farewell Soju  
 That's what regulars are for.

120
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,180
Stop with the nonsense and go away.

121
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,390
Boss is really good to me.

122
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,700
Bye, then.

123
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,550
You rude b****.

124
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,480
Did your wrist break, or is your ear plugged?

125
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,740
Why the f*** are you not answering my calls?

126
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,700
Leave. This is my workplace.

127
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,070
Stop embarrassing me and leave right now.

128
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:29,380
If you're embarrassed, spit out the 5 million won, b****!

129
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:30,630
I don't want to see your face either, b****!

130
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,210
Pity, rage, or whatever it is, you can't.

131
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,680
Do you want to be eliminated in front of Go Che Gyeong?

132
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,060
I'll take care of it. Let go of me.

133
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,000
Aigoo.

134
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,610
- Now, who are you? 
 - Her boss.

135
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,690
Step aside, this is a family business.

136
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,560
I can't step aside.

137
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,820
Because I like her.

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,480
Boss.

139
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,410
Anyway, ahjussi, leave quietly unless you want to end up in jail.

140
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,110
Leave and never show up again.

141
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:00,030
Chief!

142
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,730
- Yes, sir. 
 - We'll be closing early today.

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:13,260
Don't let anyone in.

144
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,500
Let's go inside.

145
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,010
How dare she, to her father's face...

146
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,690
Let go!

147
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,760
Wow...

148
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,620
Did you hear that? "Sir."

149
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,410
Right? His father must have him there in case "sir" gets in trouble.

150
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,430
Yeah. A hundred percent.

151
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:34,690
By the way, why are you staring like that?

152
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,750
Huh? I wasn't looking.

153
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:42,650
You were. Like you want to take me home. Let's go.

154
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,400
What? No, this isn'tâ€” Where am I going?

155
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,030
Bye!

156
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:55,120
So why do your friends call you Go Eun Seon?

157
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,600
Oh, that...

158
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,550
Apparently, I was acting strange my sophomore year of college.

159
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,090
I couldn't remember what had just happened,

160
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,840
and people said I looked like I was totally out of it.

161
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,510
My mom was so worried

162
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:12,810
but one day, a customer visited our cafe.

163
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:14,850
 Here's the drink you ordered. 

164
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:18,050
 Your daughter's name is Go Eun Seon, right? 

165
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,300
 Excuse me? 

166
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:23,800
 She looks like her soul has left her body, and she can't remember what happened in the past that well. 

167
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,350
 Oh, my. 

168
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,460
 You're spot on. How do you know that? 

169
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,800
 I'm... No... 

170
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,520
 Samshin was a little drunk when she blessed you with your daughter. 

171
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,940
 She was in a good mood. 

172
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:39,420
 That's why she has a generous amount of talent and pretty decent looks. 

173
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,840
 But she left one thing out: her fate with men. 

174
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,990
 - She's unlucky. 
 - What?  

175
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:47,730
 There is a fate that keeps visiting your daughter. 

176
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,220
 If she doesn't escape it, it may happen again. 

177
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,800
 So change her name so that fate can never visit her again. 

178
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,860
That's how Go Eun Seon became Go Che Gyeong.

179
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:02,480
But actually after that, my mind became clearer,

180
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,500
my work became a hit, and the cafe expanded and flourished.

181
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:10,900
We should've asked for her number, but my mom didn't think of asking.

182
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:15,200
- Do you know something? 
 - What?

183
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,010
I always have to listen till the end of your story.

184
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:26,660
A story that begins sadly always ends with laughter.

185
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,400
And I really like that.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,040
You must like things that make you laugh.

187
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,380
I also like that you always smell like coffee.

188
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:54,840
Gosh, I'm cold. I dressed too lightly.

189
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,150
Want to run all the way home?

190
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,700
â™«  The water's never been so clear for me, my dear  â™«

191
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,140
I don't want to run. Let's go slowly.

192
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:12,680
All right.

193
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,870
But, since you look too cold for us to go slowly,

194
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,670
let's hold hands.

195
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:24,610
My hand's super warm. My nickname used to be "hand warmer."

196
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:33,550
â™«  We can go back to the real world  â™«

197
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:38,970
â™«  In just a little more time  â™«

198
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:45,950
â™«  Forget the things of our old world  â™«

199
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:53,400
â™«  It's just all passing by  â™«

200
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,080
Are you unwell?

201
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,660
Don't you think you're squeezing too hard just because my nickname was "hand warmer"?

202
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,230
Oh, I'm sorry.

203
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:07,330
This is the first time I've walked this long while holding someone's hand.

204
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:09,970
Come on now.

205
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,400
â™«  Beauty in sorrow  â™«

206
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:19,090
By the way...

207
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,150
to be honest, there is something I'm curious about.

208
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,570
Don't let go of my hand no matter what I ask you.

209
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,080
What is it?

210
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,860
- Have you ever lied to me? 
 - No.

211
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,600
- Not even once? 
 - Not even once.

212
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,200
 Excuse me! 

213
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,830
 Weren't you just talking to me over there... 

214
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,720
 then you suddenly zoomed all the way over here?  

215
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,140
 It's definitely not because of the yogurt. 

216
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,620
 You are talking to a god of destiny right now. 

217
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,220
 Oh, god of destiny is your pseudonym? 

218
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:05,070
 Every human being has a god in charge of scripting their destiny. 

219
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:07,290
 I am one of those gods. 

220
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:10,750
 If someone is waiting, I'll know. Like just now.  

221
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:14,800
So you really are a god of destiny.

222
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,280
â™«  But you went the long way around to come back here  â™«

223
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,280
Making you lose your father in vain when you were 15 years old,

224
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,780
or making you work part-time jobs starting when you were 19 years old

225
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:28,760
to pay off your family debt, that really wasn't me.

226
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:34,210
â™«  Even if it's too late and we are too far apart it will be us again  â™«

227
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:36,860
Then can you make me win the lottery?

228
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,600
â™«  if it is destiny  â™« 
 No.

229
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,700
- Then can you make my ratings skyrocket? 
 - No.

230
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,760
You're heartless.

231
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,340
Then until the day I die,

232
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:52,960
can you not let go of this hand?

233
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,370
â™«  Which is forked, I look at you  â™«

234
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,040
â™«  Walking side by side with me  â™«

235
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,550
â™«  Under the same moon the same wind blows  â™«

236
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,390
No.

237
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:12,540
â™«  I only feel far away  â™«

238
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,080
â™«  If I had known  â™«

239
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,260
Jerk.

240
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,020
â™«  The one person who could fill an empty day  â™«

241
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,000
If you were going to be like this, you should've told me sooner.

242
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,900
You should've told me everything before I liked you this much.

243
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,950
If I didn't believe that you're a god of destiny,

244
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,170
you should've told me a hundred times until I believed you!

245
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,230
We shouldn't have walked toward a beautiful sunset!

246
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:40,980
We shouldn't have seen the first snow of the year together!

247
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,600
You shouldn't have said "yes" when you were asked

248
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,200
if you'd be my assistant writer...

249
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,700
â™«  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  â™«

250
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:58,800
â™«  Again, I'll engrave you  â™«

251
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:04,480
â™«  Even if it's too late and we are too far apart it will be us again  â™«

252
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,040
â™«  if it is destiny  â™«

253
00:15:19,110 --> 00:15:21,360
What are you doing?

254
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,570
You know, Go Che Gyeong.

255
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:26,280
She got mixed up with a god of destiny before, hasn't she?

256
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:31,800
That god of destiny... was me, wasn't it?

257
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,380
So it's true.

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,200
What if it's true? What then? Do you want to be eliminated again?

259
00:15:48,730 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm the one who ended up losing her on the day I fell in love.

260
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,500
The novel Go Che Gyeong wrote

261
00:15:58,310 --> 00:16:00,650
was my destiny.

262
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:05,640
This is how I get punished for

263
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,370
writing foolishly in the book.

264
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:13,980
You really had to go this far.

265
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,110
How come your owner's not coming to work after leaving like that?

266
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,940
It can't be because I hit him too hard, could it?

267
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,680
If only I knew his contact information, then I couldâ€”

268
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,000
Oh, I have his contact. The suggestion box.

269
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,180
 Suggestion Box: Chilsung  
 I guess he does check after all.

270
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,730
You better not throw it into recycling again.

271
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:03,000
 This is Jeong Ba Reum.  I'm headed to your office with the bound scripts. 

272
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,630
We started auditioning actors.

273
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,140
I emailed you the list, so take a look and let me know what you think.

274
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,460
And the first script read-through...

275
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,920
Oh, that.

276
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,030
My friend took that photo when I was in high school.

277
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:29,500
Don't look too closely. It's embarrassing.

278
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,510
But how could he be in this photo with you?

279
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,740
Who?

280
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:39,240
This male student.  That's your assistant writer.

281
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,760
No way.

282
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,310
No way.  I would know if we went to the same school.

283
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,650
Do they look similar from behind?

284
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:47,240
To be exact, it's their profiles.

285
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,720
I'm a director.

286
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:53,080
I know a face once I've seen it, no matter how it's made up.

287
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:09,720
Just a moment.

288
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,840
Yeah, Mom.

289
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:16,550
 I didn't expect the landlord to be this kind of a person, but the realtor called. 

290
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,790
 He wants the cafe out. What do we do? 

291
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,920
Really? That doesn't make any sense. Where are you right now, Mom?

292
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,000
The lease term  ended and the landlord doesn't want to renew.

293
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,540
So, to be honest, nothing else can be done.

294
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,760
And he didn't show up to work?

295
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:37,370
He's determined to kick us out.

296
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,030
- Mom, I'll be right back. 
 - Where are you headed?

297
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:49,370
This is Go Che Gyeong.

298
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:51,410
Let's meet.

299
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:00,390
You came. It's quite far from Sangam to Gangnam.

300
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,830
I guess you weren't too keen to meet me.

301
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:04,430
One becomes clear-headed during a long trip.

302
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:08,190
So I was hoping you'd make a rational decision.

303
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:09,720
Where is Shin Ho Yoon right now?

304
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,940
For example, a question like that.

305
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:14,420
I was hoping you wouldn't ask such a question.

306
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,850
- Tell me if you have something to say. 
 - Why?

307
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:20,800
Because you're my real god of destiny who gave up on me out of laziness?

308
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,860
You really believe that?

309
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,270
Yes.

310
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:27,540
And I should've believed it sooner.

311
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,820
Don't believe it.

312
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,380
Some things are preserved only if you don't believe it.

313
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,410
Something happened to Shin Ho Yoon, right?

314
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,440
Is he in danger because of me?

315
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,570
I'm not at liberty to say anything.

316
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,300
Just leave.

317
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,860
Why did you ask if I went to Danpoong High?

318
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,280
If you knew I went to Dangpoong High, you must have known that I used to be Go Eun Seon too.

319
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,480
Apparently, I used to be super weird before my name change.

320
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:55,090
But now I think I finally get why I used to be so weird.

321
00:19:56,070 --> 00:20:00,490
Shin Ho Yoon and I... This is not our first time, is it?

322
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:12,900
How are humans this foolish and brave every single time?

323
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:16,150
Just what is so great about love that...

324
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,000
I asked you where Shin Ho Yoon is!

325
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,650
Shin Ho Yoon!

326
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,270
What are you doing? Do you really want to be eliminated?

327
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:46,340
 Go Eun Seon! 

328
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:55,380
 Mom, that man's not getting rained on. 

329
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,200
 Make sure to carry an umbrella when it rains. 

330
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,690
 Humans are shocked when they see that you don't get wet. 

331
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,190
 You must carry an umbrella when it's raining. 

332
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,100
 - Go'spresso. 
 - Did you know my family runs a cafe? 

333
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,480
 No, but you always smell like coffee. 

334
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,730
 Welcome. 

335
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:15,610
 So far, the only thing I know how to make is caramel macchiato. 

336
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:18,940
 If you're dragging your feet because you want to tell me something, just get it over with. 

337
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,750
 I only have one umbrella, so I think we will have to share it. 

338
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:22,790
 You like me, don't you? 

339
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:26,320
 In the end, I'm the one who confessed first, and this how you respond? 

340
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,930
â™«  Rewind the day  â™«

341
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,470
- Three times. 
 - What?

342
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:34,420
You taught me three times to carry an umbrella when it rains,

343
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:37,060
but I didn't listen to you this time either.

344
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:39,280
Crazy bastard...

345
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,090
You remember everything?

346
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,490
Go Che Gyeong was so pretty.

347
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:51,380
Both in high school and in college.

348
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,030
â™«  I want you  â™«

349
00:21:54,030 --> 00:21:57,070
â™«  I want to tell you  â™«

350
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:02,940
â™«  Please stay with me  â™«

351
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,060
Did the landlord not show up for work?

352
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,220
No news?

353
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,930
No.

354
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,860
No, it can't be that he's actually kicking us out.

355
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,880
The realtor might be pulling something. Who knows?

356
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:25,520
Gosh, we're out of cup holders already.

357
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:27,370
I'm going to the storage room.

358
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,500
Welcome.

359
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:52,200
I went to work, but the office was empty.

360
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,320
Let's go upstairs and get to work.

361
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,300
Would you like coffee?

362
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,370
Yes. Caramel macchiato, the most expensive item.

363
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,950
 Scripting Your Destiny

â™«  I wanna make love  â™«

365

366
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,550
