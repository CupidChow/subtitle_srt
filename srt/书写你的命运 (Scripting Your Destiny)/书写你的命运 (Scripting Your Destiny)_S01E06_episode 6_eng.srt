1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:10,020

2
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,940
 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 6

3
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,430
 He was happy with his fated love. But then one day...

4
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,930
 he loses her to an accident.

5
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,270
Seul Ah, let me call you back.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:50,450
Don't die.

7
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,170
Don't fall in love for the ages.

8
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,800
A turbulent but beautiful journey.

9
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,550
Don't do that just because

10
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:08,620
of a stupid god of destiny.

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,650
Am I going to die?

12
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,590
All of a sudden?

13
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,880
Is it funny?

14
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,300
You had me for about two seconds.

15
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,270
Do you get unnecessarily creative when you live off rent?

16
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,500
So, I take it that you're sticking with the god of destiny concept?

17
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:35,010
It's not a concept...

18
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,960
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

19
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,030
 Gods of destiny must not have personal feelings towards a particular human.

20
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,110
Did it look like I had personal feelings just now?

21
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,490
What do you mean?

22
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:54,590
Just now, did I come across as affectionate?

23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,310
I thought I was being quite indifferent and matter of fact.

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,870
Gosh, did you skip your medicine this morning?

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,580
That's it. I ate something wrong.

26
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,750
This happens when you eat too much yogurt with Bifidus in it.  (Bifidus is a bacterium used to manufacture yogurt.)

27
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,050
Right? I better check. Don't follow me.

28
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,000
Excuse me!

29
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,240
I can't believe it.

30
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,560
Do you see that?

31
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,330
The moon is shining so beautifully with magenta pink color...

32
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,420
Who am I talking to right now?

33
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,620
Excuse me!

34
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,080
What the heck?

35
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,120
Did I get distracted by the moon?

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,590
How's he there already?

37
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,890
Did I walk too much earlier?

38
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:55,170
Gosh, my blood sugar's dropping...

39
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,700
Excuse me.

40
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,970
I know this doesn't make sense, but

41
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:09,750
you were spouting a bunch of nonsense, so it's my turn now.

42
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,190
My memory went blank for a moment,

43
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,280
and I'm wondering if I have extreme stress.

44
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,410
Weren't you just talking to me over there,

45
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,350
then you suddenly zoomed all the way over here?

46
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:24,340
It's definitely not because of the yogurt.

47
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:35,400
Check out, please.

48
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,800
- That'll be 14,300 won.
 - Sorry?

49
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,340
I think you scanned it wrong.

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:45,840
Thirteen yogurts. Including the ones for the man who just left.

51
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,670
He wants me to pay? For the ones he had?

52
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:51,370
He said to let you know it's in lieu of rent.

53
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,780
Here you go.

54
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:59,200
 D***. He pulled a power-trip on me.

55
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,520
We've been at this for days.

56
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,500
You think he won't find you just because you stay out?

57
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,970
When he's the mighty Ho Yoon?

58
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,670
Hey. You keep talking as if this only concerns me.

59
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,260
You're an accomplice.

60
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,590
Have you ever heard of aiding and abetting?

61
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,330
Hey!

62
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,700
Ho Yoon! I led him in this direction.

63
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,530
- Hey, you! 
 - You, come here.

64
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:22,030
I'll send you to hell today, no matter what...

65
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:24,820
Ho Yoon! Are you okay?

66
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,890
It feels like a ball of fire is bouncing around inside me.

67
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,830
It's all because of this son of a bitch.

68
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,230
I've been a mess since you made me walk with Go Che Gyeong.

69
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,360
Hey. Walking should make your legs hurt, not your chest.

70
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,870
He's acting.

71
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,840
He makes it sound like I made him and Go Che Gyeong sleep with each other.

72
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,980
You immoral, careless son of a bitch.

73
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,970
Samshin, you too.

74
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,780
You just stood and watched?

75
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,550
Give me that, at least. My insides are burning up.

76
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,680
What are you ajussis doing?

77
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,500
Are you okay?

78
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:06,570
It's dangerous. Stand to the side.

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,190
You better explain before leaving.

80
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,300
You see?

81
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:14,490
She's an expert at aiding and abetting. She's a natural.

82
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll make it short and sweet.

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,100
My dad's a cop. He's high up. I'm the baby of the family.

84
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,580
Mess with her one more time,

85
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,490
and you'll face the governmental authority of Republic of Korea.

86
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:28,190
He's threatening us right now, right?

87
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,410
He's not the problem. She is.

88
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

89
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:36,510
They're scary ahjussis. Beware.

90
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,010
Don't worry.

91
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,740
I've got it figured out.

92
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,760
Run!

93
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,380
♫  Just like you stepped out of a dream, baby  ♫

94
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:03,240
♫  Summer sun through my winter's cold  ♫

95
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:11,300
♫  Ever since that day I'm so happy  ♫

96
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:16,500
♫  I'm walking on a cloud of air  ♫

97
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,040
Who is that bastard?

98
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,650
If he loves running so much, should I make him run for three days straight?

99
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:28,680
Why does it look like they're running in slo-mo?

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,800
I think I better make it rain a little.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,300
Gosh, play nice.

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,410
I was going to, but I'm in pain.

103
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:39,760
So what? What's going on with your heart, exactly?

104
00:06:41,930 --> 00:06:44,100
When Go Che Gyeong approaches me,

105
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,950
my heart heats up.

106
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:49,300
 It throbs when I'm looking at her face.

107
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,430
 I can't bear it when our eyes meet.

108
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,160
Huh? I've written many lines like those in the books.

109
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,240
You wrote stuff like this for humans?

110
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,450
Stuff that hurts so badly?

111
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:03,300
But humans loved that stuff.

112
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,260
Cruel bastard.

113
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:06,880
Anyway...

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,240
Anyway what? What are you going to say now?

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,080
About Jeong Ba Reum.

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,820
That day,

117
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,320
he spilled coffee and erased

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,240
his own fate written in the book.

119
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,960
Even the God of Destiny cannot erase what's been written.

120
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,230
But he himself somehow could erase it?

121
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,590
 What in the world are you thinking about?

122
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,770
 What's the deal?

123
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,600
 What's that say?

124
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:36,910
 Something that makes you want to pour coffee all over someone's face.

125
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,080
 I know a face like that, though.

126
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,930
 Right away like this?

127
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,220
 Just a second. At my count of three...

128
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:54,180
 Whoa, nice timing.

129
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,480
 Why are you standing here? You dare to stand in your Sunbae's way?

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,770
 You better not even step on my shadow. Watch out!

131
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,800
 Shin Seung Woo, you're dead.

132
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,000
 I'll let this go.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,230
 I did enough to deserve this from you.

134
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,060
 But let's make one thing clear.

135
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,650
 - That was all for your sake... 
 - There's still some left.

136
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,260
Shin Seung Woo, come out!

137
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,920
You have no way out. Show yourself!

138
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:37,330
Didn't Shin Seung Woo come here?

139
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,360
 Hyeon Joon: God of Destiny, 
Gangnam Chilsung Hall

140
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,530
Seung Woo has been eliminated.

141
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,660
 No, you can't take it!

142
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,510
Out of one of the books Seung Woo has been writing,

143
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:58,510
there was a child who grew up in an orphanage.

144
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:01,570
 - You...  
-  You have to leave the orphanage when you become eighteen.

145
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:04,290
The government gives the orphan 5 million won at that time.

146
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,210
Dad!

147
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,250
Parents show up to steal that money.

148
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:33,100
Seung Woo felt rage toward humans.

149
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,710
What? What's happened to you?

150
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:45,650
Did something happen?

151
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,200
Shin Seung Woo of Yongsan Chilsung Hall has been eliminated.

152
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,700
So why have feelings toward humans?

153
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,730
You stop slaving over Jeong Ba Reum, too.

154
00:09:58,730 --> 00:10:01,250
Get through the next stage and get it over with.

155
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,430
You've failed to isolate them.

156
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,000
In that case, the next stage is living together.

157
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,400
I need some rest.

158
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,040
I have a dilemma right now.

159
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,500
He's acting strange.

160
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,880
Okay, I'll get it over with for him.

161
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,200
 Go Che Gyeong

162
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,930
 Please Participate in Recycling Day.

163
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:43,850
Here.

164
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,510
I went to see Writer Yang.

165
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:48,100
The business is doing amazing.

166
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:53,300
Mom says she can only write well when the business is doing well.

167
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,920
Why do you laugh?

168
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,090
That sounds logical, somehow.

169
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:02,700
Episode eight was so fun. Business must be doing really well.

170
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:08,730
Now that I saw you, I'll be leaving.

171
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,570
Day after tomorrow's already past.

172
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,090
Why don't we say that it's our Day One in three days?

173
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,800
You're okay with getting dumped in three days?

174
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
Look at you, thinking about dumping me first.

175
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,370
You should play the field a little,

176
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:22,910
and I even welcome two-timing.

177
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,470
Whoa, you're a learned man.

178
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:27,390
Your landlord's not in your field, is he?

179
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,750
Nonsense.

180
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,430
He came all the way to the broadcast station yesterday.

181
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,900
To see you? He's insane!

182
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,440
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,920
Why would you be sorry, Che Gyeong?

184
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,630
If you're sorry about it, that's upsetting for me.

185
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,810
I'll pretend you stopped after "He's insane."

186
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,100
It's cold. Go inside. Bye.

187
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,740
He went to the broadcast station?

188
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:05,100
Hey Landlord, we need to have a chat.

189
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,360
- I'm not the only one who felt it, right? 
 - Someone's coming up.

190
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:25,470
No one in the world can come up here.

191
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:27,620
Was the button pressed?

192
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:35,870
 Go Che Gyeong gets on the elevator to meet her landlord.

193
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,990
- It's Go Che Gyeong. 
 - What should we do?

194
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:40,370
What else. We stop the elevator.

195
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,930
What?

196
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,330
What? What's going on?

197
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,910
Excuse me. Is someone there? The elevator's stuck.

198
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,310
 - Save me!  
- Oh, no...

199
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:07,880
 - I think the elevator is stuck!  
 - You cruel bastard.

200
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,630
What else can we do?  This is Chilsung Hall, a place that handles all human fate.

201
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,950
This is where the books are. Shall we show her everything?

202
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,070
Send the security guard already.

203
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,920
 - Hello?  
 - I'm looking.

204
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,660
Let's see. Our security guard...

205
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,700
 Kim Jong Hwan said a lonely goodbye and left.

206
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,830
He quit the job.  What?

207
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,170
I mean, there's nothing to guard. We have no thieves or anything.

208
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,680
If we place an ad right now and start looking for someone...

209
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,730
 Hello?

210
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,460
We'll get someone in no time.

211
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,010
 Can't you hear me?

212
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,570
Geez, I'm scared.

213
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,200
I didn't even bring my phone. What do I do?

214
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:54,000
Help me! The elevator's stuck!

215
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,830
I better not think of my mom right now.

216
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:01,050
Mom...

217
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:05,790
She's crying. What do we do?

218
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,070
You crazy bastard! Why did you stop the elevator?

219
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,230
No... I meant Ho Yoon's crying.

220
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:13,590
What?

221
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,650
What's wrong with you?

222
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,160
Are you okay?

223
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,640
My heart's burning up again. It's beyond burning. I'm in pain.

224
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,090
Stop bluffing.

225
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:34,150
The god of destiny's heart is always cold, objective, and rational.

226
00:14:34,150 --> 00:14:36,660
Kept at around two degrees celcius at all times.

227
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,700
A guard! I'll be back.

228
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,200
Yes, ma'am. I'm the building owner's friend.

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,630
Your daughter's passed out here.

230
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:12,700
"Go Che Gyeong selects the man she most recently met,

231
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,930
a very handsome and wonderful man, as an assistant writer,"

232
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,410
"and lives with him."

233
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,390
This Jeong Ba Reum must be quite wonderful.

234
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,890
Yeah, he's good-looking.

235
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:29,560
- Better looking than Ho Yoon? 
 - Yeah.

236
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,660
Huh? Wait a second.

237
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:35,380
Between the two, whom did she meet most recently?

238
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,050
Where is she right now?

239
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,130
Mom!

240
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm alive, right?

241
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,720
Gosh, earlier the elevator got stuck...

242
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,870
The elevator's fine. You're the one who's sick.

243
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:03,700
Your landlord's friend carried you home after you passed out in the elevator.

244
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,810
I don't think so...

245
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,110
Gosh, how weak are you that you passed out in the elevator?

246
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,890
This won't do. You better hire an assistant writer.

247
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:15,630
Make him take care of research and driving.

248
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:18,040
Make him carry heavy stuff. It would be nice if he was tall.

249
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:23,160
Still, an assistant writer should know how to write...

250
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:31,250
It'd be a plus if he can write. Sleep more. Mommy will take care of everything.

251
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,670
Sleep more...

252
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,860
What? Eun Seon got stuck in the elevator?

253
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:45,280
Yeah. She's in shock.

254
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,530
But I can't just leave the cafe.

255
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:51,750
She's lying alone getting an IV, and the part-timer suddenly had to leave. I'm going crazy.

256
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,330
- Go up and see. I'll tend to the cafe. 
 - Will you?

257
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:57,790
Then, let me go up and see how she's doing. I'll come right back.

258
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:01,020
Gosh, thank you, Seul Ah.

259
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:09,080
Would you like to order?

260
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:20,340
Are you friends with her daughter, by chance?

261
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,380
Yes.

262
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:28,280
Did I hear you say just now, Go Eun Seon, not Go Che Gyeong?

263
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,900
Yes. Why are you asking that?

264
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:38,520
So she... changed her name.

265
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,630
I was hoping it wasn't her.

266
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,930
By chance...

267
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:50,180
did you graduate from Danpoong High School?

268
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:53,400
Oh, yes. I did.

269
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,340
How did you know?

270
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,810
Is your daughter okay?

271
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,580
Did your daughter go to the hospital?

272
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,580
Your daughter broke a button in our elevator, and we need to fix it.

273
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:07,310
No... This isn't it.

274
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,800
Oh, hello.

275
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,700
What brings you here?

276
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:19,550
Well, I thought she might be sick.

277
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:20,940
Oh, my.

278
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,070
Oh, my, my, my, my!

279
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:25,160
You're here because you're worried about my Che Gyeong!

280
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,570
No, it's...

281
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,820
The elevator...

282
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,930
I need your daughter's testimony.

283
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,380
 Go Che Gyeong gets...

284
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,770
 Go Che Gyeong gets a "no" to every question she asks.

285
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,160
Mom, feed me meat...

286
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,050
I'm hungry. I have no strength to walk.

287
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,970
Meat, meat, meat, meat...

288
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,110
Wait, wait, wait. Why go back in?

289
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,470
Say hello. To your assistant writer.

290
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,180
Assistant writer? Me?

291
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,840
Really?

292
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,230
 Is your daughter all right?

293
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:56,440
 Gosh, my daughter would usually be strong enough to chew through metal.

294
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:59,410
 But she got so scared that she is still sleeping.

295
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,800
 Gosh, I really hope we don't have to discuss repair costs...

296
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,890
 We won't be discussing that.

297
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,170
 Right? Gosh, I got so worried.

298
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:13,800
 Looking at you close up, you're very tall.

299
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,490
 I saw you writing something now and then.

300
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,530
 You're an aspiring writer, right?

301
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,500
 You know how to use a copier, a scanner, and a printer, right?

302
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:31,060
 This is the first time you're not calling me "Lord."

303
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:36,360
 Will I be getting a new title?

304
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:38,980
Will you really be my assistant writer?

305
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,010
Please stop with the questions.

306
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:44,530
I can't stop. Do you know what an assistant writer does?

307
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:47,100
Were you really an aspiring writer?

308
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,370
You'll have to room and board here. That's okay, right?

309
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:53,560
It's okay since I'll cook you delicious meals.

310
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,720
You'll really do it?

311
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,100
Yes.

312
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,680
 Go Che Gyeong: Will you really be my assistant writer?

313
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,740
 Shin Ho Yoon: Please stop with the questions. 
 Go Che Gyeong:  You'll really do it?

314
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,470
At last, you...

315
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,730
This is your last chance to give up and get out.

316
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,940
 When Go Che Gyeong approaches me, my heart heats up.

317
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,080
 It throbs when I'm looking at her face.

318
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,220
 I can't bear it when our eyes meet.

319
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,620
Are you sure you won't regret this?

320
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,450
Yes.

321
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:02,300
 You are being very impulsive right now.

322
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:05,620
 Gods of destiny must not have personal feelings towards a particular human.

323
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,640
 If this is violated, the god of destiny shall be eliminated.

324
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,020
 Didn't you learn that on your first day in the world?

325
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:18,550
♫  If I had known  ♫
  Scripting Your Destiny

326
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:25,410
♫  The one person who could comfort my tired heart  ♫

327
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,800
♫♫  is still you  ♫

328
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,240
♫  I would have been a little warmer and affectionate to you  ♫

329
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,630
♫  And quickly hugged you tightly first  ♫

330
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:46,330
♫  But you went the long way
 around to come back here   ♫

331
00:22:46,330 --> 00:22:49,120
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

332
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,300
♫  Again, I'll engrave you  ♫
