1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,130

2
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,900

3
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,400
 Every human is born with a book of their life.

4
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,720
 Every moment of one's life is recorded there.

5
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:47,580
 We call this destiny.

6
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,350

7
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:13,870
 Kim Jin Sun will win third place  in the 932nd lottery.

8
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,110
 Whatever is written in the book comes true.

9
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,110
 You may not know...

10
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,180
 but your destiny is being written even at this very moment.

11
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,780

12
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,150
 By the hand of god.

13
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,730

14
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,700
 Kang Young Min will prepare a surprise event

15
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:57,700
 for his girlfriend this weekend afternoon on a subway line 1 train.

16
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,540
 If your romance always starts fresh

17
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,030
 but ends in a chaotic mess every time,

18
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:11,350
 unfortunately, that might be because the god of your destiny has never dated anyone.

19
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,700
 One more thing.

20
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,500
 Grandma Samshin is the one who creates the books.

21
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,700
 Right.

22
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,500
 The Samshin who blesses you with children.

23
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,500
 Well, we can talk about that later on. In any case ...

24
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:35,810
 this is how we write human beings' destinies every day.

25
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,280
 The two gods you were introduced to earlier

26
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,580
 and this one in front of me, too.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,870
Damn it, I can't stand this.

28
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,310
- Who are you so obsessed with? 
 - Jeong Ba Reum.

29
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,340
The most unique one among the destinies I write.

30
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,200
I'm going to make a masterpiece out of it.

31
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,070
My goodness! My lord! You're here!

32
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,760
Hello.

33
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,900
Did she say "lord?" To you? Right now?

34
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,730
You don't know that the landlord is more powerful than the creator God?

35
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,050
He is our landlord.

36
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,670
Oh, do you go to church by chance?

37
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,050
Then sorry. I'll find another nickname.

38
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:20,330
Are you sure she is joking?

39
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:23,370
Rent is a lot cheaper in this building than in the one next door.

40
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,480
On top of that, business is good here, too.

41
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,970
She says the landlord usually kicks them out if that is the case

42
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,160
because they want to run the business themselves.

43
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,710
And it's not that she knows who you are?

44
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,200
She tried to set me up with her daughter before.

45
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,740
If she knows who I am, she wouldn't joke like that.

46
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:41,770
Let's go. Yongsan Chilsung Hall requested backup.

47
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:41,090
 That's right.

48
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,770
 You might have figured it out by now.

49
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,200
 I am a god of destiny who writes your destiny.

50
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,770
A god of destiny here at Yongsan Chilsung Hall has been eliminated.

51
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,330
We have neglected books here because of that.

52
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,700
Please split up and take care of these books for a bit.

53
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,980
Again?

54
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,360
Why can't you guys just take care of them?

55
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,970
Eliminated? How?

56
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,300
I don't know the details.

57
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:34,060
Oh, a few of these books will actually be transferred to Mapo, so keep that in mind.

58
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,410
I'll get going now.

59
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:42,800
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!

60
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,610
 I'm telling you in case you might misunderstand.

61
00:06:44,610 --> 00:06:46,480
 Just because we are gods of destiny,

62
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,840
 it doesn't mean we spin gigantic wheels of fate every day.

63
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:51,030
- Let's split in half. 
 - Me?

64
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,800
I won though. Why would I?

65
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,350
Half of a half! Half of a half of a half!

66
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,090
You're going to be sorry for acting like this some day!

67
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,650

68
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,400
I'm checking out.

69
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,380
That will be 19,900 won. Do you have a reward card with us?

70
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:51,040
No.

71
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,480
I'm so sorry.

72
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,580
I started watching "Accounting for the Married" late so I'm binging.

73
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,770
You get it, right?

74
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,200
Is that drama really that good?

75
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,600
You haven't seen it? You must.

76
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,390
But once you start, you won't be able to stop so be careful.

77
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:39,600
 When I first said I wanted to write dramas, this is what my mom said.

78
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,370
You are way too young. What will you be able to write about?

79
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,590
Dear daughter...

80
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:46,940
These days, the news is funnier than comedies and more dramatic than dramas.

81
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,780
Who watches TV anymore? It's a waste of time and electricity.

82
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:55,100
Hello, Director (of broadcasting station)!

83
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,090
I'm really enjoying your dramas! Go RBS!

84
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:03,000
It's not the first or second time. It has been like this, so no need to flatter.

85
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,540
- Four Americanos.
 - You got it.

86
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,430
There are so many coffee shops in Sangam. Why do we have to come all the way here?

87
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:09,800
In the middle of nowhere.

88
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,100
- Aren't you having coffee? Just three Americanos.  
 - Give me a green tea.

89
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,470
 My mother sold coffee to employees at the broadcast station all her life so she could pay for my college tuition.

90
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,880
 Never mind business ethics, she never watched TV.  (TN: Despite earning a living from the TV station cast, she didn't watch.)

91
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,020
 But these days, she is obsessed with this drama.

92
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,500
 It's me.  I'm Hwa Ok's husband.

93
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,600
 No.

94
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,050
 This man is a piece of trash who cruelly abandoned Hwa Ok.

95
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:35,790
 He had plastic surgery to look like me for the inheritance. He is a devil.

96
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:39,990
 No, you got plastic surgery to look like me.

97
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,400
 Father-in-law. Mother-in-law.

98
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,580
 Look at me.

99
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,480
 You must have heard from Hwa Ok.

100
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,310
 I am the World Muscle Competition Champion.

101
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,820
 He may have gotten plastic surgery on his whole body

102
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,400
 but he could not have faked my abs, which are number one in the world.

103
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:07,240
 You... you are Son-in-law Joo.

104
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,010
 Come here, my son-in-law.

105
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:18,310
 My son-in-law, let me hold you.

106
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,200
 You bastard! You swindler!

107
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:30,380
 You deceived my daughter and tried to hurt my son-in-law.

108
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,680
 Get out right now!

109
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,080

110
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:42,360
 The drama that entranced my mom is "Accounting for the Married."

111
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,830
 It's a rare daily drama that broke 30% viewer ratings during this time when the ratings are dying.

112
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:53,000
 A woman died, leaving behind death insurance worth 10 billion won.

113
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,570
 The beneficiary is her husband, Joo Gil Nam.

114
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,550
 How could this have happened?

115
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,780
 I'm here, Father-in-law, Mother-in-law.

116
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,700
 But men who have had full body plastic surgery keep showing up, insisting they are Joo Gil Nam.

117
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,450
 Hi, I'm Yeong Hoon.

118
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:07,430
 I'm Hwa Ok's real husband.

119
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:10,470
 Who is her real husband?

120
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,000
 That's right. Korea's first mystery soap drama to find the real husband.

121
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
 "Accounting for the Married."

122
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,300
 This is my - Go Che Gyeong's - debut piece.

123
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,210
Oh goodness, goodness, goodness!

124
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:25,650
- It's that good?
 - So, so good.

125
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:28,800
 I don't know if it's actually that good, if it's because her daughter wrote it,

126
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,530
 or if it's because I got well paid for the script.

127
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:36,100
 For six months, I couldn't sleep nor eat. All I got were insults.

128
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,340
 So I feel like I'm 64 years old instead of 24 years old.

129
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,730
He's here, he's here, he's here.

130
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,950
 - But when I saw my mother's smiling face... 
- Oh, my, my, my!

131
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:47,600
 That day, I just wanted to be happy without thinking about anyth—

132
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,150
Oh right, it's recycling day.

133
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,550
- Let's go together. 
 -  Or so I thought.

134
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,750
 Come on!

135
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:56,550
It's a one-person job. Why do you always say let's do it together?

136
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:01,210
You need to move. Are you a mermaid or something?

137
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:03,360
You haven't used your legs in six months.

138
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,350
Do you even have any muscle left?

139
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,320
You look like you aged, too.

140
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,660
I have so much baby fat! Don't you see how peachy my cheeks are?

141
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:15,220
Even drinking soju fills me up with protein.

142
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,590
- Hello, ma'am. 
 - Hello!

143
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,510
How's the business? Good?

144
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:21,800
Yes, very good. But it could always be better.

145
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,950
I'm still raising a baby over here.

146
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:25,900
You are always so funny.

147
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,930
But who is this?

148
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,440
Oh! Must be your youngest sister.

149
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:33,060
- You are beautiful, just like your sister.
 - Oh, stop.

150
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,150
- See you later. 
 - Bye.

151
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:40,640
Can we trust him with our security?

152
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:53,500
My gosh! Are you alright?

153
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:57,070
That crazy bastard. Who drives like that on a narrow road?

154
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:59,760
Mom, did you see the license plate? We need report a****** like him.

155
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,990
A******? Crazy bastard?

156
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,870
I saw the license plate.

157
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:07,810
Number 4444, that's the landlord's car.

158
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:10,560
He's driving recklessly since it's his own building?

159
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,190
Tell him to drive as comfortably as he wants from now on.

160
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:15,360
I can move out of his way.

161
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,110
By the way, he's so young. Maybe it's because I just got a glimpse?

162
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:21,820
You want to be set up? He doesn't have a girlfriend.

163
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,510
Oh my god, no way! This is crazy! What do I do?

164
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,910
Right? It's great, right? You want to?

165
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:27,480
Do what? Seul Ah is coming. What do I do?

166
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,180
I haven't talked to her about the drama at all. On top of that, she kept asking me to meet up,

167
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,870
so I lied saying I'm attending a civil service exam academy.

168
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,300
- Why? 
 - What do you mean why?

169
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,930
The main writer ran off and I replaced her.

170
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:40,870
Word can't get out, and everything has to be buried as a secret.

171
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,590
I even signed a contract with the broadcasting network for that.

172
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,980
You said so, too!

173
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,210
That this is real life so I need to do it right.

174
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,350
You told me not to tell anyone.

175
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:50,210
But you should have told Seul Ah without telling me.

176
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:54,800
And you never went to a tutoring academy even in high school. Why would you attend a civil service exam academy?

177
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,700
How can you be so bad with the details as a writer?

178
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:01,770
Whose side are you on?

179
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,200

180
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:19,620
Re-reading it still makes me tear up. It's a great narrative.

181
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,300
 Jeong Ba Reum fell deep into the novels of Go'spresso on his sickbed.

182
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,390
 It was his first love.

183
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:31,410
Samshin, you need to find me a book.

184
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,700
The book for Go'spresso mentioned on this page and the destiny writer, too.

185
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,320
- Why are you looking for it? 
 - Go'spresso is Jeong Ba Reum's first love.

186
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,970
I want to make it come true.

187
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:43,280
I think it's time for the two of them to meet.

188
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,900
What if Go'spresso is a man?

189
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,290
I'm not prejudiced.

190
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:52,560
Is it a guy?

191
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:03,150
The name is Go Che Gyeong.

192
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,820
She's 24 years old. She's pretty.

193
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,390
Go Che Gyeong?

194
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:10,230
The first-floor cafe owner's daughter? Who writes her book?

195
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,140
Her book was at Yongsan Chilsung Hall, but it happens to be transferred here.

196
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,670
It's under the care of Myeong.

197
00:15:15,670 --> 00:15:17,120
Where is Myeong right now?

198
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,100
Why do you need this book? I haven't even looked at it.

199
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,220
None of your business. I don't have time, so just give it to me quickly.

200
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,220
But I want to know.

201
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:31,070
I told you I'm making a masterpiece out of Jeong Ba Reum, right?

202
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,190
That Go Che Gyeong is Jeong Ba Reum's first love.

203
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,220
You have less work so you're happy. I get what I need so I'm happy.

204
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,070
Transfer it to me. I'll continue to write for her.

205
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:43,680
I told you. That a moment will come when you will feel sorry for your decision.

206
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,460
Fine.

207
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,470
Take this and 10,000 more.

208
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,760
5,000.

209
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:56,600
- 9,900. 
 - 5,900.

210
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,470
Deal!

211
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,150

212
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:07,550
Should I turn off the intercom and pretend I'm not here? How do I do that?

213
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,480
I'll just destroy it.

214
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,170
Is this the right thing to do?

215
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:16,180
What should I do? What should I do?

216
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,020
The batteries!

217
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,410
 Chilsung

218
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:30,320
Your mom is on my side anyway.

219
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,530
So not answering your phone and avoiding me won't work, Go Che Gyeong.

220
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,880
I'm not a weirdo.

221
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:01,230
This is my friend's house. She must not be home.

222
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,570
Unit 1315. Someone's in there.

223
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,890
- How do you know?
 - The utility meter just ran.

224
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,890
She normally never opens the door whenever there is a utility meter reading.

225
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,370
I see.

226
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,640
You must work for the utility company.

227
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,190
But her doorbell must be broken.

228
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:22,010
Let me try.

229
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,310
I turned off everything, so why is it turning on?

230
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:31,210
 Che Gyeong!

231
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,000
 Long time no see.

232
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,220
 I know you're scared that I might be upset.

233
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,630
 But you know what's really scary?

234
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,210
 - I know your new door password. 
 - What?

235
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,670
 Your mom gave it to me last time.

236
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,480
Oh no.

237
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:46,900
I took out all of the batteries. Why is it opening?

238
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,590
Oh no?

239
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,150
You haven't seen your sister in six months yet the first thing you say is "oh no"?

240
00:17:51,150 --> 00:17:53,930
Oh, no. It's so good to see you

241
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:56,900
and I've missed you, so I was surprised. That's why.

242
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,710
I missed you!

243
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:03,040
You think acting cute is going to get you out of this? Follow me.

244
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,440
There is no time since you didn't pick up your phone.

245
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,770
You have 15 minutes from now.

246
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:19,050
Wash your hair, take a shower, and get dolled up. Let's go out.

247
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,490
Do we need to go out?

248
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,890
Can't we just stay home, have a beer and you know,

249
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,350
catch up, talking about stuff?

250
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:26,190
Why did you lie and say you signed up for an exam academy?

251
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,790
 Che Gyeong never signed up for our academy.

252
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:30,370
 Are you sure she's preparing for the exam?

253
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,500
I discreetly looked into other academies as well.

254
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,220
I don't think she is attending any exam schools.

255
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:37,110
About that...

256
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:39,110
You don't go to an academy. You don't pick up your phone.

257
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,760
So did you get any studying done?

258
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,840
I know you didn't, so shut it.

259
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,400
For today, just shut up and come out with me. Then I'll forgive you.

260
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,670
What a scary way to ask me out on a date.

261
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:49,730
Why would I go on a date with you?

262
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:52,870
- You're meeting a guy. 
 - A guy?

263
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,290
Cheers!

264
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,920
Wow, that's good.

265
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Che Gyeong, it's been way too long.

266
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,660
- Come to our club meetups more often.
 - Me?

267
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,480
Did my doppelganger go around signing up for clubs by any chance?

268
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,760
Yeah, that's right.

269
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,960
You signed up for a dance club, manga club, and whatnot.

270
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,360
Oh, right. I remember.

271
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,610
Sunbae, you told me to just fill out the application form.

272
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,150
So you could get drinks from the dance club president, like some kind of multi-level marketing scheme.

273
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,100
Sunbae, it has been a while so it's good to see you.

274
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:26,620
- Introduce us to your friends!
 - Sure. Sure.

275
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,350
This is my friend from high school.

276
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,230
Kim Si Hyeok who was just appointed as the Minister of the Office for Government Policy Coordination.

277
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:34,520
This is Jeong Ba Reum whom I met during my study abroad.

278
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,990
He works for RBS in the drama department.

279
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,870
Hello.

280
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,690
Hello.

281
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,720
Che Gyeong, is there anything you want to ask him?

282
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,580
You used to want to get into RBS.

283
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,800
- I did? 
 - Yeah.

284
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,050
You said you were going to get an RBS employee ID no matter what.

285
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,370
Did I?

286
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,320
Oh, because I used to really like RBS dramas.

287
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,330
But your company is a little bit of a gamble.

288
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:04,700
There are some masterpieces, but some are just so soapy.

289
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,380
Don't make trash like that.

290
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,850
What's trash?

291
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,290
I'm curious, too. Does RBS have a super soapy drama?

292
00:20:13,290 --> 00:20:15,100
Recently there is "Accounting for the Married" or something.

293
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:18,780
Killing the wife for money, then killing someone else. That drama.

294
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:21,500
How can you have trash like that on national television?

295
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,110
The viewers are messed up,

296
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,900
but the people who make it need to do some self-reflection, too.

297
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,860
If my future wife says she will watch something like that,

298
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:28,870
I'll divorce her right away.

299
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,900
How would you get a divorce?

300
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:34,660
You need to be married to get a divorce.

301
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:39,080
That's right. Che Gyeong, you're so smart.

302
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,480
You're not even married yet, but you're already talking about divorce.

303
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,270
- Must keep you busy. 
 - I don't think so.

304
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,860
You'll never tie the knot anyway.

305
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,650
- Hey, are you drunk? 
 - No, I'm not drunk.

306
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:50,110
I am very sober. You know why?

307
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:52,220
Because that drama is not about that.

308
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,540
It's not about killing the wife and killing others for money at all.

309
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:59,720
Someone who can't even comprehend a drama plot is running our country with the taxes I pay.

310
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,020
Wow, I thought I cured my insomnia, but it seems like it will come back.

311
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,600
Hey, Go Che Gyeong!

312
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,890
What is wrong with you?

313
00:21:17,890 --> 00:21:22,020
I had something to tell you. That's why I told you we should just eat at home.

314
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,680
But today really won't work.

315
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,550
I'll tell you later. Next time.

316
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,320
Bye.

317
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,420
 It was good at the beginning because Writer Hwang wrote it before she left.

318
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:49,400
 It feels so formulaic.

319
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,200
 It's so obvious that she cares about the viewer response too much.

320
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:55,520
 Can't they just change the writer right now?

321
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,020

322
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,180
A perfect destiny that will be the talk of the town for a long time

323
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:13,550
is about to start.

324
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,270
On a perfect night like this...

325
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,070
we need magenta pink rain.

326
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:45,480
 It's magenta pink rain!

327
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,400
Excuse me, sir. I'm getting off.

328
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:34,860
 Every human is a work of God.

329
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:45,250
♫  If I could return  ♫

330
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:50,600
♫  Once again to that time  ♫

331
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,700
♫  Even if my heart aches and feels sad  ♫

332
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:02,660
♫  It would be a good memory  ♫

333
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,990
♫  Rewind the day  ♫

334
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:11,490
 Human beings who are born into lives written for them by gods

335
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:14,560
 grasp concepts of happiness and sadness

336
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,710
 and commit acts of good and evil as they live.

337
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:20,880
♫  I want to tell you  ♫

338
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,250
 Whoever feels happy will go through an equal amount of hardship.

339
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:27,630
 Whoever suffers will gain an equal amount of wisdom.

340
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,010
 But regarding love...

341
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,960
 Love is the only thing that is unfair.

342
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,980
♫  Please stay with me  ♫

343
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:02,010

344
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,530
♫  Standing several steps apart  ♫

345
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:15,990
♫  You and I are at this place  ♫

346
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:18,540
♫  Two people are looking like this  ♫

347
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,260
 Love.

348
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,000
 Love is...

349
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:27,170
 a gift from god for the courageous.

350
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,940
♫  We desired each other  ♫

351
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:36,120

352
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:41,240
♫  If I had known  ♫

353
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:46,440
♫  The one person who could comfort my tired heart  ♫

354
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,710
♫  is still you  ♫

355
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:55,270
♫  I would have been a little warmer and affectionate to you   ♫

356
00:25:55,270 --> 00:26:04,100
♫  And quickly hugged you tightly first  ♫

357
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,300
♫  But you went the long way around to come back here  ♫

358
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:12,610
♫  To my small crumpled heart   ♫
