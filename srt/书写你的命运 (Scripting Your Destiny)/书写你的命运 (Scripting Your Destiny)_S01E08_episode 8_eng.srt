00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,100
 Scripting Your Destiny: Episode 8 

2
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:31,700
 On a day with a mysterious beginning and an end, 

3
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,000
 I opened my eyes 

4
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,960
 and realized all by myself 

5
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,220
 that I script the lives and deaths 

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,260
 and all emotional experiences of humans. 

7
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,920
 That I am a god of destiny. 

8
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:12,280
Mom, that man's not getting rained on.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,310
Gosh, it's cold. Hurry.

10
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,130
Gosh...

11
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,040
Are you okay?

12
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,410
Newbie?

13
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,060
Make sure to carry an umbrella when it rains.

14
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:30,360
Humans will be shocked when they see that you don't get wet.

15
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:33,770
Are you a god of destiny like me?

16
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:36,170
I am Shin (means God) Myeong, in my 127th year.

17
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:38,290
Listen carefully and commit this to memory.

18
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,350
The first commandment for the gods of destiny:

19
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,700
Do not pity humans, as you did just now.

20
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,400
The minute you develop feelings for a human, you will be in great danger.

21
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,350
Don't laugh.

22
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,800
My weak spot is for those with a pretty smile.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,960
Can you call yourself a god when you can fall into danger so easily?

24
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,100
You crazy bastard!

25
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,510
You mean, don't smile like this?

26
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,040
Gosh, I told him it was dangerous.

27
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,640
I've never seen anyone get eliminated on his first day.

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 

29
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,760
 When I opened my eyes, 

30
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,700
 I had retained no memory. 

31
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,780
 Everything felt unfamiliar like it was the beginning of times. 

32
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,580
 Only... 

33
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,620
 the taboo toward humans was vivid. 

34
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:20,470
 A god of destiny must not pity humans. 

35
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,410
 A god of destiny must not hate humans. 

36
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:29,500
 A god of destiny must also not rejoice due to humans. 

37
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,200
 And... 

38
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,620
 I remembered I must use an umbrella in the rain. 

39
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,110
♫  Carefully what you've done with your wings now  ♫

40
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:45,910
Hey, newbie. I'm Myeong.

41
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:49,100
Are you a god of destiny like me?

42
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,400
Yeah. I've desperately been waiting for a newbie.

43
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
I'm flabbergasted that it's you of all gods, but I'll try my best

44
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,240
to help you become a fine god of destiny this time around.

45
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,250
Give me your arm.

46
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,460
I've never seen anyone come back after being eliminated.

47
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,640
Does he remember you?

48
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,560
No, he can't.

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,820
Be careful. You can't tell a god his past after his memory's been wiped.

50
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,400
Did you write this book?

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,570
I know. Every page pulls at your heartstrings, right?

52
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,200
Study and learn.

53
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,300
 
Especially the part where they flirt with each other.

54
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,760
They get stuck on an island, and there's only one room.

55
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,040
Filthy.  ("Deoreowo") 

56
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:42,340
♫  Stay in my soul  ♫

57
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,950
Maybe he remembers everything?

58
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:48,400
Didn't he say "warm"?  ("Deowo") 

59
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:27,690
♫  If I had known  ♫

60
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:34,990
♫  The one person who could comfort my tired heart  ♫

61
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,160
♫  is still you  ♫

62
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,550
♫  I would have been a little warmer and affectionate to you  ♫

63
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,980
Thank you.

64
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:47,050
You have to use an umbrella when it rains.

65
00:06:47,050 --> 00:06:50,400
Of course, I just didn't have an umbrella.

66
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,570
So are you lending it to me?

67
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:57,810
Would lending it to you be pitying you?

68
00:06:57,810 --> 00:07:01,270
Pity?

69
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:04,290
What a grandiose word for this situation.

70
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,940
Because pitying is dangerous.

71
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,770
Gosh, it's raining cats and dogs, and you're...

72
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,070
Where do you go to school? You go to my school, don't you?

73
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,130
You better stay out of my way at school.

74
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:34,840
I want to go to school.

75
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,120
What? School?

76
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,420
 

77
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:42,190
My name is Shin Ho Yoon.

78
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,570
Please put a space between my first and last names.

79
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,810
Over.

80
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,800
What's up with him?

81
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,930
 TN: In writing a proper name in Korean, the last (family) name and first ( given) name are not separated by  a space. 

82
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:53,490
 TN.  However, the "Shin" in his name is not a family name.  It means "god.") 

83
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,390
So you do go to my school.

84
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,400
Whoa, romance at first sight!

85
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,060
Is he Go Eun Seon's type?

86
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,400
Look at you blabbering on after being late.

87
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,170
Sit down already.

88
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,570
Ho Yoon, you too. Take the empty seat.

89
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,300
If you must go to school, pick.

90
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:34,900
Version one. Poor but fresh and youthful memories of winter time.

91
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,860
Version two. You're rich, but your youth is tumultuous.

92
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,380
Which story is more popular?

93
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,500
Number one is overwhelmingly more common in youth movies.

94
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,270
What are you doing here, not eating?

95
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,780
I must've looked very fresh and youthful just now.

96
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:04,400
I knew that I shouldn't have talked to you.

97
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,650
Tap water? At the faucet area?

98
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:10,950
Yeah. It's probably frozen, but he was drinking from it.

99
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,480
Gosh, so fresh and youthful.

100
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,890
Hey, it must've been like a youth movie.

101
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,250
Did you eat something wrong?

102
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,860
Maybe this is past its expiration date?

103
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,820
No, it's not...

104
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,000
You like eating stuff like this? Sweet stuff?

105
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,380
What's this?

106
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,410
Why is this here? Didn't you buy it?

107
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,990
You...

108
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,970
Could you have...

109
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:50,000
Did you make a friend?

110
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,260
Do you know how scary and dangerous friendship is?

111
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,900
You've gone insane!

112
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,380
Is it very dangerous?

113
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,580
Friendship?

114
00:09:57,580 --> 00:10:00,550
You didn't go to a tteokbokki place together or something, right?

115
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,860
You'll get in real trouble!

116
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,460
 Number three, for question 29. 

117
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:10,560
Yeah! I got it right!

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,320
Number four for question 30.

119
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:24,400
Can I see your test?

120
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,580
A perfect score.

121
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,470
Were you first in your class in your previous school as well?

122
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,390
- Why do you ask? 
 - Hey.

123
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:47,080
You got a perfect score, so I'm in second place. Of course, I'll ask.

124
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,410
Whatever. Let's hash out the rest over tteokbokki.

125
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,330
Tteokbokki?

126
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,420
Has that time finally come?

127
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,440
What are you saying?

128
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,790
I'm more ambitious than I let on. I must find out your secret to your grades.

129
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:04,090
What are you doing? Let's get going.

130
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:06,330
Oh, ambition...

131
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,560
What a relief.

132
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,830
I thought we were forming a friendship or something scary and dangerous like that.

133
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,680
Be honest.

134
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,840
You didn't solve these problems, did you?

135
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,460
Why aren't you eating?

136
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,480
You're the one who put yogurt in my backpack, huh?

137
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,240
I threw it away there.

138
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,430
Do you know that you're super weird?

139
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:39,040
I noticed you're always writing. What are you writing?

140
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,090
Novels? No way, is it poetry?

141
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:46,120
Some fates are as long as a novel,

142
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:50,000
and some fates are as short as a poem.

143
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,620
You're a master cringe artist, my friend.

144
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,270
Where do you upload your writing?

145
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:59,840
I put mine up on Anomia. What's your ID?

146
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,260
I don't have anything like that.

147
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:03,250
- What's yours? 
 - That's for next time.

148
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:06,860
My ID sucks. I'm racking my brain about what to change it to.

149
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,740
An oppa I know is in a band in Hongdae

150
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,230
and when he named his band,

151
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,980
he named it after his last name plus the food he ate that day.

152
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:20,850
Does that mean I'm Shinmul? 
  (God Water) 

153
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,260
And you'd be Godaepa? 
  (Go Leek) 

154
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,930
Huh?

155
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,130
Having fun, are you?

156
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:33,350
If it were that easy, would I be racking my brain?

157
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,610
Go'spresso.

158
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,570
Huh?

159
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:41,280
Go plus espresso. What do you think?

160
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,030
You knew my family runs a cafe?

161
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:44,570
Do you run a cafe?

162
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,990
No, but you always smell like coffee.

163
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:01,220
I'll buy this time. You buy next time.

164
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,840
Shall we go?

165
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,470
Ma'am, we'd like the check, please.

166
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,320
Why am I buying?

167
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,950
That was an excuse to ask you out again, you dummy.

168
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:12,540
I don't want to.

169
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,390
You don't want to?

170
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,030
I am dumbfounded.

171
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,010
Why? Why don't you want to?

172
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,770
Why not? How could you not want to?

173
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:22,460
I think you're a little scary.

174
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:26,260
♫  Close your eyes and be with me  ♫

175
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,940
Let's go.

176
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:32,800
♫  We can go back to...  ♫

177
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,200
- What in the world? 
 - What?

178
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,490
Look over there...

179
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,170
♫  Forget the things that are over  ♫

180
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:49,330
It's the first snow of the year!

181
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:57,020
♫  It's just all passing by  ♫

182
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:04,260
♫  Cuz I don't need anything at all  ♫

183
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:10,550
♫  Baby, the only things I want  ♫

184
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,500
♫  Are love in the darkness  ♫

185
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:23,000
♫  Beauty in sorrow, and me and you on this boat  ♫

186
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:40,960
Are you two dating?

187
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:43,870
How dare you spout such nonsense so early in the day?

188
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:47,290
We're not dating.  No way. Why would we date?

189
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:49,950
Hey, no need to be so adamant.

190
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:51,630
What now, Go Eun Seon?

191
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:53,320
Go Eun Seon.

192
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,600
You got dumped before we even had lunch.

193
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,520
Hey, Shin Ho Yoon. Say it again.

194
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,990
"Why would we date?"

195
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,210
Really? After I paid for the tteokbokki?

196
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,610
If you pay for tteokbokki, it means we're dating?

197
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,180
You didn't just eat tteokbokki.

198
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,430
You added extra cheese, and now you're backing out?

199
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:13,410
I added extra cheese because you asked.

200
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:15,700
But if that's the situation, then let's date.

201
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,170
Whoa. A couple is born.

202
00:15:18,170 --> 00:15:20,910
Go Eun Seon, you're a big spender!

203
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,780
Hey, take it back.

204
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,920
Take it back?

205
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,830
- He says to take it back. 
 - No way!

206
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,730
I paid for extra cheese and also a soda. How dare you?

207
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,980
Hey, Kim Cheol Su. Who do you think you are to butt in?

208
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,920
Because I like you, Go Eun Seon.

209
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,610
Go Eun Seon is the only one who doesn't know that I like her.

210
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:49,000
Hey, Kim Cheol Su. Follow me out. Let's talk outside.

211
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,600
You said you didn't know.  You can continue to not know.

212
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:54,310
You were about to take it back, you punk.

213
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,980
Are you not going to let go?

214
00:15:58,890 --> 00:16:00,550
I'll deal with you later.

215
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:02,970
I'll deal with you now. Follow me out.

216
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,580
What are you doing?

217
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,330
Where is Kim Cheol Su's book?

218
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:15,590
Who's Kim Cheol Su?

219
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,450
The tallest and ugliest kid in my class.

220
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:21,330
Everyone calls him the school bully.

221
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:23,500
What will you do with his book?

222
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,960
I'm going to kill him.

223
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,070
No!

224
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,610
You did this again?

225
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:55,830
Jealousy this time?

226
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:06,220
 Just like that, I was eliminated once again. 

227
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,960
 I was eliminated several times after that. 

228
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:13,290
 There's no one who knows how many times I came back. 

229
00:17:13,290 --> 00:17:15,340
 No one. 

230
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,170
 Not even me. 

231
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,500
 It's raining. Rice wine and scallion pancakes, cool? 

232
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,610
Begone, Satan!

233
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:27,380
I didn't get the scholarship this time, so I have to leech off my mom.

234
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,690
I'll grow my mom's cafe so big

235
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:33,540
that Starbucks files for bankruptcy.

236
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,150
See you.

237
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,970
Welcome.

238
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:03,810
♫  A little story in a fairy tale  ♫

239
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:07,610
May I order?

240
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,370
So far, the only thing I know how to make is the caramel macchiato.

241
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,900
- I'll take one. 
 - I'll bring it to your table.

242
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:24,470
♫  Why do I always want to know?  ♫

243
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,990
Why is that the only thing you know how to make?

244
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:29,280
Caramel macchiato is the most expensive item.

245
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,590
That's why that's the only thing I know how to make.

246
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:38,750
♫  If something is more important than that  ♫

247
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,520
♫  It is to always to be together  ♫

248
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,600
♫  Every precious day as if you were dreaming  ♫

249
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,490
♫  The last word between you and me  ♫

250
00:18:55,490 --> 00:18:58,640
♫  Which will remain for a long time  ♫

251
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,720
♫  Was a common ending  ♫

252
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,980
♫  If it was even that  ♫

253
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,700
♫  So beautiful no one could know  ♫

254
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,800
♫  So that tonight won't end for a long time  ♫

255
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:20,100
♫  I will be there for you  ♫

256
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:25,170
We're closing up for the day.

257
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,720
There are still 15 minutes left.

258
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,880
You'll stay till the very last minute?

259
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,830
Yes. Is there a problem?

260
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,190
Not that it's a problem. You come to our cafe every day like clockwork.

261
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,160
If you're dragging your feet because you want to tell me something,

262
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,200
just get it over with.

263
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:47,040
I have nothing to say to you.

264
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,810
Then how come you're here instead of going home?

265
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:54,850
It's raining.

266
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:00,970
People stare when I don't carry an umbrella.

267
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,200
I only have one umbrella, so I think we will have to share it.

268
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,380
No, I don't think we should.

269
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,950
What? Why?

270
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:31,530
When you share an umbrella, one shoulder gets wet.

271
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,100
- I'll just borrow it. 
 - What?

272
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,060
What a crazy bastard!

273
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,850
Hey! Bring back my umbrella!

274
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,100
 She was right. 

275
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,060
 I shouldn't have gone crazy like that. 

276
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,510
 I never returned her umbrella. 

277
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:51,310
 Clutching onto my excuse to see her again, 

278
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:55,050
 I walked and walked. 

279
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:58,790
 Blind to the fact that this was our unavoidable destiny... 

280
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,390
Yeah, Mom.

281
00:21:03,390 --> 00:21:07,660
I'll come up as soon as I'm done with the research. Don't worry.

282
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,670
No.

283
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,800
The sheep are cute but smelly. And there are tons of couples.

284
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,950
It's a perfect village for male and female characters

285
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:18,120
to come on a date, get stuck, and spend a night together.

286
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:34,070
Another caramel macchiato, please.

287
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:36,450
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,830
My daughter suddenly screamed and hung up the phone.

289
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,790
Let me make a phone call.

290
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,700
Did she go somewhere far?

291
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:48,690
She went to a sheep farm in Daegwallyeong by herself.

292
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:51,540
I'm getting a terrible feeling. What do I do...

293
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,780
 #Little Things 

294
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:17,370
It's okay, Go Eun Seon. People don't die that easily.

295
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:23,570
People will come when the sun comes up.

296
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:27,730
Yes, you're going to be an outstanding writer.

297
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:32,790
So, a night in a haunted place like this is just...

298
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:44,400
Help! Is anyone there? Help!

299
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:02,130
I've gone crazy.  Now I'm seeing things.

300
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,010
I did skip dinner today.

301
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,510
What do you want to eat?

302
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,890
Even the voice is the same...

303
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,430
You don't sound like you skipped dinner.

304
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,400
No way. Are you real?

305
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:31,700
Are you really that customer? Why are you here?

306
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,740
Your mom's worried.

307
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,210
I figured you were hurt, so I'm here to rescue you.

308
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:38,750
Nonsense.

309
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:42,320
You didn't know where I am, and you're here to rescue me?

310
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,190
Can you walk?

311
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,880
You like me, don't you?

312
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,960
Let's go to the hospital first. I better carry you on my back.

313
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:58,660
You came every day to confess your feelings.

314
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,610
Because as a pretty part-timer, I've experienced this many times,

315
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:04,130
so I recognize it when I see it.

316
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:07,100
You must not be hurting that much. That's not it.

317
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:10,610
And you had lots of experiences like that?

318
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,370
That makes me a little mad.

319
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:17,450
- Look at you all jealous. 
 - I'm not jealous.

320
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,110
Get on my back.

321
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,870
 #Little things 

322
00:24:26,150 --> 00:24:28,130
I said, get on my back.

323
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,880
What did you just do?

324
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,720
In the end, I'm the one who confessed first, and this is your response?

325
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,010
Isn't this enough...

326
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,900
♫  But you went the long way around to come back here  ♫

327
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,860
♫  The slightly crumpled heart again unfolds  ♫

328
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:39,050
 Scripting Your Destiny 

329
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,970
♫  Even if it's too late and we are too far apart it will be us again  ♫

330
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,760
♫  if it is destiny  ♫

331
00:25:54,970 --> 00:26:00,190
♫  On the side of a road  ♫

332
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:07,100
♫  Which is forked, I look at you  ♫

333
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:12,310
♫  Walking side by side with me  ♫

334
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,720
♫  Under the same moon the same wind blows  ♫
