1
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:56,348
Hey, Jonas! Slow down.
You might get another asthma attack.

2
00:02:08,212 --> 00:02:09,505
Jonas…

3
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:11,924
I told you not to help anymore, right?

4
00:02:12,007 --> 00:02:13,592
Look at what happened.

5
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,594
Wipe your sweat off.

6
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:49,211
Your top is already too small.

7
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,839
I need a new one.

8
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:53,507
I'll buy you one.

9
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:54,884
It's because you have a big appetite.

10
00:02:54,967 --> 00:02:55,968
No, I don't!

11
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,113
- Hey, it's my turn!
- Let me meet them.

12
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,448
- Give me some money.
- Yeah.

13
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,699
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

14
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,375
I'm telling you, Osang!

15
00:03:29,168 --> 00:03:31,128
Today's your lucky day!

16
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,963
- Really?
- Yes, believe me!

17
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,673
Oh, please, Grandma.

18
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,927
You've been telling me that
for three years now!

19
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:42,598
Luna! Good thing you're here.

20
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,558
Your mother finally showed up.

21
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:47,394
She said she's looking into something.

22
00:03:48,187 --> 00:03:50,856
- Luna, is that you?
- It stinks.

23
00:03:52,691 --> 00:03:54,485
I'll go ahead, Luna.

24
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:56,070
Oh, you're here.

25
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:57,988
Mom.

26
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:01,492
Wait, wait. I haven't even closed it yet.

27
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:02,576
Luna.

28
00:04:03,118 --> 00:04:05,412
Here. Here, honey.

29
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:07,581
This is cruise ship work.

30
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:09,458
Cruise.

31
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,467
They'll train you for free.
You just need to be on board.

32
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,179
What's so horrible about it?

33
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,014
You're cleaning old tombs here
for Christ's sake.

34
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,143
You'll be cleaning
something grand this time, honey.

35
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:29,311
You'll clean a cruise ship.

36
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:30,729
You'll get big tips.

37
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,898
In Euros, honey. Euros.

38
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,110
Mom, you're forcing me again.

39
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,822
I already took care of everything.

40
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:43,784
This is our only chance for a better life.

41
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,621
Do you really want Jonas to breathe
this air forever?

42
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,373
That's the thing, Mom.

43
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,166
Who's going to look after Jonas?

44
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,751
Me and your Grandma Martha, of course.

45
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:55,879
You?

46
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,215
You're always disappearing
for days on end.

47
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,176
Because I'm fixing your documents.

48
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,595
And the truth is…

49
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:07,641
my hustle with foreigners
isn't going so well.

50
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:10,477
Hmm.

51
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,646
Then I should just take your job.

52
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,649
I'll be a tour guide like you.

53
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:17,151
Do you hear yourself?

54
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,235
You want to be a tour guide?

55
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:20,612
Just feed your brother.

56
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,078
Over there. Look up.
It's all covered in glass.

57
00:05:28,162 --> 00:05:29,329
It must be scary to look down
when it's all glass.

58
00:05:30,873 --> 00:05:32,541
That one's tall too.

59
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:33,917
You're right.

60
00:05:42,551 --> 00:05:43,427
Jonas,

61
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:46,555
you're going back to school next year.

62
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,766
You already said that last year.

63
00:05:49,892 --> 00:05:51,477
Don't worry.

64
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,645
I'll keep an eye on Mom and Grandma.

65
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,855
I'll keep them in line.

66
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:58,025
Whoa! Jonas, my little tough guy!

67
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,401
So cool!

68
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,864
Send me lots of videos.

69
00:06:04,323 --> 00:06:06,408
Send it whenever you get a signal.

70
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,745
So it still feels like I'm with you.

71
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,921
Promise, when I come back,

72
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,716
we won't need to ride a ferry
to see the tall buildings.

73
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,096
We will live
in one of those tall buildings.

74
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,348
Where do you want? Here? There? Which one?

75
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,265
That one!

76
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,183
Do you like it there?

77
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,392
We'll live there someday.

78
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,436
Somewhere too high for dust to reach.

79
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,729
You won't have asthma attacks anymore.

80
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,147
Promise me.

81
00:06:38,065 --> 00:06:39,483
I will wait for you.

82
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,363
Remember that Luna-and-Jonas move we make?

83
00:06:44,696 --> 00:06:45,614
On three,

84
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:48,242
two, one, go!

85
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,201
Go up!

86
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,412
I'll fall in!

87
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,373
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

88
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,335
We're rocking the boat.

89
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:05,551
Yay!

90
00:07:09,138 --> 00:07:10,848
Luna! Luna!

91
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:14,643
Luna! Bat your eyes! Hey!

92
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,104
Luna, don't forget my present.

93
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,107
<i>My Bridget always brings you chocolates.</i>

94
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,901
<i>We've run out again.</i>

95
00:07:22,985 --> 00:07:24,236
<i>Grandma! Grandma!</i>

96
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,113
<i>Buy a new one for Jonas, okay?</i>
<i>I left some money.</i>

97
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,197
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

98
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,242
<i>And you, when your inhaler runs out,</i>
<i>make sure to tell Grandma, okay?</i>

99
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,660
<i>Here, sister.</i>

100
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:33,954
<i>Promise you'll bring this back home to me.</i>

101
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:35,247
<i>Take it back home with you.</i>

102
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:36,832
<i>Make it look nicer.</i>

103
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:40,002
<i>My beautiful daughter is now an OFW!</i>

104
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:40,919
<i>Look at you!</i>

105
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,422
<i>Hey, boomers.</i>

106
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,717
<i>The moment she steps off that ship,</i>
<i>we'll be rich.</i>

107
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,343
<i>We'll be out of this dump!</i>

108
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,053
<i>Say goodbye to everyone.</i>

109
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:53,140
<i>- Bye!</i>
<i>- Bye!</i>

110
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,185
<i>Oh, bye! Yes, smile at the camera.</i>

111
00:07:56,435 --> 00:07:57,811
<i>Luna! Bye-bye!</i>

112
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:58,896
<i>Luna!</i>

113
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:05,652
<i>Hi, Jonas!</i>

114
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:07,487
<i>It's so beautiful here.</i>

115
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:08,947
<i>It is such a big ship!</i>

116
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,949
<i>This is the ship's lobby.</i>

117
00:08:11,033 --> 00:08:12,201
<i>Cory, Cory!</i>

118
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:13,744
<i>Say "hi" to my brother!</i>

119
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,120
<i>Hi, Jonas!</i>

120
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,789
<i>Capt. Muhloch!</i>

121
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,584
<i>Say "Mabuhay!" to my brother Jonas.</i>

122
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,501
<i>Mabuhay!</i>

123
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,963
<i>Hey, Luna! Look.</i>

124
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,924
<i>Here he comes. The handsome waiter!</i>

125
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,927
<i>Be honest, he's good-looking, right?</i>

126
00:08:30,928 --> 00:08:32,763
<i>I have to go, Jonas. Bye for now.</i>

127
00:08:32,846 --> 00:08:34,097
<i>I love you.</i>

128
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,391
<i>Bonjour, Madame.</i>

129
00:08:36,475 --> 00:08:37,392
<i>Hello.</i>

130
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,522
<i>Thank you.</i>

131
00:08:45,943 --> 00:08:48,528
<i>You're totally jealous.</i>

132
00:08:49,947 --> 00:08:50,864
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

133
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,326
<i>I'm sure one day,</i>
<i>I'll make it to a masquerade too.</i>

134
00:08:56,745 --> 00:08:57,704
<i>Jonas?</i>

135
00:08:58,288 --> 00:08:59,998
<i>Hey, what happened to you? Are you okay?</i>

136
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:01,291
<i>- I can't breathe, Sis.</i>
<i>- Ms. Luna Caceres.</i>

137
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,878
<i>- Are you doing FaceTime during your shift?</i>
<i>- Grandma's not here. She's at the market.</i>

138
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,172
<i>Chop-chop! We haven't got all day.</i>

139
00:09:07,256 --> 00:09:09,258
<i>Ma'am, I'm sorry. It's my brother.</i>

140
00:09:13,929 --> 00:09:17,724
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>It looks like they're breaking up.</i>

141
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:20,102
<i>Why is she fighting with Aji?</i>

142
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:23,063
<i>I should stop recording this.</i>

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,209
Luna! I was looking for you.

144
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:47,546
What's the matter, girl? Get over here!

145
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:49,131
Come here, hey!

146
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,674
What's wrong? Come on.

147
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,342
Luna.

148
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,386
Luna, what are you doing?

149
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:56,763
- Luna!
- Man overboard!

150
00:09:56,847 --> 00:09:59,766
- Help! Help, somebody help us!
- Man overboard!

151
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:00,809
- Luna!
- Somebody help!

152
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:02,269
- Luna! Somebody help!
- Help her!

153
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:03,770
- Man overboard!
- Help us, sir!

154
00:10:03,854 --> 00:10:05,689
- Somebody help!
- Help us, sir!

155
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,483
Help us. Someone help her, sir!

156
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,484
Help!

157
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:35,510
- Hey, Luna!
- Hey!

158
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,513
You're not supposed to be back
until next year, right?

159
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,141
Did they send you home early?

160
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:42,309
Yeah.

161
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:10,962
Sis!

162
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:14,674
Jonas!

163
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,267
Sis, I kept my promise. I waited for you.

164
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,355
This is for you.

165
00:11:28,772 --> 00:11:29,898
That's a lot.

166
00:11:32,651 --> 00:11:33,944
They're just giveaways.

167
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:36,238
Better to take it
than let the guests throw it away.

168
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:37,823
Oh, wait.

169
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,539
I promised I would bring this back to you.

170
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:49,292
Thank you, sis.

171
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:52,838
Where's Mom?

172
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,132
- I don't know.
- Let's go.

173
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:07,477
Here. These are effective against hexes.

174
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,687
Get your hands on it!

175
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,400
My friends, come and get it!

176
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,069
Aren't you interested?

177
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,282
Grandma?

178
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,160
I sent you money to fix the house.

179
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,536
Why does it look the same?

180
00:12:24,619 --> 00:12:27,289
I assure you, these will block all curses.

181
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:28,582
Grandma.

182
00:12:28,665 --> 00:12:30,375
Luna, I can't deal with you right now.

183
00:12:31,042 --> 00:12:33,336
I'm talking to my customers.

184
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,463
Can we talk later?

185
00:12:42,554 --> 00:12:44,055
Where's Mom?

186
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:48,351
Grandma also has no idea, sis.

187
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:52,522
I think she's going senile.

188
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:56,359
Look. She's keeping all those papers.

189
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:59,154
No, those are utility bills.

190
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,448
She doesn't want to see them.

191
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:12,000
That one again?

192
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,752
You've finished that puzzle ten times.

193
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,045
Okay, guys.

194
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,755
That's it for today, okay?

195
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,298
Catch you later!

196
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,133
Thank God that's over with.

197
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,012
And you.

198
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,098
Why are you back so soon? Where is it?

199
00:13:28,266 --> 00:13:29,976
The better home…

200
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:32,270
that you promised.

201
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,609
Nothing to be done about it.

202
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,569
What's done is done.

203
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,786
Where's Mom?

204
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:49,871
She disappeared again.

205
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:52,374
Into thin air.

206
00:13:58,088 --> 00:14:00,257
Where are you, Mom?
What is wrong with her?

207
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,855
<i>Your call cannot be completed as dialed.</i>

208
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:19,693
<i>Please check your number and try again.</i>

209
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,908
Where'd you go this time, Mom?

210
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:29,327
Sis, don't do that.

211
00:14:29,995 --> 00:14:31,162
It stinks.

212
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:33,373
I don't even take a bath there.

213
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:37,085
Jonas, do you know where Mom
keeps her secret stash?

214
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,037
Do you think maybe that's where Mom went?

215
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,289
You should go find her, sis.

216
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,717
So this is P77.

217
00:15:41,983 --> 00:15:44,944
Miss, can I have some change?
Just for a meal.

218
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,164
Are you going in there?

219
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:58,541
I'm looking for someone, miss.

220
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,210
I've been there before.

221
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,003
That place is dangerous, dear.

222
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:06,091
They'll suck your mind out.

223
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:08,885
Suck out what?

224
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:15,892
I just really need to find someone.

225
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,061
- Miss…?
- Tere.

226
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,771
My name is Tere.

227
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,565
Listen,

228
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:25,860
be careful in there.

229
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:24,878
<i>Capt. Muhloch!</i>

230
00:17:24,961 --> 00:17:26,629
<i>One day, I'll attend a masquerade too.</i>

231
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,173
<i>What is happening to you? Are you okay?</i>

232
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,632
<i>Don't answer that.</i>

233
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,092
<i>Are they having problems back home?</i>

234
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:00,663
Are you okay, miss?

235
00:18:12,592 --> 00:18:14,385
Oh. Ms. Caceres.

236
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,386
Welcome.

237
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,555
We've been expecting you.

238
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,682
Have we met?

239
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,643
How do you know my name?

240
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,895
I am Anastacio Focalor, at your service.

241
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:26,022
I'm the stay-in lobby manager

242
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,651
of this super exclusive establishment.

243
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,037
You were recommended by Mrs. Caceres.

244
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,249
Your mother, right?

245
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,336
Really? Is she here?

246
00:18:49,087 --> 00:18:51,756
She told us you'll be replacing her

247
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,716
as a home cleaner

248
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,134
of unit…

249
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:58,721
Please don't tell anyone.

250
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,640
It's actually illegal

251
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,767
to hire someone outside of an agency.

252
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:04,727
But here you go.

253
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:08,857
Penthouse 7 on the 77th floor.

254
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,393
Hello?

255
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,068
Is anybody home?

256
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:51,542
Mom's earring?

257
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,138
My apologies.

258
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,723
Andrew Cambion.

259
00:21:05,807 --> 00:21:06,641
I'm…

260
00:21:07,517 --> 00:21:09,185
I'm the owner of this place.

261
00:21:13,314 --> 00:21:16,025
Surely I'm not that ugly, right?

262
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:19,445
Oh, I'm sorry. You just startled me.

263
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:21,072
I should be the one saying that.

264
00:21:21,155 --> 00:21:22,240
What brings you here?

265
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,868
My name is Luna Caceres.

266
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:28,037
I'm the house cleaner.

267
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:30,039
You can ask the receptionist.

268
00:21:30,123 --> 00:21:32,625
I was recommended by Natalia Caceres.

269
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,585
Natalia Caceres?

270
00:21:35,086 --> 00:21:36,379
We don't know anyone by that--

271
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:39,716
Darling?

272
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,718
Sonia, come over please.

273
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,303
We have an intruder.

274
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:47,348
A very pretty one but still an intruder.

275
00:22:01,904 --> 00:22:03,364
Osteoarthritis.

276
00:22:03,448 --> 00:22:04,782
Don't mention it.

277
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:06,284
She's quite sensitive.

278
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:08,703
Darling, meet Luna.

279
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,957
I didn't hear the doorbell, Andrew.

280
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,960
The door was open.

281
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:18,337
Should you enter every open door?

282
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,464
Like your mouth?

283
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,424
Darling,

284
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:23,217
Luna is a house cleaner.

285
00:22:23,301 --> 00:22:26,971
Recommended by a certain Natalia Cacecke?

286
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:28,306
- It's "Caceres."
- Who cares?

287
00:22:28,389 --> 00:22:29,265
We're going to be late.

288
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,100
You may leave, Luna.

289
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:34,771
But Sonia, surely,
you see the house needs cleaning.

290
00:22:34,854 --> 00:22:37,315
And we do need a house sitter
while we're away.

291
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:40,985
So you trust her?

292
00:22:41,069 --> 00:22:43,696
She literally just walked in
for the love of the devil.

293
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,740
What if this one here is a klepto?

294
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,408
An arsonist? A serial killer?

295
00:22:47,492 --> 00:22:48,701
Don't be ridiculous.

296
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:52,038
Reception, Mr. Focalor, vetted her.

297
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,500
Luna?

298
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:05,009
Luna?

299
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,888
Ma'am. Ma'am Sonia,

300
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:11,182
I really need a job.

301
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,355
Alright.

302
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:20,233
Regular condo cleaning rates.

303
00:23:20,316 --> 00:23:23,069
Additional for house sitting. Five days.

304
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:25,029
We pay when we return, okay?

305
00:23:25,738 --> 00:23:28,407
Oh, and don't let anyone in.

306
00:23:30,576 --> 00:23:32,161
I promise, you won't regret it.

307
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,248
No, but you might.

308
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,668
Let's go. We're going to be late.

309
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:42,296
Consider this day one.

310
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,257
Thank you.

311
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,258
Thank you, sir.

312
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,659
Look…

313
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:13,995
This isn't pretend rich.

314
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:16,414
These people are the real deal, you know?

315
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,623
<i>It looks cool!</i>

316
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,168
But it's weird

317
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,962
because they said they've never met Mom.

318
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:23,880
<i>Really?</i>

319
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:24,881
I don't believe them.

320
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:26,799
But…

321
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:29,927
Jonas…

322
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,555
Your sister has a new job.

323
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:35,349
What is happening to you?

324
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,518
You can't breathe.

325
00:24:37,852 --> 00:24:38,686
<i>It's nothing.</i>

326
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,646
Your inhaler's used up. Where's Grandma?

327
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,315
<i>Sis, I can't breathe.</i>

328
00:24:42,398 --> 00:24:43,774
<i>Grandma's not here.</i>

329
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,779
<i>Grandma's not here, sis.</i>
<i>Grandma's not here.</i>

330
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:50,573
Did they leave you by yourself?

331
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,074
Uhm…

332
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,076
Don't worry, I'll come home right now.

333
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,328
I'll be right there.

334
00:24:55,411 --> 00:24:57,455
Jonas, wait for me. Wait for me, please.

335
00:24:57,538 --> 00:24:58,789
I'll be with you in a second.

336
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:01,209
- Please, Jonas! You can't!
<i>- I can't breathe.</i>

337
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,877
No!

338
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,753
You cursed someone.

339
00:25:47,171 --> 00:25:48,464
Who did I curse, Grandma?

340
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:52,510
You cursed yourself.

341
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:58,349
You are full of fear and regret.

342
00:25:59,392 --> 00:26:01,978
There is so much guilt in your heart
over your sins.

343
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:03,646
You can't let go.

344
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:06,732
Well, they're feasting…

345
00:26:08,192 --> 00:26:09,443
on your sins.

346
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:23,207
Come on, Grandma. You're making me crazy.

347
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,334
It's probably just a rotten egg.

348
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:27,920
Check it out, Grandma.

349
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:30,923
I was able to trace the condo
where Mom used to work.

350
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:32,800
I even found her other earring, see.

351
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:34,760
The missing pair.

352
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:37,346
They're inside your head.

353
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,433
They're going to devour your soul.

354
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,184
Who are they?

355
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,233
You know what, Jonas?

356
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,443
The place is awesome.

357
00:26:50,776 --> 00:26:51,902
And the windows!

358
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:53,529
You can see all the way to China!

359
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,031
- For real?
- It's true!

360
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:58,159
And every corner is fully-air conditioned.

361
00:26:58,242 --> 00:26:59,702
You'll never catch a cold.

362
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,837
I only wish I could have given you
all that comfort.

363
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:13,507
Sis, I'm happy when you're happy.

364
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:18,471
I'm sorry, Jonas.

365
00:27:19,263 --> 00:27:21,557
We couldn't give you a better life.

366
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:28,397
Why is God unfair?

367
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,483
He plays favorites.

368
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,569
Favorites?

369
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,488
He favors certain people.

370
00:27:36,447 --> 00:27:38,407
Others seem to have
all the luck in the world…

371
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,368
Then there are people like us…

372
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:42,370
Sis,

373
00:27:42,787 --> 00:27:43,621
calm down.

374
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,539
I'm doing okay.

375
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,041
You're always worrying.

376
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,627
I love you, Sis.

377
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:58,552
I said, "I love you."

378
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,349
Jonas, listen…

379
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,352
What if I bring you to P77?

380
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:07,895
Huh?

381
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:15,820
Get down, get down…

382
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,306
Hello, ma'am.

383
00:28:45,933 --> 00:28:46,851
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,040
What a lovely family picture.

385
00:29:13,294 --> 00:29:14,587
We did it.

386
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,590
The receptionist didn't notice anything.

387
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:21,844
Seriously?

388
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,430
I just dusted this place yesterday.

389
00:29:25,723 --> 00:29:27,725
This photograph is grimy.

390
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:33,814
Wow!

391
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,232
So many birds.

392
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:39,737
Thank you, Sis.

393
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,322
So dusty!

394
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:48,204
What's with the costumes?

395
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,665
Sis…

396
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,004
I said thank you for bringing me here.

397
00:30:00,883 --> 00:30:02,009
Of course.

398
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:04,470
I'll handle everything for you.

399
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,473
What's this box?

400
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,146
Jonas, be careful!

401
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,066
Oh, it's a puzzle!

402
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,654
I told you, this house has everything
you could ever want!

403
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,671
Jonas, have you taken a bath?

404
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:56,564
We only used to see this in the movies.

405
00:30:57,106 --> 00:30:58,023
Smells good, right?

406
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,444
Sis, this is not our bathtub.

407
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:07,241
So what? We all have armpits
that need scrubbing.

408
00:31:08,492 --> 00:31:09,702
Is my little brother happy?

409
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:14,331
Sis, why do you always ask if I'm happy?

410
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,084
Because if you're happy, then I'm happy.

411
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:21,171
What happens if I disappear?

412
00:31:29,096 --> 00:31:30,931
Having fun, are you?

413
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:35,060
I'm sure I'll find those little armpits.
Where are they?

414
00:31:36,061 --> 00:31:37,187
Where are those?

415
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:39,732
Jonas?

416
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:43,360
Jonas?

417
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:46,780
Jonas?

418
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:49,658
Sis, I'm right here.

419
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:54,997
You were in here a while ago.

420
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,249
What are you talking about?
You're so silly.

421
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,877
You even handed me the towel.

422
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:12,890
Sis, show your friends where you are.

423
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,475
They're going to be jealous.

424
00:32:15,017 --> 00:32:18,687
<i>Girl, what are you doing there, huh?</i>

425
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,106
Feeling blessed!

426
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,775
<i>- Feeling blessed?</i>
- Feeling blessed!

427
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:24,485
- Check this out.
<i>- Feeling like a guest, huh?</i>

428
00:32:24,568 --> 00:32:27,655
<i>Whoa! That's bubbles!</i>

429
00:32:27,738 --> 00:32:30,991
- Like in a premium suite in a cruise.
<i>- What a high-end bathroom!</i>

430
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:36,622
<i>Wow, look at her.</i>
<i>Our dear Luna has made it far.</i>

431
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:39,249
<i>You look fabulous!</i>

432
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:42,378
<i>It's so different from the broken</i>
<i>toilet bowls you're used to!</i>

433
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:47,132
<i>You deserve all that, sis! Show them!</i>

434
00:32:47,216 --> 00:32:50,469
<i>But be careful. You might drown again!</i>

435
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:52,930
Quit talking about that.

436
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:54,431
It was just an accident.

437
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,475
<i>Accident?</i>

438
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,007
You're doing this to me.

439
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:42,164
Luna, you deserve this.

440
00:34:46,794 --> 00:34:48,796
Outfit check, fellow princesses.

441
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:47,729
Whoa!

442
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,732
Jonas, come back here! You're a menace!

443
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,150
Jonas!

444
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:53,277
I swear to god!

445
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,778
Why are you trying to scare me?

446
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,239
Funny you should get scared.

447
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,741
When you're wearing a ghost's dress.

448
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:03,704
A ghost?

449
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,247
Hey, come here.

450
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,498
Sis, let's play hide and seek.

451
00:36:06,582 --> 00:36:07,749
Ah, hide and seek?

452
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,004
Mom?

453
00:36:15,549 --> 00:36:16,383
Hello?

454
00:36:17,384 --> 00:36:18,218
Mom?

455
00:36:23,932 --> 00:36:24,850
Mom?

456
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:25,767
Hello?

457
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,144
Where are you?

458
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,105
Where?

459
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:34,526
Mom?

460
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:39,781
Where are you?

461
00:36:42,242 --> 00:36:43,118
Mom?

462
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:53,670
Psst!

463
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:57,716
Jonas, I've been trying to call Mom.

464
00:36:57,799 --> 00:36:58,842
Why do you have her phone?

465
00:36:58,926 --> 00:37:01,470
Mom left it behind,
so I just kept playing.

466
00:37:01,803 --> 00:37:03,931
- Give me that.
- You'll have to catch me first!

467
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,390
Jonas!

468
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:20,656
There you are.

469
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:27,704
Jonas.

470
00:37:30,332 --> 00:37:32,751
Your sister is here.

471
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,224
Got you!

472
00:37:58,944 --> 00:37:59,820
Sis.

473
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,073
You're crazy.

474
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,786
- Catch me if you can!
- Jonas!

475
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:09,955
Where are you?

476
00:38:15,085 --> 00:38:16,503
Sis, there's someone in the house.

477
00:38:18,588 --> 00:38:19,464
Where?

478
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:21,425
We're the only ones here.

479
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:37,733
Ma'am.

480
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,985
Did I startle you, my dear?

481
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:48,410
Forgive me.

482
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:54,207
By the way, you don't know how to forgive.

483
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,295
Sorry?

484
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,088
Oh!

485
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,090
Cantonese eyeball.

486
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:03,925
Lychee with olive inside.

487
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:05,052
Do you want a bite?

488
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:12,350
I came back for my passport.

489
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,393
<i>Merde.</i>

490
00:39:13,935 --> 00:39:16,063
We booked a hotel beside the airport.

491
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,400
You look stressed, honey.

492
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,238
It's nothing.

493
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:27,074
Just grinding.

494
00:39:27,407 --> 00:39:29,242
There's a thick layer of dust everywhere.

495
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:33,371
Which is thicker?

496
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,457
The layers of dust or your face?

497
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,417
You're wearing my dress.

498
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,879
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'll take it off.

499
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,380
No, no, no. Nevermind.

500
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:43,673
You can have it.

501
00:39:43,757 --> 00:39:45,258
I was just teasing you, Luna.

502
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:46,676
It suits you.

503
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,303
A funeral dress.

504
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,223
Oh!

505
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,559
I give you permission to use the bathtub,

506
00:39:54,851 --> 00:39:58,855
try on my clothes,
and eat all the food from the fridge.

507
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:02,943
- I promise I won't. I'm still full.
- Oh, nonsense!

508
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:05,112
Take advantage of all the pleasures here.

509
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:07,656
You deserve it.

510
00:40:12,661 --> 00:40:15,205
You're a much better cleaner than Natalia.

511
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,211
Hang on, Ma'am Sonia.

512
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:23,505
You know my mom?

513
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,510
Why did you lie to me?

514
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:32,514
What have you done to her?

515
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,768
Don't you mean what has she done to us?

516
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:38,937
You got it backwards.

517
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:45,318
That's why we didn't tell you.

518
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:49,990
So you wouldn't be ashamed.

519
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,075
Why would I feel ashamed?

520
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:56,329
Because your mother stole from us.

521
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,210
What? She wouldn't do that.

522
00:41:03,587 --> 00:41:06,423
Watches, jewelry, silverware.

523
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:09,885
Mr. Focalor found them
in her bag downstairs.

524
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,928
Do you want to see the video?
There's a video.

525
00:41:12,012 --> 00:41:13,972
We can watch it together at the precinct.

526
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,557
I'm so sorry,

527
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,225
I'll just pay for everything she took.

528
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,518
Ah, no.

529
00:41:19,186 --> 00:41:20,353
She gave them all back.

530
00:41:21,313 --> 00:41:22,898
There was no need to file charges.

531
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,817
That's why we didn't tell you.

532
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,279
You are such a good daughter.

533
00:41:35,952 --> 00:41:38,079
Okay, chop-chop. Finish your job.

534
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:40,665
Oh, and remember, Luna.

535
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:42,459
Remember what I told you.

536
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:45,921
No unauthorized visitors.

537
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:49,841
If you bring someone in here,

538
00:41:51,885 --> 00:41:53,428
they might not make it out.

539
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,514
Hmm?

540
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,073
So they were lying about Mom…

541
00:42:15,075 --> 00:42:16,076
Jonas?

542
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:18,745
Jonas?

543
00:42:24,751 --> 00:42:26,044
This tastes so good!

544
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:37,222
Jonas?

545
00:42:39,224 --> 00:42:41,935
Jonas, we brought our own food.

546
00:42:44,646 --> 00:42:46,273
The old lady said

547
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:48,275
we can eat all the food in this house.

548
00:42:48,358 --> 00:42:51,152
That doesn't mean we should do it.

549
00:42:51,486 --> 00:42:52,862
Those are for rich people only.

550
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,740
If we have the same armpits,

551
00:42:56,157 --> 00:42:58,243
then we have the same stomachs.

552
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,453
You used her bathtub and put on her dress.

553
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:02,038
I prefer to enjoy the food.

554
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,707
What's the difference between us?

555
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:05,834
Stop being self-righteous.

556
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,045
That's why our lives went to hell.

557
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:10,797
Because of your ambition.

558
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,924
Jonas, what's going on with you?

559
00:43:13,008 --> 00:43:14,384
Why are you talking like that?

560
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:19,431
I don't want this anymore, Jonas.

561
00:43:20,307 --> 00:43:21,891
I don't want to suffer anymore.

562
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:25,562
I want to experience this life.

563
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:27,689
Even for once.

564
00:43:28,648 --> 00:43:30,525
You're sick of it too, right, Jonas?

565
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:34,487
So let's just stay here forever.

566
00:43:46,333 --> 00:43:47,459
Jonas?

567
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,442
What happened, Sis?

568
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:14,069
Sis?

569
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,324
Sis.

570
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:21,576
What's going on?

571
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:24,496
Sis, I said,

572
00:44:24,871 --> 00:44:25,705
I'm sorry.

573
00:44:26,164 --> 00:44:27,957
For eating the bread here.

574
00:44:29,376 --> 00:44:30,293
That's okay.

575
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:32,253
Go on, finish all of it.

576
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:36,216
You know what, Sis,

577
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:40,678
Grandma said,

578
00:44:41,513 --> 00:44:44,349
if you eat from a monster's feast,

579
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:46,351
you're never getting out of here.

580
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,021
What are you saying?

581
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,570
That's why I ate their food
because I want to.

582
00:44:58,029 --> 00:44:58,863
I'll stay here.

583
00:44:58,947 --> 00:45:00,323
So you should eat too, Sis.

584
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:02,033
Eat it! Eat it!

585
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:05,412
Sis, you're talking to yourself again.

586
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:06,788
Since we got here.

587
00:45:07,330 --> 00:45:09,332
Time for my siesta.

588
00:45:09,749 --> 00:45:11,251
You're so weird today, Sis.

589
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:16,965
Jonas, something is happening.

590
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:19,759
Why does it seem like
when I'm in this place,

591
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,346
it knows everything I'm thinking?

592
00:45:24,264 --> 00:45:25,557
My memories.

593
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,189
Tell me the truth, Sis.

594
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,859
Did you get sick on the ship?

595
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,827
Jonas, I have something to tell you, okay?

596
00:45:48,246 --> 00:45:49,497
On the ship…

597
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:52,000
something happened to me.

598
00:45:53,918 --> 00:45:55,211
I got depressed.

599
00:45:56,379 --> 00:45:58,006
So they gave me medicine.

600
00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:02,218
But it seems like…

601
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:04,304
it has side effects.

602
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,642
I started to see all sorts of things.

603
00:46:13,104 --> 00:46:16,316
Sis, you know what,
all you have to do is wake up.

604
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,401
Life is just a dream.

605
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:48,157
This must be a side effect.
I keep seeing random things.

606
00:47:56,374 --> 00:47:57,709
I haven't taken it off.

607
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:39,250
Miss…

608
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:42,503
is there any problem?

609
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:46,883
Let me help you.

610
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,554
Who are you?

611
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,515
What are you doing in my master's house?

612
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:55,892
Ah, sorry.

613
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,268
I'm Theo, by the way.

614
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:58,686
I live in the adjacent unit.

615
00:49:01,189 --> 00:49:02,231
I remember you.

616
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:03,941
From the elevator.

617
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,070
Yeah. I remember you as well.

618
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:11,115
No one so beautiful escapes my attention.

619
00:49:19,666 --> 00:49:20,792
Anyway.

620
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:22,710
Have you seen Andrew?

621
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,630
I wanted to borrow a bow tie.

622
00:49:26,005 --> 00:49:27,757
The Cambions aren't here yet.

623
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:29,467
They won't be back until…

624
00:49:30,343 --> 00:49:32,470
When I saw you earlier,

625
00:49:33,638 --> 00:49:35,014
you seemed terrified of something.

626
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:38,101
What was it?

627
00:49:40,603 --> 00:49:42,188
Nothing, don't worry about it.

628
00:49:42,271 --> 00:49:43,439
I wasn't myself.

629
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:56,244
No wonder you're having those
crazy episodes.

630
00:49:56,327 --> 00:49:57,370
You're taking Benz.

631
00:49:58,121 --> 00:49:59,414
Benzodiazepine.

632
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,582
Antidepressant.

633
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,459
Heavy stuff.

634
00:50:18,307 --> 00:50:20,601
I threw these in the trash earlier.

635
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,775
Why are you asking? Are you with PDEA?

636
00:50:29,652 --> 00:50:31,195
Come on, Luna.

637
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:32,613
You can tell me.

638
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:35,908
I'd rather keep it to myself, sir.

639
00:50:36,576 --> 00:50:38,119
We're not that close.

640
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:40,621
Fine.

641
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:42,874
Let me guess again.

642
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,335
You're taking double doses, aren't you?

643
00:50:49,672 --> 00:50:50,798
Whoa!

644
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:53,593
That's why--

645
00:50:55,011 --> 00:50:55,845
Good thing…

646
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,514
Good thing you didn't see Dr. Jose Rizal.

647
00:51:02,101 --> 00:51:02,935
But, sir…

648
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:06,105
it's not just the medicine
that is driving me mad.

649
00:51:09,192 --> 00:51:10,610
This whole house…

650
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,489
it seems to have its own mind.

651
00:51:16,324 --> 00:51:18,159
It seems to know me, Sir Theo.

652
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,916
This house knows everything about us.

653
00:51:28,586 --> 00:51:30,213
It's thinking ahead of us.

654
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:33,132
Really?

655
00:51:34,509 --> 00:51:35,343
Let me show you.

656
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,888
Siri,

657
00:51:40,681 --> 00:51:41,516
play music.

658
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:47,730
Siri,

659
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:49,816
stop music.

660
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,028
See, it can give you anything you want.

661
00:51:54,737 --> 00:51:56,364
As long as you don't leave.

662
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,035
There's no signal outside.

663
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:03,204
I know that.

664
00:52:03,621 --> 00:52:05,623
I wasn't talking about that.

665
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:10,211
I just feel like
I've met all of you somewhere…

666
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:12,964
somewhere…

667
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:14,340
Luna.

668
00:52:15,258 --> 00:52:16,300
Sir, stop!

669
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:18,678
You could have asked first.

670
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,972
Then it wouldn't be candid.

671
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,560
If you don't flaunt your beauty,

672
00:52:26,769 --> 00:52:27,728
it would be a waste.

673
00:52:38,531 --> 00:52:39,365
Let me see.

674
00:52:40,032 --> 00:52:40,908
Luna.

675
00:52:40,992 --> 00:52:42,034
Luna, give it back.

676
00:52:42,952 --> 00:52:44,495
Don't delete the picture, Luna.

677
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:45,997
Luna.

678
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:49,208
Okay, give it back.

679
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:53,963
Ah, sorry.

680
00:52:54,755 --> 00:52:55,590
Glitch.

681
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,925
The two photographs must have overlapped.

682
00:52:59,051 --> 00:53:00,052
Huh?

683
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,222
I've never seen that before.

684
00:53:05,725 --> 00:53:07,268
Are you saying my camera is broken?

685
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:08,728
Okay.

686
00:53:09,562 --> 00:53:10,438
Anyway,

687
00:53:10,938 --> 00:53:12,273
it's for my own enjoyment.

688
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:16,485
What's the point of taking pictures
if you're not going to show anyone?

689
00:53:18,404 --> 00:53:19,238
To…

690
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:21,616
To entertain myself.

691
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:26,579
It's lonely in here.

692
00:53:29,498 --> 00:53:31,500
We're jealous of people like you.

693
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:34,045
People like me?

694
00:53:35,755 --> 00:53:37,548
What's there to be jealous about?

695
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,134
You wouldn't understand.

696
00:53:41,636 --> 00:53:44,180
I feel like whenever I capture
someone's photo,

697
00:53:45,181 --> 00:53:47,224
I've also captured their soul.

698
00:53:49,852 --> 00:53:52,188
You should be careful
which souls you capture.

699
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:53,940
Why?

700
00:53:54,774 --> 00:53:56,233
What's your soul like these days?

701
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,361
Is it completely cracked?

702
00:54:05,409 --> 00:54:07,078
I should get back to work, sir.

703
00:54:08,788 --> 00:54:09,664
Luna!

704
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:11,624
Come on.

705
00:54:13,167 --> 00:54:14,043
Listen,

706
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:17,463
I just need to practice
for the masquerade ball later.

707
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:19,423
Can you please help me?

708
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:22,426
Ball?

709
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,055
I'll go back to work now, sir.

710
00:54:26,138 --> 00:54:27,056
Please, Luna.

711
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:29,976
Just for once, come on.

712
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:32,269
Promise.

713
00:54:32,895 --> 00:54:34,563
I'm not going to tell Mrs. Cambion

714
00:54:34,647 --> 00:54:36,649
that there's a kid squatting
in their living room.

715
00:54:45,032 --> 00:54:45,866
Please.

716
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,286
It's a deal.

717
00:54:51,163 --> 00:54:52,331
Aha!

718
00:54:52,957 --> 00:54:54,166
Is that how you want to play?

719
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,002
Fine.

720
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:58,337
What was her name?

721
00:54:59,964 --> 00:55:00,798
Siri,

722
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:02,842
ballroom music.

723
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:06,637
Tango!

724
00:55:07,972 --> 00:55:10,099
Place your hand on my shoulder. There!

725
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:14,812
When you're rich, you can't be sad, right?

726
00:55:15,604 --> 00:55:17,273
Why did you say you feel lonely here?

727
00:55:18,858 --> 00:55:20,359
This place is filled with dark energy.

728
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:22,486
Do you know what this place used to be?

729
00:55:22,945 --> 00:55:23,904
A hospital.

730
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:28,159
A hospital?

731
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:29,994
Yeah.

732
00:55:31,620 --> 00:55:32,580
It was a hospital.

733
00:55:33,789 --> 00:55:35,291
This very unit

734
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:36,751
used to be the morgue.

735
00:55:39,086 --> 00:55:40,337
It's fun in the morgue.

736
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:42,590
All their pain is gone.

737
00:55:49,638 --> 00:55:50,473
You know what,

738
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:53,517
you're so witty.

739
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,692
And when the hospital closed down,

740
00:56:03,194 --> 00:56:04,487
do you know what it became next?

741
00:56:06,489 --> 00:56:07,448
A sex club.

742
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:10,993
Infested with millionaires

743
00:56:12,078 --> 00:56:13,871
and naked women every night.

744
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:15,956
But eventually,

745
00:56:16,999 --> 00:56:17,833
they closed down too.

746
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:20,503
Because this land is cursed.

747
00:56:24,298 --> 00:56:25,800
Are you trying to scare me?

748
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,385
Because it's not working.

749
00:56:29,804 --> 00:56:31,931
I used to clean tombstones for a living.

750
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:35,351
I could dust off a whole cemetery.

751
00:56:35,935 --> 00:56:36,852
You know what,

752
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:41,065
I've never met anyone
whose company I enjoy as much as yours.

753
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:44,193
I enjoy all of you, Luna.

754
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:51,492
Sir,

755
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:53,786
time's up.

756
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:54,995
It's been over a minute.

757
00:56:56,330 --> 00:56:57,915
Luna, give me a chance.

758
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:00,668
Please come to the ball with me?

759
00:57:02,503 --> 00:57:03,921
That's not what we agreed on.

760
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:08,425
Luna, just a few minutes.

761
00:57:09,051 --> 00:57:10,344
Jonas is fast asleep anyway.

762
00:57:11,011 --> 00:57:12,304
Besides, this is a masquerade ball.

763
00:57:13,556 --> 00:57:15,891
Isn't that every girl's dream?

764
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:18,727
Back on the ship,

765
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:21,939
I know it was your dream too.

766
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:25,776
You've always wanted to attend
a masquerade ball, right?

767
00:57:28,362 --> 00:57:29,864
You don't have to live in envy.

768
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:36,036
For one night, you're one of them.

769
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,089
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.

770
00:57:47,173 --> 00:57:49,925
This is our annual masquerade ball.

771
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:52,344
Luna!

772
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:04,815
Ladies, it is important to hold on
to your Russian dolls.

773
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:06,984
As per tradition,

774
00:58:07,067 --> 00:58:09,945
the gentleman with the same doll as yours

775
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,573
will find you.

776
00:58:12,948 --> 00:58:13,866
But for now…

777
00:58:14,283 --> 00:58:15,576
Let's dance!

778
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,380
Are you excited, Luna?

779
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:46,458
Do you want this kind of life?

780
00:59:47,626 --> 00:59:48,752
Forever?

781
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:51,505
Is that even possible?

782
00:59:58,971 --> 00:59:59,847
Just be my wife.

783
01:00:05,978 --> 01:00:06,812
Hang on.

784
01:00:07,396 --> 01:00:08,314
This isn't right.

785
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:10,274
Let's cut it off.

786
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:11,191
I need to go back to Jonas.

787
01:00:11,275 --> 01:00:12,568
I'm serious, Luna.

788
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:14,069
Say yes, please.

789
01:00:15,404 --> 01:00:16,530
You're just drunk.

790
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:17,656
Sleep it off.

791
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,366
I'm not drunk. Wait for me.

792
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:21,035
I'll get the engagement ring from Mom.

793
01:00:21,577 --> 01:00:22,578
You've met her.

794
01:00:23,203 --> 01:00:24,204
I've met your mom?

795
01:00:24,663 --> 01:00:25,706
Who is she?

796
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:27,458
Stay there. I'll go get her.

797
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:29,084
Theo!

798
01:00:30,169 --> 01:00:31,170
Theo, wait!

799
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:37,092
Theo!

800
01:01:09,333 --> 01:01:10,167
Theo!

801
01:01:11,168 --> 01:01:13,253
I think I need to go back
to the penthouse.

802
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:15,005
Theo!

803
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:20,010
Hi, do you know where the exit is?

804
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,515
Sir, where's the exit?

805
01:01:29,395 --> 01:01:31,021
Ladies and gentlemen,

806
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:36,068
this is the moment
we've all been waiting for.

807
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:13,147
Wait. Let me go.

808
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,189
I'm not a part of this!

809
01:02:21,822 --> 01:02:22,656
Sir?

810
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,200
You?

811
01:02:26,827 --> 01:02:27,786
Why?

812
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:28,704
Wow!

813
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:32,583
You come to my house, you play in my bed,

814
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,961
and you expect nothing in return?

815
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:41,758
You're never getting out of here, Luna.

816
01:03:04,740 --> 01:03:07,242
Jonas! Jonas, wake up!

817
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:18,504
Jonas, where are you?

818
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,216
This isn't the time to play.

819
01:03:22,716 --> 01:03:23,550
Jonas!

820
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:00,254
Jonas, what is happening to you?

821
01:04:00,337 --> 01:04:02,464
<i>Are you having another asthma attack?</i>
<i>Where's Mom and Grandma?</i>

822
01:04:07,594 --> 01:04:08,845
<i>Grandma is not here.</i>

823
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,807
<i>All right. Wait for me, okay?</i>

824
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,850
<i>Jonas, wait for me, okay?</i>

825
01:04:14,601 --> 01:04:15,561
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

826
01:04:15,644 --> 01:04:17,938
<i>How can I get there fast, Jonas?</i>

827
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:20,691
<i>Jonas, talk to me.</i>

828
01:04:20,774 --> 01:04:22,234
<i>Ma'am, please help me.</i>

829
01:04:22,317 --> 01:04:24,570
<i>My brother can't breathe,</i>
<i>he's in the Philippines!</i>

830
01:04:24,653 --> 01:04:26,446
<i>Jonas!</i>

831
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:31,159
<i>Which relative can you call</i>
<i>in the Philippines?</i>

832
01:04:31,243 --> 01:04:33,203
<i>- Nobody.</i>
<i>- You're not going anywhere.</i>

833
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,081
<i>I can call…</i>

834
01:04:36,164 --> 01:04:38,917
<i>I can call Ms. Osang or Mom.</i>
<i>I'll call my mom, wait.</i>

835
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:42,087
<i>But I can't hang up on Jonas.</i>
<i>Wait, let me think.</i>

836
01:04:42,170 --> 01:04:43,255
<i>Jonas, wait for me.</i>

837
01:04:43,338 --> 01:04:44,756
<i>How do I go there, Jonas?</i>

838
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:46,174
<i>Wait for me.</i>

839
01:04:46,967 --> 01:04:48,385
<i>Jonas!</i>

840
01:04:49,886 --> 01:04:51,513
<i>Luna, Jonas is gone.</i>

841
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:52,639
<i>Sis?</i>

842
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:00,647
I shouldn't have brought you here.

843
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:01,857
Let's go home.

844
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,855
They'll suck your mind out.

845
01:05:43,398 --> 01:05:44,441
Ms. Tere?

846
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:47,944
She was a victim.

847
01:05:49,363 --> 01:05:51,823
She was one of their victims,
that's why she told me to be careful.

848
01:05:53,742 --> 01:05:55,160
Look through the pictures,
we might find Mom.

849
01:05:59,998 --> 01:06:01,500
Sis, what are these masks?

850
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:04,628
That's not here a while ago.

851
01:06:05,629 --> 01:06:07,130
Don't touch those. Nothing here is real.

852
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,965
Those women are real.

853
01:06:09,758 --> 01:06:11,343
That's why I take photos of you.

854
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,971
To capture your souls.

855
01:06:16,181 --> 01:06:17,182
Luna.

856
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:21,645
Theo, sweetie.

857
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:23,605
Here's the ring.

858
01:06:25,148 --> 01:06:26,108
Give it to her.

859
01:06:37,035 --> 01:06:38,036
Stay back!

860
01:06:38,120 --> 01:06:39,121
Stay away from us!

861
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:40,330
Stay away from us!

862
01:06:41,081 --> 01:06:42,165
Jonas, let's go.

863
01:06:42,249 --> 01:06:43,083
Don't come any closer!

864
01:06:43,458 --> 01:06:44,418
Don't you dare!

865
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:46,420
Don't you dare! Jonas, get down!

866
01:06:46,503 --> 01:06:47,379
Go!

867
01:06:48,422 --> 01:06:49,631
Don't come any closer!

868
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:50,716
Jonas, hurry!

869
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,180
- Sis! Sis, help me!
- Jonas!

870
01:06:57,472 --> 01:06:58,557
- Sis!
- Jonas!

871
01:06:59,141 --> 01:07:01,643
Jonas, oh my god! Jonas!

872
01:07:02,644 --> 01:07:03,729
- I can't open it.
- Sis.

873
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:06,773
I can't get out of here
because I ate their food.

874
01:07:06,857 --> 01:07:10,026
No, no. You can get out, Jonas!

875
01:07:10,318 --> 01:07:12,070
I'll get you out!

876
01:07:13,196 --> 01:07:15,073
How do I get out of here, Sis?

877
01:07:15,574 --> 01:07:16,450
Sis?

878
01:07:19,411 --> 01:07:21,538
Sis? Help me, Sis!

879
01:07:21,830 --> 01:07:23,957
Sis! Sis!

880
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:25,584
Sis!

881
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:26,835
Sis!

882
01:07:27,461 --> 01:07:29,755
Sis! Help me, Sis!

883
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:31,256
Let go of my brother!

884
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,382
Sis!

885
01:07:32,466 --> 01:07:33,967
No!

886
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,093
No!

887
01:07:35,177 --> 01:07:36,219
Jonas!

888
01:07:36,303 --> 01:07:38,555
- Sis?
- Jonas!

889
01:07:42,100 --> 01:07:44,311
- Don't…
- Sis!

890
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:46,605
- My brother.
- Sis!

891
01:07:46,688 --> 01:07:48,523
Help me, Sis!

892
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,609
- Jonas!
- Sis!

893
01:07:50,901 --> 01:07:53,069
- Jonas!
- Sis!

894
01:07:58,575 --> 01:08:00,285
- Luna!
- Ms. Tere!

895
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:01,828
Help me. My brother is trapped!

896
01:08:01,912 --> 01:08:04,539
Calm down. Think about what you should do.

897
01:08:04,623 --> 01:08:05,457
"Calm down"?

898
01:08:05,832 --> 01:08:06,958
They took Jonas.

899
01:08:07,042 --> 01:08:08,084
How am I supposed to calm down?

900
01:08:08,168 --> 01:08:10,045
Forget about your brother.

901
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,254
He's gone.

902
01:08:11,338 --> 01:08:13,840
Forget about my brother?
I could never do that!

903
01:08:14,508 --> 01:08:15,884
I love my brother so much!

904
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:17,469
He's my life!

905
01:08:17,552 --> 01:08:19,638
Then you shouldn't have left him before.

906
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:24,017
Listen to me.

907
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,602
The moment you stepped
through those gates,

908
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:27,896
they crawled inside your mind,

909
01:08:28,188 --> 01:08:30,440
your heart, your memories.

910
01:08:30,982 --> 01:08:32,192
They know about your friends,

911
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:33,735
your loved ones,

912
01:08:33,819 --> 01:08:35,111
they know about all of it.

913
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:38,824
- To defeat them, you need--
- A weapon.

914
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,326
A weapon against the devil.

915
01:08:43,245 --> 01:08:44,830
That's right, a weapon.

916
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:45,789
My Grandma should have some.

917
01:08:46,706 --> 01:08:48,917
Those monsters! I'll come back for them!

918
01:08:49,835 --> 01:08:51,628
Jonas!

919
01:08:51,711 --> 01:08:54,422
Don't hurt my brother! Jonas!

920
01:08:54,506 --> 01:08:56,132
Let me in!

921
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:57,717
Miss, what are you doing here?

922
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,010
- You're not supposed to be here, Miss.
- Jonas!

923
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:01,054
Jonas!

924
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,764
- Are you going to break that?
- Take me! Take me instead!

925
01:09:02,848 --> 01:09:04,683
- Miss, are you going to break that?
- Take me! Take me instead!

926
01:09:04,766 --> 01:09:06,685
Jonas who? There's nobody in there.

927
01:09:07,102 --> 01:09:08,061
This crazy woman.

928
01:09:08,562 --> 01:09:09,396
Hey, miss!

929
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:11,982
There's a policeman at the guardhouse.

930
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,066
Do you want me to call him?

931
01:09:13,400 --> 01:09:15,068
Go ahead! Go ahead and call him.

932
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,695
Let's see who gets arrested.

933
01:09:17,821 --> 01:09:18,655
Jonas!

934
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:20,407
- Jonas, come out of there!
- Chief!

935
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:21,825
- Jonas!
- Here she is.

936
01:09:21,908 --> 01:09:23,034
- Jonas!
- What's going on here, sir?

937
01:09:23,118 --> 01:09:24,160
- She wants to go in.
- Hang in there, Grandma.

938
01:09:24,244 --> 01:09:26,246
- I'll be back.
- Miss. She's holding a knife.

939
01:09:26,329 --> 01:09:28,248
Wait. Drop that knife!

940
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:31,251
Are you causing a scene? Are you high?

941
01:09:33,211 --> 01:09:34,379
Let go of me!

942
01:09:35,130 --> 01:09:37,257
You should be helping me.

943
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,093
Ms. Tere, explain it to them--

944
01:09:42,721 --> 01:09:44,848
There was a woman right here
pulling a cart.

945
01:09:46,308 --> 01:09:47,601
She saw everything.

946
01:09:47,684 --> 01:09:48,810
A woman? A woman with a cart?

947
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:50,812
You're standing there by yourself!

948
01:09:51,146 --> 01:09:52,439
You're talking to yourself.

949
01:09:52,522 --> 01:09:55,525
Sir, please help me.

950
01:09:55,817 --> 01:09:57,569
We need to save my brother.

951
01:09:57,652 --> 01:09:59,779
He was kidnapped
by the residents of that building!

952
01:10:00,405 --> 01:10:02,365
Wait, miss. Explain yourself.

953
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:03,408
Residents of what?

954
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:06,870
"Residents of what"?

955
01:10:06,953 --> 01:10:09,164
Of P77!

956
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:12,375
Why are you looking for P77?

957
01:10:12,459 --> 01:10:13,835
It's right there!

958
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,096
- I won't leave him there alone!
- I'll tell you what.

959
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,890
I have a street cam up there.

960
01:10:26,973 --> 01:10:28,433
It's turned towards the vacant lot.

961
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:29,768
We can take a look.

962
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:31,728
There you are.

963
01:10:31,811 --> 01:10:32,812
The last 48 hours.

964
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:38,777
See? I told you.

965
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,987
You were trespassing.

966
01:10:49,329 --> 01:10:50,997
<i>I've been there before.</i>

967
01:10:51,247 --> 01:10:52,791
<i>That place is dangerous, dear.</i>

968
01:10:54,292 --> 01:10:56,294
<i>They'll suck your mind out.</i>

969
01:10:59,965 --> 01:11:02,759
<i>Penthouse 7 on the 77th floor.</i>

970
01:11:07,430 --> 01:11:08,765
<i>Jonas, listen…</i>

971
01:11:08,848 --> 01:11:10,850
<i>What if I bring you to P77?</i>

972
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:14,896
Outfit check, fellow princesses.

973
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,775
Whoa!

974
01:11:19,275 --> 01:11:21,027
Come back here! You're a menace!

975
01:11:21,403 --> 01:11:23,238
This isn't the time to play.

976
01:11:23,571 --> 01:11:25,448
Your sister is here!

977
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:31,705
<i>Do you want this kind of life?</i>

978
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:33,373
<i>Forever?</i>

979
01:11:33,915 --> 01:11:34,833
<i>Is that even possible?</i>

980
01:11:35,417 --> 01:11:36,251
<i>Just be my wife.</i>

981
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,426
<i>Let me go. I'm not a part of this!</i>

982
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,219
Let me go. I'm not a part of this!

983
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:49,681
<i>You come to my house, you play in my bed,</i>

984
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:53,309
<i>and you expect nothing in return?</i>

985
01:11:54,853 --> 01:11:56,855
<i>Don't come any closer!</i>
<i>Don't come any closer!</i>

986
01:11:56,938 --> 01:11:59,149
Jonas, get down! Don't come any closer!

987
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:03,319
- Don't come any closer!
- Sis!

988
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:05,280
Jonas, get down!

989
01:12:07,490 --> 01:12:09,284
<i>Jonas, get down! Jonas, hurry!</i>

990
01:12:09,576 --> 01:12:12,620
<i>You're never getting out of here, Luna.</i>

991
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:23,214
<i>Sis, you know what,</i>
<i>all you have to do is wake up.</i>

992
01:12:23,298 --> 01:12:24,674
Life is just a dream.

993
01:12:26,593 --> 01:12:27,719
Where's Jonas?

994
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:30,180
Miss,

995
01:12:30,847 --> 01:12:31,973
it's just you.

996
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:38,646
<i>Sis! Help me, Sis</i>

997
01:12:39,481 --> 01:12:43,026
<i>Sis!</i>

998
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,530
We don't know where to bring her.

999
01:12:47,614 --> 01:12:50,867
- To the precinct or to Mandaluyong?
<i>- Sis!</i>

1000
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:55,080
- Maybe your boyfriend dumped you…
<i>- Sis!</i>

1001
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,376
- Come on, that's enough.
<i>- Sis!</i>

1002
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,961
But don't ever come here again, okay?

1003
01:13:05,548 --> 01:13:06,925
<i>Sis!</i>

1004
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,394
How will I get my brother back?

1005
01:13:24,984 --> 01:13:25,819
No.

1006
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:27,695
No.

1007
01:13:29,531 --> 01:13:30,990
Grandma? Grandma?

1008
01:13:31,825 --> 01:13:33,701
Grandma! Where do you keep your powder?

1009
01:13:33,785 --> 01:13:35,245
Your crystals and amulets, where are they?

1010
01:13:35,328 --> 01:13:36,871
Huh? Is it this one? Is this--

1011
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:38,540
Are these…?

1012
01:13:39,249 --> 01:13:40,250
Grandma, what are these?

1013
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,502
What else? It's salt.

1014
01:13:42,877 --> 01:13:44,671
Your grandma's a conwoman.

1015
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,422
Right, Grandma? But it's effective.

1016
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:55,473
What about Jonas?

1017
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,058
Hey, Luna.

1018
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:58,685
Pull yourself together.

1019
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00,687
You have guests.
You keep walking past them.

1020
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,939
They've been waiting for you.

1021
01:14:04,357 --> 01:14:05,191
Who?

1022
01:14:27,088 --> 01:14:27,922
You?

1023
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:32,468
You? You monsters!
Give me back my brother!

1024
01:14:32,886 --> 01:14:34,012
Luna!

1025
01:14:34,095 --> 01:14:39,350
Capt. Muhloch, Madam Apollon,
I am sorry to apologize with regrets.

1026
01:14:39,976 --> 01:14:43,563
Luna, they're your bosses on the ship.

1027
01:14:44,939 --> 01:14:47,734
Luna, I am so relieved to see you.

1028
01:14:48,026 --> 01:14:49,444
Come over here, my dear.

1029
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,158
What bullshit is this?

1030
01:14:56,534 --> 01:14:57,410
Captain?

1031
01:14:59,078 --> 01:15:00,955
You're the owner of the penthouse,
aren't you?

1032
01:15:01,956 --> 01:15:03,374
What penthouse, my dear?

1033
01:15:03,458 --> 01:15:04,417
Shut up!

1034
01:15:05,210 --> 01:15:06,502
"My dear, my dear!"

1035
01:15:06,586 --> 01:15:07,921
The penthouse!

1036
01:15:08,463 --> 01:15:09,756
P77!

1037
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:12,342
Is everyone going senile?

1038
01:15:12,717 --> 01:15:14,844
P77!

1039
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,815
P77!

1040
01:15:28,858 --> 01:15:30,735
Princhessa Chevron!

1041
01:15:31,861 --> 01:15:34,530
That's the insignia of our cruise ship.

1042
01:15:34,906 --> 01:15:35,740
Princhessa!

1043
01:15:36,282 --> 01:15:37,867
P77!

1044
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:39,535
I told you, Capt. Muhloch.

1045
01:15:39,619 --> 01:15:40,995
It looks like a seven.

1046
01:15:41,079 --> 01:15:42,163
Bad branding.

1047
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:45,500
Huh?

1048
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,543
What's the ship got to do with this?

1049
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:48,878
Why are you bringing it up?

1050
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:50,129
Look.

1051
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:54,092
This is our logo, my dear.

1052
01:16:05,853 --> 01:16:08,398
It does look like P77.

1053
01:16:10,275 --> 01:16:13,486
Look, we know you suffered
a great deal of trauma.

1054
01:16:13,987 --> 01:16:16,739
So you must have jumbled your perception.

1055
01:16:18,449 --> 01:16:19,284
See?

1056
01:16:25,248 --> 01:16:27,083
P77 is our ship.

1057
01:16:28,668 --> 01:16:30,461
Why can't you recognize us?

1058
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,381
We are your managers on the cruise ship.

1059
01:16:35,008 --> 01:16:36,551
Are you confusing us with someone else?

1060
01:16:38,136 --> 01:16:40,305
Oh, but we understand.

1061
01:16:40,847 --> 01:16:42,181
We really do.

1062
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:44,142
It was a terrible moment in your life.

1063
01:16:44,225 --> 01:16:45,101
Terrible.

1064
01:16:45,351 --> 01:16:48,146
It's understandable
that you suffer memory loss.

1065
01:16:54,360 --> 01:16:55,194
No.

1066
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,487
No.

1067
01:16:57,655 --> 01:16:58,614
You're not them.

1068
01:16:59,198 --> 01:17:02,035
Don't you remember?
I am the captain of the ship.

1069
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:11,377
<i>Capt. Muhloch!</i>

1070
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:14,339
<i>Say "Mabuhay!" to my brother Jonas!</i>

1071
01:17:17,467 --> 01:17:19,969
Madam Apollon,
I'm completely at fault here.

1072
01:17:20,053 --> 01:17:21,054
I failed to detect

1073
01:17:21,137 --> 01:17:24,599
her vulnerable emotional state
during the hiring interview.

1074
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:26,392
Of course, having said that,

1075
01:17:26,476 --> 01:17:28,978
the ship has no accountability whatsoever.

1076
01:17:29,437 --> 01:17:33,149
Because your trauma
stemmed from that call, isn't it?

1077
01:17:35,151 --> 01:17:36,527
<i>Are they having problems back home?</i>

1078
01:17:38,237 --> 01:17:39,072
Jonas?

1079
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:43,951
What is happening to you? Are you okay?

1080
01:17:44,035 --> 01:17:45,411
<i>I can't breathe.</i>

1081
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:52,919
Are they having problems back home?

1082
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:55,004
Yes, that phone call.

1083
01:17:55,254 --> 01:17:57,256
Captain, I was there when it happened.

1084
01:17:58,508 --> 01:17:59,675
Ms. Luna Caceres,

1085
01:18:00,009 --> 01:18:02,136
are you doing FaceTime during your shift?

1086
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:05,098
Chop-chop.
There's a lot of work to be done.

1087
01:18:12,605 --> 01:18:13,731
Don't answer that!

1088
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:16,067
Ma'am, I'm sorry. It's my brother.

1089
01:18:16,150 --> 01:18:17,402
Jonas, what is happening to you?

1090
01:18:17,485 --> 01:18:19,654
Are you having another asthma attack?
Where's Mom and Grandma?

1091
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,572
<i>Grandma went to the market.</i>

1092
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,116
<i>I'm alone in the house.</i>

1093
01:18:23,366 --> 01:18:26,202
Oh. Okay, okay.

1094
01:18:26,285 --> 01:18:27,453
I'll be right there, okay?

1095
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:29,956
Jonas, wait for me, okay?

1096
01:18:30,415 --> 01:18:31,374
Wait a minute.

1097
01:18:31,457 --> 01:18:32,542
How do I get to you, Jonas?

1098
01:18:32,625 --> 01:18:33,918
Jonas, wait for me.

1099
01:18:35,294 --> 01:18:36,712
Jonas, Jonas, talk to me.

1100
01:18:36,796 --> 01:18:38,798
Help! Help me, please!

1101
01:18:38,881 --> 01:18:41,259
My brother can't breathe,
he's in the Philippines!

1102
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:42,510
Jonas, Jonas.

1103
01:18:50,268 --> 01:18:52,437
Jonas!

1104
01:18:52,520 --> 01:18:53,980
<i>Sis!</i>

1105
01:19:02,113 --> 01:19:02,947
Jonas!

1106
01:19:03,489 --> 01:19:04,574
Wait for me!

1107
01:19:23,468 --> 01:19:24,886
Jonas is dead?

1108
01:19:26,637 --> 01:19:29,015
We all witnessed it over the mobile.

1109
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:32,393
But it must have been
infinitely more tragic for you

1110
01:19:32,477 --> 01:19:33,853
that's why you unknowingly erased it.

1111
01:19:37,231 --> 01:19:38,065
No.

1112
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:40,610
No.

1113
01:19:41,527 --> 01:19:43,321
Ms. Osang, I was just with Jonas,
remember?

1114
01:19:43,404 --> 01:19:46,491
Before I took him to P77,
you saw us together at home, didn't you?

1115
01:19:47,116 --> 01:19:49,785
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

1116
01:19:50,161 --> 01:19:52,413
That you talk to Jonas
as if he's still alive,

1117
01:19:52,497 --> 01:19:55,374
even though there's no one there.

1118
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:13,518
I promised I'd give it back.

1119
01:20:19,649 --> 01:20:21,943
<i>I only wish I could have given you</i>
<i>all that comfort.</i>

1120
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:23,486
Jonas, listen.

1121
01:20:24,111 --> 01:20:25,905
What if I bring you to P77?

1122
01:20:28,199 --> 01:20:29,992
My dear, it's very clear.

1123
01:20:30,451 --> 01:20:32,161
You had a nervous breakdown.

1124
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:33,788
Remember in the ship,

1125
01:20:34,288 --> 01:20:37,959
you had to be restrained
and sedated by Dr. Jack.

1126
01:20:41,629 --> 01:20:42,505
No.

1127
01:20:44,632 --> 01:20:45,967
I don't believe you.

1128
01:20:47,677 --> 01:20:49,053
You're lying to me.

1129
01:20:50,805 --> 01:20:51,847
Tere was right.

1130
01:20:52,431 --> 01:20:54,058
You got inside my head!

1131
01:20:54,559 --> 01:20:56,394
That's how you copied
my bosses' faces, right?

1132
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,312
You're conmen! Pretenders!

1133
01:20:58,396 --> 01:21:00,064
Give me back my brother!

1134
01:21:01,107 --> 01:21:02,525
We can't raise the dead!

1135
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:04,902
He died because you left him.

1136
01:21:14,579 --> 01:21:15,413
No.

1137
01:21:17,665 --> 01:21:19,709
Jonas ate bread from your refrigerator,

1138
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,044
that's how you gained power over him

1139
01:21:22,295 --> 01:21:24,255
and trapped him inside the penthouse!

1140
01:21:24,338 --> 01:21:25,298
Luna!

1141
01:21:26,591 --> 01:21:28,634
Ms. Osang, don't listen to them.

1142
01:21:31,387 --> 01:21:33,556
Wait, don't you have a son?

1143
01:21:33,889 --> 01:21:35,641
Right, don't you? That guy…

1144
01:21:35,725 --> 01:21:37,518
That guy who takes photographs
of the women you kill.

1145
01:21:37,602 --> 01:21:38,853
Where is he? Where is he?

1146
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:39,979
The women we kill?

1147
01:21:40,062 --> 01:21:41,105
You're way out of line!

1148
01:21:41,188 --> 01:21:42,189
Madam Apollon.

1149
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:46,235
Initially, it would've been
just the two of us here.

1150
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:49,739
But because I knew
it would be difficult to convince you,

1151
01:21:49,822 --> 01:21:53,034
your friend insisted on coming over,
so we brought him here.

1152
01:21:55,578 --> 01:21:56,454
Aji?

1153
01:21:58,164 --> 01:21:59,415
Aji Morales,

1154
01:21:59,790 --> 01:22:00,750
the waiter.

1155
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,765
Theo?

1156
01:22:17,683 --> 01:22:18,559
Luna.

1157
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,062
It's me.

1158
01:22:21,604 --> 01:22:22,772
Aji.

1159
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:24,940
We were a couple.

1160
01:22:26,484 --> 01:22:27,818
Don't you remember me?

1161
01:22:33,157 --> 01:22:34,492
<i>When your brother passed,</i>

1162
01:22:35,409 --> 01:22:37,745
<i>I told you to never give up.</i>

1163
01:22:38,454 --> 01:22:39,872
<i>I will be there for you.</i>

1164
01:22:40,748 --> 01:22:42,166
<i>But you insisted</i>

1165
01:22:42,875 --> 01:22:44,251
<i>that we break up.</i>

1166
01:22:56,180 --> 01:22:57,264
<i>The next morning…</i>

1167
01:22:57,807 --> 01:22:59,183
<i>Luna, if you remember,</i>

1168
01:23:00,226 --> 01:23:01,602
<i>you desperately wanted to jump.</i>

1169
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:25,418
Liar.

1170
01:23:27,086 --> 01:23:28,921
You're a liar! All of you!

1171
01:23:29,630 --> 01:23:31,090
What do you want? Are you here to kill me?

1172
01:23:31,841 --> 01:23:33,092
Luna.

1173
01:23:33,175 --> 01:23:34,218
Please listen.

1174
01:23:35,136 --> 01:23:37,054
We're not trying to do anything.

1175
01:23:37,138 --> 01:23:39,765
The only reason why ma'am
and sir came to see you

1176
01:23:40,391 --> 01:23:42,435
is to check if you can come back to work
on the Princhessa,

1177
01:23:42,768 --> 01:23:44,103
as a way to make up for--

1178
01:23:44,812 --> 01:23:45,646
Huh?

1179
01:23:46,105 --> 01:23:46,981
Go back there?

1180
01:23:47,064 --> 01:23:49,191
Back to P77 for what?

1181
01:23:49,275 --> 01:23:50,693
You're going to lock me up in there.

1182
01:23:50,776 --> 01:23:53,446
Play with me, then eat me!

1183
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:55,114
No! I won't let you!

1184
01:23:56,741 --> 01:23:57,867
Ms. Osang.

1185
01:23:58,534 --> 01:23:59,368
That's it.

1186
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:02,288
She has confirmed my worst suspicion.

1187
01:24:02,705 --> 01:24:05,207
Despite counseling and therapy,

1188
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,209
Luna is still not well.

1189
01:24:07,877 --> 01:24:09,670
But we do offer medical intervention.

1190
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:10,921
Wait.

1191
01:24:11,005 --> 01:24:13,549
What kind of medical intervention?

1192
01:24:14,508 --> 01:24:16,635
Dr. Jack, maybe we can help?

1193
01:24:27,438 --> 01:24:29,023
No, no.

1194
01:24:31,692 --> 01:24:32,526
Don't do this.

1195
01:24:37,031 --> 01:24:38,157
Stay away from me!

1196
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,366
Stay back!

1197
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:40,743
Stay back!

1198
01:24:40,826 --> 01:24:42,328
Don't come near! No.

1199
01:24:42,703 --> 01:24:45,331
Stay back! Don't come near!

1200
01:24:51,253 --> 01:24:52,755
Who are you?

1201
01:24:52,838 --> 01:24:54,507
What are you?

1202
01:24:56,592 --> 01:24:59,512
Before the first man was created,

1203
01:25:00,513 --> 01:25:02,056
we have been roaming the earth.

1204
01:25:03,015 --> 01:25:05,309
Before light was created,

1205
01:25:06,727 --> 01:25:08,479
we were here first.

1206
01:25:09,188 --> 01:25:10,189
We…

1207
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:14,068
are the Darkness to the Lord's Light.

1208
01:25:15,569 --> 01:25:17,780
We are the grandchildren of Nephilim.

1209
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,159
These faces we have on

1210
01:25:24,829 --> 01:25:27,414
were borrowed from your memories.

1211
01:25:29,458 --> 01:25:32,795
Looking upon our real faces
would rip you apart.

1212
01:25:39,802 --> 01:25:40,636
Luna.

1213
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:44,348
I'll send you back

1214
01:25:44,431 --> 01:25:45,307
to the Darkness!

1215
01:25:46,475 --> 01:25:47,393
Luna!

1216
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:55,025
I'm out of patience.

1217
01:25:56,277 --> 01:25:57,862
We have you now!

1218
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,262
<i>Sis!</i>

1219
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:24,555
<i>Sis!</i>

1220
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:26,515
<i>Sis!</i>

1221
01:26:27,057 --> 01:26:28,601
<i>- Sis!</i>
- Jonas?

1222
01:26:28,934 --> 01:26:30,352
Jonas! Jonas!

1223
01:26:30,436 --> 01:26:31,979
<i>- Sis!</i>
- Jonas!

1224
01:26:32,730 --> 01:26:33,647
<i>Sis!</i>

1225
01:26:34,899 --> 01:26:36,442
- Jonas!
<i>- Sis!</i>

1226
01:26:37,276 --> 01:26:38,736
- Jonas!
<i>- Sis!</i>

1227
01:26:39,737 --> 01:26:41,071
- Jonas!
<i>- Sis!</i>

1228
01:26:41,488 --> 01:26:42,823
- Jonas!
<i>- Sis!</i>

1229
01:26:44,325 --> 01:26:45,993
- Jonas!
<i>- Sis!</i>

1230
01:26:46,869 --> 01:26:48,495
- Jonas!
<i>- Sis!</i>

1231
01:26:48,579 --> 01:26:50,623
Jonas! Jonas!

1232
01:27:12,978 --> 01:27:14,104
Jonas!

1233
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,814
Jonas!

1234
01:27:16,649 --> 01:27:17,650
You're not dead yet!

1235
01:27:46,804 --> 01:27:47,805
Jonas!

1236
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:51,475
There's nothing you can do.

1237
01:27:53,102 --> 01:27:54,186
- There's nothing you can do.
- Let me go!

1238
01:28:16,417 --> 01:28:18,252
Jonas, where did you go?

1239
01:28:18,752 --> 01:28:20,963
Jonas, where did you go?

1240
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:24,842
Don't be like me. You have to fight!

1241
01:28:27,845 --> 01:28:30,264
They're feasting on your guilt,

1242
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:32,975
on your sin, on your pain.

1243
01:28:35,894 --> 01:28:37,479
What do I have to do?

1244
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,857
You have to face the truth.

1245
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:44,862
The truth?

1246
01:28:50,451 --> 01:28:51,493
The truth.

1247
01:28:59,960 --> 01:29:01,920
Help me, Jonas.

1248
01:29:20,272 --> 01:29:21,273
<i>Sis.</i>

1249
01:29:24,651 --> 01:29:25,486
<i>Sis.</i>

1250
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:28,030
I'm alone in the house.

1251
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,282
Grandma went to the market.

1252
01:29:32,076 --> 01:29:33,077
Jonas.

1253
01:29:35,037 --> 01:29:36,413
<i>Ah, Jonas.</i>

1254
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,415
<i>Jonas, what is happening to you?</i>

1255
01:29:38,499 --> 01:29:39,792
<i>Are you having another asthma attack?</i>

1256
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:40,918
<i>Where's Mom and Grandma?</i>

1257
01:29:42,002 --> 01:29:43,045
<i>Ahh…</i>

1258
01:29:43,128 --> 01:29:44,713
<i>Oh, okay, okay.</i>

1259
01:29:44,797 --> 01:29:46,298
<i>I'll be right there, okay?</i>

1260
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:48,300
<i>I'm coming home.</i>

1261
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:51,386
<i>How do I get to you, Jonas?</i>

1262
01:29:51,470 --> 01:29:53,347
<i>Jonas, wait for me. Ahh…</i>

1263
01:29:53,430 --> 01:29:55,307
<i>Jonas, Jonas, talk to me! Help!</i>

1264
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:56,809
<i>Ma'am, help me, please.</i>

1265
01:29:56,892 --> 01:29:59,269
<i>My brother can't breathe,</i>
<i>he's in the Philippines!</i>

1266
01:29:59,353 --> 01:30:00,729
<i>Jonas, Jonas.</i>

1267
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:03,857
<i>Jonas!</i>

1268
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:10,781
Jonas.

1269
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:18,997
I've come to accept it.

1270
01:30:29,299 --> 01:30:31,301
I accept that you're gone.

1271
01:30:37,182 --> 01:30:39,184
You don't have to wait for me anymore.

1272
01:30:43,105 --> 01:30:44,022
I accept your death.

1273
01:30:47,067 --> 01:30:47,901
Ate,

1274
01:30:49,111 --> 01:30:51,655
I know who God's favorite is.

1275
01:30:56,910 --> 01:30:57,744
Who?

1276
01:30:59,788 --> 01:31:00,622
Me.

1277
01:31:01,373 --> 01:31:04,126
Because He gave me a sister like you.

1278
01:31:07,004 --> 01:31:08,088
I'm lucky too,

1279
01:31:10,090 --> 01:31:12,968
because I had a brother like you.

1280
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:21,310
Go ahead.

1281
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:26,023
You can leave me now.

1282
01:31:31,111 --> 01:31:34,406
I love you so much.

1283
01:33:46,997 --> 01:33:48,248
Hello, I was wondering…

1284
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,876
Does Luna Caceres live here?

1285
01:33:51,376 --> 01:33:53,420
Luna, someone's looking for you.

1286
01:33:55,922 --> 01:33:57,007
Why are you here?

1287
01:33:59,426 --> 01:34:00,344
Well…

1288
01:34:03,138 --> 01:34:05,515
You weren't answering my calls.

1289
01:34:10,312 --> 01:34:11,646
I wanted to give you something.

1290
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:16,068
This is for you.

1291
01:34:18,945 --> 01:34:20,989
But it's okay.

1292
01:34:21,490 --> 01:34:25,994
I know you were busy with Jonas' funeral.

1293
01:34:30,165 --> 01:34:31,416
Thanks for this.

1294
01:34:34,336 --> 01:34:35,170
- I wanted to--
- I'm glad you--

1295
01:34:41,426 --> 01:34:42,552
Okay, let's make a deal.

1296
01:34:44,096 --> 01:34:46,098
Before you get back on the ship,
let's meet again.

1297
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,057
Sure.

1298
01:34:47,641 --> 01:34:48,517
I'd love to see you again.

1299
01:34:49,976 --> 01:34:50,811
Just promise me.

1300
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:53,063
You won't forget.

1301
01:34:58,402 --> 01:35:00,779
Mom, where do you keep disappearing to?

1302
01:35:04,783 --> 01:35:06,118
I'm always hustling.

1303
01:35:07,202 --> 01:35:09,496
I didn't know you were going

1304
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,331
to come home for the funeral--

1305
01:35:11,665 --> 01:35:13,750
Of course, I had to come home for him.

1306
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,300
I managed to borrow some money.

1307
01:35:23,093 --> 01:35:25,178
So the morgue released his body.

1308
01:35:26,054 --> 01:35:27,681
I had him cremated.

1309
01:35:29,599 --> 01:35:30,434
I know, Mom.

1310
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:39,025
I took out a loan

1311
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:41,194
and got him

1312
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:43,822
a unit at the columbarium.

1313
01:35:44,698 --> 01:35:45,866
It's beautiful, honey.

1314
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:47,868
He got the very best one.

1315
01:36:04,843 --> 01:36:06,011
Forgive me, Luna.

1316
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:09,806
Mom,

1317
01:36:12,058 --> 01:36:13,602
it wasn't anyone's fault.

1318
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:21,776
We just all dreamed of a better life.
