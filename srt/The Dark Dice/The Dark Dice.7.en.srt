1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,900
I’ll buy a ladder card
and get you to the floor above.

2
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:03,990
You will?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,010
I told you I wanted to help you win.

4
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:10,130
Aom didn’t show any signs of
interest in Mark before.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,200
Don’t you think that’s strange?

6
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:13,910
Where’s Mark?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,950
Game over.

8
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,700
Players can now leave the game.

9
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,100
Aom.

10
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:24,016
You made sure Mark was left behind
in the game, didn’t you?

11
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,760
Why would I do
what you accused me of doing?

12
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,900
Because you wanted to get back at me.

13
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:31,930
Pan.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,330
WELCOME TO OUR SCHOOL’S ANNUAL FAIR 1995

15
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,240
Here are some ropes and decorations.

16
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,370
Thanks.

17
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,150
You scared me.

18
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:54,100
Let’s play some music.

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,600
“What we feel inside.”

20
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,330
“Only time will tell.”

21
00:01:02,810 --> 00:01:05,556
Do you think our school is going to hire
some artists for the fair this year?

22
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,000
It would be amazing if someone famous
like Tao or Mos showed up.

23
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
Keep dreaming.

24
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,940
Those two are signed with different labels.
There’s no way they’ll show up together.

25
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,000
Aom, I think we need more fabric.

26
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:21,780
I’ll go find some more.

27
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,500
- Thanks.
- Help me with this.

28
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:34,900
- Aom?
- You okay?

29
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,800
What’s that dice?

30
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,760
There’s a weird pattern on it.

31
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,400
Why don’t you try rolling it?

32
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,260
Is the game dead set on killing us all?

33
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,500
Guys, look!

34
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:17,940
You alright?

35
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,000
I’m okay.

36
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,586
How are we gonna get out of here?
That thing is right in front of the door.

37
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,610
What should we do, Aom?

38
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,800
I have a plan, but…

39
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:31,740
But what?

40
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,700
We can’t all leave, Pan.

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,100
Someone has to stay behind.

42
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:43,600
The only way we can get out is
for someone to divert his attention

43
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,420
while the rest runs for the door.

44
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:46,890
But who will do that?

45
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,500
The slowest person right now is…

46
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,250
No! Pan is injured.

47
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,170
It’s too dangerous for her
to stay any longer.

48
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,700
Should we… vote?

49
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,190
I’ll stay.

50
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,876
But you guys need to take Pan to the
hospital as soon as you get out of here.

51
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,630
- No, Aom!
- I’ll buy you some time.

52
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Aom, no!

53
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:15,460
We’re only wasting our time
if we keep arguing!

54
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,700
You have to come with me.

55
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,700
Don’t worry about me.

56
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:21,300
I’ll wait for you to come back
and save me.

57
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:23,620
Once I get out of here,

58
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,470
you can make good on
that promise of yours.

59
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:34,980
Hey!

60
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,430
Run.

61
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,040
Pan!

62
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,700
Run!
Pan!

63
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,850
- Aom…
- You have to run!

64
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,650
Hurry up.

65
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,890
We need to go.

66
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:02,730
Let’s go.
Aom.

67
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,100
Come on.

68
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,190
- Aom!
- Let’s go.

69
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,900
Hurry up.

70
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,830
Pan, we have to go.

71
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Get in.

72
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:30,050
Pan is coming back for me.

73
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:31,410
Pan is coming back for me.

74
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,900
Pan is coming back for me.

75
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,430
Pan is coming back for me.

76
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,520
Pan is coming back for me.

77
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,400
Pan is coming back for me.

78
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,100
Pan is coming back for me.

79
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:58,250
Hey.

80
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,150
Hey.

81
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,370
Hey.

82
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,880
Easy! Easy!

83
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,800
Do you remember how you got here?

84
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,100
I don’t remember anything.

85
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,300
Next thing I know I was here.

86
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
All eight players, get ready for the game.

87
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,020
What day is today and what year is it?

88
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:33,500
It’s January 27, 2025.

89
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,800
Where have you gone, my dear?

90
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,400
Why aren’t you coming home?

91
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,680
I miss you.

92
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,840
Aom.

93
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,110
Mom.

94
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Mom.

95
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,800
I’m home.

96
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,990
Aom?

97
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,080
Aom.

98
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,650
It’s really you, Aom.

99
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,230
Aom!

100
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Aom.

101
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,450
- Mom.
- Don’t go away again, my dear.

102
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,000
I’m never leaving you again.

103
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,850
I promise.

104
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:07,050
FAMILY BEGS FOR DAUGHTER’S RETURN
FOLLOWING MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE

105
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:11,180
2025…

106
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,800
It’s been 30 years?

107
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,070
Pan?

108
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:50,850
Mom!

109
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,230
Yes, love?

110
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,100
Have you seen my shirt anywhere?

111
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,030
Your shirt? It’s where it always is.

112
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:56,730
“Mom”?

113
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,150
It’s over there.

114
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,450
You’re the student
who disappeared 30 years ago.

115
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,070
You meant to leave Mark behind
in the game to get back at her.

116
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,410
This has nothing to do with you.

117
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:37,470
It does.

118
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,200
Mark is our friend.

119
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:41,150
“Friend”?

120
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,650
Why don’t you tell these kids

121
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,300
how meaningless

122
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:51,980
something such as “friends” truly is?

123
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,360
You had no trouble leaving behind

124
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,000
the best friend who sacrificed
herself to save you,

125
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:00,050
without ever thinking about rescuing her.

126
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,480
Am I right?

127
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:02,810
That’s not true, Aom.

128
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,610
I never meant to leave you behind.

129
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,200
You can say anything now.

130
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,950
But you will never understand

131
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,460
how tormenting it feels
to be left behind all alone.

132
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:19,810
Yet I believed that you would
come back for me.

133
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,500
I believed you would never leave me.

134
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,900
How foolish of me to believe those words.

135
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:29,550
Aom.

136
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,600
I can understand your anger.

137
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,956
But Mark has nothing to do with this.

138
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,980
Well, my parents had nothing
to do with it, either!

139
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:41,340
Do you even know what I’ve been through
since I got out of the game?

140
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,500
I am now in a world
that’s been changed by 30 years.

141
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,010
It’s a world I don’t know anything about!

142
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I’m sorry.

143
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Meanwhile you,

144
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,200
my most beloved best friend,

145
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,750
are living your happiest life.

146
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,700
You have an adorable son.

147
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,600
Free of pain.

148
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,850
“Free of pain,” you said?

149
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,690
Yes.

150
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:32,200
Your sacrifice that day

151
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,820
saved everyone’s lives.

152
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,500
But it doesn’t mean no one lost anything.

153
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:45,600
I lost one leg, disabled for life.

154
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,400
The rest of our friends lived
with the nightmares of the game.

155
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,700
It wasn’t true that I didn’t think
about saving you.

156
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:59,350
I always wanted to go and save you, Aom.

157
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,990
I’m sorry.

158
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:06,000
You got to the hospital too late.

159
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,720
Your wounds were deadly
infectious down to the bone

160
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,600
I had no choice but to amputate
your leg to save your life.

161
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:15,430
I’m really sorry.

162
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,800
Doctor, when can I go home?

163
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,600
I promised my friend something.

164
00:13:25,950 --> 00:13:27,350
I need to save her.

165
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:37,850
Manus?

166
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:41,296
The doctor said I have to stay put
for the next few weeks.

167
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,250
Will you and everyone go and save Aom?

168
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,540
If we wait any longer, I’m afraid
Aom might be in danger.

169
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Pan.

170
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,760
I’m not playing that game anymore.

171
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,596
I can barely bring myself to think about
what happened that day.

172
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,000
Manus, did you forget who saved us?

173
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,150
Aom is waiting for us to come
and save her right now.

174
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,350
Aom is dead.

175
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,850
Do you really think she’d survive that?

176
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,630
Coward.

177
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,300
You’re a coward!

178
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,410
If you’re not going to do it,
give me the dice.

179
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,100
I’ll go and save her myself!

180
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,460
The dice is gone.

181
00:14:26,270 --> 00:14:27,270
What?

182
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,100
I’m here today to tell you I quit school.

183
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,690
I don’t think we’ll see each other again.

184
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
Hang on.

185
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,810
Friends don’t do this!

186
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:40,820
Manus, wait!

187
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,350
I’ve always carried with me
the guilt of what happened to you.

188
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:05,250
But I really didn’t know
how I’d come and find you.

189
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,320
Hello. Hello.

190
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,690
Please.

191
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,150
This is my missing daughter.

192
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,900
The best thing I could do…

193
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,490
MISSING

194
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,100
Excuse me.

195
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,020
Please. Excuse me.

196
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,350
Was to take care of your mother.

197
00:15:33,130 --> 00:15:34,130
Pan?

198
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
Let me help.

199
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,350
Please contact us if you find her.

200
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:46,740
Ten years had passed, and still
no one ever saw you.

201
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,700
Even I thought… you didn’t make it.

202
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,620
So I stopped looking for you.

203
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,980
I changed my name.

204
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,600
I started my life over.

205
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,900
But I never forgot about
what happened, Aom.

206
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Aom.

207
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:28,700
I’m only asking you for one thing…

208
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:33,400
Please, give me the dice.

209
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,650
I just want to save my son.

210
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,200
I’ll beg if you want me to.

211
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,210
Pan, stop.

212
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
Careful, ma’am.

213
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,170
Please.

214
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:53,050
Do you really think Mark is still alive?

215
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,000
Maybe he… didn’t make it.

216
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,600
You know how vicious this game can be.

217
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,270
Mark…

218
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,130
Ma’am.

219
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,260
Ma’am, please don’t overthink right now.

220
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:07,850
Aom made it out alive.

221
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,510
There’s a chance
that Mark is still alive, too.

222
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,056
We have no proof to the contrary.

223
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,080
There’s still hope.

224
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,620
If you want it so much, just take it.

225
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,860
Take it.

226
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,860
Aom.

227
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,100
Are you saying Aom is the student
who disappeared 30 years ago?

228
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,500
I think I understand how she feels.

229
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,540
Going through anything like that
would make anyone angry.

230
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,450
I don’t care how angry she is.

231
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
Mark didn’t deserve any of this.

232
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,290
How are we going to save Mark?

233
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,300
Mark’s mom wants to do it right away,

234
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:54,590
but I told her I needed to talk
to you all first.

235
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,300
The chances of rescuing him are
higher with more people.

236
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:01,770
So I’m asking you if you want
to help me save Mark.

237
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,910
I’m all in.

238
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,900
I want to save him,
but to tell you the truth,

239
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,400
this game really scares me.

240
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:10,780
I understand.

241
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,690
It’s undeniable how dangerous the game is.

242
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,650
There’s a chance some of us
might not make it out of the game.

243
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,530
But I feel like I am to blame.

244
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,950
I’m to blame for getting you involved in
the game to satisfy my own needs.

245
00:18:32,330 --> 00:18:35,750
So I feel that I owe it to Mark
to go and rescue him.

246
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,500
I feel the same way.

247
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,950
I asked Mark to play the last game.

248
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,900
So I should… take responsibility, too.

249
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,100
If you all think so…

250
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:51,090
Count me in.

251
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
What about the others?

252
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,360
I think it’s safe to say
Aom isn’t interested.

253
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,010
As for Benz and Don,

254
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,700
I texted them about this.

255
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,400
I don’t know what they want to do, though.

256
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,850
MAMAY: WE’RE GOING TO RESCUE MARK.
ARE YOU AND DON IN?

257
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:13,400
Hey, so it’s true that Mark went missing?

258
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,200
I saw his mom at school.

259
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,700
Yeah. I feel sorry for him.

260
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,400
Mark is so nice and kind, isn’t he?

261
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,560
He even taught me
how to play basketball once.

262
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,980
What’s wrong?

263
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,100
Mamay texted me.

264
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,010
They’re going to rescue Mark.

265
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,400
Don’t you think we should help?

266
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,860
What the hell for?

267
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,550
Mark got left behind by Aom.

268
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,400
It had nothing to do with us.

269
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:51,020
Did you forget we played a part?

270
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,140
Benz, what the hell did you do?

271
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,700
If he actually died in there,

272
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,600
doesn’t that make us murderers?

273
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,300
I think we need to save him.

274
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,500
Don’t try to be a hero, you fool.

275
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,810
What’s in it for us if we help?

276
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,770
DON’T FORGET ABOUT YOUR DUE DATE.

277
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,500
I’ll go back into that game like you ask.

278
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,020
You will?

279
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,760
Damn it!

280
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,340
Now that’s my best friend right there!

281
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:31,990
Amazing.

282
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,700
I’ll tell Mamay.

283
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,500
Pan isn’t coming today, dear?

284
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,250
You and Pan are always inseparable.

285
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,550
She’s busy today.

286
00:20:57,730 --> 00:21:01,100
You know, when you were away,

287
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,700
Pan always came around to see you, Aom.

288
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,900
She kept me company all the time.

289
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,550
Don’t worry, Mom.

290
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,150
I’m here with you now.

291
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,700
Let’s eat, shall we?

292
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,200
I’ll get it.

293
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,600
What do you want?

294
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
We’re going to play the game again
to save Mark tonight.

295
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:40,560
So?

296
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:43,000
Are you demanding I lend a hand?

297
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,180
No.

298
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,300
Mark’s mom wanted me to give you this.

299
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,300
She said you probably wouldn’t accept it
if she came here herself.

300
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,300
I understand you.

301
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,580
Anyone would be right to be angry
if they went through what you did.

302
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:08,820
I just don’t think revenge is the answer.

303
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,970
Of course, it is.

304
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,010
Then how come you don’t look
one bit happy with it?

305
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,430
Aom.

306
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:22,100
I don’t know what you
should do about this.

307
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:25,050
But I believe in you.

308
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,110
I believe that you will make
the right decision.

309
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
Pan.

310
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,900
Do you think this game can really
grant wishes like it promises?

311
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,930
I don’t know.

312
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:59,500
We have to collect four medals
before we find out, right?

313
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:03,100
But if it really does grant wishes,
what are you asking for?

314
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:05,330
I don’t know.

315
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,010
Maybe I’ll ask for a Walkman.

316
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:09,910
What?

317
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,860
That’s it?

318
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,500
Well, that’s all I want!

319
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,200
And you? What are you wishing for?

320
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,890
Hmm…

321
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:22,300
I’ll probably ask for some money.

322
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,130
My family is kind of struggling right now.

323
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,430
If I could ask for some money to help
my parents out, that would be great.

324
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:33,600
Then I’ll help you win the next game.

325
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,600
What about your Walkman?

326
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:39,280
Well…

327
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:41,900
You’re my best friend.

328
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:48,400
But don’t forget my Walkman
once you’re filthy rich!

329
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,390
How about this?

330
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,350
Let’s go and pick one out this evening.

331
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,710
I’ll take that as a promise,
and I’ll remember it.

332
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,050
Promise?

333
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,610
Promise.

334
00:23:58,970 --> 00:23:59,970
Are you sure?

335
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,800
And I won’t forget it, either.

336
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,090
Dearest Aom,

337
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,800
I don’t know if I’d ever get a chance
to give you this.

338
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:17,000
I’m sorry I couldn’t go back
and save you like I promised.

339
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,530
I really do want to make good
on my promises,

340
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:25,600
even if just one of them.

341
00:24:27,430 --> 00:24:29,400
Do you remember

342
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:34,200
how I said I wanted to ask for some money
if I could have my wish granted?

343
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:40,300
I know now that it’s not money I want.

344
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,300
If I really could make a wish,

345
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,800
it would be…

346
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,000
to be with you forever.

347
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:58,410
PANYADA

348
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:16,870
Hey.

349
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,800
Is Auntie seriously going to play?

350
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,800
She can barely walk.

351
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,360
Is she gonna make it in the game?

352
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:26,050
We’re all here.

353
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:28,200
Let’s just roll the dice.

354
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,680
Are you ready?

355
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:46,690
Hold on.

356
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,050
Aom.

357
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:52,500
What are you doing here?

358
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,700
I’m joining the game.

359
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,770
Don’t think this means I’ve forgiven you.

360
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,590
Are you sure about this?

361
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,600
I’ve made my decision.

362
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,200
You should wait outside.

363
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,380
Thanks.

364
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,760
I’m really sorry...

365
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,850
Save your apology for after the game.

366
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:26,340
I knew you’d come.

367
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,600
Just roll the dice.

368
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,050
Let’s get this over with.

369
00:26:57,990 --> 00:26:59,050
Mark isn’t here.

370
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:02,940
Aom.

371
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,400
Do you happen to know
where Mark could be?

372
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:06,630
I don’t.

373
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,100
The game is always changing.

374
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:17,400
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

375
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,100
where all your desires will come true.

376
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,230
We have no choice.

377
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,020
Let’s just play the game for now.

378
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,900
Players, get changed and
ready for the game.

379
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,250
There’s nothing around here.

380
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,410
No sign of Mark, either.

381
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,600
Nothing over here as well.

382
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:30,590
Guys.

383
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,660
Is the venue for this game
an amusement park?

384
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,200
Do you really think Mark is here?

385
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,050
Four stars?

386
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,296
This game must be more difficult
than all the previous games.

387
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,250
Escape Out.

388
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,300
All players are assigned as inmates
trying to escape from this amusement park.

389
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:58,580
Players must find keys and
gates to make an exit.

390
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,500
One key opens one gate.

391
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:08,600
Inmates must evade the Soul Keepers
whose job is to apprehend inmates.

392
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:14,500
If apprehended by Soul Keepers,
captives will be taken to the Test Center.

393
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:17,700
In case of more than one captive
being apprehended,

394
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,660
the captives will be put through
a Psychological Test.

395
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:28,100
If failed, the captive’s soul
will be confined.

396
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,620
Our soul will be confined?

397
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:31,260
The game completes

398
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,500
when inmates make a successful
escape within the time limit.

399
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,800
There is currently one captive.

400
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,570
Mark!

401
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:42,100
It’s really him!

402
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,600
Guys, we need to hurry up and save him.

403
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:49,540
Even if we can save him,
we still can’t leave this place.

404
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,850
We need to find the keys
and the exits first.

405
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,150
Guys.

406
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:59,070
I think you need to
take a look at this map.

407
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,700
Is this the park’s directory?

408
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,650
It seems there are seven zones.

409
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:11,220
Seven?

410
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,360
That’s gonna take us forever
to find the keys.

411
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:15,390
It’s likely that the keys
are hidden in each zone.

412
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:17,200
This is the closest one.

413
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,050
Let’s start here.

414
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,100
Are the keys really hidden here?

415
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:40,750
Let’s split up.

416
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,640
Guys.

417
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,000
Come take a look at this.

418
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,100
I think the key might be in here.

419
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,780
It needs a code.

420
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,170
How are we gonna find that?

421
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,320
There’s a sign over there.

422
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,500
It’s got something on it.

423
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,700
I think it’s the clues to the code.

424
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,900
These are different kinds of dinosaurs,

425
00:31:21,050 --> 00:31:23,290
and they happen to coordinate
with the ones in this room.

426
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,300
I think this is a puzzle for us to decode.

427
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,890
They’re degrees.

428
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
What do you mean?

429
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,740
Each dinosaur faces
in different directions.

430
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:44,800
I think it’s the degrees in which
the dinosaurs are facing.

431
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,390
How are we to know which direction
is which degrees?

432
00:31:52,790 --> 00:31:54,400
I got this with my uniform.

433
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,300
We have to find the direction
each dinosaur is facing in,

434
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:00,350
and replace the picture of
the dinosaurs with the numbers.

435
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,900
North likely indicates 360 degrees.

436
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,300
This one is facing east,

437
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,740
which is 90 degrees.

438
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,800
I’ll check out the one over there.

439
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
It’s north.

440
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:27,000
Guys, I don’t know
which direction this is.

441
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,120
What’s ‘W’ mean?

442
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:31,450
It’s northeast over here.

443
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:34,145
This one faces south.

444
00:32:35,619 --> 00:32:37,001
It’s north.

445
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,610
Now that we have all the numbers,

446
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,398
what do we do with them?

447
00:32:40,884 --> 00:32:42,302
This symbol indicates fraction.

448
00:32:42,850 --> 00:32:44,543
This one faces north, so it’s 360.

449
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,200
Divided by the one facing south,
which is 180.

450
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
That makes two.

451
00:32:48,994 --> 00:32:51,111
This is 270 divided by 90.

452
00:32:51,162 --> 00:32:52,162
Now we have three.

453
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,202
This is 360 divided by 45…

454
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,552
The code is 238.

455
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:20,496
Should we go straight to the next zone?

456
00:33:21,028 --> 00:33:22,028
Hold on.

457
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,162
I think the items we received
from the game

458
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:26,700
must be helpful in puzzle-solving.

459
00:33:27,699 --> 00:33:29,002
Did you all receive something?

460
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,099
I did.

461
00:33:34,604 --> 00:33:35,900
I got a whistle.

462
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,637
Are these things really useful?

463
00:33:44,130 --> 00:33:46,202
They seem… shoddy.

464
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,160
They’re definitely going to come in handy.

465
00:33:50,434 --> 00:33:53,254
I think each zone requires
different items.

466
00:33:53,989 --> 00:33:55,801
Should we split up, then?

467
00:33:56,360 --> 00:34:00,001
Kaen, Pie, and I will go to
the zones on the right.

468
00:34:00,428 --> 00:34:02,250
You guys go to the zones on the left.

469
00:34:02,804 --> 00:34:04,896
Send us a signal when you get the keys.

470
00:34:14,201 --> 00:34:15,296
I want you to keep it.

471
00:34:20,542 --> 00:34:21,542
Let’s go, bud.

472
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:26,019
Why did you give Mamay the key?

473
00:34:26,287 --> 00:34:27,767
Don’t you think she could betray you?

474
00:34:30,358 --> 00:34:32,198
Mamay came here to save Mark.

475
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,151
She has no reason to betray me.

476
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,395
Do you really believe that

477
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,820
everyone is here to save Mark?

478
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:47,780
I understand you find it hard to trust
after everything that happened to you.

479
00:34:48,746 --> 00:34:51,200
But I want you to give it another try.

480
00:34:53,042 --> 00:34:54,402
At least try to trust me.

481
00:34:56,754 --> 00:34:59,400
I promise I won’t betray you,

482
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:02,097
and I won’t abandon you like before.

483
00:35:06,045 --> 00:35:07,045
I’m sorry.

484
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:10,595
I can’t trust anyone anymore.

485
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:21,900
I think…

486
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,152
The key is in there.

487
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,325
Let’s go.

488
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,990
Let’s split up and look for it.

489
00:35:40,751 --> 00:35:41,997
Hey! Found it!

490
00:35:42,477 --> 00:35:43,477
Y’all!

491
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:50,001
Another code?

492
00:35:51,131 --> 00:35:52,331
It’s a 4-digit code this time.

493
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:02,330
I think it has something
to do with this box.

494
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,590
Don.

495
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,545
Ow, shoot!

496
00:36:29,817 --> 00:36:31,099
There’s something on the screen.

497
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:32,970
Is it the code?

498
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,000
I doubt it.

499
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,010
Did something appear on the screen?

500
00:36:55,623 --> 00:36:56,903
There’s an ‘O’.

501
00:36:58,788 --> 00:37:00,496
Now an ‘X’ just appeared right after.

502
00:37:03,637 --> 00:37:04,198
Let me see.

503
00:37:04,376 --> 00:37:05,496
It’s gone.

504
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:07,330
I swear it was on the screen just now.

505
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,080
Benz.

506
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,050
Can you sit on the horse in the middle?

507
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,669
You’re asking me to play this carousel?

508
00:37:18,594 --> 00:37:19,888
Fine.

509
00:37:26,062 --> 00:37:27,062
Now what?

510
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,053
It’s tic-tac-toe.

511
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,600
Don.

512
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,320
Sit on the horse at the corner.

513
00:37:42,048 --> 00:37:44,201
What? I totally didn’t have to
actually sit on it!

514
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:54,720
Aom.

515
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,190
Seven?

516
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,986
There are three other carriages
like this one.

517
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:12,820
We need to play tic-tac-toe
for four numbers.

518
00:38:14,090 --> 00:38:15,290
Let’s play the next one, then.

519
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:52,152
They’re Roman numerals.

520
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:53,797
From one to 12.

521
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:55,900
What are they for?

522
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:03,896
I think this clock will help us
solve the puzzle.

523
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Look.

524
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:27,397
This tells time.

525
00:39:28,146 --> 00:39:30,026
We must coordinate it to
the hands of the clock.

526
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,048
Mamay, you go to number three.

527
00:39:33,470 --> 00:39:34,551
I’ll go to 12.

528
00:39:35,602 --> 00:39:36,602
Okay.

529
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:42,198
Mamay, press the button.

530
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:48,302
Mamay. Kaen.

531
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,057
The numbers changed.

532
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:53,200
It says 19.55 now.

533
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
That’s seven and 11.

534
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:13,102
Kaen, the clock just went dark.

535
00:40:16,096 --> 00:40:16,804
Why?

536
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,410
Did we get something wrong?

537
00:40:23,305 --> 00:40:24,305
We didn’t.

538
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,880
Now there are only four numbers
with the lights on.

539
00:40:30,318 --> 00:40:31,398
That’s our code.

540
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,440
The game is easier than
I thought it would be.

541
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,050
I agree.

542
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:46,379
Don’t underestimate it.

543
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,680
You seriously can’t be too cautious
about this game.

544
00:40:58,765 --> 00:40:59,299
Oh?

545
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:00,500
There’s a parade.

546
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:05,220
Adorable.

547
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:23,910
Benz, watch out!

548
00:41:25,005 --> 00:41:26,005
Benz!

549
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,460
What the hell did you do?

550
00:41:33,862 --> 00:41:35,782
These must be the Keepers
the game told us about.

551
00:41:46,950 --> 00:41:48,355
They’re following
the sound of the whistle.

552
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:48,900
Aom.

553
00:41:49,207 --> 00:41:50,400
Go and warn Mamay’s group.

554
00:41:55,656 --> 00:41:56,134
Don.

555
00:41:56,256 --> 00:41:57,256
Hurry.

556
00:41:57,331 --> 00:41:58,331
Let’s go.

557
00:41:59,096 --> 00:42:00,096
Come on.

558
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:01,937
Let’s go.

559
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,303
Run! They’re the Keepers!

560
00:42:09,914 --> 00:42:10,454
Aom?

561
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:11,496
Run!

562
00:42:11,748 --> 00:42:12,499
Run away!

563
00:42:12,725 --> 00:42:13,725
Run!

564
00:42:31,368 --> 00:42:32,368
Samut!

565
00:42:35,057 --> 00:42:36,057
Where’s Aom?

566
00:42:41,469 --> 00:42:42,469
Aom.

567
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,296
You take care of Benz.

568
00:42:46,457 --> 00:42:47,457
I’ll go and save Aom.

569
00:43:13,447 --> 00:43:14,447
Mark!

570
00:43:14,555 --> 00:43:18,050
There are currently two captives.

571
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,080
Aom.

572
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:24,370
Aom.

573
00:43:27,216 --> 00:43:28,216
Mark?

574
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,601
How did you get here?

575
00:43:36,625 --> 00:43:38,598
The Psychological Test will now begin.

576
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:48,930
What the hell is going on now?

577
00:44:00,877 --> 00:44:01,877
Mark?

578
00:44:04,512 --> 00:44:05,512
Mark!

579
00:44:10,402 --> 00:44:11,402
Mark!

580
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,660
Mark!

581
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:28,702
The Psychological Test will now begin.

582
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:29,760
Mark!

583
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:32,346
His heart is still beating,
but he’s not responsive.

584
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,995
What exactly happened in there?

585
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:36,374
There is no place for you out there.

586
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:37,430
It’d be better if you stay here, Aom.

587
00:44:37,454 --> 00:44:38,454
Stay forever.

588
00:44:40,671 --> 00:44:41,697
What more now?

589
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:44,300
These must be the exits.

590
00:44:44,802 --> 00:44:46,423
One door for one player?

591
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:49,016
Does that mean someone
must stay behind?
