1
00:00:01,066 --> 00:00:02,903
Escape Out.

2
00:00:03,070 --> 00:00:05,647
All players are assigned as inmates

3
00:00:05,715 --> 00:00:08,099
trying to escape from this amusement park.

4
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,204
Mark!

5
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:10,742
Guys, we need to hurry up and save him.

6
00:00:10,819 --> 00:00:13,395
Even if we can save him, we still can’t leave this place.

7
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,105
We need to find the keys and the exits first.

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:15,752
Oh?

9
00:00:15,885 --> 00:00:17,011
There’s a parade.

10
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:18,401
Run! They’re the Keepers!

11
00:00:19,114 --> 00:00:19,617
Aom?
Run!

12
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:31,697
There are currently two captives.

13
00:00:31,742 --> 00:00:32,297
Aom.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,402
The Psychological Test will now begin.

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:54,700
Mark?

16
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:56,056
What?

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,097
Mark.
Aom?

18
00:00:59,380 --> 00:00:59,854
Aom!

19
00:01:00,871 --> 00:01:01,402
Mark.

20
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:03,598
Mark!
Aom.

21
00:01:04,471 --> 00:01:05,000
Mark.
Aom.

22
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,204
-Mark. -Aom.

23
00:01:08,617 --> 00:01:09,077
Aom.
Mark.

24
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:11,902
Aom.

25
00:02:05,228 --> 00:02:06,099
What’s that smoke?

26
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:49,982
Aom, no!
We’re only wasting our time if we keep arguing!

27
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:51,600
Run!

28
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,308
I’ll wait for you to come back and save me.

29
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:53,940
Aom!

30
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,352
We’ll go on ahead.

31
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,302
Manus?

32
00:03:08,651 --> 00:03:09,749
Guys, wait for me.

33
00:03:17,577 --> 00:03:18,102
Pan?

34
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:21,370
I promise.

35
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,349
Thanks for your sacrifice, Aom.

36
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,801
Pan, wait for me!

37
00:04:09,471 --> 00:04:10,050
Mark?

38
00:04:11,388 --> 00:04:13,502
Thank you for being the decoy, Aom.

39
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:20,297
There is no place for you out there.

40
00:04:20,662 --> 00:04:21,602
Just stay here.

41
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:22,798
Stay forever.

42
00:04:23,488 --> 00:04:24,798
You’ll die here with your foolishness.

43
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:33,921
Hold on! Wait for me!

44
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,002
Pan!

45
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:41,100
Run!

46
00:04:41,792 --> 00:04:43,801
There is no place for you out there.

47
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,354
Thank you for being the decoy, Aom.

48
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,802
The only way we can get out is for someone to divert his attention.

49
00:04:50,376 --> 00:04:51,303
Just stay here.

50
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:52,348
Stay forever.

51
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,702
Thanks for your sacrifice, Aom.

52
00:04:53,888 --> 00:04:54,671
-Aom! -Let’s go!

53
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,339
I’ll wait for you to come back and save me.

54
00:04:58,605 --> 00:04:59,296
Help…

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,422
Please…

56
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:19,656
No one is coming to save us.

57
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,297
You already know

58
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,604
how selfish people are.

59
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,946
So I have to accept it now…

60
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,647
Am I going to be stuck here again?

61
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,948
There is a way to put an end to this.

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,939
Take this,

63
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,902
and everything will be over.

64
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,047
You don’t have to go through it again.

65
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:23,682
Just stay here.

66
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:24,896
Stay forever.

67
00:06:25,037 --> 00:06:27,604
-Thanks for your sacrifice, Aom. -Thank you for being the decoy, Aom.

68
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,457
-There is no place for you out there. -Aom!

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,545
Aom!

70
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,607
Aom!

71
00:06:35,968 --> 00:06:36,417
Aom!

72
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:38,602
Aom!

73
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:43,499
Aom, are you alright?

74
00:06:43,911 --> 00:06:44,602
-Aom. -No!
No!

75
00:06:49,211 --> 00:06:49,748
Aom.

76
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:51,902
Calm down. It’s just me.

77
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,401
It’s me, Samut.

78
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:56,554
Take a deep breath.

79
00:06:57,745 --> 00:06:59,703
I promised I wouldn’t leave you behind, didn’t I?

80
00:07:02,915 --> 00:07:03,801
I’m here to save you.

81
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,345
Easy. Easy.

82
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:11,299
Samut, you jerk!

83
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,665
You want to take everything from me, don't you?

84
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:15,200
Mark.

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,696
I ain’t letting you do that!

86
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:17,801
Mark!

87
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:18,832
Mark! Get off him!

88
00:07:20,605 --> 00:07:21,146
Samut.

89
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:25,600
You and Aom are working together to leave me behind!

90
00:07:26,425 --> 00:07:28,140
You were trying to make me take some pill!

91
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,502
What’s happened to him?

92
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:33,404
The smoke in this room causes hallucination.

93
00:07:34,007 --> 00:07:34,500
Mark.

94
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,096
I’m here to save you.

95
00:07:36,265 --> 00:07:37,022
Get it together.

96
00:07:37,322 --> 00:07:38,783
How are we going to get him out of here?

97
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,597
Watch out!

98
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,090
-Mark! -Mark!

99
00:07:49,896 --> 00:07:50,500
Aom!

100
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:55,902
Samut!

101
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:30,554
Where’s Samut?

102
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:37,177
There are currently two captives.

103
00:09:01,545 --> 00:09:02,050
Mark.

104
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,748
The Psychological Test will now begin.

105
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,724
The smoke in this room causes hallucination.

106
00:09:25,605 --> 00:09:26,102
Mark.

107
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:31,001
Mark.

108
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:36,146
What are you thinking?

109
00:09:48,897 --> 00:09:50,099
This isn’t an exam.

110
00:09:51,028 --> 00:09:51,896
No need to be so tense.

111
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:54,897
What?

112
00:09:56,037 --> 00:09:57,654
You look like you’re staring at a ghost.

113
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,195
This isn’t real.

114
00:10:02,943 --> 00:10:04,179
You’re just an illusion.

115
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,854
This is impossible.

116
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,848
You need to learn to accept the truth, Samut.

117
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,995
Do you realize how long I’ve been sleeping because of you?

118
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:25,616
You think you have a right to do what you did...

119
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:28,490
because you’re superior, aren’t you?

120
00:10:31,986 --> 00:10:32,851
Did I strike a nerve?

121
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:35,402
You gonna punch me again?

122
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:41,001
You know damn well that what happened that day was your fault.

123
00:10:41,352 --> 00:10:45,133
And you should know nobody wants you around.

124
00:10:45,152 --> 00:10:45,823
Atom, you jerk!

125
00:10:46,382 --> 00:10:47,087
Call an ambulance!
You’re the worst!

126
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,054
This is exactly why no one wants to be your friend!

127
00:10:52,533 --> 00:10:54,305
You always act like you’re so much better than everyone.

128
00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,551
That look on your face…

129
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:01,294
I take it you’re aware of it.

130
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,297
How about this?

131
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:06,800
I’ll forgive you

132
00:11:07,844 --> 00:11:08,897
if you take this.

133
00:11:13,328 --> 00:11:13,995
Take it,

134
00:11:15,357 --> 00:11:16,499
and everything will be over.

135
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,097
Nobody wants you around.

136
00:11:22,727 --> 00:11:24,140
You’re the worst!

137
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:26,937
This is exactly why no one wants to be your friend!

138
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,797
Thank you, Samut.

139
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:31,700
No.

140
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,851
What you said isn’t true.

141
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:39,946
None of it is true.

142
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:44,500
I know you’re just jealous so you make things up.

143
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,777
There’s no place for you here.

144
00:11:48,035 --> 00:11:51,198
What you said then and even now, none of it is true.

145
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,451
You’re quite good

146
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,605
for keeping your wits about you.

147
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:01,850
I can’t say the same thing about your friend, though.

148
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,970
Of course, Mom.

149
00:12:17,802 --> 00:12:18,257
Mark!

150
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:22,186
Mark!
Mark!

151
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:24,822
Mark!

152
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:25,920
Mark!

153
00:12:34,342 --> 00:12:35,204
His heart is beating.

154
00:12:35,817 --> 00:12:36,300
Mark!

155
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,137
Mark, wake up!

156
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:39,137
Mark!

157
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:40,797
Mark!

158
00:12:41,902 --> 00:12:42,537
Mark!

159
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:46,201
The captive’s soul has been imprisoned.

160
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,448
Hey!

161
00:12:50,008 --> 00:12:50,800
Let me go!

162
00:12:51,066 --> 00:12:51,696
Help!

163
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,000
Can you hear me?

164
00:12:53,432 --> 00:12:54,050
Guys!
Where are you?

165
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,694
Time left in the game.

166
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,899
Can we really get out of here?

167
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,893
Of course, we can.

168
00:13:04,448 --> 00:13:06,020
We have the keys now.

169
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,001
We just need to save Samut.

170
00:13:08,903 --> 00:13:10,948
You saw what it’s like in there,

171
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,696
and you still want to go and save him?

172
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:16,697
The game isn’t over so this is no time to give up.

173
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:21,300
And I believe Samut isn’t going to give up, either.

174
00:13:23,657 --> 00:13:24,802
I’ll save him at all costs.

175
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:30,419
But how will we do that?

176
00:13:31,605 --> 00:13:33,699
Those Keepers can electrocute us with just one touch.

177
00:13:37,995 --> 00:13:39,614
Then we take care of them first.

178
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,238
Run!

179
00:13:51,669 --> 00:13:52,422
Hey! Over here!

180
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,552
Come at me! Come on!

181
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,588
Come here!

182
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:02,845
Mark?

183
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:04,595
Mark, stay with me.

184
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:05,334
Mark.
Mark.

185
00:14:06,404 --> 00:14:06,902
Mark.

186
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,608
Aom?

187
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,154
Kaen?
Hurry up.

188
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,613
Mamay and the rest can only buy us some time.

189
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:13,899
Alright. Let’s go.

190
00:14:20,303 --> 00:14:20,940
Guys!

191
00:14:21,914 --> 00:14:22,706
Over here!

192
00:14:29,891 --> 00:14:30,500
Put him down.

193
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:40,899
Mark!

194
00:14:41,195 --> 00:14:42,604
Mark, wake up, please!

195
00:14:44,029 --> 00:14:44,647
Mark.

196
00:14:45,312 --> 00:14:46,013
Mark.

197
00:14:46,499 --> 00:14:47,254
Mark.

198
00:14:48,241 --> 00:14:48,952
Mark.

199
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,048
His heart is still beating,

200
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:52,503
but he isn’t responsive at all.

201
00:14:53,274 --> 00:14:55,404
We saw his soul locked up somewhere.

202
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,497
It could be the prison cell in this amusement park,

203
00:14:57,557 --> 00:14:58,600
like the game said.

204
00:15:02,305 --> 00:15:03,699
That means Mark is alive.

205
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:07,497
What exactly happened in that room?

206
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,558
Take it.

207
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:16,453
Aom.

208
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,180
Did you get offered a red pill when you were in that room?

209
00:15:20,811 --> 00:15:21,401
I did.

210
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,093
Someone offered it to me.

211
00:15:23,434 --> 00:15:25,597
It disappeared when you barged in.

212
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,648
Do you remember what the voice said?

213
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,051
It said there would be a psychological test.

214
00:15:38,734 --> 00:15:40,602
I think that red pill is the test.

215
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:43,736
I saw Mark take the pill before he passed out.

216
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,948
His soul must be confined somewhere inside this place.

217
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:50,700
But how do we wake him up?

218
00:16:00,475 --> 00:16:01,801
We can still make a wish.

219
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:05,420
If we get out of here,

220
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:08,019
we can collect four medals.

221
00:16:10,595 --> 00:16:12,256
If the game really does grant wishes,

222
00:16:13,414 --> 00:16:14,801
we can still save Mark.

223
00:16:15,810 --> 00:16:17,148
Then we need to find all the keys.

224
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,851
Let’s split into three groups so we can work faster.

225
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,195
Aom and I will go to the train station zone.

226
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,268
Mamay and Kaen will go to the miniature city zone.

227
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:30,503
Don and Benz, you two take the haunted house zone.

228
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,002
Pie, stay with Mark to make sure you’re out of the Soul Keepers’ way.

229
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:41,470
Dude, stay close.

230
00:16:41,574 --> 00:16:42,207
Samut.

231
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,253
Don, I found it!

232
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,545
That’s our code!

233
00:17:01,555 --> 00:17:02,020
Hell yeah!

234
00:17:18,558 --> 00:17:19,902
Did you all get the keys?

235
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,395
This is the last zone.

236
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,499
Let’s go, shall we?

237
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:52,400
What are these doors?

238
00:18:14,601 --> 00:18:16,256
These doors must be the exits.

239
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:43,699
An exit has been unlocked with a key.

240
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:10,050
Two souls detected.

241
00:19:11,714 --> 00:19:15,777
Only one soul is allowed through each exit.

242
00:19:17,619 --> 00:19:19,300
So one exit for one person?

243
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,302
Doesn’t that mean only six people get to leave?

244
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:32,500
The game never meant to let all of us go.

245
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,810
Maybe there are more keys somewhere else?

246
00:19:34,968 --> 00:19:36,903
Don’t you see there are only six doors?

247
00:19:37,328 --> 00:19:38,622
Only six people will leave.

248
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,752
Does that mean someone has to stay behind?

249
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,401
It ain’t going to be me.

250
00:19:56,013 --> 00:19:56,650
Guys.

251
00:19:59,099 --> 00:20:00,600
Will you agree to let Mamay leave first?

252
00:20:02,346 --> 00:20:03,500
Why her?

253
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,296
Mamay has three medals right now.

254
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,050
She has the highest chance of collecting four medals.

255
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:12,200
And you would be the next to leave, is that right?

256
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,697
Since you also have three medals.

257
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:20,202
Devious bastard.

258
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,497
You’re only playing the leader act just so you get the most out of this.

259
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:33,096
It’s not Samut’s fault that there are only six doors here.

260
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,201
We all got here because of his plan.

261
00:20:43,302 --> 00:20:44,600
Do you have a better idea?

262
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:48,896
Don.

263
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,051
I agree with Samut.

264
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:55,656
He saved me from the Soul Keepers and saved our butts all through the game.

265
00:20:57,198 --> 00:20:58,254
I believe in him.

266
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,244
I’m okay with his plan.

267
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:02,374
Me, too.

268
00:21:07,149 --> 00:21:08,497
Fine, then.

269
00:21:16,114 --> 00:21:17,496
This is the best way.

270
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:32,897
Now we have five keys and six people.

271
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,377
What are you gonna do?

272
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,503
Hold on.

273
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,151
There’s something I want to try.

274
00:22:01,182 --> 00:22:02,900
Are these really the exits?

275
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,703
Samut, are you sure about this?

276
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:14,900
An exit has been unlocked with a key.

277
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:23,700
Holy crap!

278
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:25,800
Mark got through.

279
00:22:30,511 --> 00:22:31,897
What does that mean?

280
00:22:33,943 --> 00:22:36,900
Mamay could take Mark with her.

281
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:39,848
This means that those whose souls are imprisoned can still leave.

282
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:43,302
What are you saying exactly?

283
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,754
If one of us agrees to have their soul taken away,

284
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,102
we can all leave.

285
00:22:54,137 --> 00:22:56,776
We will then use Mamay’s wish to put the souls back into their bodies.

286
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,648
Who will agree to that?

287
00:23:04,223 --> 00:23:04,797
I will.

288
00:23:06,567 --> 00:23:10,700
But in order for that to happen, two people have to be captured.

289
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,801
I’m asking one of you to come with me.

290
00:23:25,032 --> 00:23:25,696
I’ll do it.

291
00:23:28,137 --> 00:23:28,910
Are you sure about this?

292
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,152
This is no time to be rational.

293
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:32,398
Let’s just go.

294
00:23:42,231 --> 00:23:43,700
There are no Soul Keepers here at all.

295
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:44,841
We’ll have to wait.

296
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,045
Aom.

297
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,050
Do you still have that handkerchief?

298
00:24:04,949 --> 00:24:07,598
When the test begins, cover your nose with the handkerchief

299
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,419
so you don’t inhale the smoke.

300
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,700
I’ll quickly take that red pill.

301
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:19,650
Okay.

302
00:24:25,899 --> 00:24:27,002
Are you sure you’re alright?

303
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:36,248
Aom.

304
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:39,062
Can I ask you something?

305
00:24:44,297 --> 00:24:47,102
Why did you agree to be captured again?

306
00:24:52,727 --> 00:24:53,700
Earlier…

307
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,094
Desperation got the better of me.

308
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:01,200
I was honestly going to take that red pill.

309
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,499
But right when I was at my darkest,

310
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,402
you barged through that door to save me.

311
00:25:16,136 --> 00:25:17,300
That promise of yours

312
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:21,899
made me feel like I could trust again.

313
00:25:27,428 --> 00:25:28,100
Thank you.

314
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,503
I hope I can get out of this place with the wish we’re going to make.

315
00:25:47,048 --> 00:25:47,897
Honestly,

316
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,201
if you didn’t have to save me and Mark,

317
00:25:52,635 --> 00:25:53,899
what would your wish be?

318
00:26:01,635 --> 00:26:03,425
I would wish to turn back time, I guess.

319
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,302
So I never played this game in the first place.

320
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,602
That would be too bad.

321
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:15,703
What do you mean?

322
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,654
If that was the case,

323
00:26:22,671 --> 00:26:23,797
I wouldn’t see you again.

324
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:30,800
Samut!

325
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:32,654
The Soul Keepers are here.

326
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,146
Samut.

327
00:27:01,041 --> 00:27:01,601
Samut!

328
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:03,635
Samut.

329
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:04,748
Samut.

330
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,699
Are you alright?

331
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:19,247
The Psychological Test will now begin.

332
00:27:49,223 --> 00:27:49,688
Aom.

333
00:27:50,874 --> 00:27:52,995
Do you think the game really will give me back my soul?

334
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:56,482
If I don’t get out of here, will you please tell my parents...

335
00:27:56,502 --> 00:27:57,630
You will be alright.

336
00:27:59,515 --> 00:28:00,497
Believe me.

337
00:28:09,851 --> 00:28:12,700
I believe in you to save me.

338
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,453
Samut.

339
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:20,816
Aom?

340
00:28:20,877 --> 00:28:22,103
That promise of yours

341
00:28:22,672 --> 00:28:24,601
made me feel like I could trust again.

342
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:25,191
Samut.

343
00:28:26,023 --> 00:28:26,579
Samut.
Samut!

344
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:28,794
Aom, where are you?

345
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:29,389
Aom.

346
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:30,998
Aom.

347
00:28:32,991 --> 00:28:33,897
Where are you?

348
00:28:35,234 --> 00:28:35,797
Aom.

349
00:28:37,105 --> 00:28:38,269
What are you doing, Samut?

350
00:28:43,727 --> 00:28:44,302
I…

351
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,377
I thought you…

352
00:28:47,709 --> 00:28:48,497
What?

353
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,201
I thought you forgot our plan

354
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,100
for me to take the pill.

355
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,051
I see.

356
00:29:04,546 --> 00:29:05,204
Take it.

357
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,017
…and everything will be over.

358
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:12,771
Where did you get this?

359
00:29:18,177 --> 00:29:19,299
You’re not Aom.

360
00:29:21,641 --> 00:29:24,995
I can’t believe you got away twice.

361
00:29:36,445 --> 00:29:36,928
Aom!

362
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:38,752
Aom!

363
00:29:41,081 --> 00:29:42,149
Aom, spit it out.

364
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:42,900
Aom!

365
00:29:43,462 --> 00:29:43,942
Aom!

366
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:51,200
Aom.

367
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:52,454
Aom!

368
00:29:56,194 --> 00:29:57,103
I promise…

369
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,197
I’ll get you out of here.

370
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,540
Samut!

371
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:06,997
Hurry up!

372
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:11,010
Let’s go.

373
00:30:12,823 --> 00:30:14,087
Samut, the Soul Keepers!

374
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:21,638
Hurry up!

375
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,840
Pie, catch up!
Hurry up!

376
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,002
Keep going!

377
00:30:33,106 --> 00:30:34,148
They’re right behind us.

378
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,148
We’re almost there.

379
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:48,700
Hurry up.

380
00:30:58,442 --> 00:30:59,051
Hold it!

381
00:31:02,062 --> 00:31:02,740
Keep pushing!

382
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:04,800
Guys, hold the doors!

383
00:31:11,081 --> 00:31:13,300
Pie, go and unlock every door.

384
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,850
An exit has been unlocked with a key.

385
00:31:29,942 --> 00:31:30,745
Got it!

386
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,097
Go on ahead!

387
00:31:40,109 --> 00:31:41,302
Kaen, now you go.

388
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:42,248
Take Aom with you.

389
00:31:52,982 --> 00:31:54,000
Keep pushing!

390
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:56,253
Push!

391
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,222
I don’t think we can hold it any longer.

392
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,071
Let’s just go.

393
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,958
We’ll run together on my count.

394
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:06,509
Right!

395
00:32:07,505 --> 00:32:08,005
One.

396
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:11,361
Two.

397
00:32:13,437 --> 00:32:13,899
Three.

398
00:32:36,813 --> 00:32:37,400
Samut!

399
00:32:50,899 --> 00:32:51,755
Don, my dude!

400
00:32:52,432 --> 00:32:53,300
We’re alive!

401
00:32:55,136 --> 00:32:56,152
We made it!

402
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:00,100
We all made it out of the game.

403
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,773
But…

404
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,505
Game over.

405
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,251
The inmates have made a successful escape within the time limit.

406
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,948
The inmates won, and will receive one medal each.

407
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,200
Samut.

408
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,954
You should be the one making that wish.

409
00:34:45,318 --> 00:34:47,697
Player has collected four medals.

410
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:50,546
State your desire.

411
00:34:55,430 --> 00:35:00,398
I wish for the captured souls in the game to come back to these bodies.

412
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,103
Your wish has been granted.

413
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:28,800
Mark.

414
00:35:29,712 --> 00:35:31,106
Mark is awake, guys!

415
00:35:34,202 --> 00:35:35,300
Are you alright, Mark?

416
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:36,945
Aom.

417
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:38,602
Aom.

418
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:46,202
Easy.

419
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:48,000
Easy, Aom. It’s just me.

420
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,247
Aom.

421
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,995
I saved you like I promised.

422
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,797
Let’s go.

423
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:20,300
The game concludes when a wish is granted.

424
00:36:24,838 --> 00:36:26,651
What does that mean?

425
00:36:33,685 --> 00:36:34,900
What the hell is going on now?

426
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:40,798
Game over.

427
00:36:41,077 --> 00:36:43,265
Game over.

428
00:37:04,773 --> 00:37:07,460
We’re back to school, aren’t we?

429
00:37:13,048 --> 00:37:13,601
Mark?

430
00:37:15,037 --> 00:37:15,697
Mom!

431
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:24,398
Mom.

432
00:37:28,152 --> 00:37:28,699
Mom.

433
00:37:33,805 --> 00:37:34,300
Aom.

434
00:37:35,312 --> 00:37:36,402
Thank you.

435
00:38:05,857 --> 00:38:08,891
So you’re the only one who got to make a wish.

436
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:15,656
Maybe that’s for the best.

437
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,703
No one has to risk their lives like we did again.

438
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,352
Let’s go home, then.

439
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,059
Good luck.

440
00:39:00,065 --> 00:39:00,696
Bye.

441
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:07,968
After the game was over, everything went back to normal.

442
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:14,297
It’s like the whole thing never happened.

443
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,897
But even when it feels as if nothing happened,

444
00:39:20,838 --> 00:39:23,897
we all know deep down what we went through.

445
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,362
We learned that…

446
00:39:30,475 --> 00:39:31,386
We have a quiz this afternoon.

447
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,628
There are things so minor compared to what we’ve faced.

448
00:39:34,731 --> 00:39:35,700
Good morning, Samut.

449
00:39:38,511 --> 00:39:39,062
Here.

450
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,090
That’s the sheet cheat for Social Studies.

451
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:43,386
There’s a quiz this afternoon.

452
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,334
Wow.

453
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,749
Thanks.

454
00:39:48,208 --> 00:39:52,503
We also learned… who we can trust.

455
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,657
Someone who’s there to push us towards our goals.

456
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:57,903
Amazing!

457
00:39:58,622 --> 00:39:59,970
Well done, bud.

458
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:09,751
You tired?

459
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:10,600
Exhausted.

460
00:40:11,188 --> 00:40:12,051
You can do it.

461
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:13,900
It’s best for everyone

462
00:40:16,466 --> 00:40:18,383
now that everything is back to normal.

463
00:40:22,349 --> 00:40:23,059
…Isn’t it?

464
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,410
Aom.

465
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,848
Are you here to enroll?

466
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,251
There are so many things I have to learn.

467
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:55,151
You want me to add ‘going back to school’ to the list?

468
00:40:57,670 --> 00:40:58,998
How are you adjusting?

469
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,346
It’s been difficult.

470
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,945
I didn’t think the outside world would change so much over the years.

471
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,647
What about you?

472
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:10,200
Are you also adjusting?

473
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:13,942
To this school?

474
00:41:15,635 --> 00:41:18,699
To living an unexciting life, unlike in the game.

475
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,548
What are you asking?

476
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,417
You said you didn’t want to get involved with that game anymore.

477
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,611
Aom would say that, wouldn’t she?

478
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,552
What do you mean?

479
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,251
You made a wish, didn’t you?

480
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:53,105
You wish for the captured souls in the game…

481
00:41:53,389 --> 00:41:55,099
…to come back to these bodies.

482
00:41:59,902 --> 00:42:05,600
Did you really think there are only two souls stuck in that game?

483
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:20,096
Thanks to you I’m back in this world.

484
00:42:22,013 --> 00:42:22,890
Who exactly are you?

485
00:42:32,885 --> 00:42:33,400
Aom.

486
00:42:35,645 --> 00:42:36,194
Aom!
