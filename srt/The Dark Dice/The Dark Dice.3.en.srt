1
00:00:00,352 --> 00:00:02,977
You are assigned as an Accomplice.

2
00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:06,836
I saw you put your hand in your pocket,
doing nobody knows what.

3
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:07,973
How dare you fool me, Benz?

4
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:09,287
I’m just following the rules of the game.

5
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:10,807
You’re the spy, aren’t you?

6
00:00:11,152 --> 00:00:12,152
Pie.

7
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:14,725
The Detectives won.

8
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,379
- Yes!
- Damn it!

9
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:16,755
You helped us win that game.

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,499
I want everyone to see
that good side of you that I see, too.

11
00:00:20,171 --> 00:00:21,171
I’m sorry,

12
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,102
but I also want to play.

13
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:36,860
I’m sorry,

14
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:39,500
but I also want to play.

15
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:45,601
The second that dice hit the ground,

16
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,600
I realized that...

17
00:00:48,485 --> 00:00:52,305
there are still things
science can’t prove.

18
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:51,297
I used to believe that everything
can be proven by science.

19
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,733
Observe, formulate a hypothesis,

20
00:01:55,238 --> 00:01:56,918
conduct an experiment, and gain knowledge.

21
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,977
This is how you understand things
and get the correct answers.

22
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,170
FIRST PLACE WINNER
150,000 BAHT

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,290
GLASSES/FLUKE/CHEAT

24
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:10,711
Wow.

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,404
Didn’t you win a hundred grand?

26
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:14,376
- You wouldn’t mind sharing it, would ya?
- Yeah, man, come on.

27
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:15,407
I don’t have it.

28
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
You don’t?

29
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,300
Show us!

30
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,680
What are you doing?

31
00:02:23,072 --> 00:02:24,072
Nothing.

32
00:02:28,493 --> 00:02:29,503
Are you alright?

33
00:02:54,605 --> 00:02:55,650
What’s this?

34
00:02:56,688 --> 00:02:58,776
It’s a binary code.

35
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:00,982
Each line refers to an English alphabet.

36
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,860
When you put it together,
it spells my name.

37
00:03:02,931 --> 00:03:05,260
Well, the first line is an N.

38
00:03:05,408 --> 00:03:06,653
The next is A.

39
00:03:07,002 --> 00:03:08,002
Then, T.

40
00:03:08,274 --> 00:03:09,299
- I see.
- D...

41
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:10,518
You’re Natdanai.

42
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,320
You just represented our school
and won a competition, didn’t you?

43
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,808
You’re so amazing.

44
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,020
You were up against so many schools, too.

45
00:03:17,911 --> 00:03:21,300
Science would explain
that the sensation occurred here

46
00:03:21,714 --> 00:03:23,863
is a result of a release
of chemicals in the brain.

47
00:03:25,616 --> 00:03:31,008
But it still doesn’t help me understand
my own feelings that day.

48
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:34,700
For the student president election,

49
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:39,204
please present your student ID
in order to vote.

50
00:03:40,182 --> 00:03:43,102
Every student has one vote.

51
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,079
STUDENT COUNCIL
PRESIDENT ELECTION

52
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,360
DO YOU WANT TO VOTE
FOR NUMBER 1?

53
00:03:48,167 --> 00:03:49,167
Kaen.

54
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,505
Can I see the current results?

55
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,840
Thanks, Kaen.

56
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,180
Look.

57
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,557
This can’t be right.

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,169
40% MAI / 27.9% MAMAY

59
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,410
40.1% MAI

60
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,902
I’m going to the restroom.

61
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,699
I–I voted for you, Mamay.

62
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,820
It might seem like you’re falling behind
on the scoreboard,

63
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,702
but I believe you’ll turn the table
and win at the end.

64
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,703
Thank you, Kaen.

65
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
CONGRATULATIONS,
THE NEW STUDENT PRESIDENT, MAMAY

66
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,127
You won!

67
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,087
You won, Mamay!

68
00:05:40,819 --> 00:05:41,819
Mamay.

69
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,402
Are we… back in the game, Kaen?

70
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:54,272
I’m sorry.

71
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:56,404
If it wasn’t for me,

72
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,980
you wouldn’t be back in this game.

73
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,930
KAEN: MAMAY, HELP.
DON IS TAKING ME TO THE OLD GYMNASIUM.

74
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,105
I have to go.

75
00:06:05,491 --> 00:06:06,602
Something came up.

76
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:17,377
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

77
00:06:17,426 --> 00:06:19,725
where all your desires will come true.

78
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,050
We really are back in the game!

79
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,102
I’m not losing this time around, bud.

80
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:31,859
Why did you roll the dice?

81
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,342
I just want to know more about this game.

82
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,835
Then play on your own.

83
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,920
Why did you have to drag
other people along with you?

84
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,854
Why are you so mad at me?

85
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:44,703
You said it yourself.

86
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:46,970
It’s all just a game.

87
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,900
Unless there is something more to it.

88
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,405
Please stop arguing, you guys.

89
00:06:58,106 --> 00:07:00,407
We need to find a way out of this game.

90
00:07:06,768 --> 00:07:07,768
Guys.

91
00:07:08,114 --> 00:07:09,114
Look.

92
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,540
Does anyone else have their medal?

93
00:08:16,442 --> 00:08:19,400
Medal placement does not meet
the requirement.

94
00:08:21,274 --> 00:08:22,274
What does that mean?

95
00:08:25,835 --> 00:08:27,802
I think our medals are different,

96
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,777
as you can see from
the difference in colors here.

97
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,402
We might need to insert
medals of the same color.

98
00:08:36,955 --> 00:08:38,305
What will happen...

99
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,550
when it’s all one color?

100
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,697
Do you remember what was said
at the beginning of the game?

101
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:52,305
The voice said, “the game of wits,

102
00:08:53,254 --> 00:08:55,705
where all your desires will come true.”

103
00:08:56,277 --> 00:08:58,097
“Where all your desires will come true.”

104
00:08:59,345 --> 00:09:00,825
Do you believe in such a thing, Kaen?

105
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,256
I mean, I know it’s unlikely…

106
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,762
But if this game really does grant wishes,

107
00:09:07,337 --> 00:09:08,857
it seems like fun to play, doesn’t it?

108
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,253
The only way to find out is to prove it.

109
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,900
One thing is confirmed:

110
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:17,705
This game is real.

111
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,108
But whether anything else is,

112
00:09:20,782 --> 00:09:22,422
we need to play ’til the end to find out.

113
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:27,133
Let’s put our heads together
and complete this game.

114
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
Bold of you to say.

115
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,510
You were the first to get eliminated
in the last game.

116
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,402
Just don’t slow anyone down this time.

117
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,136
All eight players, get ready for the game.

118
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,802
Mark, isn’t this the school’s courtyard?

119
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,151
There are some cards over here.

120
00:10:39,782 --> 00:10:42,890
The Skyscraping Stone Pillars.

121
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,899
Players are assigned as worshippers

122
00:10:47,074 --> 00:10:50,200
who are devoted to building
stone pillars to honor the Gods.

123
00:10:50,973 --> 00:10:55,143
Each player is given a “box”
representing a stone pillar,

124
00:10:55,161 --> 00:10:57,453
which is five squares in width.

125
00:10:57,789 --> 00:11:01,100
Players must bid for pieces
to fill their box

126
00:11:01,179 --> 00:11:03,410
in an attempt to build
the tallest stone pillar.

127
00:11:04,054 --> 00:11:05,500
So it’s an auction?

128
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:11,109
Each player will receive an initial
of eight credits for bidding.

129
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,875
There will be eight rounds of auction.

130
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:17,392
Each round offers four pieces.

131
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,170
These pieces are made up of 5-7 squares.

132
00:11:23,179 --> 00:11:27,801
Bidding will be done in a closed auction
in a private room.

133
00:11:28,297 --> 00:11:32,059
Players can access their private room
with the card they receive.

134
00:11:32,528 --> 00:11:35,506
Players’ credit history
will be saved on their card.

135
00:11:36,026 --> 00:11:38,770
When a piece is won from the bidding,

136
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:42,201
players must add the piece
to their box from the top.

137
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:46,586
Players can rotate the piece
to fit in the box.

138
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:49,280
It’s just like Tetris.

139
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:56,037
Pieces may exceed the box
on the left and right.

140
00:11:56,250 --> 00:12:01,259
The squares that exceed the box will be
put up for auction in the next round.

141
00:12:01,557 --> 00:12:05,694
One row is formed when all five squares
are filled horizontally.

142
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:10,004
Players must build three rows
to complete the game.

143
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:14,604
The player with the most rows
wins the game.

144
00:12:15,336 --> 00:12:17,445
At the end of all eight rounds of auction,

145
00:12:17,503 --> 00:12:20,100
if there are players with
the same amount of rows,

146
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:24,002
the player with more squares wins.

147
00:12:24,727 --> 00:12:27,841
May the first round of auction begin.

148
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:33,205
Did the game start already?

149
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,401
Before we begin…

150
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,800
Anyone understands any of that?

151
00:12:42,568 --> 00:12:43,857
I don’t get shit.

152
00:12:44,007 --> 00:12:47,202
Everyone must bid in an auction
for the pieces to fill their own box.

153
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,004
Do you understand what an auction is?

154
00:12:52,933 --> 00:12:55,379
Of course I do. I ain’t that stupid.

155
00:12:57,666 --> 00:12:58,666
What’s an auction?

156
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,650
You bid with money.

157
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,204
The one with the highest bid wins.

158
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
Yeah.

159
00:13:06,573 --> 00:13:08,777
So we just have to get
as many pieces as we can.

160
00:13:08,891 --> 00:13:10,604
It will be a competition.

161
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,520
But each of us has limited credits.

162
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:15,700
It’s going to be hard to win
as many pieces as possible.

163
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:19,564
Guys.

164
00:13:20,805 --> 00:13:23,979
I think I have a way
that we can all complete this game.

165
00:13:26,988 --> 00:13:31,376
According to the rules, we need to build
at least three rows to complete the game.

166
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:35,405
If we all agree which piece to bid for
before we start bidding,

167
00:13:36,422 --> 00:13:38,222
we can all probably complete it
easily enough.

168
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,660
How would we do that?

169
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,530
There are eight rounds of auction.

170
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,788
With four pieces for each round,
there will be 32 pieces in total.

171
00:13:46,041 --> 00:13:48,201
If we split it four times
between all of us,

172
00:13:48,472 --> 00:13:51,103
I believe we’ll all have enough pieces
to build three rows.

173
00:13:51,927 --> 00:13:53,402
It will also save us the credits.

174
00:13:54,631 --> 00:13:55,801
I agree with you, Mamay.

175
00:13:58,029 --> 00:14:02,371
From the pieces in the first round,
each piece contains 5-7 squares.

176
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:05,773
That means there are at least 20 squares
in total in each round of auction.

177
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:08,705
To build three rows, we only need 15.

178
00:14:09,155 --> 00:14:10,850
So if we work together,

179
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,105
everyone can complete it, like Mamay said.

180
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,665
How can you be sure that

181
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,201
everyone will agree to rationing?

182
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,105
Why wouldn’t you?

183
00:14:21,619 --> 00:14:23,850
Everyone gets to complete the game
if we do this.

184
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:25,659
But who will win?

185
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,902
Yeah, he’s right.

186
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,407
If the winner gets a medal
and get to make a wish,

187
00:14:31,571 --> 00:14:32,602
I’d love to win.

188
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,638
I can’t promise you will win,

189
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:40,377
but at least this will allow everyone
to complete the game and leave.

190
00:14:40,715 --> 00:14:41,754
Prove it.

191
00:14:42,786 --> 00:14:44,371
If you think your plan will work,

192
00:14:44,782 --> 00:14:46,382
don’t bid in the first round of auction.

193
00:14:46,737 --> 00:14:49,401
If you agree to that, I’ll do as you say.

194
00:14:53,251 --> 00:14:54,251
Deal.

195
00:14:59,958 --> 00:15:01,401
I believe in your plan, Mamay.

196
00:15:03,266 --> 00:15:04,905
I won’t bid, either.

197
00:16:34,482 --> 00:16:36,402
You have successfully offered a bid.

198
00:16:44,149 --> 00:16:45,702
First round of auction completed.

199
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,502
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

200
00:16:58,647 --> 00:16:59,647
Yes!

201
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:02,265
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

202
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,998
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

203
00:17:13,241 --> 00:17:14,800
Bidding results for Piece Number 4:

204
00:17:18,023 --> 00:17:19,023
Hey!

205
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,245
Here are the players’ current credits:

206
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,558
Players, place the piece in your box.

207
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,626
Kaen, look.

208
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:02,600
What is that?

209
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,241
I think it’s the piece
after adding it in the box.

210
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,499
It’s color-coordinated,

211
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,946
and in the order of
who’s leading the scoreboard.

212
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:13,875
If it’s like this, we can estimate
what kind of pieces someone would need,

213
00:18:14,537 --> 00:18:15,798
and what they wouldn’t need.

214
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,019
Hey.

215
00:18:25,325 --> 00:18:26,503
I’m taking the lead, guys.

216
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,604
I’m getting back at him.

217
00:18:35,228 --> 00:18:38,557
May the second round of auction begin.

218
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,303
Piece Number 6 was yours, wasn’t it?

219
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:55,780
Yes.

220
00:18:59,530 --> 00:19:01,530
It seems you know how to play
this game quite well.

221
00:19:05,450 --> 00:19:06,890
I listened to the rules of the game.

222
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,560
One more thing.

223
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,509
You know how to play it
just as well as I do.

224
00:19:13,117 --> 00:19:14,117
Guys.

225
00:19:15,565 --> 00:19:17,508
Let’s try out my plan this time.

226
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,401
If we work together,
we can definitely win this.

227
00:19:22,005 --> 00:19:27,699
Let’s let the people who didn’t get
any pieces in the last round choose first.

228
00:19:28,029 --> 00:19:29,029
Do you agree?

229
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:32,670
I’m taking Piece Number 3.

230
00:19:32,724 --> 00:19:34,404
How come you get to be
the first to choose?

231
00:19:35,127 --> 00:19:36,621
There are three other people
who didn’t get any pieces.

232
00:19:36,645 --> 00:19:37,800
Come on, no fighting.

233
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:41,054
Let’s let Don choose first, and then Pie.

234
00:19:41,508 --> 00:19:42,770
Kaen and I will go last.

235
00:19:43,802 --> 00:19:44,962
Which piece do you want, Pie?

236
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,105
I choose Piece Number 1.

237
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,799
You should take Piece Number 2, Mamay.

238
00:19:54,823 --> 00:19:56,007
I’ll pick Piece Number 5.

239
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,460
Okay.

240
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,103
I’ll choose Piece Number 2,
while Kaen Piece Number 5.

241
00:20:02,757 --> 00:20:04,376
That leaves us with…

242
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,179
Piece Numbers 4 and 6.

243
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,108
I’ll take a pass.

244
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:11,031
I’ll keep my credits for the next round.

245
00:20:12,414 --> 00:20:13,703
I’ll choose Piece Number 4.

246
00:20:14,503 --> 00:20:15,503
I’m not bidding.

247
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,080
You can take it.

248
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:20,105
Then I’ll take Piece Number 6.

249
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,937
That settles it.

250
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:25,976
Only bid with one credit so you can save
the rest for the next rounds.

251
00:20:26,776 --> 00:20:27,776
Let’s do it.

252
00:20:51,472 --> 00:20:53,103
Second round of auction completed.

253
00:20:54,035 --> 00:20:55,511
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

254
00:20:59,628 --> 00:21:01,201
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

255
00:21:03,137 --> 00:21:04,702
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

256
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,102
Bidding results for Piece Number 4:

257
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,210
It’s going according to plan.

258
00:21:13,802 --> 00:21:15,008
We can definitely win.

259
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:19,377
Bidding results for Piece Number 5:

260
00:21:25,502 --> 00:21:26,851
Why are you doing this?

261
00:21:27,247 --> 00:21:30,004
We all agreed this piece
would go to Kaen!

262
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,456
It can’t be helped, can it?

263
00:21:31,579 --> 00:21:32,579
We’re in a game.

264
00:21:32,751 --> 00:21:33,352
Yeah.

265
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,451
It’s an auction game.

266
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:37,897
It’s totally normal
to place a bid, isn’t it?

267
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,257
There has been a tie bid.

268
00:21:41,386 --> 00:21:45,710
Players must offer a new bid openly
to decide who gets the piece.

269
00:21:46,542 --> 00:21:48,177
Bidding begins at 2 credits.

270
00:21:48,478 --> 00:21:50,900
Bidding starts now.

271
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:52,256
Three!

272
00:21:53,783 --> 00:21:54,320
Four.
Five.

273
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,201
Your credits are not enough.

274
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:00,602
The piece is sold at four credits.

275
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,702
Bidding results for Piece Number 6:

276
00:22:14,168 --> 00:22:16,200
Here are the players’ current credits:

277
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:21,804
Players who get credits
from selling their squares.

278
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,940
Aom knew she would receive
her credits back

279
00:22:26,961 --> 00:22:28,300
so she placed a usually high bid.

280
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,158
This isn’t just bidding.

281
00:22:30,441 --> 00:22:31,900
We need to manage our sales, too.

282
00:22:34,945 --> 00:22:36,985
It might be a good thing
that you lost that bidding.

283
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,140
If you had won,

284
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:41,130
you wouldn’t have had any credits left
to bid in the next rounds.

285
00:22:41,697 --> 00:22:43,502
Benz now has only one credit.

286
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,100
If you don’t cut your pieces
and sell them,

287
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,180
you won’t have any credits
for the next rounds.

288
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,096
Shit. He’s right.

289
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:54,102
But more importantly,
we need to find you a piece, Kaen.

290
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:58,402
Players, place the piece in your box.

291
00:23:03,296 --> 00:23:05,980
Just place the piece
in your box first for now, Mamay.

292
00:23:40,988 --> 00:23:44,201
May the third round of auction begin.

293
00:23:47,441 --> 00:23:49,890
Should we agree which piece to bid
before bidding this time?

294
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,530
There are seven pieces,

295
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:54,305
which is enough for all of us.

296
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,453
Save for Benz who doesn’t have
any credits left.

297
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:57,905
Just shut up, man.

298
00:23:57,954 --> 00:23:59,990
I’ll sell some pieces and
get my dough back in no time.

299
00:24:00,014 --> 00:24:03,503
You stole Kaen’s piece and
have the nerve to talk like this?

300
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,208
How can you be so selfish?

301
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:06,802
Selfish?

302
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:08,802
It’s a competition.

303
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,905
What you came up with is not fit for it.

304
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,210
Am I right?

305
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:13,754
Who agrees with me?

306
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,308
I think Mamay’s plan works just fine.

307
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,990
Don’t you want to win anymore, Don?

308
00:24:22,262 --> 00:24:25,202
Her plan allows us to get the pieces
we want with minimal credits.

309
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,004
It’ll help us win
even more easily, won’t it?

310
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,480
Fine, fine.

311
00:24:36,592 --> 00:24:38,109
I’ll do as Mamay says now.

312
00:24:38,592 --> 00:24:39,592
Alright?

313
00:24:50,927 --> 00:24:52,508
Third round of auction completed.

314
00:24:53,422 --> 00:24:55,002
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

315
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,614
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

316
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:06,548
Don, you jerk!

317
00:25:07,032 --> 00:25:08,192
Why the hell did you do that?

318
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,158
Didn’t we agree I’d get this piece?

319
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,200
You stole the first piece from me.

320
00:25:13,494 --> 00:25:15,305
You said we can all win with your plan.

321
00:25:15,674 --> 00:25:17,242
Are you gonna let him cheat like that?

322
00:25:17,257 --> 00:25:20,802
You said it yourself that it’s typical
to place the highest bid in an auction.

323
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:23,797
You made a mistake because
you’re a freaking moron.

324
00:25:23,802 --> 00:25:24,416
You bastard!

325
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,950
- Hey!
- What the hell you gon do!

326
00:25:26,894 --> 00:25:28,011
- You asshole!
- Come at me!

327
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:28,757
You jerk!
Hey, hey!

328
00:25:29,438 --> 00:25:30,438
Stop it!

329
00:25:31,973 --> 00:25:32,561
Don.

330
00:25:32,946 --> 00:25:34,200
Why did you do that?

331
00:25:34,355 --> 00:25:35,859
We all agreed to it.

332
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,955
You said your plan would allow
everyone to build three rows,

333
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,040
but you claimed
the best pieces for yourself.

334
00:25:43,845 --> 00:25:45,303
That’s not helping anyone!

335
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:47,948
But you each have one row already...

336
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,300
Freaking stay out of this, Kaen!

337
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:55,490
You said it yourself. It’s a competition.

338
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:56,306
Fine.

339
00:25:56,665 --> 00:25:57,665
Fine!

340
00:25:57,706 --> 00:25:58,746
If that’s how you wanna play.

341
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,860
No more cooperating!

342
00:26:00,457 --> 00:26:01,176
Hold on!

343
00:26:01,447 --> 00:26:02,905
I’ve had enough with your plan!

344
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,900
I’m not doing it anymore.

345
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,462
I think you should focus on building
your own three rows for now, Mamay.

346
00:26:15,877 --> 00:26:18,008
You can help other people later.

347
00:26:18,671 --> 00:26:19,908
I’ll help you, Mamay.

348
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:21,597
I believe in you.

349
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,757
I know everyone will, too.

350
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:29,143
May the fourth round of auction begin.

351
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,724
You have successfully offered a bid.

352
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:57,912
May the fifth round of auction begin.

353
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:16,256
You have successfully offered a bid.

354
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,158
May the sixth round of auction begin.

355
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:35,011
There are nine pieces this round?

356
00:27:38,663 --> 00:27:40,023
I think that could be good, Mamay.

357
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,505
With more options,
you can build three rows faster.

358
00:27:46,546 --> 00:27:50,377
But if we cooperate, we can all have
one piece each without fighting.

359
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,200
What do you want now?

360
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,670
You’re a lucky girl, aren’t you?

361
00:27:55,370 --> 00:27:57,755
You have help in the game
and in the real world.

362
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,721
What do you mean?

363
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,490
Kaen is always there to help you in
any kind of competition, isn’t he?

364
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:07,980
Aren’t you, Kaen?

365
00:28:11,552 --> 00:28:12,632
Let’s place our bids, Kaen.

366
00:28:31,155 --> 00:28:32,410
Took you long enough, jerk.

367
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,456
You need to help me build three rows.

368
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,555
If I refuse…

369
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,602
It’s not a request.

370
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,170
It’s an order.

371
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,942
If you refuse to do it,

372
00:28:53,634 --> 00:28:55,619
I’ll tell everyone what you did.

373
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,764
It might seem like you’re falling behind
on the scoreboard,

374
00:28:59,788 --> 00:29:02,404
but I believe you’ll turn the table
and win at the end.

375
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,379
Thank you, Kaen.

376
00:29:49,226 --> 00:29:50,226
Don.

377
00:29:50,302 --> 00:29:51,900
Mamay is taking the lead now.

378
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:53,330
What should we do?

379
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:54,651
How is that possible?

380
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:56,690
Almost everyone in our class
voted for Mai, right?

381
00:29:58,056 --> 00:29:59,056
I don’t know.

382
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,352
But if Mai loses,

383
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:03,108
we’re ruined, man.

384
00:30:10,951 --> 00:30:11,992
I knew it!

385
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,908
I knew our effort wouldn’t go to waste!

386
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:16,466
Good job!

387
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:19,451
I think someone is messing with the votes.

388
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,720
CONGRATULATIONS,
THE NEW STUDENT PRESIDENT, MAMAY

389
00:30:26,441 --> 00:30:27,441
You won!

390
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,502
You won, Mamay!

391
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:33,100
Hey, there. Come with me.

392
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,408
Stop moving.

393
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,250
Stop moving!

394
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,059
What did you do with the votes?

395
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:45,648
Huh?

396
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,054
You cost me so much money, you know that?

397
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,265
What did I do? I didn’t do anything.

398
00:30:55,528 --> 00:30:56,528
Stop moving!

399
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,030
Now this is the evidence.

400
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,186
I saw you put this thumbdrive
on the school’s computer,

401
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:06,351
and suddenly all the votes went to Mamay.

402
00:31:07,557 --> 00:31:09,056
That’s obviously cheating, isn’t it?

403
00:31:10,527 --> 00:31:11,527
No.

404
00:31:11,570 --> 00:31:12,201
I…

405
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:14,558
I was just doing system maintenance.

406
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,650
System maintenance?

407
00:31:17,317 --> 00:31:19,182
Like hell I’d believe that!

408
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:20,906
Now admit it, you jerk!

409
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:24,910
I bet I can find out if it was just
system maintenance or not.

410
00:31:25,645 --> 00:31:28,445
Everyone in this school will know
that bitch Mamay rigged the election.

411
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:31,604
No. I did it on my own.

412
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,503
Mamay has nothing to do with this.

413
00:31:33,579 --> 00:31:34,605
Don’t tell the teachers.

414
00:31:35,428 --> 00:31:36,428
How about this?

415
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:38,751
I have some money left
from the competition I won.

416
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,157
I’ll give it to you for the bet you lost.

417
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:42,770
Please don’t tell the teachers.

418
00:31:47,154 --> 00:31:48,154
What do you want?

419
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,054
I need Piece Number 2.

420
00:31:51,208 --> 00:31:52,970
You need to negotiate it for me.

421
00:31:57,377 --> 00:31:59,102
Don’t forget I still have that video.

422
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Samut.

423
00:32:06,322 --> 00:32:09,499
Can I talk to you about the auction?

424
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,703
What’s the matter?

425
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
I…

426
00:32:13,945 --> 00:32:15,850
I want Mamay to get
the piece that she wants.

427
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,758
I thought I should come
and talk to you first

428
00:32:17,782 --> 00:32:19,222
so you don’t bid for the same piece.

429
00:32:21,908 --> 00:32:23,976
What if Mamay and I want
the same piece?

430
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,240
How about this?

431
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,210
Let’s tell each other
the pieces we won’t bid for.

432
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:37,552
You tell me two of yours

433
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:38,980
and I’ll tell you two of mine.

434
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,657
You can decide the rest.

435
00:32:45,805 --> 00:32:46,805
Okay.

436
00:32:49,890 --> 00:32:52,254
I won’t bid for Piece Numbers 1 and 4.

437
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,054
I won’t bid for Piece Numbers 3 and 6.

438
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,404
What about Piece Number 2?

439
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:09,857
Is that the one you want?

440
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Samut.

441
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,604
Can you help me choose the pieces?

442
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,600
I’ll let you talk.

443
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:18,872
Thanks.

444
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,102
Sixth round of auction completed.

445
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,051
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

446
00:33:34,872 --> 00:33:35,872
Yes!

447
00:33:40,506 --> 00:33:41,982
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

448
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:25,222
Are you happy you completed the game?

449
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,099
None of your business.

450
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:30,650
Are you still mad at me
for rolling the dice?

451
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:33,801
You saw it’s nothing
more than just a game.

452
00:34:34,438 --> 00:34:35,838
It’s not as dangerous as you think.

453
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,730
You don’t know anything about this game
so you probably shouldn’t say anything.

454
00:34:39,903 --> 00:34:40,906
What should I know?

455
00:34:41,457 --> 00:34:42,457
Tell me.

456
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,400
You can’t trust anyone in the game.

457
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,303
Even you?

458
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,201
May the seventh round of auction begin.

459
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:13,706
Hey.

460
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,558
I need more credits for the next round.

461
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,848
Buy the squares I’m auctioning off.

462
00:35:20,928 --> 00:35:21,928
You copy?

463
00:35:24,114 --> 00:35:25,645
I want Piece Number 2.

464
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:27,706
You have three rows already.

465
00:35:28,262 --> 00:35:29,600
That’s enough to complete the game.

466
00:35:29,617 --> 00:35:30,902
I didn’t ask for your opinion.

467
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,602
I need to be the best.

468
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,040
Samut.

469
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,900
I’m not bidding for
Piece Numbers 3 and 5.

470
00:35:56,423 --> 00:35:58,302
You can’t trust anyone in the game.

471
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:02,710
Kaen.

472
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,960
What you’re doing right now…

473
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,700
Is Don making you do it?

474
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:11,357
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

475
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:26,000
I can help you if you want me to.

476
00:36:29,662 --> 00:36:30,905
Don isn’t doing anything.

477
00:36:31,263 --> 00:36:32,500
I’m doing this for Mamay.

478
00:36:33,075 --> 00:36:34,906
She wants everyone
to get through the game.

479
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,580
Okay.

480
00:36:45,093 --> 00:36:46,733
I’m not bidding
for Piece Numbers 1 and 2.

481
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,096
Thanks.

482
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,859
Seventh round of auction completed.

483
00:36:58,272 --> 00:36:59,924
You’re definitely winning this thing, Don.

484
00:36:59,948 --> 00:37:01,503
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

485
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,051
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

486
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,853
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

487
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,300
Bidding results for Piece Number 4:

488
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,057
Bidding results for Piece Number 5:

489
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,099
Bidding results for Piece Number 6:

490
00:37:38,773 --> 00:37:40,505
Why didn’t you bid for a bigger piece?

491
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,580
You haven’t even gotten
three rows, have you?

492
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:44,291
I…

493
00:37:44,648 --> 00:37:45,810
I wanted to help Benz.

494
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:48,537
He had no more credits
for the next round.

495
00:37:49,499 --> 00:37:51,286
You want everyone to win
this game, don’t you?

496
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,980
Here are the players’ current credits:

497
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,154
Players, place the piece in your box.

498
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,010
Let’s put the pieces in the boxes.

499
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,260
Damn it, Don.

500
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:36,742
May the last round of auction begin.

501
00:38:41,838 --> 00:38:42,838
Kaen.

502
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,506
I cut my own pieces for you.

503
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:50,903
If you bid for it and win,
you’ll have three rows.

504
00:38:58,715 --> 00:39:00,201
I don’t have three rows right now.

505
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,807
Help me out, Mamay.

506
00:39:02,905 --> 00:39:03,905
Same here.

507
00:39:12,229 --> 00:39:13,229
Guys.

508
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:17,200
Right now, Mark, Benz, and Kaen
don’t have three rows yet.

509
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:20,230
I want you to help these three out
so we can all complete the game.

510
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,991
If you have three rows already,

511
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,966
I’m asking you not to offer
any biddings this time.

512
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:26,400
I won’t, either.

513
00:39:26,790 --> 00:39:28,700
So the people who need the pieces
can have them.

514
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,214
And why the hell should I do as you say?

515
00:39:35,342 --> 00:39:36,404
It’s for everyone.

516
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,432
Your friend, Benz, will get
something from this, too...

517
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:39,900
But you get the most out of this.

518
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,302
Aren’t we negotiating here
because you’re losing?

519
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,657
Do you always have to be so vile?

520
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,801
And you!

521
00:39:46,157 --> 00:39:47,757
You said you wouldn’t cooperate anymore,

522
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,767
but now that you’re losing,
you’re willing to?

523
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,506
Aren’t you doing the same thing...

524
00:39:56,010 --> 00:39:58,090
by making Kaen to get you
the pieces that you wanted?

525
00:40:00,373 --> 00:40:03,004
I know you’re threatening him
with something

526
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:05,032
so he would get you the pieces
that you wanted.

527
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,783
You also made Kaen
buy the pieces Benz auctioned off.

528
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:14,370
Don.

529
00:40:14,681 --> 00:40:16,106
Why did you do that?

530
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:20,183
You forced us to play this, and now
you forced him to do your bidding?

531
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:22,860
Once we get out of this game,
I’m reporting you to the teachers.

532
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:25,746
To think you’re still acting like
you’re the student council president.

533
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,303
You don’t have power here.

534
00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:29,659
The only person with power is the winner.

535
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,001
And if Kaen didn’t help you,
you wouldn’t have been elected.

536
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,601
You don’t know, do you,
that the only reason you won that election

537
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:50,730
was because Kaen rigged it for you?

538
00:40:56,709 --> 00:40:57,709
That’s not true.

539
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:58,555
You’re lying.

540
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,300
I have a video of his confession.

541
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,700
He begged and agreed to do
everything for me if I kept quiet.

542
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:05,552
You wanna see it?

543
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:15,834
Is it true, Kaen?

544
00:41:41,742 --> 00:41:42,742
Mamay!

545
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,870
I’m sorry.

546
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,754
I’m sorry for all this.

547
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,204
I did as Don said because I didn’t
want you to know about this.

548
00:41:55,562 --> 00:41:57,162
I’ll take responsibility for everything.

549
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,202
This last round is the final showdown
between you and me.

550
00:42:43,656 --> 00:42:44,656
You, too.

551
00:42:45,619 --> 00:42:47,250
You’re pathetic.

552
00:42:47,681 --> 00:42:49,576
Do you want to win so badly
that you have to resort to this?

553
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:51,680
What’s the point of playing games
if not for victory?

554
00:43:32,368 --> 00:43:34,002
Last round of auction completed.

555
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,801
Bidding results for Piece Number 1:

556
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,503
There has been a tie bid.

557
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,460
Why does it have to be you?

558
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,303
Bidding starts now.

559
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:45,903
What will you do, Mark?

560
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:47,900
Aom has four credits.

561
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:50,961
Three.

562
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,640
Pass.

563
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:09,311
Yes!

564
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,103
The piece is sold at three credits.

565
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:14,401
Bidding results for Piece Number 2:

566
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:17,257
Yes!

567
00:44:20,437 --> 00:44:22,004
Bidding results for Piece Number 3:

568
00:44:26,748 --> 00:44:28,259
I knew you’d bid for this.

569
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:29,802
I ain’t letting you win.

570
00:44:35,248 --> 00:44:37,176
This piece might not give me five rows,

571
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,500
but it will still be enough to make me win.

572
00:44:41,402 --> 00:44:42,598
How would he win?

573
00:44:43,241 --> 00:44:45,207
He won’t have five rows.

574
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:49,837
According to the rules, if players
have the same amount of rows,

575
00:44:50,110 --> 00:44:52,627
it’s decided with the amount of squares
that aren’t in the rows.

576
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:54,400
The player with more squares wins.

577
00:44:56,170 --> 00:45:00,250
Good thing someone is stupid enough to
call a pass when she had a chance to win.

578
00:45:01,487 --> 00:45:03,287
Bidding results for Piece Number 5:

579
00:45:15,805 --> 00:45:17,377
That means Mamay has five rows.

580
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:24,807
But that means Kaen is…

581
00:45:39,785 --> 00:45:41,602
You can’t trust anyone in the game.

582
00:45:48,641 --> 00:45:49,642
What the hell did you do?

583
00:45:49,677 --> 00:45:50,850
I’m just trying to win.

584
00:45:50,927 --> 00:45:51,980
Just like everyone has been doing.

585
00:45:51,998 --> 00:45:53,958
Don’t you know how dangerous
what you just did is?

586
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:57,902
There is a penalty for players
who fail to build three rows.

587
00:45:59,069 --> 00:46:00,893
Maybe the game will bring
someone out here to kill Kaen.

588
00:46:00,917 --> 00:46:02,137
How did it come to this?

589
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,216
Kaen wrote a program that would guarantee
Mai would lose the election.

590
00:46:05,231 --> 00:46:08,099
The suspect is be one of you.

591
00:46:08,260 --> 00:46:10,414
- You did this, didn’t you?
- Hey, hey.

592
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:11,028
Didn’t you!

593
00:46:11,354 --> 00:46:13,204
The real bad guy is the person

594
00:46:13,727 --> 00:46:15,250
you’re all trying to protect.
