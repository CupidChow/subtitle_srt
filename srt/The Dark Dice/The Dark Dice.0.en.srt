1
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:49,040
My story began
when that dice hit the ground.

2
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:49,600
Samut.

3
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,080
Samut.

4
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:54,160
We have a new student today.

5
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,680
I don’t know how tough you were
back in your old school,

6
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,280
but I don’t mind finding out.
Jerk!

7
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,896
This series is called The Dark Dice.
[GEMINI NORAWIT AS SAMUT/
PRIM CHANIKARN AS AOM]
The story is set in a school.
[GEMINI NORAWIT AS SAMUT/
PRIM CHANIKARN AS AOM]

8
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,760
And there is this game, a board game,
a dice-based board game.

9
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,800
This game is kind of
the school’s urban legend.

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,039
It belongs to a long-lost club.

11
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,159
My character happens to find a dice.

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,880
Right in the school.

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,920
An accident happens, and I find the dice

14
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,136
for the first time after it’s been lost
for a long time.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:36,080
And now we’ve got sucked into this game,
because of the dice.

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,960
Each game is quite dangerous.
[MEWNICH NANNAPHAS AS MAMAY]

17
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,359
So the players feel under pressure.

18
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,440
Winning each game also has a prize.

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,960
And everyone wants it.

20
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,000
Right.

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:51,920
[A MYSTERIOUS DICE]

22
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:54,160
That dice fell out of a box
of the Board Game Club.

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,280
This is no typical dice.

24
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
The dice you are used to are cubes, right?

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,000
But this one is kinda diamond-shaped.

26
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
A golden diamond.

27
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,640
It’s got so many sides,
with one of a crescent moon.

28
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,880
It’s the symbol of this game.

29
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,120
The club’s log book confirms that someone
really has played this game before us.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
The only way to find out is to play.

31
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,440
The octagon room is
what we call The Lobby.

32
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,160
That’s where we begin each time
we get sucked into the game dimension.

33
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,119
In that room, there are eight doors,

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,080
representing all eight of us.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,840
In some games, we have to go through
the door on our own.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,200
And in some, we can work together.

37
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,120
No one knows how we get to that Lobby.

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,856
It’d be like, next thing we know we’re there.

39
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,816
There’s also a platform
in the middle of the room,

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,800
where medals are kept.

41
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,760
In this room, we’ll hear
a voice telling us the rules,

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,720
which we don’t know whose voice it is.

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,639
This voice explains the rules of the game,

44
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,080
because the game is the never the same
each time we get there.

45
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,480
<i>Welcome all eight players to Djehuty.</i>

46
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,160
<i>The game of wits.</i>

47
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,799
I’d say the characters are nervous.

48
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,240
We don’t know what we’re up against.
We have to choose the door.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,160
We don’t know…

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,079
- …what’s behind each door.
- Right.

51
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,840
So that’s difficult.

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,200
It’s nerve-wracking.

53
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
It’s dark, too, when you open the door.

54
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,320
So we must stay here and play the game?

55
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,680
Help me.

56
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,320
Help.

57
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,479
Each game is different.
[POON MITPAKDEE AS BENZ]

58
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,159
Some game requires physical
strength, some mental,

59
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,279
and some game needs collaboration,

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,960
which is open to betrayal and cheating.

61
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,496
There may be the kind of game that
wouldn’t exist in the real world,
[PROM TEEPAKRON AS DON]
which is exciting for me.
[PROM TEEPAKRON AS DON]

62
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,839
I find it fun while playing the game.

63
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
It feels like I really am a part of the game.

64
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,279
You gotta finish the game
in order to leave it.

65
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,216
And if you don’t get through it,
there could be a punishment.

66
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:17,480
The game is always different.

67
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,960
Sometimes you have to use your wits.

68
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,360
Sometimes you have to be cunning.

69
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,480
Sometimes you need to have a strategy.

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,120
And some game requires working together
in order to get through it.

71
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:35,680
But each game reveals
each character’s desires.

72
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,559
You’ll be on edge wondering
if they’ll help each other

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,680
or betray each other.

74
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,759
In this game, Kaen is the strategist.
[AUNGPAO OCHIRIS AS KAEN]

75
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,159
Kaen is the guy behind the screen.
[AUNGPAO OCHIRIS AS KAEN]

76

He does all the coding.

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,560
Kaen is good with computers.

78
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,120
He’s the strategist.

79
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,560
Samut explains the game to the others.

80
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,960
And… he is the one
who solves all the problems.

81
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:21,680
He always sacrifices himself
helping people

82
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,120
so everyone can come out of the game.

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
I think Aom is a bit of an observer.

84
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,839
She’s the kind of character
that’s all quiet at first,

85
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,479
but as the game progresses
or the situation calls for it,

86
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,840
she would fight.

87
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,000
I think Benz is someone
who doesn’t know how to play games.

88
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:56,720
Like, he only cares about
strength on his stat.

89
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,560
If this was a military game,
Don would be a lieutenant.

90

He’s vicious.

91
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,880
He likes taking control.

92
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,760
He wants people to do things his way.

93
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,600
He plans things ahead.

94
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,280
He’s devious.

95

She’s a leader.

96
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Mamay, in terms of intelligence,
isn’t on par with Samut or Kaen.

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,000
But she’s good at seeing the big picture,

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,360
summing up decisions and plans
so everyone understands.

99
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,360
She makes sure everyone is accounted for.

We’re all roughly the same age.

106
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,960
We’re practically friends.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
So working together has been really easy

108
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,040
since we’re all friends.

109
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,279
I think it’s always lively on set.

110
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,719
Teshow, for example, is such a yapper.

111
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,400
He always cheers everyone up
when we’re tired.

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,120
Right.

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,679
We got to play boardgames together
during our workshops.

114
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,240
It gets us to know each other
and how to play the games.

115
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,000
That helps us get the characters
better while filming.

116
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,920
It’s more like basic training,

117
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,119
since the games in the show
have been modified a little.

118
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,799
All eight of us, the main cast,

119
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,199
have tried an escape room
experience together.

120
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
Off hours, that is.

121
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:05,599
This helps us understand the discomfort
of wanting to get out of a place,

122
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,360
and also working together.

123
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,480
When we were playing the escape room,

124
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,920
it was like everyone
was playing their characters.

125
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,760
There’d be someone observing and leading.

126
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,960
There’d be someone not doing anything.

127
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:27,080
And since we were
so overconfident after filming,

128
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,360
we chose the “hardest” level
of the escape room.

129
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:32,560
We spent an extra time
of almost two hours.

130
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:37,079
I was stuck in that escape room
with seven people for almost two hours.

131
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,000
It was extremely fun.

132
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:41,080
I got to understand the characters
so much better.

133
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,416
When I was reading the screenplay,
I thought it would be easy.

134
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,519
The mystery seems to unfold easily.

135
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,560
But in an actual game,
when you’re faced with it,

136
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,680
it is difficult!

137
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,399
It looks easy,
but you just don’t really see it.

138
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,960
You don’t seem to think things through.

139
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,359
I don’t know how tough you were
back in your old school,

140
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,560
but I don’t mind finding out.

141
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,560
I play Samut.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,440
Samut is a high school student.

143
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,760
He had some trouble so he had
to move to this school.

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Samut is very smart.

145
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,160
He’s observant of people.

146
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,319
He knows how to read the room well.

147
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,959
He’s a problem solver and a witty guy.

148
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,320
He loves his friends.

149
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,319
Samut is a character
with high level of leadership,

150
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,000
and has a strong sense of self.

151
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,640
He wants to save his friends
and leads them on a good path.

152
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,079
Don isn’t a big fan of his.

153
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,640
He’s jealous, really.

154
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,560
He hates that people trust Samut
more than they trust him

155
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,280
when he’s just as good.

156
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,320
Something like that.

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,720
You’ll notice Samut takes the lead
in every episode and every game.

158
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,760
He’s got that kind of leadership.

159
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,960
Samut is full of leadership.

160
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,560
But he’s subtle about it.

161
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:02,560
He’s meticulous and lets people know
when he’s come to a decision.

162
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,999
Samut just moves from a different school,

163
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
and there’s been
a not-so-good rumor about him.

164
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:13,000
So everyone is suspicious of him at first,
speculating why he moves school

165
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,560
and whether or not the rumor is true.

166
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,840
You can imagine how everyone
would not trust Samut at first.

167
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:23,120
You’ll have to look forward to seeing
how he wins everyone’s trust.

168
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,720
Samut is a calm character,

169
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,840
who always uses his brain.

170
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
He’s the analyst of the game.

171
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,840
Basically, he’s the brain of the group.

172
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,080
Samut doesn't trust people easily.

173
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,480
He has his trauma from before.

174
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,199
So he finds it hard to trust people,

175
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,160
and then slowly learns
what it’s like to trust finally.

176
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,240
He’ll gradually meet
good friends and people

177
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,360
who are genuine in wanting to help him.

178
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,960
Are we back in that game again, Kaen?

179
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,200
Why did you toss the dice?

180
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,800
I want to know more about this game.

181
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,280
Then play on your own!

182
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,960
Why did you drag all of us here with you?

183
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,240
The hard part of this role?

184
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:08,240
I have to make it believable
that I am smart.

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:13,160
Well, this character talks a lot.

186
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,480
But right now,

187
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,760
there are “omly sheven of uth.”

188
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,640
(Focus!)

189
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:24,120
It’s quite a feat to remember
the mechanic of the games,

190
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,280
all of them,

191
00:11:25,281 --> 00:11:28,280
as well as explain them
to the other characters,

192
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,000
with leadership, no less.

193
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,640
That’s the hard part.

194
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,400
I have to help everyone else understand,
meaning the other characters,

195
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,400
and the audience.

196
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,040
I have to use my imagination a lot.

197
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,960
We work a lot with special effects.

198
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,840
So a lot of things need my imagination
to make it work.

199
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,200
That’s the hard part.

200
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,040
We had workshops.

201
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,040
Workshops with all the cast members.

202
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,959
We took acting classes to get to know
the characters better.

203
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:06,760
We had to play board games.

204
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,600
The board games we tried were similar
to the ones in the story.

205
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,599
This was to help us get the idea of
what the filming would be like.

206
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,039
We had to play the games
as our characters

207
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,240
to see how we’d improvise
in a situation.

208
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,480
It’s all new to me.

209
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,520
I like it.

210
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:34,840
It’s a total challenge on my part.

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,039
I had been in mostly
romantic comedies before this.

212
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:45,840
I was never in survival
or drama series like this.

213
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:51,160
I also got to work with
new friends and new crew.

214
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,840
Gemini is always making
everyone laugh on set.

215
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,080
He’s always cracking jokes
so I think he’s funny.

216
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,879
Gemini is really active, in my opinion.

217
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,959
I had been on variety shows
with him before,

218
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,760
so I’m used to his fun side.

219
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,160
Now, working on a series, seeing him
play his character so seriously,

220
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,040
it’s quite new to me to see
that side of Gemini.

221
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,480
(Ready? And…)

222
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,079
Not ready. I’m not ready.

223
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,080
(There’s a bee.)

224
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,320
(Let’s cut the scene for now.)

225
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,480
(Stay still, guys.)

226
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,759
This is entirely a secret
and I’ve never said this before.

227
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,400
He’s like a chicken!

228
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,600
He really is!

229
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,759
You guys think he’s puppy-coded,

230
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,239
but I personally think
he’s more of a chicken.

231
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,039
He’s so winged-animal-coded.

232
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,160
He’s funny, too.

233
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,440
When we’re on set and the scene is tense,

234
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,840
he would always say or do something
that makes everyone laugh and relax.

235
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,896
He has such an amazing energy,
even when he’s always working.

236
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,840
He’s able to remember
his massive amount of lines.

237
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,279
I just know he uses
his brain all the time.

238
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,560
He’s just that amazing.

239
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,599
(One more time, please.)

240
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,280
(Get right back in.)

241
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,720
Come on!

242
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
(Action!)

243
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,440
Just play the game.

244
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,616
We won’t get out of here
if we don’t do something.

245
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,719
I play Aom in this series.

246
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,919
She’s a student at this school.

247
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,799
She’s got a bit of a mysterious vibe.

248
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,400
She has this “out-of-nowhere” vibe

249
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,759
that makes you wonder
what she’s all about.

250
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,120
You will definitely
have questions about her.

251
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,639
She only speaks when it’s necessary
for her to speak.

252
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:35,839
She isn’t quick to open up.

253
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,679
She doesn’t speak without purpose.

254
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,760
She only talks when she’s required to.

255
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:45,080
Aom is this mysterious student no one knows
where she’s from or who she is.

256
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,160
Or even why she seems to
carry so many secrets.

257
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,560
When she’s asked about things,
her answers are always so complicated.

258
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,439
She’s not straightforward.

259
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,640
She makes you wonder who she is.

260
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:59,000
She barely speaks. She’s quiet.

261
00:14:59,040 --> 00:14:59,800
She’s mysterious, alright.

262
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:00,961
She’s a bit alluring, really.

263
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,200
She doesn’t trust anyone.

264
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,760
She seems like she knows something

265
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,360
that she keeps to herself.

266
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,240
She seems like she knows
how to get us out of the game.

267
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,840
She also knows more about this game
than the rest of us.

268
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,560
But she just keeps everything to herself.

269
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,559
Aom isn’t afraid to go against Don,
in my opinion.

270
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,040
She doesn’t hold back from
arguing with or berating him.

271
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,760
She’s smart and really knows
how to hurt people with her words.

272
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,080
Go ahead.

273
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,760
Toss the dice.

274
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,680
It’s just a game anyway, didn’t you say?

275
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:35,159
For me, the hard part
of playing this character is…

276
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,839
She’s got her trauma.

277
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,959
It’s quite hard to feel into that trauma

278
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,160
and play it in a way
that hints at her past.

279
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,320
Another hard part is the games.

280
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,800
I have to understand the games
my character is playing.

281
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,400
I feel like that’s difficult,

282
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,079
probably because I barely ever
play board games in real life, I think.

283
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,640
I feel like it requires
a lot of brainpower to play.

284
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,039
We got to do some workshops
before we started filming.

285
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,560
There were two parts:

286
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,439
first, the acting
to get to know the character,

287
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,359
and second, the games.

288
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,559
They wanted us to get the idea of

289
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,199
how it was going to be like with
all eight of us in the game.

290
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:13,800
It isn’t just like acting the role we get.

291
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,799
We must imagine the characters
in the game context.

292
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,440
That was difficult and new to me.

293
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,360
It is an opportunity worth taking.

294
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,760
Don’t you know how dangerous that was?

295
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,159
Aom is such a charming character.

296
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,760
Her personality and whatnot.

297
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,719
We did our workshops together,

298
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,239
so I got to see P’Prim design
this character in real time.

299
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,960
I thought it was so interesting.

300
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,160
She’s got this allure
and mystery about her.

301
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,960
P’Prim is really good at portraying that.

302
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,840
I think it’s quite hard to play
a mysterious character like that.

303
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,200
This is the first time
we work together in a series.

304
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,896
What’s it like working with Prim?

305
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,000
Prim is just amazing.

306
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:11,240
Prim is a seasoned actor.

307
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:11,720
Oooh.

308
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,760
She’s experienced.

309
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,040
And she has helped me a lot.

310
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,080
This is my first time
working on this genre,

311
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:24,040
so working with someone who’s
really good at what they do,

312
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:26,160
it gives me encouragement.

313
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,360
We’re the same age, as well.

314
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,640
So working with her is full of ease.

315
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,919
I’ve always seen him as an artist,
singing and performing.

316
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:42,680
So to witness his acting prowess,
it quite wows me.

317
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,680
He’s so quick-witted,
just like his character.

318
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,919
His lines are always long,

319
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,456
with such a specific variety
of vocabulary...

320
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,800
it’s not the everyday words we use,
but they’re game lingo...

321
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,840
so his mind must have to work so quickly
to connect all the dots.

322
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:03,360
That’s why I’m quite impressed with him.

323
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,600
Attention.

324
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,960
Good morning.

325
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,440
I play Mamay in this series.

326
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:18,560
Mamay is quite calm and a leader.

327
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,280
But her leadership and her composure
are not exactly her true self.

328
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,960
She’s shaped to be that way
by her environment.

329
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,160
She grew up competing with people at home.

330
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,440
She is always doing everything
to be accepted by her family.

331
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,559
That’s why she chases roles
like class president

332
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:42,239
and student president
just to make her dad proud.

333
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,319
At school, she’s well loved by everyone.

334
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,840
She helps everyone who needs it
and is a good leader.

335
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
Mamay is a smart one.

336
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,600
She’s the student president.

337
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,400
In the game, or out of it,

338
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:06,400
Mamay is the one who always helps me
explain the mechanics of the games.

339
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,840
Mamay and Kaen are among
the smart ones in this series.

340
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,120
Mamay helps Samut come up with plans,

341
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,959
or handles the team members.

342
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,839
She gives advice and suggestions,
and tells people what to do.

343
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,880
She helps plan things out.

344
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,720
This character is full of leadership.

345
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,840
Mamay is kind.

346
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,480
She’s nice to everyone.

347
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,680
She’s got this mom friend vibe,
kinda like P’Mewnich herself.

348
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,639
She’s always eager to help and friendly.

349
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,160
She’s the student president.

350
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,959
I personally think Mamay has
such a high level of leadership.

351
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,160
She’s also quite smart and able to
take the lead in the games.

352
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,040
She intends to get everyone
out of the games safely.

353
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,960
I was quite stressed out
when I first got the role.

354
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:07,399
I feel like Mamay has more depth
to her than she lets on.

355
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:10,600
She’s multi-faceted and emotional.

356
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,240
There is also a lot of character
development all through the series.

357
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,880
So I had to work hard to figure out
which part of her past changed her life,

358
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,680
and turned her around.

359
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,119
That was one of the hardest parts.

360
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,440
Another hard part would be
working with a lot of CGI.

361
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,680
We film on the green screen quite a bit,
so we would work with no actual scenes.

362
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:43,240
It requires a lot of imagination to make
this fantasy of the games seem real.

363
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,240
(Cut.)

364
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,439
I’ve known her since we were younger
and always thought she’s a great actor.

365
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,640
You don’t need to worry about her
in that regard.

366
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,479
She’s always done well,
even in workshops.

367
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,640
She works really hard.

368
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,479
P’Mewnich is, like,
the most quiet among us.

369
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:09,320
She’s always rounding us up like, “Guys!”

370
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,000
“Get to work. Listen up.”
Something like that.

371
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,280
She’s got leadership.

372
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,960
Both herself and her character.

373
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,079
P’Mewnich is the mom friend.

374
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,560
She takes care of and encourages people.

375
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,120
She’s got that mom vibe, you know?

376
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,799
That’s why we all call her “Mom.”

377
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,680
She’s the mother of the set.

378
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,400
On the last day of filming,

379
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,160
Mewnich gave everyone a plant pot.

380
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:39,120
With a handwritten note telling us
how happy she is to work with each of us.

381
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,360
That’s one of the things that really
impressed me and the people on set.

382
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,199
She’s just really nice.

383
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,880
She’s a nurturing mother to all of us.

384
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:51,960
I think everyone on set always
shares snacks and food.

385
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,576
We receive such an abundance
of food support,

386
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,639
which I am so thankful for.

387
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,840
We never go hungry on set.

388
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,560
It’s my project.

389
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,240
So it’s my problem.

390
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,560
I don’t need anyone’s help.

391
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,679
I play Kaen.

392
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,360
He’s a nerd. He’s a scaredy cat.

393
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,560
He’s bad at socializing,
and he’s always bullied at school.

394
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,040
He stands out, you see.

395
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,240
He always wins medals and whatnot.

396
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,920
Of course his peers find him intolerable.

397
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,960
Kaen is really smart.

398
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,760
Any games that require wits and wisdom,
I’d want Kaen on my team.

399
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,360
He’s got a high IQ
and always makes things work.

400
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,136
He’s always under Don
and Benz’s thumbs, though,

401
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,360
because he doesn’t put up a fight
and always follows orders.

402
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:42,360
That’s why Don and Benz
use him for their own gain.

403
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:48,640
Kaen is smart and a nerd
who doesn’t stand up for himself.

404
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,800
He’s among the strategists of the series.

405
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,319
He’s always so quick to solve any puzzles,

406
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,520
and he’s very careful.

407
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,560
He’s similar to Samut in terms of brains.

408
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,280
He’s a thinker.

409
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:08,040
He’s always full of theories.

410
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,560
He’s an analyst.

411
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,120
But he doesn’t usually
have the guts to take action.

412
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,559
Kaen is essentially a nerd.

413
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,760
He’s shy and quiet, but he’s a genius.

414
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,240
Needless to say, he’s bullied a lot.

415
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,160
Mamay would always save him.

416
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,920
Kaen and my character have quite
a lot of conflicts in the series,

417
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:34,639
but I’ll leave that for you
to look forward to.

418
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,560
There will be a lot of turning points
all through the story.

419
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,240
You didn’t do anything, Don.

420
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,760
I did it for Mamay.

421
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,040
She wants everyone to get through this.

422
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,960
The hard part of playing Kaen is
that he and I are so unalike.

423
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,640
I’m a yapper.

424
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,040
I love talking to people.

425
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,720
Talking to people is fun to me.

426
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,520
But Kaen just doesn’t know
how to talk to people.

427
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,040
He’s afraid of speaking to people.

428
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,960
It took me a while to grasp that concept.

429
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,800
I had to work hard for that.

430
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,320
I had to learn how to move like him
and what he likes.

431
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,840
I need to know what he knows.

432
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:13,240
There’s this game show with smart students
answering different questions…

433
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,760
I think I watched 12 episodes of that.

434
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,440
That’s 12 hours!

435
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,280
Every night, I would put it on and watch.

436
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,840
Oh, one more thing…

437
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,120
I have to learn to make
coding look realistic.

438
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:27,960
I watched this… the director sent me
this video of people coding.

439
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,440
I gotta learn where to place
my fingers on the computer.

440
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,960
I have to learn the pace of my typing

441
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,376
that would make it
as realistic as possible.

442
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,560
Kaen speaks often.

443
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,199
He explains the games
or uses jargon a lot.

444
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,919
Things like, “binary code,”

445
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,760
“3.1415921535…” something like that.

446
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,840
I have to memorize them!

447
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,720
I can’t just yap my way though that.

448
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,640
I look up all of Kaen’s dialogues.

449
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,160
I want to understand him
as well as I could.

450
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,160
I like Aungpao.

451
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:01,200
I think he’s got this fire,
this passion for his role.

452
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,440
He and I have a lot in common as well.

453
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,040
(Cut.)

454
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,960
Once he puts on his glasses,
he’s become just like his character.

455
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,479
I’ve seen how hard he works ever since
we were doing the workshops together.

456
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,080
I guess it’s because
he’s a rookie as well,

457
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:26,599
so he’s always curious about
how to approach a scene.

458
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,840
I think that’s amazing of him.

459
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,160
He always takes care of people,
like opening water bottles for people,

460
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,520
small things like that.

461
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,160
He’s good.

462
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,919
This is the first time
I work with Aungpao.

463
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:39,440
And he’s such a hardworking boy.

464
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,039
He would remember all his lines
prior to filming without fail.

465
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,880
Kaen has one of the longest lines

466
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,399
since he’s the one explaining
the games to people.

467
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,096
He’s usually the only person
who understands.

468
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,599
That’s why his lines are all so long.

469
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,120
But he always says them without a hitch.

470
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,240
He’s a properly nice kid.

471
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:01,360
I do want to work more
with him in the future.

472
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:05,480
Why did you toss the dice?

473
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,039
I want to know more about this game.

474
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:08,480
Then play on your own!

475
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,136
Why did you drag all of us here with you?

476
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,240
If the game really granted wishes,

477
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,960
it could be fun to play, ain’t it?

478
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,880
I play Don.

479
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:22,119
Don is… he’s a bully, he’s bad news.
He’s devious and full of himself.

480
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:26,600
He wants to be the best,
and doesn’t care about other people.

481
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:29,439
Don is very self-assured.

482
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,399
He’s the school’s bully.

483
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,920
Just like Benz,
he isn’t afraid to use his fists.

484
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,400
I think he puts Benz
under his thumb a bit,

485
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,519
and wanting his orders followed
without questions.

486
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,119
He’s very stubborn.

487
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,559
He fights with every character.

488
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,720
Literally everyone.

489
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,480
I really like this character, Don.

490
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,280
He’s cheeky, he’s a thug,
and he’s daring.

491
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,199
Don’s got all that.

492
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:59,880
This is just the type of character
that infuriates you.

493
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,040
Don is the leader.

494
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,960
He’s like Benz’s boss.

495
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,960
Don is also a violent person.

496
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,280
He uses his fists before his brain.

497
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,640
While playing games, he’d rather
get through them with force.

498
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,480
But he’s actually a smart guy.

499
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,200
He is.

500
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,080
So I’m up against you this time?

501
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,880
It’s gonna be easy-peasy.

502
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,480
The hard part of playing
this character is…

503
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:34,880
He’s envious of people
and doesn’t like people,

504
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:39,320
while I personally
don’t feel like that much.

505
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,239
We got to do a lot of
workshops before filming,

506
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,200
and that was very fortunate for us.

507
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,599
We found the perfect designs
for our characters,

508
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,960
as the director intended.

509
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:47,759
But it took me a while to flesh him out.

510
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,799
He’s quite unfamiliar to me.

511
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,800
He’s a bully and has trouble at home.

512
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,600
So it took me a bit of time
to get to know him.

513
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:02,079
I took an extra speaking class
for this character.

514
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,760
This character is very blunt.

515
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,480
He’s quick to order people around,
while I’m not used to that at all.

516
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,879
I don’t sound intimidating

517
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,280
the way this character is supposed
to be when he’s speaking.

518
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
(Cut.)

519
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:17,760
Did I hurt you?

520
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,760
Not at all.

521
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,960
One more thing to mention is the CGI.

522
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,799
I have to work on my imagination.

523
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,079
I have to imagine walking
through walls and stuff.

524
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,080
So that part is also hard.

525
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,599
But that’s really fun.

526
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
I didn’t know we could do that
with the camera.

527
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,560
It’s been really fun.

528
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,920
I’m not lying!

529
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,960
I really saw that
when I was in that room!

530
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,280
I play Benz in this series.

531
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,839
Benz doesn’t think thoroughly.

532
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,360
He’s a follower.

533
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,840
He grew up going with the flow
of other people,

534
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,760
and dealing with problems with his fists.

535
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,616
He’s the ‘the end justifies
the mean’ kind of guy.

536
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,360
Benz is the guy I always use.

537
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,119
He’s the character that
Don spends most of his time with.

538
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,680
Benz does what Don asks of him.

539
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,560
Don probably loves him
because he does as told.

540
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,439
Benz only uses his fists
when he listens to Don.

541
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,040
They’re the kind of duo that
Don orders and Benz does as told.

542
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,080
Something like that.

543
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:24,280
He’s a daredevil of the game
and with the dice.

544
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,440
He’s also… tough and asking for trouble

545
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,480
from the people around him.

546
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,360
These two are a duo.

547
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,200
Don is the leader and Benz
kinda does what he says.

548
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,200
When these two are together,
something unexpected ought to happen.

549
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,560
That’s how it is with them.

550
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,120
Kaen thinks they’re bullies.

551
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,080
They’re mean and they hurt me.

552
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,440
They bully me.

553
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,840
They always threaten my character
with one thing or another.

554
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:57,360
The problem is that these characters
are played by P’Prom and P’Poon…

555
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,480
I’m supposed to be scared of them,

556
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,760
but these two are too funny!

557
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,680
I have to hold my laughter back.

558
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,239
I have to be scared of them.

559
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,679
But it isn’t rare for me
to break character laughing.

560
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,320
I mean, just seeing P’Poon’s face
makes me laugh.

561
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,960
(3, 2, 1.)

562
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,360
What?

563
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,040
(Cut!)

564
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:25,999
I did my research by watching films
about troubled kids.

565
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,680
My character isn’t as troubled, though.

566
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,760
From my talk session with the director,

567
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,640
this character actually
grew up in a good family.

568
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:37,840
But he surrounds himself
with bad friends in high school,

569
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,880
and start bullying people.

570
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:46,119
He’s quite different from
all my previous roles.

571
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,719
As for his skills and wits in the games,

572
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,239
he doesn’t really have that kind of thing.

573
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,120
He’s a one-layer guy.

574
00:30:52,121 --> 00:30:54,360
He says what he thinks.

575
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,520
He’s very good at improvising.

576
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,760
He would say things off-script that
makes his character more complete.

577
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
I think he’s really good.

578
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,840
This is my first time working with P’Poon.

579
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,240
He’s so determined.

580
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:09,199
He makes me feel like I should
try harder to match his energy,

581
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,880
and give a better performance.

582
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,480
We’re in the same scenes a lot.

583
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,999
Since we both get along
with people easily,

584
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,959
it takes us no time at all
to tune in as friends.

585
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,119
We hit it off right away in the workshops.

586
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:25,120
He’s very easy to work with.

587
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
Don.

588
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,040
The doors really connect!

589
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
Let go!

590
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Run!

591
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,960
I play Mark.

592
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,480
So this character is an athlete,

593
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,960
on the school’s team.

594
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,279
All he cares about is basketball.

595
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,960
He doesn’t care about studying.

596
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:50,040
I think Mark is the school’s heartthrob.

597
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,160
He’s a star athlete
who’s in love with his girlfriend.

598
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,640
He’s got a bit of a flirty side,

599
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,440
though that doesn’t come out much.

600
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:01,479
But it’s clear he’s worried and scared
sometimes in the game.

601
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:06,319
He dares to use his strength and
his brain to get things done.

602
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,880
He’s a brave guy.

603
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,560
P’Mark is older than my character,
and I have a crush on him.

604
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,240
Mark and Pie are dating in this series.

605
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,200
P’Mark is a good athlete,

606
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,440
and he’s quite popular with girls.

607
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,240
P’Mark deals with things with force

608
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,000
because he plays sports,
basketball, to be exact.

609
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,360
So he’s always so prone to using force.

610
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
P’Mark!

611
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,360
Hey! Stop it!

612
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,560
Stop it!

613
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:46,000
His background is that,

614
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,000
he’s an athlete who grew up
with just his mother.

615
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,360
I’m also close to my mom in real life,

616
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,776
so I find that
I understand him quite easily.

617
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:57,240
I make use of that
for the character design.

618
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,559
But one thing I need to
work hard on is my rizz.

619
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:07,120
The character is kind of
this charming, flirty guy,

620
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:10,480
and I gotta admit that I am nothing
like that in real life.

621
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,560
I need to be coached on that,

622
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:17,919
like how I should behave as a flirty guy.

623
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,760
And I was told I’m supposed to
use my mouth and my eyes,

624
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,520
and say something sweet sometimes.

625
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,800
Who’s my coach?

626
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,480
Well, there’s P’Prom.

627
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,519
He gives me advice.

628
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,560
He helps me a lot.

629
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,880
Jerk!

630
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
Hold up. That’s not...

631
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,320
Why are you guys laughing?

632
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:44,920
This is my first time
working with Teshow.

633
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,840
We’re actually quite far apart in age.

634
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,960
I get this feeling,
when I look at him, that…

635
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,360
Welp, I was once just like that!

636
00:33:55,640 --> 00:34:02,080
He’s got this young
and curious energy to him.

637
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,320
He yaps!

638
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:08,719
The cast has an inside joke
of posting a story

639
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:12,360
where Teshow is talking
and all seven of us are like…

640
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,760
“Umm. Okay. Hmm.”

641
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:19,480
We’d be having lunch, and
Teshow is doing his standup comedy.

642
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,760
I’ve never seen him
take a nap on set at all.

643
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,840
And if he talks to the cast
and we don’t respond well,

644
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:32,040
he’d go to the makeup artists
and wardrobe team.

645
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:37,719
I heard before that P’Poon is
the number one yapper around here.

646
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:39,360
But he just got dethroned by Teshow.

647
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,960
Poon was like, “Man, I surrender.”

648
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,520
Teshow’s amazing.

649
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,080
He never lets the set go quiet.

650
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
He talks all the time.

651
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:50,960
Everybody thought the biggest yapper,
at first, would be either me or P’Poon.

652
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,480
But nope, that title went to Teshow.

653
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,040
He’s the biggest yapper.

654
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:58,560
When everyone’s dead tired,
he’s still got the energy to speak.

655
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,480
Which is to say, he brings
colors onto our set.

656
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,959
I really like him.

657
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,440
He’s handsome, isn’t he?

658
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,560
He’s handsome and tall.

659
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,680
He’s full of potential.

660
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,760
This is his first series,

661
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,359
but there will be so many
opportunities coming his way.

662
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,720
I was telling him to get ready for it all,

663
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,880
so he should take
singing classes and whatnot.

664
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,000
Whatever he feels he lacks,
he should work on that.

665
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,520
“Don’t lose yourself,” I was saying.

666
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:31,160
He is the way he is,
and he should continue to be that.

667
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,880
Keep yapping because it’s adorable!

668
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,920
I like him like that.

669
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,160
Wow!

670
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,680
I’m someone’s senior now!

671
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
(Clipperboard, please.)

672
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
Hey.

673
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,480
I got so scared that I ran away.

674
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,560
I play Pie.

675
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:54,400
Pie is scared of everything,
and she’s dating Mark.

676
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,159
She’s always sticking to Mark.

677
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:00,040
Whether in the game or outside,
she’s right next to him.

678
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,759
Pie is the youngest among everyone.

679
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:08,760
She’s in Grade 10 while the rest
is either in Grade 11 or 12.

680
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:14,399
Since she’s a scaredy cat
and usually sticks to people,

681
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,999
she’s likely to cause some trouble,

682
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,440
but you should tune in
to the series to find out.

683
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,640
Pie always sticks to her boyfriend
and is the jealous type.

684
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:27,399
She’s, what would you say…
she’s down bad.

685
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,880
She’s always scared
when playing the games.

686
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,480
She doesn’t have the gut to take action.
She would always hide behind Mark.

687
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:38,320
In the series, Pie is the youngest.

688
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,440
She’s in Grade 10.

689
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,400
She’s quiet and silent.

690
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,559
She doesn’t speak much,

691
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:49,080
like she’s always on low energy mode.

692
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,120
When I knew I got this part,
I was really excited.

693
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:56,560
Because this seems like a challenge to me.

694
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,480
It’s full of competitions and survival.

695
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,160
It’s the genre I like.

696
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:07,960
I was glad to get the part and
I really enjoyed the screenplay.

697
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,040
The hard part is that she’s always afraid.

698
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,960
She’s verging on paranoia.

699
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
She worries about the games

700
00:37:15,241 --> 00:37:20,040
and about losing her boyfriend
to other girls.

701
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,799
I have to work on many things during
our workshops to get into character,

702
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:27,160
such as speaking louder.

703
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,080
I got to know the cast members better
through board games as well.

704
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,520
We use a lot of CGI in this series,

705
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,480
so it requires a lot of imagination
to play the role,

706
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,040
since we have to react to things
we can’t actually see.

707
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,680
I gotta control my breathing

708
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,560
like I’m actually in the game,
and that is exhausting.

709
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,560
They’re an inseparable duo.

710
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,720
They’re the lovers.

711
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:56,640
Pie would always stick to Mark.

712
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:01,359
Mark is the school’s heartthrob,

713
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,759
and Pie herself is quite popular.

714
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,200
And they’re dating, and now they’re the,

715
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,960
what do you call that…
the star couple of the school.

716
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,280
When we’re on set filming,

717
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,080
Pie would be holding on to Mark
like this at all times.

718
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,359
P’Myme and Teshow would be like this.

719
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,560
Well, P’Myme is
the smallest person on set,

720
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,760
while Teshow is the tallest person.

721
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:27,880
P’Myme looks like a koala
holding on to a tree.

722
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,640
Teshow is really tall.

723
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,800
It’s kinda funny
when I see them like that.

724
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,320
They’re adorable.

725
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,440
Teshow has to look down at her
like this when they’re talking.

726
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,880
The quietest person on set?

727
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,520
I think it’s P’Myme.

728
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,920
She’s as quiet as a mouse.

729
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,880
If you don’t talk to her,
she’s not gonna speak.

730
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,176
And of course, I have to tease her
all the time so she doesn’t get lonely.

731
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,160
If you think Prim is quiet,

732
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,680
Myme is even more so.

733
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,879
So it’s fitting that she spends
a lot of time with Teshow.

734
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
He’s the perfect company.

735
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,240
Oh?

736
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Mamay.

737
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,560
Hold on.

738
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,479
There are different locations
for our filming.

739
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,200
Sometimes we shoot in
a studio for days on end,

740
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,160
but there’s also the school
and amusement park.

741
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,959
I think we enjoy filming
in the studio the most.

742
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
It’s air-conditioned, you see.

743
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:20,039
But it’s new to us as well to film
in an amusement park,

744
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,160
so that’s a fun experience.

745
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,320
We got to do something
we’ve never done before.

746
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,159
We were filming in an amusement park
in the middle of summer.

747
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,799
- Fun!
- And it rained!

748
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,159
It was hot and raining.

749
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,840
We’d be like,
“This is too hot. I hope it rains.”

750
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,359
But then it did rain, and it was
even hotter because of the humidity.

751
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:36,839
There was literally no wind at all.

752
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,776
And the filming would halt
because it got too loud.

753
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,960
The struggle was real.

754
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,920
I did enjoy filming in an amusement park.

755
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,400
I feel like it was worth the effort.

756
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:52,480
I think the game felt really exciting
because we gotta survive the game.

757
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,080
There’s a lot of actions.

758
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:00,120
I like the scenes we filmed in the studio.

759
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,759
It just seems really new to me.

760
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,280
We really put a lot of effort
into building the whole set

761
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,960
to make these games realistic.

762
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,760
I think it will really impress people
when they get to watch it.

763
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,240
The games themselves are interesting.

764
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,080
- We can’t wait for you to see it.
- Exactly.

765
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,920
[GET READY]

766
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,680
[TO JOIN THE GAME]

767
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,360
[WHERE EVERY TURN]

768
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,480
[DEMANDS A WIN.]

769
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,360
Since there are many characters,

770
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:39,319
eight, to be exact, each scene is filmed
with a maximum of 40-50 cuts.

771
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,416
We gotta include every character’s
reaction in a scene.

772
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,959
So it takes us nearly
half a day to film one scene,

773
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,640
and sometimes, it takes even longer.

774
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,680
Right. It’s not unlike working on a film.

775
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,680
It’s an exhausting filming experience,

776
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:52,959
but also very fulfilling for all of us.

777
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,439
We work hard on this.

778
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,240
And we are proud of the work we’ve done.

779
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,440
We hope you’ll like it.

780
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,080
You have worked with Parbdee before.

781
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:13,720
Mhmm.

782
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,240
I never have.

783
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,280
It’s my first time working
with a team outside of GMMTV.

784
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,879
They take such good care of us.

785
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,159
The process of preparing
for the role is also new,

786
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,839
like the workshops and
the board game experience.

787
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,320
It feels all new to me.

788
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,160
I love it.

789
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,976
Parbdee is just as good as their name suggests.

790
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,520
You can tell everyone takes their job seriously.

791
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,080
I have worked with Parbdee
on several series,

792
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:46,080
like, Gifted and Enigma,
and now this series as well.

793
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:49,599
I can guarantee they’re going to deliver,
because they’re very professional.

794
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,440
But since this is a different director,

795
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,560
you will get to see something new.

796
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,960
It’s worth tuning in to.

797
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,640
Let go!

798
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,800
Run!

799
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,559
This is a punishment, isn’t it?

800
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,560
The real villain here is
the one you’re protecting.

801
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,960
Why should you tune in?

802
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:13,759
Well, it’s a bit action-packed and
you get to solve different puzzles.

803
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,080
It’s also a bit of a thriller series.

804
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:21,040
I think this is quite rare from GMMTV.

805
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,320
The cast is also very nice,

806
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:28,400
and everyone works really hard
for this series.

807
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,440
This series will take you to a world
you never knew before.

808
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:36,399
It’s a bit fantasy and board game-coded.

809
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,559
There’ll be betrayal, friendship,
and different relationship dynamics.

810
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,039
The characters themselves are diverse.

811
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,320
I do hope you’re looking forward
to The Dark Dice.

812
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,520
You’ll get to see human nature.

813
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:56,319
Of course each player has
their purpose for playing this game,

814
00:42:56,320 --> 00:43:01,960
so the idea is to see what makes
each character do what they do.

815
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,319
These eight characters, to me, feels like

816
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,679
when you’re choosing an avatar in a game.

817
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,399
You have to root for someone.

818
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,399
You see yourself in someone.

819
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,200
There are so many characters
for you to root for.

820
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:19,600
There are different mechanics that
make a scene seem even more realistic.

821
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,320
Filming with these machines is really exciting.

822
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,560
It makes me wary of how it would go.

823
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,120
It’s pretty scary.

824
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:32,920
That’s one of the hard parts as well.

825
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:34,240
It’s just binge-worthy.

826
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:35,800
I can’t wait for you to see it.

827
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,960
It’s really fun.

828
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:44,800
I hope you root for my character, Samut.

829
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,159
This is a different role for me.

830
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,719
I think it’s just the kind of
series you’ll enjoy.

831
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:51,440
Please check it out.

832
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,639
Please root for my character.

833
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:56,000
I’ll be playing Aom in The Dark Dice.

834
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,456
I promise you every episode
will get you on the edge of your seat.

835
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,000
Bye.

836
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:01,599
Please look out for my character, Mamay.

837
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,360
Join this game and root for us.

838
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,439
I want you to root for every character,

839
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,159
and hope each of us get through the game.

840
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,840
Look out for The Dark Dice.

841
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:13,119
Please watch out for Kaen.

842
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:15,639
This character’s entirely
different from me.

843
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,599
I don’t usually get to play
a character like him.

844
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:18,919
I’m really happy to get the role.

845
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:20,840
I work hard to design this character,

846
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,520
so I do hope you’ll tune in to see him.

847
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,039
Please root for everyone else as well.

848
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,040
They also work hard for this series

849
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,280
Keep Don in your heart, guys.

850
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,000
This character is quite new to me.

851
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,800
I work really hard
to portray him in this series.

852
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,040
Please look forward to The Dark Dice.

853
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,439
Please root for this stray puppy
of a character, guys.

854
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,439
Benz really stands out
among all my roles.

855
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,560
Please look forward to seeing
my character, Mark.

856
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,360
This is my series debut.

857
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,520
So please root for me
