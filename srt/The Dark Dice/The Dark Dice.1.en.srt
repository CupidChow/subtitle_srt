1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,480
We’re recording.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:07,840
Zoom in.

3
00:00:08,690 --> 00:00:10,260
What are Atom and Samut arguing about?

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,280
What’s that all about?

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,980
- Oh!
- Look!

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,370
Atom!

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:17,780
What’s going on?

8
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:18,890
Go take a look!

9
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,090
Atom!

10
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:20,890
Go and check him out.

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,940
Wait.

12
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,500
What’s happened?

13
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:26,490
Atom!

14
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,390
Atom!

15
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,120
Atom!

16
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,130
What the hell’s going on?

17
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:30,740
Go get a teacher here!

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,070
Call an ambulance!

19
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,080
Hurry!

20
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:34,390
He’s gone too far!

21
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,750
Atom!

22
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:37,590
He’s bleeding.

23
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:39,200
Aren’t you friends?

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
Samut.

25
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,460
Samut, we’re here.

26
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,950
Dad.

27
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,500
Maybe I don’t have to go to school.

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
Of course, you do.

29
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,000
Education comes first.

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,600
Just think of your future.

31
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,500
You don’t have to worry about money.

32
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,500
I can figure something out.

33
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,070
LOAN AGREEMENT

34
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,550
All you have to do is focus on your study.

35
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,200
Forget about what happened.

36
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:24,330
You’re starting over with a clean slate.

37
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,790
Alright?

38
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,300
Look at this kid dancing.

39
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,810
You can tell he doesn’t know
what he’s doing!

40
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:38,830
You’re so right.

41
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,620
You guys, don’t bully him.

42
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,340
Yes, Madam President.

43
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:46,800
Can you hold off your lecture for,
like, five minutes?

44
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,580
You’re spoiling all the fun!

45
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,610
That’s so true.

46
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,890
- Alright, alright.
- It’s just for laughs and giggles.

47
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,080
What is he even doing!

48
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,300
Oh, she’s here.

49
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,390
Class, pay attention.

50
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,110
Good morning, Miss.

51
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,500
Good morning, everyone.

52
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:09,500
We have a transfer student today.

53
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,180
- You make sure to be nice…
- No one moves school mid-term.

54
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,500
…unless they’re bad news.

55
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,340
Don’t you think?
- Definitely.

56
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,570
Oh, but he’s hot!

57
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:23,570
Why don’t you introduce yourself?

58
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:28,770
My name is Samut.

59
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,440
Nice to meet you.

60
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:34,770
Wait… I’ve seen him before.

61
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,780
Isn’t he the guy in that video
who bashes his friend?

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,920
- Oh, he is.
- Look it up.

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
Here.

64
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,140
- Let me see.
- That’s so scary.

65
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,460
That’s him.

66
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,000
- How could he do such a thing?
- I think it’s definitely him.

67
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,400
Everyone, be quiet.

68
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,200
Keep your phones away.

69
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,800
Don’t you know what time it is?

70
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,500
You can take the empty seat over there.

71
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,160
Go on.

72
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,230
Yes.

73
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,670
Mamay.

74
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,000
I trust you’ll take care of
our new friend.

75
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,170
Yes.

76
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,700
Now get ready for our lesson.
Open your textbook.

77
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,300
Turn to page 50.

78
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:31,130
Mamay, did you bring your textbook?

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,240
Of course.

80
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,160
I swear I keep forgetting
this class exists.

81
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,410
Atom, you jerk!

82
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,660
Shit!

83
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,570
I heard the student who got punched
had to be in the ICU.

84
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:45,700
I’ll bet you anything he got expelled
and had to move to our school.

85
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,290
Look at this.

86
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,400
The comments are brutal, too.

87
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,970
Look.

88
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:07,600
I kinda crave some ice cream today.

89
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,700
- Let’s go, then. It’s been a while.
- Let’s do that.

90
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,020
Mamay, you wanna come out
for some ice cream with us?

91
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,700
I’m on student committee duty.

92
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,990
I don’t think I can make it.

93
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,176
You guys should go on ahead.

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,900
You work way too hard, you know that?

95
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:20,940
We’re off, then.

96
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:21,860
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

97
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,570
- Think of me when you have it!
- We will.

98
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,980
- See you.
- Bye-bye.

99
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,820
Mamay.

100
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,930
Go down to the Headmaster’s office later.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
He wants to talk to you.

102
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,540
Yes.

103
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Samut.

104
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
You, too.

105
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,710
Yes.

106
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,700
What do you mean, Headmaster?

107
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,700
I need you to see...

108
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:54,200
if there’s any academic club
that still needs new members

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,760
so Samut can join.

110
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,400
But we usually take
the student’s GPA into account, sir.

111
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:04,200
I guess you didn’t know, then, Napassorn?

112
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:09,100
Samut has won countless
academic awards at his previous school.

113
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,300
But each school has their own criteria.

114
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,380
Wouldn’t this be disadvantageous
to our students?

115
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,290
Isn’t Mr. Samut ‘our’ student?

116
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,420
Alright.

117
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,940
Give him a tour of our school’s clubs.

118
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
I’ll leave him with you.

119
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,440
Of course.

120
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,050
So… what are you good at?

121
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,780
I need to know so I can give you
some recommendations.

122
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,600
You can choose for me.

123
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,800
I don’t mind anything.

124
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:07,500
Our school is renowned
for our academics and sports.

125
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,050
Our students win awards every year.

126
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,376
CONGRATULATIONS TO
MR. NATDANAI PREEDASIRIKUL

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,760
You might be considered outstanding
at your previous school,

128
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,900
but here, if you’re not good enough,

129
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,110
I don’t think there’s a place for you.

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,400
There’s no place for you here.

131
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,450
I don’t mind not joining any clubs.

132
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,300
You can just tell the Headmaster
I’m not qualified.

133
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:44,250
You don’t think
I’m one of you anyway, do you?

134
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,900
I’m sorry for what I said.

135
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,290
I… don’t think you’re a bad person.

136
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,220
Did you know

137
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,100
you’re looking at me like I’m a bully,
the way everyone is?

138
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:40,800
Well, is it true?

139
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,090
Are you who everyone says you are?

140
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:47,950
This is exactly why no one
wants to be your friend!

141
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,160
- He’s bleeding!
- Did you have to do that to him?

142
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,310
I…

143
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,560
What is that building?

144
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,100
It used to be a gymnasium,

145
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,100
but now it’s just for storage.

146
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,500
It’s been out of use for ages.

147
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:19,290
There was this rumor that some student
disappeared there 30 years ago.

148
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,350
No one goes there anymore.

149
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,450
I think someone did.

150
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,940
Kaen.

151
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,650
What do you think you’re doing!

152
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,200
We’re not doing anything.

153
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:01,270
Help!

154
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,430
Help me!

155
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,170
Please!

156
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,060
Kaen!

157
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,250
Mamay.

158
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,140
Careful.

159
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:15,150
Why are you doing this?

160
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,100
We’re not doing anything.

161
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,090
He was already locked inside
that locker when we got here.

162
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,040
Am I right, Kaen?

163
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,190
Hmm?

164
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,300
Kaen, don’t be afraid.

165
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,830
You can tell me. I’ll help you.

166
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,810
It was someone else.

167
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,850
These two didn’t do anything.

168
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:46,600
See? That’s exactly what I said!

169
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:50,500
But you might wanna keep your nose
out of people’s business, Prez.

170
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,510
Hey, Don.

171
00:10:57,810 --> 00:10:59,690
That’s the new student
everyone’s talking about.

172
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,680
Hey.

173
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:04,200
Didn’t you get expelled ’cause
you punched someone?

174
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,100
I don’t care how tough you were
back in your old school,

175
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,610
but I’m dying to find out.

176
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,800
All you have to do is focus on your study.

177
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:30,930
Forget about what happened.

178
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,180
You’re starting over with a clean slate.

179
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,600
I don’t fight.

180
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,570
I’ll back away.

181
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,950
Oww.

182
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,280
We thought you’d be tough,
but as it turned out, you’re just a wimp.

183
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:54,220
What was the beef with your pal
that he deserved such a pounding?

184
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,400
Was it over some candies?

185
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,200
I’m a wimp.

186
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,170
But at least I’m not stupid enough
to bully someone

187
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,270
and leave evidence behind.

188
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:12,650
Didn’t you know the blood and
your footprints would be easy proof?

189
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:20,010
And those who choose to bully a student
who’s made a name for their school,

190
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,550
thinking they’d get away with it…

191
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,670
are the stupidest.

192
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,190
Screw you!

193
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,310
You jerk!

194
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,729
Stop it right now
or I’m calling the teacher!

195
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,390
Stay out of people’s business,
you snitch!

196
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,100
Don’t think anyone will come
and save you.

197
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,420
What the hell is going on?

198
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,850
Shit.

199
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,120
What the hell happened?

200
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,570
Don.

201
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,540
Don?

202
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,710
Don, is that you?

203
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,800
It’s me.

204
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,140
I’m here.

205
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,270
- Kaen?
- Don?

206
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,800
- Kaen, are you alright?
- I’m here.

207
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,900
Don.

208
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,330
Mamay.

209
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,490
Look.

210
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,300
This isn’t the old gymnasium.

211
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,100
What the hell happened?

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,600
Huh?

213
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,730
What the hell did you do?

214
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,500
We didn’t do anything.

215
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,940
You’re Mark from Class 4.

216
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,250
And that’s…

217
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:08,170
Her name’s Pie.

218
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,100
What are you doing here?

219
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,500
I was in the closet with Pie.

220
00:15:15,070 --> 00:15:16,500
Suddenly there was an earthquake.

221
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:20,790
I was just looking for an exit,
but this is where the door led us to.

222
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:29,510
So everyone was in the old gym
before we got here?

223
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:33,000
What is this place?

224
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:07,400
Welcome, all eight players,
to Djehuty, the game of wits,

225
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,110
where all your desires will come true.

226
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
Game?

227
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,170
What the hell are you talking about!

228
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:20,400
My phone isn’t working.

229
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,060
What the hell?

230
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:48,490
What?

231
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,600
That’s impossible.

232
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,180
Damn, Don.

233
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,140
The doors really are all connected!

234
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:26,950
Damn…

235
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:28,740
Isn’t that amazing?

236
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,600
Amazing, my ass.

237
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,200
How are we going to get out of here?

238
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,970
There’s one more person.

239
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,300
The voice welcomed eight players.

240
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,910
Right now,

241
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,160
there are only seven of us.

242
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,980
He’s right.

243
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,180
Guys.

244
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,900
This room isn’t like the rest.

245
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,090
Someone’s on the floor.

246
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:48,100
She’s one of us.

247
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,100
Do any of you know her?

248
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,470
Hey.

249
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:02,840
Hey.

250
00:19:07,810 --> 00:19:08,810
Hey.

251
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,860
Easy! Easy!

252
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Easy!

253
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,800
My name is Mamay.

254
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,400
I’m the student president.

255
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,620
What’s your name?

256
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:26,590
Aom.

257
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,250
My name is Aom.

258
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,590
Uhh…

259
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,270
Do you remember how you got here, Aom?

260
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,600
I don’t remember anything.

261
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,600
Next thing I know I was here.

262
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,490
All eight players, get ready for the game.

263
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,900
Players, choose a room.

264
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:34,610
Ugh!

265
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:36,660
I ain’t playing your stupid game!

266
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,030
I’m going home!

267
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,490
You hear me?

268
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:40,950
I’m going home!

269
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:42,790
Hello?

270
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,790
What game is he talking about, Mark?

271
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
I don’t know, either.

272
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,810
Should we just play along with the voice?

273
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,300
Will we be able to leave
if we do play the game?

274
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,840
Are you insane?

275
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,540
Who the hell would be up for a game
in this situation?

276
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:02,700
Use your damn brains.

277
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,500
Hey, what are you doing?

278
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,000
I can’t get in!

279
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,830
There are eight doors.

280
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:58,300
You can’t get in this room
because I’ve taken it.

281
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,200
You must choose your own.

282
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
Hey.

283
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,110
What are you doing?

284
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,980
Aom got in.

285
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,000
Mamay. We have to choose.

286
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:22,690
Umm.

287
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,710
Mark.

288
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,210
Pie.

289
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,570
You get in that room behind you.

290
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,820
I’ll choose another one.

291
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:26,840
Player, place your hand on top of the box.

292
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:51,530
You are assigned as a Detective.

293
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,190
Detective?

294
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,900
The Murder of a Student.

295
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,300
In 1995, a gruesome crime occurred.

296
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,180
A student was murdered,

297
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,290
and her body was hidden
inside this school.

298
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,371
3 SEP 1995
and her body was hidden
inside this school.

299
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:20,890
Players will be assigned as Detectives

300
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:24,500
and must find the hidden body
within this school.

301
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,780
The body is hidden inside a classroom
in the secondary school building.

302
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,690
Players are allowed to ask for clues

303
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,400
by communicating
with the ghost of the victim,

304
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:41,300
through the medium coins,
in which each player will receive three.

305
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,290
There are two options
when communicating with the spirit:

306
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,600
One, to answer whether the body
is hidden in a certain room.

307
00:24:57,220 --> 00:25:02,100
Two, to ask the direction of the room
in which the body is hidden.

308
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,440
Detectives have one hour
to search for the body.

309
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:15,500
The game will conclude when a Detective
has correctly located the body.

310
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:18,990
The Detective with the wrong answer

311
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:25,180
will be punished
by confinement by the ghost of the victim.

312
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,200
Choose your answer wisely,

313
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,190
or you will never leave the place.

314
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,710
Mark!

315
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,460
Mamay.

316
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,400
Are we… back to school?

317
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,000
Is there such a thing at our school?

318
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,600
I’m not playing this stupid game.

319
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,090
Don!

320
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,350
What?

321
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,690
We can’t leave?

322
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,900
1995.

323
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:57,750
Everyone, check this out.

324
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:06,890
MISSING STUDENT

325
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:13,720
We’re not back to school.

326
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,920
This is more likely
the location of the game.

327
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,350
Do you remember what the game said?

328
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,500
The Murder of a Student.

329
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,000
Are we… in the year 1995?

330
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:37,800
Maybe… this has something to do with
that rumor of a missing student?

331
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,050
MUTHITA

332
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
It means we have to complete
this game, doesn’t it?

333
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,700
Where is the body?

334
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:49,650
I remember.

335
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:53,300
It said the body is hidden in one of
the classes in the secondary building.

336
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,170
Let’s work together to find the body

337
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,200
and quickly get out of here.

338
00:28:58,830 --> 00:29:00,100
And if we can’t find the body?

339
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,540
Didn’t it say we’d be stuck here forever?

340
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:07,360
Let’s just play the game.

341
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,700
We won’t get out of here
if we don’t do anything.

342
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:57,800
So we really must play?

343
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,460
According to the rules of the game,

344
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,490
we must find the body in this building.

345
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,500
Time is already ticking.

346
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,300
What should we do?

347
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,820
The coins.

348
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:16,950
Did you all receive some coins?

349
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,400
I think we have to use these coins
to win this game together.

350
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,950
Together?

351
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
What do you mean?

352
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,900
Let’s use our coins
in each classroom to find the body.

353
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,520
What do you think?

354
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:34,000
It said you will be confined here
if you get the answer wrong.

355
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:36,100
Who would risk that?

356
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,940
Would you?

357
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,600
I think we should start
by eliminating the wrong choices.

358
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,190
The secondary school building
has four classrooms on each floor.

359
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:14,096
Four people should enter
the four rooms on the first floor

360
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,600
and use one coin to ask whether
the body is hidden in the rooms above it.

361
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,820
The other four should go to
the higher floors

362
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,340
and enter the first classroom
on each floor.

363
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,000
Use one coin to ask whether the body is
hidden in any of the next rooms.

364
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,370
If we do this,

365
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,930
it should take no more than two coins each
before we find the body.

366
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:38,670
Let’s do that, then.

367
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,560
Let’s go.

368
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:52,450
GRADE 7 CLASS 1

369
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,240
The secondary school classrooms
are on this floor and beyond.

370
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,804
We need four people
for these four classrooms.

371
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:05,603
Who should enter which room, then?

372
00:32:07,652 --> 00:32:09,104
I’ll take one room upstairs.

373
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,474
You girls should take the ones
on this floor.

374
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:14,738
You don’t have to exhaust yourselves
climbing the stairs.

375
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:16,655
I’m going with you, Mark.

376
00:32:18,275 --> 00:32:19,309
Me, too.

377
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:23,204
Mamay and Aom should stay on this floor.

378
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,333
I don’t wanna waste my time walking.

379
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,027
I’m taking one room on this floor as well.

380
00:32:30,095 --> 00:32:31,407
I’ll take one room upstairs.

381
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,580
So the ones who take
the classrooms upstairs

382
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,360
must enter the room on the far left,

383
00:32:36,473 --> 00:32:38,104
and ask about the rooms on the right.

384
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:39,668
Do I understand that correctly?

385
00:32:39,692 --> 00:32:40,692
Yes.

386
00:32:41,669 --> 00:32:44,998
Let’s meet back here
once we get our clues.

387
00:32:45,989 --> 00:32:46,989
Let’s go.

388
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:17,269
Pie.

389
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:18,378
Don’t be scared.

390
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:20,300
I’ll see you right after.

391
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:23,403
You take the Grade 8-1 classroom.

392
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:45,923
I’ll take this one.

393
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,450
GRADE 9 CLASS 1

394
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,170
GRADE 10 CLASS 1

395
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:09,210
You take this one.

396
00:34:09,352 --> 00:34:10,352
I’ll go upstairs.

397
00:34:10,992 --> 00:34:11,992
Okay.

398
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:25,210
GRADE 11 CLASS 1

399
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:25,890
Help…

400
00:35:27,618 --> 00:35:28,618
Help me.

401
00:35:32,183 --> 00:35:33,183
Help.

402
00:35:34,901 --> 00:35:35,901
Help me.

403
00:35:40,933 --> 00:35:41,933
Help.

404
00:35:43,676 --> 00:35:44,676
Help me.

405
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,130
GRADE 11 CLASS 1

406
00:36:41,606 --> 00:36:42,606
Pie, calm down.

407
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,860
Will you please tell me what happened?

408
00:36:45,209 --> 00:36:46,209
Yeah.

409
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:47,307
What did you see, Pie?

410
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
I…

411
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,703
I entered the room

412
00:36:56,075 --> 00:36:58,403
and saw that there was a phone
in the middle of the room.

413
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,630
When I put the coin in,

414
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:03,900
someone was calling for help
at the other end.

415
00:37:07,523 --> 00:37:09,600
I got so scared that I ran away.

416
00:37:10,852 --> 00:37:13,450
So you didn’t even ask for any clues.

417
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,503
You shouldn’t be playing this kind of game
if you’re so easily frightened.

418
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,175
Don’t scold her.

419
00:37:21,667 --> 00:37:23,000
I’m sure she didn’t mean to.

420
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:29,050
Everyone’s playing this for the first time
so it makes sense to be confused.

421
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:32,706
But you seem to handle this pretty well.

422
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:39,806
What about the rest of you?

423
00:37:40,323 --> 00:37:42,203
I entered the Grade 7-2 classroom

424
00:37:42,338 --> 00:37:44,100
and the light flickered,

425
00:37:44,670 --> 00:37:46,152
and then it just turned red.

426
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:49,310
I think that means the body
isn’t in any classrooms above it.

427
00:37:51,993 --> 00:37:54,007
I saw a flickering light
that turned red, too.

428
00:37:55,446 --> 00:37:57,010
The light in my classroom turned green.

429
00:38:03,973 --> 00:38:07,207
I remember that after I pushed
the button on the phone…

430
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,652
The light suddenly turned green.

431
00:38:25,638 --> 00:38:26,983
And I saw…

432
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,006
someone’s silhouette above me.

433
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:38,303
It means the body is in one of the rooms
above the Grade 7-3 classroom.

434
00:38:39,501 --> 00:38:40,701
I think so.

435
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:43,690
Did the light turn green
in anyone else’s classroom?

436
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:46,358
Mine turned red.

437
00:38:48,090 --> 00:38:49,090
Mine as well.

438
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:50,290
Same here.

439
00:38:51,315 --> 00:38:52,875
The light in my classroom turned green.

440
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,333
I entered, saw the light flicker,
and then…

441
00:38:57,630 --> 00:39:00,350
saw the shape of someone lying
on the floor to the right of the room.

442
00:39:00,455 --> 00:39:01,455
Yep.

443
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:05,003
I think we found where the body is hidden!

444
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,601
We got a clue from Mamay in...

445
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,703
the classroom of Grade 7-3,

446
00:39:18,943 --> 00:39:21,806
and from Benz in the classroom
of Grade 9-1.

447
00:39:22,876 --> 00:39:25,244
That means the body is hidden
in the classroom of…

448
00:39:27,815 --> 00:39:28,815
Grade 9 Class 3!

449
00:39:30,524 --> 00:39:31,524
Let’s go.

450
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,250
GRADE 9 CLASS 3

451
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,220
It is this room, isn’t it?

452
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:58,506
I will enter and answer

453
00:39:59,121 --> 00:40:00,303
so we can all go home.

454
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
Help.

455
00:40:43,812 --> 00:40:44,812
Help me.

456
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,080
Help.

457
00:40:51,489 --> 00:40:52,489
Help m...

458
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:21,886
The Detective has given
an incorrect answer.

459
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:25,307
The Detective will be
punished by confinement.

460
00:41:31,898 --> 00:41:32,898
Mamay?

461
00:41:33,276 --> 00:41:33,881
Mamay!

462
00:41:33,966 --> 00:41:35,001
How could it be wrong?

463
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,286
Mamay!

464
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:39,596
Mamay!

465
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,100
Can you hear me?

466
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
Mamay!

467
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:45,330
It won’t open.

468
00:41:45,752 --> 00:41:46,752
Mamay!

469
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,720
You said the body is hidden
in this classroom!

470
00:41:49,524 --> 00:41:50,524
How did we get it wrong?

471
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,603
I don’t know.

472
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,003
The clues led us here.

473
00:41:56,373 --> 00:41:57,707
It wasn’t supposed to be wrong.

474
00:42:00,743 --> 00:42:02,423
Maybe this stupid game is messing with us.

475
00:42:12,666 --> 00:42:14,016
I don’t wanna waste my time walking.

476
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,400
I’m taking one room on this floor.

477
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,524
Mamay and Aom should stay on this floor.

478
00:42:18,796 --> 00:42:20,204
I’ll take one room upstairs.

479
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,106
I’m going with you, Mark.

480
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,270
I’ll take this one.

481
00:42:27,387 --> 00:42:29,307
What if it’s not the game
that’s messing with us,

482
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,050
but one of us is?

483
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,100
What do you mean?

484
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,300
I think one of us is lying.

485
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,420
What if it’s not the game
that’s messing with us,

486
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,606
but one of us is?

487
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:10,658
You have been assigned as an Accomplice.

488
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,210
One person among the six of you
must be a mole.

489
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,223
Seven of us,

490
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:13,983
with you included.

491
00:43:14,084 --> 00:43:15,190
Are you accusing me, you jerk!

492
00:43:15,210 --> 00:43:16,298
Why are you fighting?

493
00:43:21,976 --> 00:43:23,170
It was Mamay who was lying!

494
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:24,920
We’re running out of time.

495
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:26,003
Let’s split up.

496
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,206
She’s the mole.
