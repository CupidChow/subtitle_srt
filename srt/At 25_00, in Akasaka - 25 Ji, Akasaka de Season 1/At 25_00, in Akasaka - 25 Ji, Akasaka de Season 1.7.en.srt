00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,270
(Dear Mom)

2
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:08,510
Ever since I was child,

3
00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:10,750
everyone praised how I looked.

4
00:00:10,910 --> 00:00:13,060
That I'm pretty and cute.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,590
My mom was a model

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,750
who was proud and confident
in her own beauty.

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,330
But after she'd taken me to England
because of my dad's job,

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,420
her pride was destroyed.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,800
Even though she wanted to
keep working as a model there,

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,360
no one paid her any attention.

11
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,980
Mom?

12
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,850
Asami.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,530
I've told you many times

14
00:00:58,610 --> 00:01:01,960
when you smile,
don't show your teeth.

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,990
You were born
with a beautiful face.

16
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:13,200
Understood?

17
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,510
Mm.

18
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:45,910
(Thank you, Mom)

19
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,520
To my mom,

20
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:51,830
what mattered most was
her son must be beautiful.

21
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,540
The secret to living with
someone sensitive like my mom

22
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,910
was to make myself numb,

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,090
to keep everything inside,

24
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:05,490
to never reveal how I felt.

25
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,688
Hayama,

26
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,478
the film study club invited you?

27
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:19,990
Mm.

28
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,220
Sekimizu begged you, didn't he?

29
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,420
He's been saying behind your back

30
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:26,200
you can be used to bring people in.

31
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,380
Eh? Is that so?

32
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:30,980
Just "Eh?"?

33
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,080
Aren't you mad?

34
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,180
Mihara?

35
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:40,440
Mm?

36
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,140
I trust you're well.

37
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,810
No, that's not the answer.

38
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,160
Mm. Let's do this.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,820
Great.

40
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,330
Ah! Sorry for the wait.

41
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,740
Can you go over there?

42
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:55,060
Thank you for helping out.

43
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,250
Have you ever acted, Hayama?

44
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,920
No, I haven't.

45
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,400
Ah, you see.

46
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,730
Just having you
stand there will help a lot.

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,480
You don't need to try hard.

48
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,660
- Got it.
- Mm.

49
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,170
Okay.

50
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,190
- Explain the lines to him.
- Yes.

51
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,440
Uh, these are your lines.

52
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,720
You just have to yell at him.
Your lines are...

53
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,260
- Uh...
- There?

54
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,930
Oh, yes. There.

55
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,620
Okay. Thank you.

56
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,670
Oh, mm.

57
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,420
Uh, do your best.

58
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,810
Is everyone in place?

59
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,850
- Rolling.
- Yes.

60

61
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,670

63
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,930
Acting was more fun than I thought.

64
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,560
After the filming,

65
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,010
I started watching more films.

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,860
I researched that a lot.

So you lied.

72
00:04:21,530 --> 00:04:22,730
Did you mean it?

73
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:27,610
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

74
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,120
It's unforgivable!

75
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
For me, you're...

00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,660

The Hayama-kun guy is very cool.

80
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,030
- Yes. He's very good-looking.
- Right?

81
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,770
I might join this club.

82
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:12,260

they don't watch my acting."

to hurt someone

and pretending to
not know how they feel.

137
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:27,410
If they keep doing that,

138
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,230
one day they won't
know who they are.

139
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:36,150
"Who's the actor in that role?"

140

I had that thought.

The original lines
are already good.

147
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,650
The changes you suggested

148
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,120
will make the story inorganic.

149
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,760
Jeez, that kid doesn't know
how to read the room.

150
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,560
He must feel alienated
in a group setting.

151
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,590
- I see. Go with the original lines.
- How nice.

152
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,720
- Use the original lines in scene ten.
- Being like that might feel nice.

153
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,870
He's the opposite of you, Hayama.

154
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,560
I wonder if someone like that...

155
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,280
will become an actor someday.

156
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,360
Since then,

157
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,080
the next thing I knew,
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

158
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,306
- Are you going to Tokyo?
- Who?

159
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,220
No, I'm not.

160
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,810
You must be going there.

161
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,700
Tokyo?

162
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,380
(What I don't know is my own path.
To the bigger world.)

163
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,830
Here's what I've learned
about Shirasaki-kun.

164
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,260
He's always by himself.

165
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:26,930
He has a sweet tooth

166
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:30,030
so he always puts
sugar and milk in his coffee.

167
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,010
- Right?
- Why did you improvise just now?

168
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,529
It doesn't go with
the important dialogue later.

169
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,020
No matter who it was,
he faced them with candidness.

170
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,760
- The dialogue here is crucial.
- I get it now.

171
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,290
Shirasaki-kun and I

172
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,310
were completely different.

173
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,700
We would never see eye to eye.

174
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,490
The dialogue after this
is crucial too.

175
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,870
Eh?

176
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,780
That kid.

177
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,850
Look.

178
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,530

from the film study club.

179
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,580
Oh.

180
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,410
That's Shirasaki-kun.

181
00:12:20,570 --> 00:12:22,400
Whoa, that's weird.

182
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,140
You remember
a junior's face and name.

183
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,460
Well.

184
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,690
I said that kid

185
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,870
was the opposite of you, right?

186
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:36,230
But you're actually alike.

187
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,600
Eh?

188
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,720
Well, he's...

189
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,740
the type without a shell.

190
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,231
The way he talks, behaves,
his social etiquette,

191
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,740
or his ability to read people.

192
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,750
He's like, "Yes, go ahead."

193
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,840
He's like that.

194
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,760
- Mm.
- But you, Hayama,

195
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:56,410
are the type with
a many-layered shell...

196
00:12:56,710 --> 00:13:00,160
people can't tell
what you're really thinking.

197
00:13:02,513 --> 00:13:05,387
So we have nothing in common.

198
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,560
I guess not

199
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,270
but it must be hard to live

200
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,900
both for you and that kid.

201
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,630
Hayama,

202
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,940
you have so many walls

203
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,510
you don't know
what you're thinking.

204
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,450
You're scouted by
a model agency from Tokyo.

205
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,690
Isn't that wonderful?

206
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:51,630
A handsome guy like you
is different from us.

207
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,360
- Mm.
- Yes, it's wonderful.

208
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,320
No way.

209
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,840
You won't work
as an actor, Hayama-san?

210
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:03,210
That's not right.

211
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,060
Ah, that's right.

212
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,400
Shirasaki-kun's still the same.

213
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:17,690
- So inconsiderate.
- I actually want to act.

214
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,440
I know.

215
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,040
I didn't realize that.

216
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,560
And the one who made me realize
was Shirasaki-kun.

217
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,290
Sorry, please give me
a different pose.

218
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:35,900
To me, he's my most
beautiful memory

219
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,900
and a special person.

220
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,570
You won't work
as an actor, Hayama-san?

221
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,110
That's not right.

222
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,670
But memories are memories.

223
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,170
My world and Shirasaki-kun's world
would never meet

224
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,640
no matter what I think.

225
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,790
(Hiru no Yume)

226
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:12,670
(Shirasaki Yuki)

227
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:14,280
But Shirasaki Yuki

228
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,680
appeared before me again.

229
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,730
(Shirasaki Yuki)

230
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,590
Hayama-san's here.

231
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,460
Good morning.

232
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,720
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

233
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,470
I was so anxious to see you again

234
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,660
after so many years.

235
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,310
Nervous?

236
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:54,550
Oh, yes.

237
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,640
(Sugar)

238
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,020
Delicious.

239
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,240
No matter the genre,
or what type of scene or role,

240
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:16,150
creating is always difficult.

241
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,290
I felt incredibly happy.

242
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,400
Since then he...

243
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,140
You haven't changed, Shirasaki-kun.

244
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,280
Eh?

245
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,690
I'm looking forward to
being your boyfriend.

246
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,420
Eh? Have we met before?

247
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,530
- Uh, I don't think so.
- First time here?

248
00:16:47,190 --> 00:16:48,010
Yes.

249
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,530
Oh. The film study club.

250
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,320
That kid from the film study club
called Shirasaki-kun

251
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,560
is at the bar I work right now.

252
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,500
The next thing I knew,
I was running.

253
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,700
The next thing I knew,
I already kissed you.

254
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,570
Until the filming's over,

255
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,530
Shirasaki-kun and I
would be a couple.

256
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,220
Why couldn't I leave

257
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,880
Shirasaki-kun alone?

258
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,060
Oh, Asami-san.

259
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,810
Hello.

260
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:14,400
Should I stay over tonight?

261
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:15,620
Huh?

262
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:20,460
I wish the filming would never end.

263
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,380
So that's what...

264
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,020
the word "like" is all about.

265
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,670
I'm looking forward
to our sensual kiss scene.

266
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:47,280
Yuki, let's check out
the onsen together.

267
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:47,920
Eh?

268
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,650
The onsen here is famous.

269
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,470
Uh...

270
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,560
Going to the onsen with Yamase-kun?

271
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,960
No.

272
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:35,060
When I'm with Shirasaki-kun,

273
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,760
I feel like my shell
is being pried off.

274
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,317
What I've got hidden,

275
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:52,770
covered up,

276
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,580
and stored away
is about to be revealed.

277
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,280
You two were wonderful.

278
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:32,540
Shall we rehearse?

279
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,110
Our kiss scene tomorrow.

280
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,940
I finally understood...

281
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,100
I don't wanna give Shirasaki-kun...

282
00:20:54,210 --> 00:20:55,770
to anyone.

283
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:02,460
Hey, about the person
you still can't get over.

284
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,520
You said, "There's someone
I can't get over."

285
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,420
Mm.

286
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,980
So... you like that person?

287
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:17,300
Mm.

288
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,230
I do.

289
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,320
It really felt like a dream.

290
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,880
I'm gonna stop...

291
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,630
being your boyfriend, Hayama-san.

292
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,560
I don't need to rely on you
anymore, Hayama-san.

293
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:19,920
But eventually
I have to wake up from this dream.

294
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,253
The script for the last episode.
Please do your best.

295
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,500
Thank you very much.

296
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,830
Please do your best.

297
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,090
Thank you very much.

298
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,420
Ryouji and Takumi

299
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,200
press their lips together
as if to affirm their feelings.

300
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,270
And they...

301
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,040
become one for the first time.

302
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,380
I have no idea...

303
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,500
how to touch Shirasaki-kun

304
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,690
who's keeping me at arm's length.

305
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,580
I have no idea.

306
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:41,870
(Next episode)

307
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:44,440
It's been fun
acting in my first drama.

308
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:47,700
I won't force you
to stay in character anymore.

309
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,910
Why do I keep
thinking about Hayama-san?

310
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,460
Can you hold me?

311
00:23:53,992 --> 00:23:55,052
It sounds fun.
