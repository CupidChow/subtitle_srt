1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I like you.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I like you, Ryouji-san.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Cut!

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Again, please.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Shirasaki-kun, that was good

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
but the word "like"

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
should sound more overwhelming.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Understood.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,000
It's okay. Calm down.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Excuse me.

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
You can do it.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
- Rolling!
- Rolling!

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
- Please roll camera!
- Roll camera!

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Take two.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
All right. Action!

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I like you.

17
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I like you, Ryouji-san.

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Cut!

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Mm...

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Again.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Take three.

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
All right. Action!

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I like you.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I like you, Ryouji-san.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Take seven.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
All right. Action!

27
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Take 11.

28
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I like you.

29
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
All right. Action!

30
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I like you.

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I like you, Ryouji-san.

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Cut!

33
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Mm...

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Please...

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I'm sorry. Please let me try again.

36
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Please.

37
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Shirasaki-kun.

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
It's gotten better.

39
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're not satisfied?

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry. I feel like
I'm not very into it.

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Director, can I do it again?

42
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Please.

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
This is an important scene.

44
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
And it's the climax
of the first half.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hayama-san has
other work after this.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
He has to leave soon.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But the filming's not done yet.

48
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
- Should we do it later?
- Understood. Again.

49
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Huh.

50
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
- Please.
- All right!

51
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's the wrap for today!

52
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
- We'll film this scene tomorrow!
- Eh?

53
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Pack up!

54
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
- Please bear with us.
- Please bear with us.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Asami-san,

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
It's okay.
Everyone has one of those days.

58
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I had a similar experience.

59
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Sorry for today.
I have work later. I have to go.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
It's okay.

61
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I was wasting your time

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
and causing you trouble.

63
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Recalibrate your emotions
and let's try again tomorrow.

64
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Yes.

65
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I rehearsed it well.

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Mm.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yours is cute.

68
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I like you.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I like you, Ryouji-san.

70
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Cut!

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Hm?

72
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Sakuma-san?

73
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Your drama starts
broadcasting today.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Looking forward to it.
Will you watch it live?

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
(Yes, I will.)

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
It's finally here.

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I like you.

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I like you.

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I like you.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I like you.

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Huh.

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The more I say it,
the less I understand it.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Eh?

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Asami-san.

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Hello.

86
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 3)

87
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
- Excuse me.
- Eh?

88
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Why are you...

89
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I figured I'd watch
the first episode with you.

90
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Eh?

91
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
No, uh...

92
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Have you eaten?

93
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Not yet.

94
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I completely forgot.

95
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm making curry rice then.

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Eh? Wait...

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Maybe you should take
a shower, Shirasaki-kun.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Take a shower?

99
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
If you dawdle,
the drama will start first.

100
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Oh, yes.

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Asami-san came to my place.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I like you.

103
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I like you.

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I like you, Ryouji-san.

105
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Wow, it smells great.

106
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is this spice fragrance?

107
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It might be a little spicy.
Can you handle it?

108
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I can. I love it.

109
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It'll be done soon. Hold on.

110
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You're a good cook too, Asami-san.

111
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Shirasaki-kun.

112
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Before we eat,
I have a favor to ask.

113
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I have a dog in my home town.

114
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
What?

115
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I have a dog in my home town.

116
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
His name is Charlie.

117
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I see.

118
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
And I love drying his hair
with a hairdryer.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
A dog?

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I haven't done this in a while.

121
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is that so?

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm glad I can be of use.

123
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Why is it?

124
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Why is this making me feel so good?

125
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Asami-san, please sit here.

126
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
What about you?

127
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Uh...

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
This should work.

129
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I usually don't have guests.

130
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm gonna eat.

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm gonna eat.

132
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
It's good.

133
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Really?

134
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Tastes like a restaurant version.

135
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Your compliment is unique.

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I can't believe it.

137
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You being at my place like this.

138
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah?

139
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
My apartment is so small.

141
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
But with a semi-double bed.

142
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Looks suggestive.

143
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's not. I didn't buy it.

144
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
An acquaintance was returning home,
so they asked me to take it.

145
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I see.

146
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Should I stay over tonight?

147
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Huh?

148
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
It can take two people, right?

149
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Uh...

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But it's far from the set.

151
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
We go to the same place.
We can commute together.

152
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
That is true.

153
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
We're a couple, aren't we?

154
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I wanna watch it live.

155
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
- Have you watched it?
- No.

156
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I got the edited version on a DVD,
but I haven't watched it.

157
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Same. I haven't watched it.

158
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Don't you wanna use this instead?

159
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,000
- I'm a little nervous.
- Let me introduce this.

160
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Our new product,

161
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
- Life Happiness...
- It's starting.

162
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
is natural as if...

163
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
My first multi-episode drama

164
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and I'm in it with that Asami-san.

165
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
(Café Do Shuro
Open: 10 am-6 pm)

166
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
(Café Do Shuro)

167
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Welcome.

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
One person?

169
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
God, I suck.

170
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Oh, this?

171
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Stress on my face and stiff acting.

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
The last sentence
is very memorable.

173
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I love it too.

174
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This is the first time I met
someone who thinks the same way.

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Oh. Please come back again.

176
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ryouji-san stays at a hotel?

177
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
That must be tough.

178
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Uh...

179
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If you don't mind,

180
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
come stay with me.

181
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Eh?

182
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
- The best...
- It's over?

183
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
- I can do from now on...
- Thirty minutes flew by.

184
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Jeez, my acting was so stiff.

185
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Oh, you must be sleepy.

186
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
- Please get in bed.
- Hm?

187
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Here.

188
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Uh, wait...

189
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Uh...

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You're probably thinking
I'm your dog.

191
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
You must be.

192
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I can smell you, Shirasaki-kun.

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Shirasaki-kun,

194
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
what do you like?

195
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Eh? Like?

196
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes.

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Dogs or cats,

198
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
or food, or anything?

199
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Please tell me.

200
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Eh?

201
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
What do I like?

202
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Cinema and acting.

203
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
And...

204
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
strawberry shortcake.

205
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And...

206
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
curry rice with hamburger.

207
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I see.

208
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,000
The curry rice
you made was very delicious.

209
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Thanks.

210
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
What else?

211
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
And...

212
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
probably the slope
near my apartment building.

213
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
A slope?

214
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
The view from up there...

215
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
is very beautiful.

216
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You can see the beautiful
landscape of the city.

217
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's pretty in the late
afternoon and evening.

218
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,000
but it's gorgeous in the morning.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
It feels like...

220
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
a new day has begun.

221
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
And I like that view very much.

222
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Really?

223
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
See?

224
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
You like so many things.

225
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Earlier,

226
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
you said you'd never
seriously been in love.

227
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I've never seriously been in love.

228
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
To be honest,

229
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
the love for someone

230
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,000
this character has,
I don't understand it at all.

231
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Actually, I...

232
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
never even made a confession of love.

233
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
That's probably
why I couldn't say that line right.

234
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tomorrow,

235
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
maybe think of something
you like and say it.

236
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I see.

237
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Eh?

238
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Or...

239
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
did you come here to tell me that?

240
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Sorry.

241
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'm sleepy.

242
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Oh, I'm sorry. You were busy.

243
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Asami-san,

244
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
did you fall asleep?

245
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You look like a child.

246
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Did you sleep well last night?

247
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Yes.

248
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Oh, it's up ahead,

249
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
my favorite place.

250
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's beautiful.

251
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm...

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
hoping one day

253
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I will shine as an actor

254
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
and every time I see this view,

255
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I think to myself
I have to do my best.

256
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Mm.

257
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So that's what
the word "like" is all about.

258
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We're happy that it exists

259
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
and gives us energy and courage.

260
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Yes.

261
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
At today's shoot,

262
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
let's do our best together.

263
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Please bear with me.

264
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Sorry for the wait.

265
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
- Please.
- Please.

266
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What I like...

267
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
cinema, acting,

268
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
strawberry shortcake,

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
hamburger,

270
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Asami-san's curry rice.

271
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Asami-san's hand
while he's drying my hair,

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Asami-san's childlike face
while he's sleeping,

273
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and...

274
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Asami-san's...

275
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
All right. Action!

276
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I like you.

277
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
I like you...

278
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Ryouji-san.

279
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Cut!

280
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Okay!

281
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Amazing.

282
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
- What was that?
- Did you see it?

283
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
This feeling...

284
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
is...

285
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
(Next episode)

286
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Did my heart race
because of Asami-san?

287
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Ah...

288
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Do what I do.

289
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Not seeing Hayama
makes you lonely, isn't it?

290
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
Eh?

291
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
I'm looking forward
to the kiss scene.

292
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Can I hug you?

293
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Do your best today.
