1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,380
So... I'll be going.

2
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:22,500
Hayama-san...

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,620
Uh...

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,070
Uh...

5
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,810
We don't need to do this anymore.

6
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,020
Filming has wrapped.

7
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,440
There's no reason
to do this anymore.

8
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,000
Why?

9
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,630
I tried...

10
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,780
I tried so hard.

11
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,380
Please don't leave.

12
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,890
I like it.

13
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:20,860
I like it...

14
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,920
Asami-san.

15
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,830
Goodbye,

16
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:05,020
Asami-san.

17
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,600
It's more than enough

18
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,020
to do that once with Asami-san.

19
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,580
Asami-san was indeed kind.

20
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,330
He did what I asked eventually.

21
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,290
Eh?

22
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:51,940
Don't tell me.

23
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,716
It's not here.

24
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,020
Never mind.

25
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,670
Probably a sign to forget this.

26
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,210
Shirasaki-kun?

27
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
Why?

28
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,160
Uh, what's happening?

29
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,240
Why are you here?

30
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,512
A night with someone I'm into,

31
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,650
but come morning

32
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,360
he left quietly.
Of course I was upset.

33
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:11,315
Aren't I allowed
to chase after you?

34
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,050
Uh...

35
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,380
Did I...

36
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,210
do something wrong?

37
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,300
No.

38
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,430
But you...

39
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,500
already have that person.

40
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,400
The person you can't get over.

41
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,470
Eh?

42
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,770
As for last night,

43
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,900
I know it's weird to say this now,

44
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,420
but I...

45
00:10:45,970 --> 00:10:49,170
can't sleep with someone
who's not into me.

46
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,080
Eh?

47
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:56,980
Just now

48
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,060
you said someone you were into?

49
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,230
Eh?

50
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,570
I meant you, Shirasaki-kun.

51
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:16,560
The person
I couldn't get over was...

52
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Shirasaki-kun.

53
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,690
Me...

54
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:32,550
Was that the reason you left?

55
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,440
Uh.

56
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:39,390
Yes. Pretty much.

57
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:44,800
Jeez.

58
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,590
What the heck?

59
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,600
I thought I did something yesterday
that made you feel bad.

60
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,270
Eh? Feel bad? Why?

61
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:59,200
- You're asking why...
- I'm glad I did it with someone I'm into.

62
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,070
Hayama-san.

63
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,490
I'm tired.

64
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:19,510
It's okay.

65
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,480
It's not okay.

66
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,150
Let me tell you this.

67
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:31,380
Me ending up like this,

68
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,260
it's your fault.

69
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,860
My fault?

70
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,900
That's right.

71
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,110
Asami-san.

72
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
Asami-san.

73
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,130
Asami-san.

74
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,030
Asami-san, Asami-san, Asami-san.

75
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,980
Asami-san.

76
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,230
I...

77
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,490
I'm into you,

78
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:32,840
Shirasaki-kun.

79
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,660
I'm into you too.

80
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:14,230
(TV Tokyo)

81
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:14,810
Yes.

82
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,230
Even "Hiru no Yume" wrapped a few days ago,

83
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,340
we're here to film the bonus video

84
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,560
that will come with
the DVDs and Blu-rays.

85
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:27,870
Uh...

86
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,210
Soon the four of us
will sit together and talk.

87
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,260
But before that,

88
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:38,890
they let the actors
handle the camera.

89
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,430
(Hayama Asami-san)
This is the green room

90
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,940
I'm planning to barge in.

91
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,830
Shhh.

92
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,630
"Hiru no Yume" starring...

93
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:55,850
Hayama...

94
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,640
Asami-san!

95
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,090
Eh, Yuki?

96
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,210
- Hi.
- Hello.

97
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,810
No. Why are you here?

98
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:05,610
You're asking why...

99
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:07,140
Uh...

100
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:10,150
Why indeed?

101
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:12,060
I called him here.

102
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:13,650
Right?

103
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,310
Yes.

104
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:21,960
I see.

105
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,860
Anyway, Hayama-san...

106
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,980
Will you sleep with me?

107
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,760
- Eh?
- Huh?

108
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:32,390
Uh.

109
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,840
When I meet great actors,
I wanna do it with them.

110
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,580
Stop it right now.

111
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,530
Hayama-san,

112
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,620
won't you sleep with me?

113
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,450
Jeez.

114
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:50,130
Talking about sex?
What kind of bonus video is this?

115
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,080
Sorry, sorry.

116
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,960
This one won't make the cut.

117
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,560
What?

118
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,380
You wanna do it with Hayama-san?

119
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,630
I do.

120
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,470
I must decline.

121
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,690
Damn it.

122
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,860
- You'll do.
- Huh?

123
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:16,240
What about me?

124
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,230
What about me?

125
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,680
Ask me that too.

126
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:23,840
(TV Tokyo)

127
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,590
That was fun,
talking to each other.

128
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,366
But you seemed to have
the most fun, Sakuma.

129
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,230
Let's get together
for drinks again.

130
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,880
- Mm.
- Yes.

131
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:34,660
So, see you guys around.

132
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,640
- Have a good day.
- Bye-bye.

133
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,920
Have a good day.

134
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,630
So, shall we go home?

135
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:58,960
For the last time...

136
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,330
I want you to kiss me...

137
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,850
for the last time.

138
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,080
Ridiculous.

139
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,350
"For the last time"...

140
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,270
when I'm this into you.

141
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,270
I'm...

142
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:40,650
into you, Takumi.

143

144
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:07,290
That's the end.

145
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:11,150
Feeling lost?

146
00:18:12,122 --> 00:18:14,255
Extremely lost.

147
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,278
Extremely?

148
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:22,030
Aren't you feeling lost, Asami-san?

149
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,360
Mm...

150
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,920
Can't say that I am.

151
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,760
Probably...

152
00:18:32,145 --> 00:18:33,375
to you,

153
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,400
it's just one of
many dramas you're in.

Soon...

155
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
you'll be playing
someone else's boyfriend.

156
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,870
I have to thank you, Shirasaki-kun.

157
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
The reason...

158
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,370
I got to act now...

159
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,462
I got to do the things
I really wanted to do...

160
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:14,480
was all because of you.

161
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,350
Thank you,

162
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,670
Shirasaki-kun.

163
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,320
That...

164
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:36,610
That was supposed to be my line.

165
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,330
Because of you, Asami-san...

166
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,180
Uh. Eh?

167
00:19:45,570 --> 00:19:47,440
Asami-san, what are you doing?

168
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,400
Eh?

169
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:49,920
Wait.

170
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,500
Asami-san, that tickles.

171
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:54,930
Wait, that tickles...!

172
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,660
Good morning.

173
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,730
Good morning.

174
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:21,560
Here.

175
00:20:23,810 --> 00:20:25,120
Thank you very much.

176
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:31,840
Oh, that's good.

177
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,250
Oh.

178
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:35,640
That reminds me.

179
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,760
Give me a sec.

180
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,540
Shirasaki-kun?

181
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,250
You dropped this here, right?

182
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:16,040
Your keychain.

183
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:19,930
I forgot to give it back.

184
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,900
Here you go.

00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,880
You can come here anytime.

Eh?

188
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,090
Eh?!

189
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,190
Well?

190
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,550
You want breakfast?

191
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,050
It can wait.

192
00:22:18,812 --> 00:22:20,042
It can wait.
