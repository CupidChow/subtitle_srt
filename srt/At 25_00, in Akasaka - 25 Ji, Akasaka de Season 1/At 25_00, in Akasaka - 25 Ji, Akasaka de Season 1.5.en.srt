1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,000
That person above the clouds

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
is now next to me.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
So that's...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
what the word "like" is all about.

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Eh?

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Is my heart racing
because of Asami-san?

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Not seeing Hayama
makes you lonely, isn't it?

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Feels like it's been ages.

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
This isn't Takumi's feelings.

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
They're my real feelings.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Now that I've realized
I like Asami-san,

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
how do I act around him?

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
So you...

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
like him?

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I don't think it's your business.

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
It is. I like him too.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
So please tell me.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Do you like him?

19
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
I do.

20
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I like Takumi.

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Cut!

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Okay!

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Yes!

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Both Hayama-san
and Yamase-san were great.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
- I agree.
- Yuki!

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Did you see that?

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I did.

28
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
No, I wanted to know how it was.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
But why did you use my first name?

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
We play childhood friends.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Aren't first names better?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Yuki, you can call me Kazuma.

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Got it, Yamase-san.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Kazuma.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Right, Yamase-san.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Hey, call me properly.

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I was kidding.

38
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm looking forward
to our sensual kiss scene.

39
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Got it, Yamase-san.

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Kazuma.

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Right, Yamase-san.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hey.

43
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
- You.
- Ow.

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Next, we'll move over there!

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

46
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
- Please get off me, Yamase-san.
- Come on.

47
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
- Yamase-san.
- Come on now.

48
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
- Boo!
- That's dangerous.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 5)

50
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hayama-san, have you ever confused
your role with yourself?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
No, I don't think I have.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Really?

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You never fell in love
with your love interests?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I never did that.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Hm...

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Yamase, Hayama is quite dull.

57
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
- Here.
- Mind your own business.

58
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Despite Hayama's
shiny outward persona,

59
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
he's surprisingly normal
on the inside.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I seem normal?

61
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Mm, fundamentally.

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Mm, is that true?

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hm, it is.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
But he seems surprisingly fiery.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Thank you for saying that.

66
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
What about you, Yuki?

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Ever confused
your role with yourself?

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You're not gonna fall in love
with me from acting with me, right?

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Eh?

70
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Sorry.

71
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you okay?

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Mm, sorry.

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're up,
Hayama-san, Shirasaki-san.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
- Good luck.
- Mm.

76
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This way, please.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Here they come.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,000
- Please.
- Please.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Hayama-san, you're in there.
Shirasaki-san, you're up here.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll take that.

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
- Thank you.
- Sure.

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Okay.

83
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I can't.

84
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Now that I've fallen for Asami-san,

85
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I can't look him
in the eye anymore.

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
All right! Begin!

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Ryouji-san?

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Cut!

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Cut!

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
- Okay!
- We got it!

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Wow, great facial expression.

92
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Dinner's in the main hall
on the second floor!

93
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

94
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Yuki, let's check out
the onsen together.

95
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Eh?

96
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
The onsen here is famous.

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Uh...

98
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So I'll see you there.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I haven't got a chance
to talk to Asami-san today.

100
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Going to the onsen with Yamase-kun?

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No.

102
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Can I come by later?

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, shoot.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If I go to Asami-san's room,

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
we'll be by ourselves.

106
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Sure.

107
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We haven't been acting
like a couple lately, have we?

108
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll wait.

109
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
(Poem of the Moon
Men's Public Bath)

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
This is bad.

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I've been running
scenarios in my head.

112
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It got me dizzy.

113
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Sorry for the wait.

114
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yuki?

115
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Eh?

116
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Why are you in
Asami-san's room, Yamase-san?

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
- Asami-san?
- Eh?

118
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Uh.

119
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Hey, what's wrong with you?

120
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Shirasaki-kun?

122
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Eh?

123
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I got the wrong room?

124
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Yuki, are you okay?

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm... I'm fine.

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Ah.

127
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Sorry.

128
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Have anything to say?

129
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
No.

130
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Yeah?

131
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Eh?

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
What was that?

133
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Hey, I'm sorry.

134
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Don't be.

135
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Thank you.

136
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Uh...

137
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Sorry for the wait.

138
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Are you...

139
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
angry?

140
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I'm not angry.

141
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
You just got the wrong room, right?

142
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
It was no one's fault.

143
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You're warm, Shirasaki-kun.

144
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I just came back from the onsen.

145
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Is that so?

146
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Hayama, let's get dinner!

147
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Shall we?

148
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
What are you talking about?

149
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Write some note at the end here.

150
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Sorry for the wait, Shirasaki-san,
Yamase-san, you're up.

151
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

152
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
- Hurry, Yuki.
- I'm coming.

153
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
That's dangerous.

154
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Huh.

155
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
It's strange seeing you sigh.

156
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Mm, sorry.

157
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
That's good. That eases my mind.

158
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Eases your mind?

159
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now I know you're human too.

160
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Tired?

161
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
No.

162
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Not tired. Must be the other thing.

163
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Frustrated.

164
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Me?

165
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Mm, in the last few days.

166
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Honestly, Shirasaki-kun and Yamase

167
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,000
have gotten close fast.

168
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're right.

169
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I get it now.

170
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
You're sulking because Yamase

171
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
stole your beloved Shirasaki-kun.

172
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
That's ridiculous.

173
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I'm not sulking.

174
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I wanna discuss our next scene.

175
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Can I come in?

176
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Sure, but...

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Uh...

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
shouldn't we be running our lines?

180
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Wanna rehearse our kiss scene?

181
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Wait, no, no, no.

182
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Eh?

183
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Have you noticed?

184
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
When you play Takumi
and share a scene with Ryouji,

185
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
your facial expression
is very sensual.

186
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Sen... sensual?

187
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I want you to look
like that with me too.

188
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
More.

189
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Wanna make me forget, right?

190
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Cut!

191
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Okay!

192
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
You two were awesome!

193
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Thank you.

194
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Can I get some water?

195
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
How's it going?

196
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
How's it going?

197
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
How was it?

198
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I think it was a very good scene.

199
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Without asking me,

200
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
you've already got compliments.

201
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
What about you?

202
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
What do you really think?

203
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I don't care about other people.
I want a compliment from you.

204
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I think it was good.

205
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm so glad.

206
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Yuki doesn't know how to breathe
in kiss scenes, does he?

207
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Eh?

208
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
For a second there
I felt like I was hallucinating.

209
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I was like,
"Maybe I really am into Yuki."

210
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Yeah?

211
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, you wouldn't understand.

212
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Since you don't confuse
your role with yourself.

213
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The kiss scene between
Takumi and Ryouji tomorrow.

214
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm looking forward to it.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Thank you.

216
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
It's coming.

217
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
(Ryouji and Takumi kiss.)

218
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I was a little jealous
of Yamase-kun today.

219
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Eh?

220
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
What do you mean?

221
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
You were great.

222
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
In the kiss scene with Yamase-kun.

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Ah.

224
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Thank you very much.

225
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Did you rehearse it
with Yamase-kun?

226
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I didn't.

227
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Shall we rehearse?

228
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Our kiss scene tomorrow.

229
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
I...

230
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
don't wanna give you to anyone.

231
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You two were wonderful.

232
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
How's it going?

233
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
How's it going?

234
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Today's kiss scene was incredible.

235
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Thank you.

236
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Though it hurts,

237
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
you two really
looked like a couple.

238
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
But the fact that you can separate
yourself completely from your role

239
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
is remarkable.

240
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
That may not be true anymore.

241
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Eh?

242
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'm confusing my role with myself.

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You mean to say...

244
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
you like Yuki?

245
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hayama-san?

246
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I don't know.

247
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
But I'm not telling you,
Yamase-kun.

248
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
(Next episode)

249
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Don't leave.

250
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I hate it

251
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
when Yamase-kun calls you "Yuki."

252
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Maybe...

253
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Asami-san feels

254
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
(Finally their feelings)
the same way.

255
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,000
(are in tune.)
the same way.

256
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
There's someone he can't get over.

257
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
You know where your heart is
only when it hurts, right?

258
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
(But... )

259
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
I don't need to rely on you
anymore, Hayama-san.

260
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Thank you very much.

261
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I want you to look
like that with me too.

262
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
Huh? No?

263
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
No way.
