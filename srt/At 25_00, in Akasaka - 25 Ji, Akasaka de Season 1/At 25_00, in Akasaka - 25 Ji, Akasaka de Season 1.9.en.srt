1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
It's okay.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
I won't force you
to stay in character anymore.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Why do I keep
thinking about Hayama-san?

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Just as I thought.

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
To give up on that feeling, it's...

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
I want you to sleep with me.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Can you hold me, please?

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You're drunk.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm not.

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
- That's what all drunk people say.
- I'm telling you I'm not.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
I get it.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Good night.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Shirasaki-kun.

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Just this one time.

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Do this with me, please.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
What does that...

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
mean?

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
To get into character.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You said you'd cooperate.

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I've...

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
never done that kind of scene.

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't wanna mess up on set.

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Is that so?

24
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Yes.

25
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Will you do it

26
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
or not?

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Can't you...

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
do it with me?

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If you don't like it,
please let me know.

30
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sorry.

31
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Let's stop.

32
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

33
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I must've really been
a little drunk.

34
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
But I've gotten
the hang of that feeling now.

35
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
It's okay now.

36
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Then...

37
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that's good.

38
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Good night.

39
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Good night.

40
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Should I have done that?

41
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Even with the excuse he was drunk.

42
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He's already into someone else.

43
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Someone like me is just...

44
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So pathetic.

45
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Right now...

46
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I can still end it
with a beautiful memory.

47
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 9)

48
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
First of all,
try to do it in one take.

49
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

50
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
- Do it this way.
- Right.

51
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
If that's the case...

52
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
So...

53
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
let's do it.

54
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

55
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Okay.

56
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Rolling.

57
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
All right. Start.

58
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Cut!

59
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Okay.

60
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Thank you very much.

61
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Thank you. This way, please.

62
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Thank you for trying.

63
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Thank you for trying.

64
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Shirasaki-kun,

65
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
thank you for trying.

66
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Thank you very much.

67
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The scene you just did

68
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,000
was good.

69
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Very good.

70
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
- Really?
- Mm.

71
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
It really shows

72
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
that Ryouji and Takumi
are important to each other.

73
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It's a really good and happy scene.

74
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Hmm.

75
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I...

76
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I can't believe
tomorrow's the last day.

77
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Looking back on the first day,
time flies.

78
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes.

79
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Do you remember

80
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
the table read?

81
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
You were so worried.

82
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Oh.

83
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
But...

84
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I wasn't worried at all.

85
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Eh?

86
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Because I believed if it was you,

87
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
everything would be fine.

88
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Shinoda-san.

89
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Thank you very much.

90
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Eh?

91
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
For always trusting me

92
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
and being there for me.

93
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Thank you very much.

94
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Shirasaki-kun...

95
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
From now on,

96
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
let's keep up the good work.

97
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Yes.

98
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Thanks for trying.

99
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Thank you for trying.

100
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
This will end tomorrow.

101
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
How has it been?

102
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
The first drama where you're the lead.

103
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
It's been fun.

104
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
It should come out quite well.

105
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah?

106
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't do anything you'll regret.

107
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Eh?

108
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I just want you
to focus till the end.

109
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Yes.

110
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
"Ryouji and Takumi
have slept together once.

111
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,000
However,

112
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Ryouji decides to leave
for Takumi's sake.

113
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Takumi can't stop Ryouji

114
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
and says,

115
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
'Please,

116
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
will you kiss me...

117
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
for the last time?'"

118
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
So spicy.

119
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Too sweet.

120
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,000
For the last time...

121
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
For the last time...

122
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I want you to kiss me...

123
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
for the last time.

124
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Ridiculous.

125
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
"For the last time"...

126
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,000
when I'm this into you.

127
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Ryouji-san.

128
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Cut!

129
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Cut!

130
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Okay!

131
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Okay!

132
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Thank you for trying.

133
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Everyone, please gather outside!

134
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,000
- Yes!
- Yes!

135
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
- Thank you.
- You too.

136
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
That was the last scene.

137
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Hayama Asami as Ryouji

138
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
and Shirasaki Yuki as Takumi

139
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,000
have now wrapped!

140
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Thank you!

141
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Thank you.

142
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

143
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm really glad you played Ryouji

144
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
and you played Takumi.

145
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you very much.

146
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The feedback has been wonderful.

147
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm so grateful.

148
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Thank you.

149
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

150
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
During the shoot,

151
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
thank you for
taking care of our Shirasaki.

152
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
Likewise.

153
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
- The drama "Hiru no Yume"...
- You've found...

154
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
- Initially I...

155
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
a good actor.

156
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
- was really worried

157
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
- but with everyone's help
in many aspects...

158
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Thank you very much.

159
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much.

160
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much!

161
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Then I woke up from...

162
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
"Hiru no Yume."

163
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
I'm sorry for leaving
so many things here.

164
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
It's okay.

165
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Oh.

166
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
- Coffee?
- It's okay!

167
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'll be done soon.

168
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I heard you were already
scheduled to film the next drama.

169
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Yes.

170
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I'm very glad I'll be acting again.

171
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Time really flies.

172
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,000
It does.

173
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
For me...

174
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
this was the first time
I got a prominent role.

175
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
But getting to create with everyone

176
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
was really fun.

177
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Mm.

178
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
While saying goodbye
to everyone, I thought,

179
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
"I won't be seeing them
on this set anymore."

180
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Once "Hiru no Yume" is wrapped,

181
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,000
everyone will go their own ways

182
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
and start filming other projects.

183
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,000
It really feels like a dream.

184
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
So... I'll be going.

185
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Hayama-san...

186
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
(Finale Episode)

187
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Goodbye,

188
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Asami-san.
