1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:03,940
Excellent.

2
00:00:05,601 --> 00:00:06,720
Can you face the other side?

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:08,320
- The other side?
- Thank you.

4
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,990
Excuse me.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,510
Yes, what seems to be the issue?

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,610
I already told you,

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:28,630
I accidentally poured syrup instead,

8
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,334
so I want a replacement.

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:31,997
So, you're ordering

10
00:00:32,013 --> 00:00:34,013
another iced coffee, is that correct?

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:35,940
No, I want a replacement.

12
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,290
We can't do that. It's not our mistake.

13
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,010
Sorry about that, Shirasaki-kun.

14
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:47,950
Can't you just tell him

15
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,232
that we can't change it?

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,330
Ah, right. Sorry.

17
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:56,270
Then, I'll take a break for now.

18
00:01:15,672 --> 00:01:17,682
Oh, it's Hayama Asami!

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:20,040
You're right! Amazing!

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,270
Hayama Asami, 28 years old.

21
00:01:22,969 --> 00:01:23,969
A popular actor from

22
00:01:23,993 --> 00:01:25,079
a modeling background.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,030
And...

24
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,110
my senior two years higher

25
00:01:29,134 --> 00:01:30,454
during my university days.

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,977
Now, he's way beyond

27
00:01:31,993 --> 00:01:33,250
just two years ahead,

28
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:35,510
soaring high above the clouds.

29
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,330
As expected,

30
00:01:36,338 --> 00:01:37,626
isn't his face a gift from the gods?

31
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,520
- Totally.
- Right? He's the real deal.

32
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,470
So handsome.

33
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:42,160
It's not just about the looks.

34
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:44,670
We were in the same film study club,

35
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,650
but we never talked.

36
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:49,130
But well...

37
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,670
Oh no!

38
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:50,980
He probably doesn't remember me.

39
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,830
(Tokyo TV)
He probably doesn't remember me.

40
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,170
- Shirasaki-kun! Over here, over here!
- Ah!

41
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,390
If you pass this,

42
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,523
it'll be your first leading role

43
00:02:07,532 --> 00:02:08,536
in a drama series!

44
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,095
You'll definitely get attention.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,133
After all,

46
00:02:11,141 --> 00:02:12,781
Hayama Asami is starring in it!

47
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:14,500
- Yes.
- Ho, ho, ho.

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,730
Yeah, do your best!

49
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:19,010
Shirasaki-kun, you can do it.

50
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,160
- I'll be going then.
- Yeah.

51
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,360
(Audition Venue for 'Hiru no Yume')
Ready, action!

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:32,830
Here's your water.

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,340
Thanks.

54
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,980
- About that book...
- Oh, this one?

55
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,560
- I really love it.
- I'm aware.

56
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,460
That last line, it's unforgettable.

57
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,660
I like that too.

58
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,051
It's the first time I've met someone

59
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,285
with the same opinion.

60
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,670
I'd love to talk more about the novel.

61
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,650
Cut! Thank you.

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,160
Thank you.

63
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,590
Now, one final question.

64
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,855
Do you have anything in common

65
00:03:03,871 --> 00:03:04,902
with the character

66
00:03:04,926 --> 00:03:06,136
you're auditioning for?

67
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,330
None.

68
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,510
Not a single thing.

69
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,360
Yes.

70
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,920
So,

71
00:03:17,536 --> 00:03:18,700
if you were chosen for

72
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:20,818
the role of Takumi, what would you do?

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,580
Having no common ground at all,

74
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:25,966
what would you do?

75
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,070
(Taiwanese Restaurant)

76
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:42,740
- Sorry for keeping you waiting.
- Yes.

77
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,040
If I don't pass today's audition,

78
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,990
that'd mean I'm not going to make it.

79
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,420
Maybe it's just impossible

80
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,920
to continue like this...

81
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,170
(Manager Shinoda-san)

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,390
(Taiwanese Restaurant)

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,750
Hello.

84
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,290
Shirasaki-kun.

85
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,250
Was it a no after all?

86
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,210
It's good.

87
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,890
It's really good.

88
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:41,460
You passed the audition!

89
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,340
Huh?

90
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,577
Shirasaki-kun,

91
00:04:46,312 --> 00:04:47,405
you're going to be

92
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,678
Hayama Asami-san's co-star!

93
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,720
Huh?

94
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,610
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"

95
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
Nice to meet you.

96
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:44,070
Hayama-san is here.

97
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,800
Good morning.

98
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,420
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

99
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,540
Good morning. Let's do our best.

100
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,430
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,350
Please.

102
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,835
Well then,

103
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,516
thank you all for gathering today

104
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,921
for TV Tokyo 25's drama,

105
00:07:14,945 --> 00:07:16,225
'Hiru no Yume.'

106
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,150
("Hiru no Yume" drama meeting)

107
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:20,580
I'm Makita, the producer for TV Tokyo.

108
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,900
This drama is

109
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,275
an adaptation of

110
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,931
the BL manga "Hiru no Yume"

111
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,840
which has sold over 1 million copies.

112
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,980
I've asked Director Kawada,

113
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,125
who's known to

114
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,345
delicately depict emotions,

115
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:37,120
to bring this love story to life.

116
00:07:39,287 --> 00:07:42,007
Good morning. I'm Director Kawada.

117
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,690
Umm...

118
00:07:44,228 --> 00:07:45,414
Personally,

119
00:07:45,805 --> 00:07:47,742
I think all love stories

120
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:50,133
are about the same thing.

121
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,547
It's a story of

122
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:54,337
two people realizing that

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,530
they're each other's one and only.

124
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,590
That's what a love story is, I think.

125
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,250
And for Ryouji and Takumi,

126
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,865
I'm looking forward to

127
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:05,215
the crucial love scenes that hold

128
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,318
significant meaning for

129
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:07,365
their relationship.

130
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,420
But I want to portray their feelings

131
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:10,756
leading up to those moments

132
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,998
with care and detail.

133
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,290
This is my first BL work,

134
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:18,910
so I might cause some trouble,

135
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:21,457
but I appreciate your cooperation.

136
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,720
- Looking forward to work with you.
- I'll be in your care.

137
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,299
Now,

138
00:08:28,315 --> 00:08:30,729
let's have each cast member

139
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,494
say a few words.

140
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,705
First, our lead actor, Hayama-san.

141
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:37,385
My name is Hayama Asami,

142
00:08:37,401 --> 00:08:38,877
I'll be playing the role of Ryouji.

143
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,799
It's my first time being here,

144
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,504
so I'm a bit nervous,

145
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,870
but I believe we can create

146
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,740
a great work together with everyone.

147
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,230
Looking forward to working with you.

148
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,960
- Looking forward to working with you.
- Looking forward to working with you.

149
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:58,260
Next, our co-star Shirasaki-kun.

150
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,450
Shirasaki Yuki,

151
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:05,825
playing the role of Takumi.

152
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,160
Umm...

153
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,650
Looking forward to working with you.

154
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,040
- Looking forward to working with you.
- Looking forward to working with you.

155
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,976
And next, playing the role of Teppei,

156
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,187
a friend of Ryouji

157
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,490
- portrayed by...
- I'm Sakuma Hajime.

158
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:31,989
I'll do my best to support both

159
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:34,299
Hayama-kun and Shirasaki-kun.

160
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,740
Looking forward to working with you.

161
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:37,850
- Looking forward to working with you.
- Looking forward to working with you.

162
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:40,590
Looking forward to working with you.

163
00:09:41,106 --> 00:09:42,731
Please perform the scene where

164
00:09:42,754 --> 00:09:44,152
you talk with Ryouji while

165
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:45,715
waiting for food at a cafe.

166
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,720
- Yes.
- Yes.

167
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,512
I want to see the scene where Teppei

168
00:09:49,537 --> 00:09:52,004
visits Ryouji after quitting his job.

169
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,620
Alright.

170
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,190
Ready, action!

171
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:01,130
Are you serious about quitting your job?

172
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:04,840
Yeah,

173
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,000
you heard it at work too, right?

174
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:11,403
That I was

175
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:12,989
causing trouble for

176
00:10:13,014 --> 00:10:14,309
everyone by being there.

177
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,242
So, I won't be

178
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:19,430
returning to Tokyo for a while.

179
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,940
- Sorry, you even came all the way here.
- Even his voice...

180
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,060
- What a waste.
- His tone...

181
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,340
- The project was starting to take off!
- Even his dialogue...

182
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,861
- Are you quitting because of them?
- He already considered

183
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:29,175
how they'll be received.

184
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,560
- Thanks.
- And yet, there's no hint of lying.

185
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,310
- But I've already made up my mind.
- As expected, Hayama-san

186
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,730
- I need some time to cool off.
- truly is amazing.

187
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,230
Shirasaki-kun.

188
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,370
Shirasaki-kun.

189
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,500
I'm sorry.

190
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,670
Ryouji-san, are you okay?

191
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,530
Is something wrong?

192
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:58,510
- Cut! Let's do it again.
- I'm sorry.

193
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,510
Are you okay? Be careful next time.

194
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,100
Yes.

195
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,470
And take it slower when you come in.

196
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,240
- I'm sorry.
- Alright, let's do it again.

197
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,120
I finally did it.

198
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,171
It felt as if

199
00:11:13,335 --> 00:11:14,983
everything was my first time.

200
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,770
- I'm so nervous...
- Are you nervous?

201
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,329
Oh.

202
00:11:21,376 --> 00:11:22,376
Yes.

203
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,930
Well, I guess so.

204
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:36,350
It's been a while, Shirasaki-kun.

205
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,220
Here.

206
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,640
Oh, thank you very much.

207
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,120
Um... Did you remember me?

208
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,500
Same university,

209
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,940
same film club.

210
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,070
You're two years younger than me.

211
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,950
Well, yes...

212
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,590
But we never talked.

213
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,120
We did.

214
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,450
Huh?

215
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,970
Just once.

216
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,895
Please drink while it's still hot.

217
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,070
Ah, okay.

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,420
Bon appétit.

219
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,840
Delicious.

220
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,450
- Shirasaki-kun...
- Ah!

221
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:55,070
Hayama is bullying the newcomer.

222
00:12:55,265 --> 00:12:56,266
I'm not bullying.

223
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,406
Others could misunderstand.

224
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,430
I want coffee too.

225
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,450
Huh? Is this your first role?

226
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,870
Yes.

227
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,660
Seriously?

228
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,259
Starting with this production

229
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:10,657
must be quite challenging.

230
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,770
It's an adaptation of a popular manga,

231
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,064
and the lead role is played by

232
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,155
Hayama Asami.

233
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,562
And they cast a newcomer

234
00:13:17,586 --> 00:13:19,031
as the lead's partner.

235
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,230
It's like a Cinderella story, isn't it?

236
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,660
- Cinderella?
- Yeah.

237
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,756
With that comes a lot of pressure.

238
00:13:25,968 --> 00:13:27,168
Are you okay?

239
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,650
Yes.

240
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:32,910
Wow... You've got nerves of steel.

241
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,320
No matter the project,

242
00:13:35,336 --> 00:13:37,016
the set, or the role,

243
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,941
putting on a production is tough.

244
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,470
Ah...

245
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,670
Yeah.

246
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,630
Yeah, you're right.

247
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,450
Ah.

248
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:52,152
Well, I'll get going now.

249
00:13:52,184 --> 00:13:53,769
Thanks for the coffee, Hayama.

250
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,310
- You're welcome.
- But I only take milk with my coffee.

251
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,770
Remember that for next time.

252
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,260
That was probably

253
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,550
Sakuma's way of encouraging you.

254
00:14:09,226 --> 00:14:10,090
That?

255
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,260
Huh?

256
00:14:19,410 --> 00:14:19,930
Huh?

257
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,200
Your hair's a mess.

258
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:32,700
You haven't changed, Shirasaki-kun.

259
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:34,980
Huh?

260
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:40,760
I'm looking forward to playing lovers.

261
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,240
Shirasaki-kun, can I have a word?

262
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,100
Yes!

263
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,065
Since it's your first leading role,

264
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:02,574
make sure to give it your all.

265
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,730
I understand.

266
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,504
I want to make sure

267
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,864
I create a great drama.

268
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,418
If there's damage,

269
00:15:08,435 --> 00:15:10,286
the market value of 'Hayama Masumi'

270
00:15:10,311 --> 00:15:11,511
will plummet.

271
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,420
Plummet?

272
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,016
Akeno-san,

273
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,108
what do you really think of me?

274
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,727
A top-quality product

275
00:15:20,735 --> 00:15:22,535
that doesn't disappoint me.

276
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,790
Isn't that a bit harsh?

277
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:31,240
Your junior at university?

278
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,520
Shirasaki-kun.

279
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,190
Yeah.

280
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,100
Will he be alright?

281
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,310
I'm a bit worried about him.

282
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:45,040
I think he'll be fine.

283
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,000
I'm...

284
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,550
no good at all.

285
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,460
Here.

286
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,190
Welcome back.

287
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,892
You were late coming out.

288
00:16:00,917 --> 00:16:02,017
Did something happen?

289
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,510
I had a talk with the director.

290
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,376
How was it trying it out

291
00:16:11,401 --> 00:16:12,626
for the first time today?

292
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:15,520
Well...

293
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,180
I was nervous.

294
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,050
Yeah,

295
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,280
Well, it's the first time,

296
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,610
so it can't be helped.

297
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,237
Remember what I asked you

298
00:16:32,262 --> 00:16:33,285
at the audition?

299
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:36,970
What will you do if you got

300
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,026
chosen for the role of Takumi?

301
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,930
Since there is no common ground at all,

302
00:16:42,237 --> 00:16:43,440
what will you do?

303
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,550
When I said there was no common ground,

304
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:51,730
it's because I haven't found it yet.

305
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,520
- You haven't found it?
- Yes.

306
00:16:55,715 --> 00:16:57,820
Right now, I just haven't realized it.

307
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,100
But I'm sure it's there.

308
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,512
There must be a moment

309
00:17:02,537 --> 00:17:04,520
when Takumi and I connect.

310
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:08,420
I want to know more about Takumi,

311
00:17:09,016 --> 00:17:10,165
I want to understand him

312
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:11,008
more than anyone else.

313
00:17:11,032 --> 00:17:14,030
So, I'll keep searching.

314
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:17,800
I thought your answer back then

315
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,100
was really good.

316
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,034
If you have any concerns

317
00:17:24,050 --> 00:17:25,256
or worries about the role,

318
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,280
please feel free to ask me anytime.

319
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,830
Yes.

320
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:33,540
Let's make a wonderful work together.

321
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,730
Let's do our best.

322
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:44,270
What the director said

323
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,710
made me very worried.

324
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,389
Even the director said

325
00:17:49,405 --> 00:17:50,951
'it can't be helped today.'

326
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,530
That...

327
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,240
means my acting today was a disaster?

328
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,770
Well...

329
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,040
You can't expect to be like

330
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,540
Hayama-san or Sakuma-san

331
00:18:02,548 --> 00:18:03,571
right from the start.

332
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,020
- You'll gain more experience...
- That's not a reason.

333
00:18:08,232 --> 00:18:09,579
Whether it's your first time

334
00:18:09,604 --> 00:18:11,009
on set or your hundredth,

335
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,712
delivering a good performance

336
00:18:12,737 --> 00:18:13,737
is your job.

337
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,850
But honestly, I don't get it.

338
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,760
Takumi's feelings...

339
00:18:25,610 --> 00:18:27,160
I don't understand it at all.

340
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,990
- Shirasaki-kun...
- It's not good enough.

341
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,750
The effort to understand the role,

342
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,040
I haven't put in enough.

343
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,290
Mm...

344
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:44,291
There's still some time

345
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:45,361
until filming starts.

346
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,790
Let's not rush and do our best.

347
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:01,600
I'm off.

348
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,780
Welcome, what will you have?

349
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,620
I'll have oolong tea.

350
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Huh? Have we met somewhere before?

351
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,170
- N-no.
- This is your first time here, right?

352
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,390
Yes.

353
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,750
Oh.

354
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,950
Oolong tea, huh?

355
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,160
Here you go. Sorry to keep you waiting.

356
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,720
Thank you.

357
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,720
- Where did those two go?
- Ah, right.

358
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,290
All the people here

359
00:20:16,168 --> 00:20:18,860
are gay, aren't they?

360
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,390
What are you drinking?

361
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,700
Oolong tea.

362
00:20:28,168 --> 00:20:30,368
You don't drink alcohol?

363
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,270
I can drink, but...

364
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,840
I'm still on duty.

365
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,520
- Hey, what kind of work are you doing?
- Well...

366
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,370
Hey, wanna drink together over there?

367
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,600
- Please?
- Um, wait, I...

368
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,670
Sorry to keep you waiting.

369
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,250
Haya...

370
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,410
Why are you here?

371
00:21:00,096 --> 00:21:01,126
I happened to see you

372
00:21:01,151 --> 00:21:02,360
in front of the shop earlier.

373
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,940
You seemed off, so I followed you.

374
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,120
Why are you here?

375
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:12,970
Se...

376
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,430
"Se?"

377
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,439
I'm here looking for someone

378
00:21:20,464 --> 00:21:21,525
to have sex with.

379
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,130
Huh?

380
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,110
I have

381
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,267
never really been in relationship.

382
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,510
Honestly,

383
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:32,420
with the role I'm playing now,

384
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:34,357
I don't understand what

385
00:21:34,365 --> 00:21:35,615
it feels like to like someone.

386
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,690
I have to feel just like Takumi.

387
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:42,210
Not just pretending,

388
00:21:42,234 --> 00:21:43,526
I must genuinely feel that way,

389
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,270
or I can't act.

390
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,030
I admire your determination,

391
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,480
but this isn't the right place for that.

392
00:21:58,810 --> 00:21:59,830
And

393
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:04,010
getting involved with a stranger...

394
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,330
Isn't that dangerous?

395
00:22:09,230 --> 00:22:12,970
For me this is the only job I have.

396
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,190
I finally have a chance,

397
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,770
a chance to act alongside Hayama-san.

398
00:22:24,526 --> 00:22:26,120
I don't want to mess it up.

399
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,102
I want to do everything I can

400
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:31,086
for the role.

401
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:31,990
So...

402
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,450
please leave me alone.

403
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:49,140
Then...

404
00:22:49,930 --> 00:22:50,920
Can't it be me?

405
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:52,930
Huh?

406
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,810
Your sex partner,

407
00:22:57,264 --> 00:22:58,140
can't it be me?

408
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:21,090
If you don't like it, tell me.

409
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,770
(Next episode)
Shall we become lovers?

410
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,860
Getting to know each other intimately.

411
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,030
Our first date?

412
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,030
Ah, how adorable.

413
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:49,524
I want to stay like this

414
00:23:49,548 --> 00:23:50,820
a little longer.

415
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,160
No one had any expectations of me.

416
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,422
Hayama-san can't possibly

417
00:23:54,454 --> 00:23:55,797
understand my feelings!

418
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,330
(This is a work of fiction)
You haven't changed,

419
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,670
(This is a work of fiction)
Shirasaki-kun.
