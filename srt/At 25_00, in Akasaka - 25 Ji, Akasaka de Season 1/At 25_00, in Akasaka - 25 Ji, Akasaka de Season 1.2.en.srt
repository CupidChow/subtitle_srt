1
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Shirasaki-kun, your expression

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
seems a bit stiff.

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Next, can Hayama-kun hold

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Shirasaki-kun's chin?

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Got it.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
If you don't like it, tell me.

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Umm...

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Is it okay to do it for real?

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
With me, I mean...

11
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Se...

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's okay.

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Shall we go to my room?

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Please.

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Then...

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Then after tomorrow's poster shoot,

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Huh? Tomorrow?

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,000
come over to my place.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Today...

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I'm going to do it

21
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
with Hayama-san.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you very much.

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Yeah.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Let me check something.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Thank you.

26
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It's good, right?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Good, right?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
- It's very beautiful.
- Ah, that's okay.

29
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,000
How about some water?

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
- This photo is good.
- Thank you.

31
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
- It's pretty.
- Yes.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
There are two ways

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
to enter this industry.

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
The first is to be called by someone.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
(Get scouted into the industry)
The first is to be called by someone.

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
To be scouted

38
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
and invited into this world.

39
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Like Hayama-san.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Another method

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
is knocking on the gate from outside

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
while saying 'Let me in,'

44
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
just like me.

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I wanted someone to find me.

46
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
While wishing for that,

47
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I've been knocking on a gate for years,

48
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
not knowing if

49
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
- Shirasaki-san.
- it will open or not.

50
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Shirasaki-san.

51
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Next, solo shot please.

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ah.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I wonder if someone found me?

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Thank you.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The gate I've been knocking on

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
seems to have started opening...

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Alright, let's start.

58
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Can I

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
really believe that?

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 2)

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Wow.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Amazing.

63
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Just sit wherever.

64
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Alright.

65
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Here.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Thank you very much.

67
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So,

68
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
about what happened yesterday...

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

70
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Like an octopus.

71
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Huh?

72
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You're not gonna do it?

73
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
No, I won't.

74
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Huh? Why not?

75
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Even if it's for acting,

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
you wouldn't really do it, right?

77
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Umm...

78
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
But, then what about yesterday's kiss?

79
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Because

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
if I didn't do that, Shirasaki-kun

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
might have ended up doing it

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
with a complete stranger.

83
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But...

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
then what

85
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
should I do?

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
How about we become lovers?

87
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Huh?

88
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Yesterday, Shirasaki-kun said,

89
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
'I want to do everything I can

90
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
for the role.'

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I feel the same way.

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
So, I want to do whatever I can,

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
if it's for making this drama better.

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
That's why

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
let's start by becoming lovers.

96
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Spend time together,

97
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
eating together,

98
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
and getting to know each other better.

99
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Lovers...

100
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Like Ryouji and Takumi from

101
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
"Hiru no Yume."

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Well?

103
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I want to try it!

104
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Hurry up.

105
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I know, I can't forget it.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
That last sentence...

107
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
(Morning and evening contact,
drink coffee together),

108
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
(Have meals together, watch movies together
call each other's first name)

109
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Spending time together as lovers,

110
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,000
what exactly should we do?

111
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Let's start by listing out

112
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
both of our scenes,

113
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
and then we'll try them before shooting.

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Yes.

115
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Contact each other morning and night.

116
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Drink coffee together.

117
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Watch movies together.

118
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Since we already drank coffee together,

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
that's checked off.

120
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Oh.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Call each other by

122
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
our first names.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Try calling me.

124
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Huh?

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Do you not know my first name?

126
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
No, but...

127
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Ah...

128
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Let's do this some other time.

129
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Calling Hayama-san by his first name...

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
That's still impossible.

131
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Shirasaki-kun, excuse me.

132
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Yes.

133
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Today marks the start of filming for

134
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Director Kawada on 'Hiru no Yume!'

135
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Looking forward to working with you!

136
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
- Looking forward to working with you!
- Looking forward to working with you!

137
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Looking forward to working with you!

138
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Looking forward to working with you!

139
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Welcome!

140
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Only one seat?

141
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

142
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Please, this way.

143
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Cut!

144
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Alright.

145
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's a wrap.

146
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
- Yes.
- Yes, prepare for the next scene.

147
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
- Please hurry up.
- Camera...

148
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

149
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Let me check one more time.

150
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

151
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
(Hiru no Yume)

152
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Good job.

153
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Did you see the news about

154
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
the info being released?

155
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Huh, you're not curious?

156
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,000
No.

157
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I just can't.

158
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I always get curious about

159
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
what people are saying,

160
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I end up searching for it right away.

161
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
"Search?"

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Look.

163
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
'Just having Hayama Asami as the lead is

164
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
already enough to raise expectations!'

165
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
'Looking forward to seeing the cool

166
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Hayama Asami every week!'

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Everyone seems to love Hayama.

168
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Ah, Shirasaki...

169
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Umm...

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It seems exciting.

171
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Let's do our best too!

172
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Yes.

173
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
(The girls' popular comic "Hiru no Yume"
will be turned into a drama)

174
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
(Hayama Asami is so cool)

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
(Just having Hayama Asami as the lead is
already enough to raise expectations!)

176
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
(Looking forward to seeing the
cool Hayama Asami every week!)

177
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
(Must watch the drama
where Asamin plays the lead role)

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
(Who is this Shirasaki?)

179
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
(His image is different from Takumi's)

180
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
(His image is different from Takumi's)

181
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
(Please, don't drag down Hayama-kun!)

182
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
(The girls' popular comic...)
It's alright.

183
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
"Hiru no Yume" will be turned into a drama)
Ah.

184
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
That is a good opportunity.

185
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
If Akeno-san doesn't have a problem,

186
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
then I'm fine with it.

187
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Yes.

188
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
By the way, when is it?

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Three months from now?

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Then, after this drama ended filming.

191
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Yes.

192
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
It's alright.

193
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Yes, see you tomorrow.

194
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Shirasaki-kun, sorry for the wait.

195
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Sorry, even though you're busy.

196
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
No worries.

197
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How about watching

198
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
a movie together today?

199
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Yes.

200
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
What should we watch?

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
A mystery, maybe?

202
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes.

203
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Or comedy?

204
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Or love story?

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Something wrong?

207
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Huh?

208
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You seem down.

209
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Well...

210
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I just feel bad.

211
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I saw some comments on social media.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
People have high expectations

213
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
for you, Hayama-san.

214
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
But...

215
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
no one expected anything from me.

216
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Don't worry about it.

217
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Shirasaki-kun is Shirasaki-kun,

218
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
and I'm me.

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
There's no need to compare.

220
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
That's...

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Because you're you, so you could say it.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Because

223
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Hayama-san is someone who was discovered,

224
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
you were scouted

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
and entered this world

226
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
with expectations.

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Having someone anticipating,

228
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
someone expecting

229
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
something from you.

230
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's a blessing!

231
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Hayama-san can't understand how I feel.

232
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'm sorry, I'll leave.

233
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Haa...

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
What a mess.

235
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,000
(I'm sorry)

236
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Oh, I found you.

237
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Shirasaki-kun,

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
the new script just arrived.

239
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

240
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Geez, the reception is good.

241
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm so excited.

242
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
(Ryouji and Takumi's First Date)
First Date?

243
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
(Hakkeijima Station)

244
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

245
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
No, it's okay.

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Umm...

247
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Let's do our best.

248
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
The rehearsal for our date.

249
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Thank you, likewise.

250
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Well then, shall we?

251
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,000
(Welcome to Sea Paradise)

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
How far are we going?

253
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I completely missed the right moment

254
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
to apologize.

255
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Ah, Shirasaki-kun,

256
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
let's go that way?

257
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
- Hayama-san.
- Hmm?

258
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Isn't this a little embarrassing?

259
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

260
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I haven't been on this

261
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
in about 20 years.

262
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But this is part of the promise, right?

263
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Yes.

264
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
But it's fun, isn't it?

265
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Huh?

266
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It would be embarrassing to come alone,

267
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
but with two people it's fun, right?

268
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Here.

269
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
This is...

270
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,000
something lovers do?

271
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's delicious.

272
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Feels like I'm feeding fish

273
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
or something.

274
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Feeding?

275
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Isn't this like 'aah'?

276
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
There's no 'aah' this serious.

277
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,000
Is that so?

278
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
How is it?

279
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's terrible.

280
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You're lying.

281
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Oh, cute.

282
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
I'll take this one.

283
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Then, I'll take this one.

284
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Yours is cute too.

285
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Yeah.

286
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I'm sorry about the other day.

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Huh?

288
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
I was insensitive.

289
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No,

290
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
that was my fault.

291
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
But you know, Shirasaki-kun,

293
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
you were also discovered.

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Huh?

295
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
The director

296
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
probably saw something in you.

297
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
That's why they chose you.

298
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
And your manager, Shinoda-san.

299
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Shinoda-san also discovered you,

300
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
and he's rooting for you.

301
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Everyone is expecting

302
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
something from you.

303
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Saying no one noticed you,

304
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
that's not true.

305
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
There is someone who's watching you

306
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
for sure.

307
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Thank you very much.

308
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Asami-san.

309
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Asami-san!

310
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
- For me,
- Is that it?

311
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
- Asami-san...
- Oh no.

312
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
- Where?
- We've been noticed.

313
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
- Huh?
- Isn't that Hayama Asami?

314
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
- No way, he's gone!
- It's him, hurry and follow him!

315
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Please make way, sorry.

316
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:01,000
- It was Hayama Asami for sure.
- I'm certain it was him.

317
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
- Did we make a mistake?
- But the vibe seemed right.

318
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
(Food court level one)

319
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,000
"The fans have left now"

320
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Is what I should say.

321
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
And separate after saying that.

322
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But somehow...

323
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
I want to stay like this a bit longer.

324
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
I wonder why

325
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I feel that way.

326
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
(Next episode)

327
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Good evening.

328
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Asami-san!

329
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I thought we'd be together forever.

330
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I can't believe it.

331
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Asami-san staying in my house like this.

332
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The semi-double bed looks suggestive.

333
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It's like I'm nervous.

334
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
Shirasaki-kun reminds me of home.

335
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Should I stay the night?

336
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Wait.

337
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
You're taking that many photos?
