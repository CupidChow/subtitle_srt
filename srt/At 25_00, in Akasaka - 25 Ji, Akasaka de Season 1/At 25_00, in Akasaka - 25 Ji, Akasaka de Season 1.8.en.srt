1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
I'm gonna stop...

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
being your boyfriend, Hayama-san.

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
After that...

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
I can't get my emotions right
while playing Ryouji.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Just when we started
shooting the last episode.

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
At today's shoot,

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
you forgot your lines a lot.
Are you sick?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
What's wrong?

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:01,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 8)

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, Hayama. It's been a while.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Hi.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Sit wherever.

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The usual?

14
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Mm.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
That distracted kid. Shirasaki.

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Is he well?

17
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Mm.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He must have not
recognized me at all.

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Even though he came here
by accident.

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Welcome. What would you like?

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Oolong tea.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Eh? Have we met?

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
- I don't think so.
- First time here?

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Yes.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Mm...

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Despite me helping out

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
at the film study club
many times in college.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Mm.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Thanks.

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey.

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
What happened?

32
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Hm?

33
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I assume you showed up early
because something's bothering you.

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Oh.

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Nothing's bothering me.

36
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Right.

37
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't comfort you anyway.

38
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Yeah.

39
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The only one who can
comfort us is ourselves.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
That's what I think.

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
That doesn't sound like you.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Ugh. Shut up.

43
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If I can't help,
I can at least listen.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
It's just...

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
acting isn't fun right now.

46
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's weird. Are you in a slump?

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Mm.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I would never imagine you
like this in college.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Ah, I haven't been back
to my home town.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I must be craving yummy local
food I haven't had in a while.

51
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
(Visitor Log)

52
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
(Hayama Asami)

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
- Here you go.
- Welcome.

54
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I miss those days.

55
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I started acting

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
because an invite
from the film study club.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
So I got to see myself
on a big screen.

58
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
This is where I met Shirasaki-kun.

59
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:24,000
(Film Study Club)

60
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Nothing has changed.

61
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Those were the days.

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
(Hiru no Yume)

63
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
"Despite the attraction,
they've never crossed the line."

64
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
"Takumi begs Ryouji,
overwhelmed with emotions."

65
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Ryouji-san...

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I want to sleep with you
for the last time.

67
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
"Ryouji and Takumi"

68
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
"press their lips together
as if to affirm their feelings."

69
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
"And they..."

70
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
"become one for the first time."

71
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm trying to get over Hayama-san

72
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
but we still have the love scene.

73
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
It's the opposite of reality.

74
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What do I do?

75
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Ah, Hayama-...san.

76
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Yuki! Are you in there?

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Yamase-san?

78
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Yuki!

79
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Yuki!

80
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
- Hey.
- What's up?

81
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's our day off today.

82
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
No, that's not the point.

83
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let's find something to eat.

84
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Mind if I come in?

85
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You already did.

86
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
So you lied.

87
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Did you mean it?

88
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

89
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's unforgivable!

90
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Was I really that bad back then?

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Please. Your tea.

92
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Thank you.

93
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Why did you just show up?

94
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's not weird. We're a couple.

95
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Just for a while

96
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
when Takumi and Yamato were dating.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Well, you'll end up
dating Ryouji-san.

98
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Anyway, Sakuma-san said

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Hayama-san had gone back
to his home town.

100
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Eh? Why?

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,000
No idea.

102
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Probably to get his emotions right.

103
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
He forgot his lines yesterday.
He had to do so many takes.

104
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It was weird.

105
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Maybe it had to do
with someone he liked.

106
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Eh?

107
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
There's someone
he still can't get over.

108
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
(Hiru no Yume)

109
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I wonder who. Probably
the actress he's rumored with.

110
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I know nothing about that.

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Huh?

112
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What are you so mad about?

113
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm not mad!

114
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's so obvious.

115
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
For me, you are...

116
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
my first love.

117
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Even if to you I'm just
one of many conquests,

118
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
you're the only one...

119
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
for me.

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I sucked at crying on screen.

121
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Recently...

122
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I watched films and dramas,

123
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
obsessed with studying acting.

124
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
But why

125
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
was I that obsessed?

126
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So you lied.

127
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Did you mean it?

128
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm sorry. It was my fault.

129
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
It's unforgivable!

130
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Even if I'm just
one your many conquests,

131
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
you're the only one for me.

132
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
- Yes.
- Cut!

133
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Okay.

134
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
That was amazing.

135
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Thank you.

136
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I'm glad I asked you, Hayama.

137
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's do the next scene.

138
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Mm.
- Okay.

139
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
- Let's do Scene 13.
- Yes.

140
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

141
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Scene 13...

142
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
- "Sorry for not saying anything."
- Ah, that's right.

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
My first acting job was so fun.

144
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Do me a favor.

145
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
- Right now.
- Is that the one?

146
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It was fun getting to create
something with everyone.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
And it was nice getting to...

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
forget my real self
and become someone else.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Even though I was me,

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I wasn't me.

151
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
I got to express
my emotions, laugh,

152
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
cry, get angry...

153
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I will...

154
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
tell you how I feel.

155
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I really like that guy.

156
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
That's right.

157
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Acting is fun.

158
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I love it for real.

159
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Acting.

160
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
A place like this exists?

161
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Yeah.

162
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You mean right now?

163
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
- Yes.
- Hi.

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
- Oh, hi.
- Yes.

165
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You two are very late.

166
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Sorry.

167
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So what would you like?

168
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'll get draft beer.

169
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
- Draft beer.
- Draft beer.

170
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
- Shirasaki-kun?
- Yuki?

171
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Uh, anything is fine.

172
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
So get anything.

173
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You're sure?

174
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I've seen a lot of
Hayama-san's works.

175
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I bet I've seen more.

176
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Seen his first one?

177
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
- The one he played a famous stud?
- Of course.

178
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But that role
had no emotional impact.

179
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
They didn't take advantage
of Hayama Asami's strengths.

180
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
- The doctor role was good too.
- That's...

181
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
- Seen it too?
- Of course.

182
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
When his patient died and he cried.

183
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Exactly.

184
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I thought his acting was great.

185
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Hayama-san plays
sensitive roles really well.

186
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
But it's beautiful to watch too.

187
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I bet you can list hundreds
of Hayama's strengths.

188
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
- Eh?
- Exactly like Ryouji and Takumi.

189
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
You're right. Mm.

190
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Are you two really dating?

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
We're not.

192
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
By the way,

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
why are you so curious
about me and Hayama-san?

194
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Why am I?

195
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Oh. Maybe you're
into Shirasaki-kun.

196
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
No. No, no, no.

197
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
So you must be into Hayama-san.

198
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Am I into Hayama-san?

199
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Maybe a little.

200
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:57,000
- Huh?
- Huh?

201
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
The only one who can
comfort us is ourselves.

202
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
That's what I think.

203
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
That's true.

204
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Akeno-san, sorry for worrying you.

205
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I'm all right now.

206
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
So fast.

207
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You really are our finest product.

208
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Do your best until it's wrapped.

209
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's okay.

210
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I can have fun with it.

211
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I won't force Shirasaki-kun
to stay in character anymore.

212
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I'll just be Ryouji
until it's over.

213
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Sakuma-san, what do you

214
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
think about the last episode?

215
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Uh...

216
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I think another twist after
they made love might be fun.

217
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Mm...

218
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
It's a good ending.

219
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
- It is, but...
- Soon I have to say

220
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
- the work vibes
- goodbye to Takumi

221
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
- must be good too.
- and Ryouji-san.

222
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
- I see.
- That would be great.

223
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
After the filming's wrapped,

224
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I probably won't see
Hayama-san again.

225
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm gonna stop...

226
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
being your boyfriend.

227
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm trying to get over it,

228
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
but why do I keep
thinking about Hayama-san?

229
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
I can't believe...

230
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm gonna lose to this feeling.

231
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
- Want a drink?
- Yes.

232
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hayama-san!

233
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Eh?

234
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I called Hayama here.

235
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
We'll all drink together
for the first time.

236
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
Ah.

237
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
- So it's not just you, Sakuma.
- Mm.

238
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Come on. Sit down.

239
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
- I'll get the usual.
- The usual. Got it.

240
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,000
What will you get?

241
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
- Hello.
- Hello.

242
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
So...

243
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Hey, hey. Yuki!

244
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
- That's too much.
- Leave me be.

245
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
- Don't stop me.
- That's enough.

246
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Leave me be.

247
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
What's worse,

248
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
the filming will be over soon.
We'll be so lonely.

249
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Right.

250
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I really will.

251
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
But...

252
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
- Hey, hey!
- I'm nauseous.

253
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Hold on. This way.

254
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
- Shirasaki-kun...
- Can you stand?

255
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
- Of course I can.
- You obviously can't.

256
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
- I can.
- It's obvious you can't.

257
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
- I can walk.
- Are you okay, Shirasaki-kun?

258
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
- Hold on.
- Are you okay?

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
- Watch your step.
- I said I'm fine.

260
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
- Let's go.
- I said I'm fine. Let's drink more.

261
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
- We have to go home.
- I'm not going home.

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Hayama, since you're
playing his boyfriend,

263
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
sorry, but can you get him home?

264
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Eh?

265
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Hey,

266
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
are you really into Hayama?

267
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm into him...

268
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
in the way when I see
a great actor at work

269
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
and go, "I wish I could do that!"
Haven't you felt that way?

270
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,000
That's all.

271
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Huh?

272
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't get it. What's that?

273
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
It's just a thought.

274
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
So...

275
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
A great actor?

276
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
If that's the case,

277
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
have you ever felt
that way about me?

278
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Eh?

279
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:58,000
No.

280
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Are you saying I'm a bad actor?

281
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
- I'm not saying that.
- Whatever. I get it.

282
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Give me a second.

283
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'll get you some water.

284
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
It's okay. Drink this.

285
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Thank you very much.

286
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Mm.

287
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Something like this
has happened before.

288
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
But it's gonna be over soon,

289
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
this drama.

290
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You're right.

291
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Ah.

292
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I should get going.

293
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
But...

294
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll call a cab.

295
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Don't worry.

296
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
See you on set.

297
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Hayama-san.

298
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Even though it took me
this long this say this,

299
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
And it was me who suggested
we stop acting like a couple,

300
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
I know it's weird
to say this right now.

301
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,000
I want you to sleep with me.

302
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Can you hold me, please?

303
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
(Next episode)

304
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
This is like a dream.

305
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,000
It's been a blast.

306
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
You like it that much?

307
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Please hold me.

308
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Sorry, I can't do that yet.

309
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
It's a beautiful memory.
