1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
Tomorrow,

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
maybe think of something
you like and say it.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Or...

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
did you come here to tell me that?

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This feeling...

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
is...

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
That person above the clouds

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
is now next to me.

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I like...

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Ryouji-san.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What was that feeling at the time?

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
It's true I'm better
at playing Takumi, but...

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
that feeling was...

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Sorry for the wait.
Your "lu rou fan." (Braised Pork Rice)

15
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

16
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Oh, you're here, Shirasaki-kun.

17
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
- It's been a while.
- Hello.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You hired someone new?

19
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Mm.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Your personnel info is still here.

21
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
You can work here any time.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm gonna be busy
for a while so I can't.

23
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Mm.

24
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I figured.

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, hey.

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You know Shirasaki-kun there?

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
His drama is on air right now.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
- Drama?
- Mm.

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's called "Hiru no Yume."

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
- I'm watching it.
- Really?

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Oh, that guy.

32
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mm.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I watched the movie
and I was wondering.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There must've been more men
than women, wasn't there?

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Are you watching
the second episode?

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Yes, I am.

37
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
What is it?

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Can I call you "Takumi"?

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Eh?

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Takumi.

41
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Don't, please.

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I see.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't.

44
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You were great.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Really?

46
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
(Really?)

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You conveyed resistance

48
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
but showed irrepressible
anticipation quite well.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
All right, let's shoot
the behind-the-scenes stuff.

50
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
- Yes.
- Mm.

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
- Please.
- Don't worry.

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
- Begin.
- Yes.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Uh, the love confession scene
we shot the other day for episode 3

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
was great.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I could feel that
Takumi genuinely liked Ryouji.

56
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Thank you very much.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It really felt that way.

58
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It almost made me think you

59
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
genuinely liked Hayama-san.

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Eh?

61
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
That scene was so wonderful,

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that it made me imagine that.

63
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Hey, Shirasaki-kun.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
"Liking" someone...

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
must have felt that way.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Mm?

67
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
My dialogue in that scene
was the truth.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
In that moment...

69
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I think I genuinely liked him.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
That's why
your acting felt so real.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's true I could feel that
I liked the person before me.

72
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
So that...

73
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
must be how Takumi feels
towards Ryouji-san,

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
isn't it?

75
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 4)

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
(Takumi must cook for Ryouji)

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
So gnocchi is the name of the food?

78
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
You don't know it?

79
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
It's chewy and delicious.

80
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
After you finish mashing,
add the flour.

81
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Got it.

82
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You're the one who's
a great cook, Asami-san.

83
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
But in the script,
Takumi-kun is the one cooking it.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Mm.

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Eh?

86
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Someone doesn't know
how to knead dough.

87
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Not knowing how to do that
won't kill me.

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wow.

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
So this is gnocchi.

90
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm gonna eat.

91
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Mm.

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Delicious.

93
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
- Really?
- Mm.

94
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, sorry.

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I had to say "Ah" too.

96
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
It's so good I forgot.

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Oh.

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Yes.

99
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So...

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Ah...

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Feels like I'm the only one
who's embarrassed.

102
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The one who's feeding you
is embarrassed too.

103
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
It's good.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Isn't it?

105
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Very delicious, this gnocchi.

106
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Hm?

107
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You got some...

108
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Eh?

109
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Did my heart race
because of Asami-san?

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Don't tell me

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
this is...

112
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
(Taiwan Night Market)

113
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Sorry for calling you here
out of the blue.

114
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
It's fine.

115
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I like you.

116
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I like you,

117
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Ryouji-san.

118
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Amazing...

119
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What was that just now?

120
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Takumi is beyond awesome.

121
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
(#HiruNoYume)

122
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
(Takumi is too cute.)

123
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
(Takumi-kun is so cute.
The actor was amazing.)

124
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,000
(I'm a fan of Takumi now.
Can't wait for next week.)

125
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
(Takumi must be sad for real.)

126
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Shirasaki-kun?

127
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
How are you doing?

128
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Congratulations.

129
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
For trending at number one.

130
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Eh?

131
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Oh.

132
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
After it went on air,

133
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Takumi's name was trending
at number right away.

134
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
(Takumi)
It created a huge buzz.

135
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,000
I see.

136
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Underwhelming reaction.

137
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Uh.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No, I'm just confused.

139
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Ah, how are you?
Thank you for taking care of us.

140
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Likewise.

141
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
From now on, please bear with us.

142
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Sure, please bear with us as well.

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Excuse me.

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Shirasaki-kun?

145
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
You made it.

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
You're booked for so many jobs.

147
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
And you've gotten
many interview requests.

148
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Eh?

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Since you're such a good actor,

150
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
of course you're being discovered.

151
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm sure you...

152
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
will do great.

153
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This is good.

154
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
So very good.

155
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
- Shinoda-san?
- Mm, yeah.

156
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Sorry, excuse me.

157
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Shirasaki-kun is breaking out.

158
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I didn't expect such a buzz.

159
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Shirasaki-kun has always been good.

160
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Hm.

161
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
In college,

162
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
his plays drew crowds.

163
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
So I'm not surprised by this.

164
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Wow, you act like
you're a veteran at this.

165
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Veteran?

166
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
If you act like you're
above others, you'll get hate.

167
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What's that?

168
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Ah.

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
- Congrats, Shirasaki-kun.
- Ah!

170
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Ah, it's Takumi!

171
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
It's just... I watched your drama.

172
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
- You were so great.
- Thank you very much.

173
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
- It's Takumi.
- Eh?

174
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Uh.

175
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
- He's cute.
- It's Takumi.

176
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
- I'm sorry.
- Eh?

177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Uh, I...

178
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Asami-san, can I come over today?

179
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
(Yoshiki: Long time no see.
I watched your drama. It's been...)

180
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
(Yoshikawa: I was shocked
seeing you on TV... )

181
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
(Koizumi: You're on TV?)

182
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Who?

183
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Eh?

184
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's get dinner today?

185
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Must be busy. Next time maybe.

186
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Get out.

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Your first multi-episode drama.
And you're paired with Hayama-san.

188
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
How did it feel when you were cast?

189
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I was extremely shocked.

190
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Uh...

191
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I wondered if I'd be any good.

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I couldn't believe

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'd get to be in a drama
with Hayama-san.

194
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When did you
get into acting, Shirasaki-san?

195
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I don't remember.

196
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Uh... What about your beginning?

197
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
In college,
I was in a film study club.

198
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
After I graduated, I moved to Tokyo
and started as a stage actor.

199
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Almost done with interviews.

200
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Can I come over later?

201
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
(Almost done with interviews.
Can I come over later?)

202
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
- How's it going?
- How's it going?

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Shirasaki-kun, there are
a few more interviews left.

204
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
You can do it.

205
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Yes.

206
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Afterward, the president
will take us out to dinner.

207
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
You're available, right?

208
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
- Yes.
- Mm.

209
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
(Almost done with interviews.
Can I come over later?)

210
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes.

211
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Please.

212
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
How are you doing?

213
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Tomorrow's call sheet.

214
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Thank you.

215
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
What's wrong? You look gloomy.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I see Hayama-san's
not coming in tomorrow.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Eh? Didn't you know?

218
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I heard from today he'd be
shooting a commercial out of town.

219
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
- Eh?
- He's as busy as ever.

220
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Is that so?

221
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
What's this?

222
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Looks like being in scenes
with me is not enough.

223
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
- It's not like that.
- I see.

224
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Not seeing Hayama
makes you lonely, isn't it?

225
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Eh?

226
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Right now...

227
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
I'm lonely, aren't I?

228
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Don't ask me.

229
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
It's beautiful.

230
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,000
Asami-san?

231
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Feels like it's been ages.

232
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Eat it if you don't mind.

233
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,000
This is...

234
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
my favorite.

235
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Can I hug you?

236
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You're doing it.

237
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
This isn't Takumi's feeling.

238
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
It's my real feeling.

239
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I...

240
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
like Asami-san.

241
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do your best today.

242
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
I will.

243
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Mm, it's good.

244
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Here.

245
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
You got some...

246
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Hm?

247
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
- Cut!
- Yes.

248
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Okay!

249
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
That's a wrap!

250
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Let's set up for the next scene!

251
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
- Good.
- Please hurry.

252
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

253
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Shirasaki-kun?

254
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Come over today?

255
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Yes. No, but...

256
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
- Shirasaki-kun?
- Yes?

257
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I can't possibly do it.

258
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Acting as his love interest
like I've been doing.

259
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Now that I've realized
I like Asami-san,

260
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
how do I act around him?

261
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Uh, let me introduce you.

262
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
He's gonna be in the next episode.

263
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This is Yamase Kazuma-kun.

264
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
- You're Sakuma's junior, right?
- Oh, yes.

265
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
We work for the same company.
Please be kind to him!

266
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Even though I'm
the youngest one here,

267
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
please be kind to me.

268
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
- Pleased to meet you!
- Pleased to meet you!

269
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
All right, everyone!

270
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Let's get back to setting up.

271
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

272
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
You must be
the buzzing Shirasaki-san.

273
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Oh, pleased to meet you.

274
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
I was kidding.

275
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
I'm looking forward
to our sensual kiss scene.

276
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,000
(Next episode)

277
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
When your crush doesn't show,
it means he's not into you.

278
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Your beloved Shirasaki-kun
must be taken by Yamase.

279
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It seems you're still angry.

280
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'm not angry.

281
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I must be into what
I'm not supposed to mess with.

282
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I don't wanna give you to anyone.
