1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
I...

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
don't wanna give you to anyone.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You two really
looked like a couple.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
That may not be true anymore.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,000
About confusing
my role with myself.

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,000
You mean to say...

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you like Yuki?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I don't know.

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
But I'm not telling you,
Yamase-kun.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
"Once I got to be with you,
Ryouji-san, I understand"

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
"that ah, my heart is really here."

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Heart...

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Heart?

14
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
That's some interesting dialogue.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But this dialogue...

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I understand it.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm still struggling
getting the hang of it.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Even though
your heart understands it,

19
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
you may not really feel that way.

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
But don't worry about it.

21
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
If it's you,

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
you'll be able to make
that dialogue your own.

23
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm gonna try.

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
So will you come over today?

25
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Today?

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
If you do, I'll cook you something.

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
You haven't asked
to hang out with me lately.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I'd be lonely
if we were a real couple.

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
This looks so good.

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
So let's eat.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
- I'm gonna eat.
- I'm gonna eat.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Hm.

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Is this burdock root?

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Yes, I put it in
the hamburger steaks.

35
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
- How is it?
- It's delicious.

36
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Wonderful.

37
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Why is it so good?

38
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I just followed the recipe.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm glad to see you
enjoy food every time.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
When I eat with you,

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
the food tastes the best.

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The best?

43
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Thanks.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You mean to say...

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you like Yuki?

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I don't know.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But I'm not telling you,
Yamase-kun.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Maybe...

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Asami-san feels the same way.

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No, no way. That's impossible.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,000
"At 25:00, in Akasaka"
(Episode 6)

52
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Shirasaki-kun, go take a shower.

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Eh?

54
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You've left many of your PJs

55
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and other clothes at my place.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's late. Please stay over.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
(TV commercial, toner for men)

58
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Shirasaki-kun?

59
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I think I should go home.

60
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What's wrong?

61
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I shouldn't bother you
while you work.

62
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You're not.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
But if I stay,

64
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll take up your time.

65
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You won't.

66
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So...

67
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
don't leave.

68
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Stay.

69
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I invited you because I missed you.

70
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Please.

71
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Here, take a shower.

72
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Asami-san, are you asleep?

73
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm not.

74
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
If you're gonna sleep,
please do it in the bed.

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I won't sleep.

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Well, you're sleeping.

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Please sleep in the bed.

78
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Asami-san?

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Are you listening, Asami-san?

80
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Say it again.

81
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Eh?

82
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
My name.

83
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Say it again.

84
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Asami-san.

85
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Again.

86
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Asami-san.

87
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
When someone says our name,

88
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
it feels special, don't you think?

89
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Special?

90
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Yes.

91
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
That's why...

92
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I hated it

93
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
when Yamase-kun called you "Yuki."

94
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Then...

95
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that...

96
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
means...

97
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you probably...

98
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
like me.

99
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You're asleep.

100
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Asami-san.

101
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
You were obviously busy

102
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
but you still spent time with me.

103
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Thank you very much.

104
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,000
But...

105
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't want you to force yourself

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
and I wish you would
prioritize your work.

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I do want us to talk more

108
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
but if you're busy,

109
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll be okay even if
we don't see each other.

110
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I wish we saw each other more.

111
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Asami-san.

112
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Actually...

113
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
more than this.

114
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm not doing this
to get into character.

115
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm doing it
just because I want to.

116
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
(Hayama Asami on a date with
Sugibayashi Hana at BBQ shop)

117
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Is this true?

118
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It's clearly a rumor.

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
A rumor?

120
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Mm.

121
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
In reality,
Hayama-san is very popular,

122
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
but I never heard
these kind of rumors.

123
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Uh...

124
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
- About that.
- Eh? What?

125
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
- Do you know something?
- Well...

126
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
There's someone
he still can't get over.

127
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Really?

128
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Who?

129
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I don't know that much

130
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
but this might be that person.

131
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Sakuma-san, Yamase-san, please.

132
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes, Sakuma. I'm coming.

133
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Me too.

134
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Someone he likes.

135
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Someone Asami-san...

136
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
likes?

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
"This is really a bad idea."

138
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
"This is really a bad idea."

139
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
(This is really a bad idea.)

140
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Acting like a couple with Asami-san
who already likes someone else

141
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
is probably a bad idea.

142
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
So...

143
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
it can't be me?

144
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Someone you have sex with?

145
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It can't be me?

146
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
If you already like someone else,
don't say things like that.

147
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm off work now.

148
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Will you come over?

149
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Of course not.

150
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I will.

151
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
What's that look?

152
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Eh?

153
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Compliment from the director?

154
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,000
No.

155
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But...

156
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I just think it's fun.

157
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Sakuma-san said
he heard a long time ago

158
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
that there was someone
Asami-san liked.

159
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
That was in the past.

160
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
That might not be the case anymore.

161
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
That must be it.

162
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
So...

163
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
it should be okay for him
to act like a couple with me

164
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,000
even though it's just what I want.

165
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,000
But...

166
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
but right now...

167
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
right now is enough...

168
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
for Asami-san

169
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
to be my boyfriend.

170
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Please.

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Those attending the dinner party,

172
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Welcome.

173
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
the bus is waiting outside.
Please get in.

174
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

175
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

176
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Oh, that.

177
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
- I watched that too.
- You did?

178
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Let's watch it together.

179
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
- Because I love it.
- Yes.

180
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
- I'm so glad.
- Mm, well.

181
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
It's...

182
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Hey, about the person
you still can't get over.

183
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You said, "There's someone
I can't get over."

184
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Mm.

185
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,000
So... you like that person?

186
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Mm.

187
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I do.

188
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
What's wrong?

189
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I had too much to drink.

190
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You're okay?

191
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yes.

192
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm leaving.

193
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'll get you your bag.

194
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Hey, wait.

195
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
All right, those going to
another bar, please wait up front!

196
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

197
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Let's join them.

198
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,000
- I already drank a lot.
- I know.

199
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Yuki already left.

200
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
He said he drank too much.

201
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
My heart is really here.

202
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
That's some interesting dialogue.

203
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But don't worry about it.

204
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
If it's you,

205
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
you'll be able to make it your own.

206
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Asami-san,

207
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I...

208
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
get it now.

209
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Once I...

210
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
got to be with you, Asami-san,

211
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I understand.

212
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Ah,

213
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
my heart is really here.

214
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,000
That...

215
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
It's like that for me too.

216
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
You're cheating, Ryouji-san.

217
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Cut!

218
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Mm, it's good!

219
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
- Next scene, please!
- Yes.

220
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Let's do the next scene.

221
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Hey.

222
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That dialogue just now.
You did great.

223
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
The heart part?

224
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The heart part.

225
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's like I really felt that.

226
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
My heart was racing.

227
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Where the heart is...

228
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
It must hurt first
for us to feel it.

229
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
I wish we could express that.

230
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
(talk morning and night,
drink coffee together)

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
(eat together, watch movies together,
use each other's first name)

232
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
(go on dates, feed each other,
take pics together)

233
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
(Buy matching keychains,
hold hands, hugs)

234
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
How's it going?

235
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
How's it going?

236
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh, right.

237
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Come over today?

238
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Shirasaki-kun?

239
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Hayama-san,

240
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Thank you very much for everything.

241
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
What's wrong?

242
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You're busy

243
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
but you've been
spending time with me

244
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,000
to help me get into character.

245
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Thank you very much.

246
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Shirasaki-kun?

247
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'm gonna stop

248
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
being your boyfriend, Hayama-san.

249
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Why?

250
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Thanks to Hayama-san, I...

251
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
now understand Takumi's feelings.

252
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I've got the hang of it now.

253
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,000
I don't need to rely on you
anymore, Hayama-san.

254
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
But the filming isn't over.

255
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Is that a good idea?

256
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
It's enough.

257
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You don't need to do it anymore.

258
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Is that so?

259
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Then, that's good.

260
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
Thank you very much.

261
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
When you smile,
don't show your teeth.

262
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:41,000
(Next episode)

263
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
Everyone praises how I look.

264
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
You're gonna quit acting?

265
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The next thing I knew,
I couldn't take my eyes off of you.

266
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,000
I don't want to give you

267
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,000
to anyone.
