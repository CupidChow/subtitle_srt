You.

165
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:47,580
Even if they find evidence and investigate you,

166
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,910

I mean...

182
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:44,150
Chief, you can't give us the case the Transportation Department couldn't take care of.

183
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:46,340
This is the Violent Crimes Department.

184
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:50,860
You know how many cases there are in Woowon City every night.

185
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,330
Yes. Even-

186
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,730
Even with the higher-up's order, we can't.

187
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,760
We won't allow it. Chief-

188
00:15:56,760 --> 00:16:00,170
He hung up. What the f***.

189
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:02,580
[Jang Chae Rim]

190
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,880
Hello, Judge Song.

191
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,220
What brings you here?

192
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,800
I heard you stopped by the Transportation Department yesterday.

193
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,780
Is something going on?

194
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,710
Feel free to talk to me.

195
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,330
I'm dying to know.

196
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,120
To be honest,

197
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,700
a car got stolen.

198
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,190
Really? Your car?

199
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,260
Not mine.

200
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,630
It's Eun Hye's old car.

201
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:53,400
Ho Yeong obsesses over that car because he can't get over his mom.

202
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:57,230
I thought it was for the better at first.

203
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,510
But he's feeling down since the car is gone.

204
00:17:01,510 --> 00:17:05,780
He won't talk much, and he won't eat, either.

205
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:07,600
[text]

206
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,100
He'd get over it since he's a grown-up.

207
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,130
But if that car turns up later by chance,

208
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,100
I think he'd feel very confused.

209
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,980
So, if you happen to find it, don't tell...

210
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,490
anyone but me.

211
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,710
I'll take care of it.

212
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:35,180
Okay. I'll do that.

213
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,430
Try thinking from the kids' perspective.

214
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,680
That sweet kid misses her mom

215
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,800
and cries all night, holding back.

216
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:54,560
I'm her grandma, but I didn't know that child was hurting.

217
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,200
It's so pathetic.

218
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,400
You should stop drinking and stop hitting them, too.

219
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,000
For f***'s sake.

220
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,310
You think I feel good? Mom,

221
00:18:04,310 --> 00:18:07,010
I feel plenty stressed, too.

222
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:09,160
I sent money through Cheong Gang today.

223
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,620
Take her to the hospital or whatever.

224
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,940
What?

225
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:28,660
F***. I told you to take her to the hospital.

226
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,840
Hey, Lee Sang Taek.

227
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,920
[text]

228
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,370
Director Jeong.

229
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:36,400
Let's keep things clean.

230
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,940
Go to the address I send you and just deliver the car.

231
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,450
Don't get distracted and cause trouble.

232
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:45,610
I'll kill you for real.

233
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,070
Okay.

234
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:55,000
3878, Honors. Pull over to the right.

235
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,620
You ran a red light.

236
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,840
Pull over to the right.

237
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:25,150
Is something going on these days?

238
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,100
Han is worried. He thinks something's going on.

239
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm not sure.

240
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,370
My head feels heavy these days.

241
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:36,690
Did you know we call you "Scale" behind your back?

242
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:39,010
Scale?

243
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,230
You said judges have scales in their heads

244
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:46,630
and what we do is balance crime and punishment.

245
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,940
You've always said that to us.

246
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,220
That's what I thought.

247
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,730
But I don't feel that these days.

248
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:02,680
I thought I'd been living with the strength of my brain.

249
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,450
But I guess I'm getting old.

250
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,660
I keep wanting to live with the strength of my heart.

251
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,620
You ran a red light. Show me your license, please.

252
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,000
[Name: Lee Sang Taek]

253
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,110
Please look up 28-Ro-3878, Honors.

254
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:03,090
W-What are you doing?

255
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:04,920
Get back in the car.

256
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:10,440
I hope you understand.

257
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,590
Ever since I lost my wife two years ago,

258
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:16,010
I'm living with my sick mother and a six-year-old girl.

259
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,790
The older kid won't go to school, and he causes trouble every day.

260
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,370
I'm so frustrated with my life.

261
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:26,600
Don't give me stuff like that.

262
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,610
You'll get punished more heavily for bribing.

263
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:36,580
I'll just let you go today.

264
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,100
Follow the traffic rules from now on.

265
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,430
Thank you! Thank you!

266
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:47,910
28-Ro-3878, Honors was confirmed stolen.

267
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:52,650
What?

268
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,380
Shit, I'm screwed.

269
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,250
What's wrong with you? Calm down.

270
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:04,460
Don't move! I'll shoot you if you move!

271
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,380
Hey, hey! Stop!

272
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:14,680
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

273
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,670
8783. 8783. Stolen car. The suspect fled.

274
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,780
Assistance needed.

275
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,970
Ho Yeong!

276
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,500
Have you been home all day?

277
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,050
Yes.

278
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,820
I'm sorry.

279
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,970
Because of me,

280
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,400
even you committed a crime.

281
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,030
I feel bad about that.

282
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,840
I found the vehicle.

283
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:37,530
I wanted to let you know quietly since you asked me to,

284
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:42,310
but it became a problem because the thief assaulted an officer and fled.

285
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,300
I think we should start investigating.

286
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,480
Where's the vehicle?

287
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,500
It's in our jurisdiction storage.

288
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,030
There's nothing wrong with the vehicle.

289
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:15,300
I searched the trunk and the glove box,

290
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,960
but it doesn't seem it was used for a crime.

291
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,300
The bumper on this side was damaged.

292
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,650
It's always been like that.

293
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,410
Do you know who stole it?

294
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:29,500
It's someone named Lee Sang Taek.

295
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,390
He's a man in his 40s who lives in Jangbeom-dong.

296
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:36,110
May I take the car?

297
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,650
We'll have to investigate it further.

298
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,920
That's the rule normally,

299
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,140
but you're Judge Song.

300
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:50,230
I'll let you take it with you. Just one second.

301
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:03,080
[Towed Vehicles Storage Office]

302
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,920
The release was approved.

303
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:22,460
I'll place the car here for you.

304
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,300
I said it was your car, and they approved it right away.

305
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,160
Please sign here.

306
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:51,110
Oh, right. The tire went flat.

307
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:54,250
It'd be difficult to drive it now.

308
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,070
I'll take it to the repair shop I know.

309
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:00,670
- I can drive there, right?
- No.

310
00:27:00,670 --> 00:27:02,850
That'd be dangerous. The steering wheel would veer off.

311
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:05,640
I think you'd need a tow truck.

312
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:09,100
- We'll replace the tire and bring it to you.
- No.

313
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:11,870
I'll call a tow truck and take it with me.

314
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,920
We have a tow truck, too.

315
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:20,330
We can go right now, then, right?

316
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,680
Why did the tire go flat?

317
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,570
What's this? Hold on, sir!

318
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,170
What?

319
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:44,990
Is this why the tire went flat?

320
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,210
What's this?

321
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:48,850
It looks like a motorcycle part.

322
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:51,260
Is it a fender?

323
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,370
- Fender?
- Yes.

324
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,940
What's the date the vehicle was stolen?

325
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:13,140
I think it was the night of April 7th.

326
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,800
What's the date your son drove the vehicle last?

327
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:22,180
The vehicle was gone when I left for work on the morning of April 8th.

328
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:24,750
He probably drove it until the night of April 7th.

329
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:29,010
He was at the library until late at night to study for the exam.

330
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:31,420
You said he goes to Hanguk University, right?

331
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:34,420
Yes. But...

332
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:41,320
are you sure what you found in the vehicle is the fender of the motorcycle from the accident?

333
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:44,200
Well, we'll have to look into it further,

334
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,810
but the motorcycle from the accident was missing the fender.

335
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,140
Why do you ask?

336
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:56,270
Since my wife used to drive the car,

337
00:28:56,270 --> 00:29:00,220
I don't want it to get involved with an unfortunate case like that.

338
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:05,120
I'm sorry.

339
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,310
You shouldn't apologize for it.

340
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,910
This is just for formality,

341
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:13,630
but I'd like to talk to your son as a material witness.

342
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,630
Would that be necessary?

343
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:19,570
It's just for formality. We need to write the witness report.

344
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,470
When?

345
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:23,780
The case got bigger than expected.

346
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,120
I'd like to do it now.

347
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,340
If you kill someone in a hit-and-run and assault an officer,

348
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,920
how long do you serve?

349
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:45,100
Are you asking me?

350
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:50,300
Yes. I thought you'd know since you're a judge.

351
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:52,950
How rude.

352
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:56,210
That's like asking me to estimate the price of an object.

353
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,830
I'm sorry, Judge Song.

354
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,020
Come on in.

355
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,270
Is he not home? Should we call him?

356
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,690
No, he's probably upstairs.

357
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,850
Have a seat here for a moment.

358
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:50,710
Why are the police here?

359
00:30:51,510 --> 00:30:54,330
How did you know the police were here?

360
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,100
I saw them.

361
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:09,170
The car was found.

362
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:12,150
They found a motorcycle fender on the bottom of it.

363
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:15,640
It was stolen for two days...

364
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:20,270
and the thief is on the run after assaulting an officer.

365
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:31,120
When was the last time you drove the car?

366
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:35,840
Two days ago.

367
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,140
Yes, that's correct.

368
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,980
Come out.

369
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,180
When was the last time you drove the vehicle?

370
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,590
The night of April 7th?

371
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,070
It's been two days.

372
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,560
I studied at the library until late and drove back home.

373
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,580
You found out it was stolen the day after?

374
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,350
Yes.

375
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,520
I went out to go to school, but it was gone.

376
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:19,810
I thought Dad took it to Grandma's house at first,

377
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,990
but he said he didn't when I asked him.

378
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,730
How did the culprit take the car key?

379
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:46,750
My grandma always kept a spare key in the glove box.

380
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:50,300
You can't lock new cars if there's a key inside,

381
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,670
but you can lock that one because it's old.

382
00:32:53,670 --> 00:32:57,210
I think the culprit found that key.

383
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:07,820
To steal the vehicle, he probably needed a car key.

384
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,580
How did Lee Sang Taek know a spare key was in the glove box?

385
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:28,610
Maybe he didn't intend to steal the vehicle.

386
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,660
While trying to steal what's inside the car,

387
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:37,730
I wonder if he found the car key in the glove box by chance.

388
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:51,650
You're right. You're smart, Ho Yeong.

389
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:57,650

You were so scared to pull out your tooth,

00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,300
The problem is the car belongs to Judge Song Pan Ho's mother-in-law.

I went to the police to turn myself in,

557
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:35,470
but when I heard the victim was Chairman Kim Gang Heon's younger son,

558
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:37,500
I turned around.

559
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,160
It became something the law can't fix.

So, he never gets caught.

If we pay him handsomely and make sure he never returns here,

he'd be responsible for the accident.

580
