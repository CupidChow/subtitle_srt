The strongest suspect in the hit-and-run accident

was Lee Sang Taek, who died that day.

77

I'm Kim Min, defending Kim Sang Hyeok, the defendant in this case.

83
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:35,000
I've been to many courts for many different cases.

84
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,600
But the courtroom I see today is quite shocking.

85
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,210
I've carefully read the evidence submitted by the Prosecution.

86
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,480
I reckon proving the evidence will be

87
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,030
a greater issue than legal interpretation for today's court.

88
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,170
The evidence the Prosecution submitted so far...

89
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,940
are way too inadequate to say Kim Sang Hyeok is the culprit.

Can't you tell me?

97
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:22,350
Dad told me to come home early.

98
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,400

- No.

- Okay.

100
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:51,750

- Eun's mom.

my Eun?

104
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,320
At the ossuary.

105
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,810
The ossuary.

106
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,690
Yes.

107
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,810
Eun is quite young.

108
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,750
When Eun was in my womb,

109
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:33,420
many things happened.

110
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:40,140
She was so pretty and made me wonder if there'd be another baby as pretty as her.

111
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,420
At some point, her intelligence stopped developing.

112
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:49,090
She's at about a 10-year-old's level.

113
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:53,310
That's why Eun doesn't have the ability to endure the pain

114
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:56,200
children her age usually go through.

115
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,150
I'm sure she's suffering a lot because her second oldest brother died recently.

116
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:06,510
But sneaking a peek at her while she's with you,

117
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:12,560
she laughs a lot and seems to be very happy.

118
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,940
That's why I'm relieved.

119
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:21,730
I hope Eun can wash away the pain of her brother's death

120
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,730
and keep laughing like that.

121
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:30,070
However,

122
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:37,150
if you're immature and just toying with her,

123
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,470
you'll have to put your life on the line.

124
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,420
You just need to keep Eun smiling like that...

125
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,140
until she gets sick of it.

126
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:58,100

127
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:07,760
- What brings you here, Mom?
- Oh, I came to the shop and saw you two together.

128
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:12,420
Your boyfriend looks really neat.

129
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,980
It's embarrassing. Hurry up and go.

130
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,590
Okay.

132
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,130
Yes.

133
00:13:25,130 --> 00:13:27,820
- I'll go now.
- Bye.

stay at your uncle's place in the U.S.

136
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,830
- Why?
- The situation isn't good.

137
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,880
I'll wrap things up and contact you if you go to the U.S.

138
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,620
Just for a while.

139
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,670
What's the reason?

140
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,670
I just hope...

141
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,950
you do what I say.

142
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,850
You still should tell me what the reason is.

143
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,840
You don't need to know.

144
00:14:32,370 --> 00:14:34,850
Ho Yeong!

145
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:38,700
I'll contact you once the situation wraps up.

146
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:44,310
Just until Kim Sang Hyeok's trial ends and everything is forgotten.

147
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,260
So, what's the reason?

148
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:51,060
The man who came by a few days ago. That's Chairman Kim Gang Heon, right?

149
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,300
He's blackmailing you, right? For a not-guilty verdict for Kim Sang Hyeok.

150
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,990
Enough!

151
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:02,110
If you find Kim Sang Hyeok not guilty, I'll turn myself in.

152
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,820
No. If you don't promise me here,

153
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,830
I'll go to Chairman Kim Gang Heon myself!

154
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:11,630
And tell him I killed Kim Sang Hyeon.

155
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,560
Why would you?

156
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,980
Why would you care about the trial?

157
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,200
Because that bastard killed Mom!

158
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:31,250
That happened to Mom because of her depression.

159
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,880
Kim Sang Hyeok doesn't have allegations.

160
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,720
The investigation was dismissed due to lack of evidence.

161
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,170
Kim Sang Hyeok isn't guilty?

162
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,640
Why did Mom do that, then?

163
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,120
Because no one believed her.

164
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:49,860
Mom did that because no one would believe her!

165
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,560
You're one of the culprits who killed Mom.

166
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,400
By chance...

167
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,740
was it intentional...

168
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,580
You didn't, right?

169
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:18,300
There's no way you'd know that boy would be passing there at that time.

170
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,670
It's a coincidence, right?

171
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:28,440
Do you really think so?

172
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,930
What if I did it on purpose-

173
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,840
Ho Yeong...

174
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,720
I'm sorry-

175
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,470
N-No way. It can't be...

176
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:07,420

It can't be...

180
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,790
[Crime and Punishment]

181
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:28,970
For one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay.

182
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:33,240
One death and a hundred lives in exchange-

183
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,590
it's simple arithmetic!

184
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,730
Besides, what value has the life of that

185
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:46,880
sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!

186
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,370
No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle,

187
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,850
less in fact because

188
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,720
the old woman is doing harm.

189
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,220
She is wearing out the lives of others.

190
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,070
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

191
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,370
After the beep, there will be a charge.

192
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:12,010
Ho Yeong, did you go out last night or early in the morning?

193
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:15,370
I'm worried, so call or text me

194
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,360
once you hear this message.

195
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,020
It's been recorded.

196
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,300
I guess you couldn't sleep a wink, huh?

197
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:06,360
I mean,

198
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:11,780
there's no way you can sleep in the grasp of Chairman Kim Gang Heon.

199
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,760
There isn't much time until we arrive at the court.

200
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,690
Judge Song...

201
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,840
I almost died, thanks to you.

202
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,580
What are you going to do?

203
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:30,100
I don't know what I should do.

204
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:33,910
I can't think of anything.

205
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:38,140
Shit, we'll die anyway. What's the point of weighing things out?

206
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:41,730
Kim Gang Heon can't go all in.

207
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:47,210
He'll first secure the safety of his family and himself first.

208
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:50,300
Then, he takes revenge with the remaining strength.

209
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:54,750
This is a game where whoever has nothing to lose wins.

210
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,560
As you said, Judge...

211
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:03,110
sentence Kim Sang Hyeok guilty.

212
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,620
And after that?

213
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,670
Next is Ma Ji Yeong.

214
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:11,710
And Kim Gang Heon after that.

215
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:15,420
Tie them down legally as much as possible!

216
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:22,010
In the meantime, I'll bring down Woo One.

217
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,440
For the last 20 years, Woo One Future Construction

218
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,420
contributed greatly in dealing with social problems and crises.

219
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:37,650
Woo One Group took the initiative in restoring the foreigner residential area,

220
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:41,000
demolished during the large-scale gang onslaught of Jangbeom-dong.

221
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,550
This is where the underserved population built homes out of

222
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:49,690
abandoned buildings and containers, unable to secure residences inside Woowon City.

223
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:54,690
As you can see, this place was demolished because of a power struggle between rival gangs.

224
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,090
This morning,

225
00:20:56,090 --> 00:20:59,600
Woo One Future Construction decided to restore Pyeonghwa-ro, which was destroyed.

226
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,520
Woo One Future Construction,

227
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,980
according to our company policy based on social contribution,

228
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:08,560
will repair the damaged residential area near Pyeonghwa-ro.

229
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,800
Simultaneously, we began building new homes where restoration is impossible.

230
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,740
This community effort is a special order from Chairman Kim Gang Heon-

231
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:28,380
Are you the witness who witnessed the shooting incident that took place

232
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,640
at the third pier of Daeyeon Port on April 12th, 2024?

233
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,380
Yes.

234
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,340
Why were you there that day?

235
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:41,180
To meet my girlfriend.

236
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,340
Why did you go all the way there to meet your girlfriend?

237
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:51,680
Because my girlfriend's family sells marinated crabs at Daeyeon Port near the entrance.

238
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:55,120
We go there to smoke cigarettes without the adults knowing

239
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:01,140
and you can see a lot of stars there at night.

240
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:04,890
What did you see that day?

241
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:12,470
Well, a man wearing a dark suit

242
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,180
shot people to death with a gun.

243
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:22,330
Is that man the person sitting right there?

244
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,850
I couldn't really see his face because it was dark.

245
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:42,850
Then, is he the person who was in the video you saw earlier?

246
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:52,100
I couldn't really see...

247
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,650
because it was dark.

248
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,570
Your Honor,

249
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,100
just as we heard, he's a witness who was at the scene.

250
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,420
The witness' testimony is evidence that disapproves

251
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:15,520
my client, Kim Sang Hyeok, cannot be specified as the suspect.

252
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,050
The witness testified in person at Gangheung Police Station on April 15th

253
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,560
and told a detective at Gangam Police Station, Woowon City.

254
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:28,210
However, Detective Jang Chae Rim of Gangam Station left out the witness' testimony.

255
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,370
Why did she do that?

256
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:40,110
The police decided Kim Sang Hyeok as the suspect of the murders

257
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:45,040
and intentionally omitted evidence, interfering with making Kim Sang Hyeok the culprit.

258
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,320
The reason being...

259
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,670
Two years ago,

260
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:52,460
Kim Sang Hyeok's forced substance injection case that Detective Jang was investigating

261
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,300
was dismissed due to lack of allegation.

262
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:59,620
She seemed to harbor a personal grudge against Kim Sang Hyeok.

263
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:04,100
As such, this investigation came this far

264
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,050
because of a personal vendetta.

265
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,180
Where's the detective in charge right now?

266
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:25,440
She's currently missing.

267
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,620
What's going on?

268
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,710
We need to rush the Blue House issue.

269
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,280
When can I meet them?

270
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:48,850
Look, can't you see the state I'm in right now?

271
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:52,510
Whose fault is it that I ended up in this state?

272
00:24:52,510 --> 00:24:56,090
How can you say that to me here?

273
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:01,260
I mean, it's the only way for you and I to survive.

274
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:04,200
If it's difficult for you, give me a number I can contact.

275
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,900
I'll reach out myself.

276
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,400
If we do nothing, we'll all die.

277
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:25,040
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.

278
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,370
If Detective Jang Chae Rim was around,

279
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:32,890
I wouldn't have asked you like this.

280
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:34,930
I hope you'll understand.

281
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,780
Sure, Judge Song. I'll look into it.

282
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,270
Okay.

283
00:25:47,410 --> 00:25:50,290
Things keep piling up. Geez...

284
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:54,260
What's up? Is something wrong?

285
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,380
No, it's nothing.

286
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,280
I know.

287
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,990
Gosh, I know!

288
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:06,720
Do you think I don't know if you need a warrant for that?

289
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,990
But we've got to work together-

290
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,750
If you keep this up, I'll be so upset.

291
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,520
It's because of a request from someone special.

292
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,540
He's trying to find his son, so let's just do it for him.

293
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:21,200
You got it?

294
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,710
That punk, he always does this. Aigoo.

295
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,010
Yes, Chairman.

296
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:38,070
Judge Song asked Detective Lee for a strange favor just now.

297
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:03,280
[Park Chang Hyeok]

298
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,740
You're looking for your son, right?

299
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,780
Where is he?

300
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,840
Where is he? Tell me.

301
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,880
Your son might really die.

302
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,830
Why is your son with my daughter?

303
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:20,300
Oppa, you're really not going home?

304
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,560
I'm okay. You should go on home. Okay?

305
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,670
It's scary to be alone.

306
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:34,280
I don't want to go home because I'm worried about you.

307
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:57,810
No matter what, I'll make sure they never meet again.

308
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,540
How?

309
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,180
How are you going to stop them from meeting?

310
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:14,070
Oppa, can't you tell me what happened at home?

311
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,360
Did your dad scold you?

312
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,500
You said your dad isn't a scary person, though.

313
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,390
I'm sure my Eun is very fond of him.

314
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,390
She's been crying every day after her oppa died.

315
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,570
But she lightened up only recently.

316
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,820
I was glad to see that.

317
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,410
But that guy just had to be your son.

318
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,900
I heard dads scold their children because they're worried about them,

319
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,170
not because they hate them.

320
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:58,470
So, you should go home now.

321
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:08,420
I'll make sure the trial ends with a not-guilty verdict.

322
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:10,080
Please...

323
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:13,770
spare my child.

324
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,670
I beg you.

325
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,980
A human like you is also a father, after all.

326
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,640
I've stayed up all night at the library many times.

327
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,560
So, don't worry too much. Okay?

328
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,700
Dad.

329
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,740
How did you know I was here?

330
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:24,180
Ahjussi!

331
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,900
Ho Yeong said you're a very kind person.

332
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,330
So kind that you frustrate him.

333
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,370
Did Ho Yeong say that?

334
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:42,730
So, Ahjussi, can you please not scold Ho Yeong?

335
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:45,130
I won't scold him.

336
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:50,110
I've wronged Ho Yeong in so many ways. How can I get mad at him?

337
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm so glad.

338
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:59,120
Your name is Kim Eun, right?

339
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,590
Yes.

340
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:07,420
Someone from your dad's work came to pick you up over there.

341
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:10,190
You can go home in that car.

342
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,880
Okay.

343
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,720
See you tomorrow.

344
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,290
Ho Yeong!

345
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:44,160
The girl you met today is the late Kim Sang Hyeon's little sister

346
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,670
and Chairman Kim Gang Heon's daughter.

347
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,600
Yes, I know.

348
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,120
But how can you...

349
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,300
Are you seeing her on purpose?

350
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,410
You're not, right?

351
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,740
Yes, there's no way.

352
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,770
You've met her by coincidence, right?

353
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,690
I'm sorry.

354
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,550
I'll stop seeing her.

355
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,650
It can't be.

356
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,960
Please...

357
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,560
Please... It can't be...

358
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,580
You're late.

359
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:48,570
O-Oh, I was meeting a friend.

360
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,190
Are you scared of me, Eun?

361
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,560
No, I'm not scared.

362
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,310
Then, why won't you look at my face?

363
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:21,940
Because you're...

364
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,530
in pain right now, Dad.

365
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Because Oppa died, your heart is in so much pain.

366
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:38,110
But you're holding it in because Mom and I might be sad.

367
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:45,030
It was because I felt bad for you whenever I saw you.

368
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,950
I'm...

369
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,710
your dad.

370
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,330
Until you're...

371
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:20,040
no longer hurting about Sang Hyeon not being here,

372
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,890
I can...

373
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,470
endure it.

374
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:07,040
You sold a gun to Jo Bin on April 12th, right?

375
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,300
Yes.

376
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:12,950
The gun Jo Bin purchased was a TCX 300. A pistol, right?

377
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:15,010
Yes, that's right.

378
00:37:15,010 --> 00:37:20,870
The gun Jo Bin purchased, and the TCX 300 found at the scene are the same models.

379
00:37:20,870 --> 00:37:24,000
The person Jo Bin called most often at the time was

380
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,070
the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok, who's sitting there.

381
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:31,600
What happened to Jo Bin, who allowed the Prosecution to be certain

382
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,820
that the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok, is the culprit?

383
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,840
Please dim the lights.

384
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,910
For no reason at all...

385
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,090
Jo Bin, who made a lot of money by selling a gun

386
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:03,570
to the defendant and information, took his own life.

387
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,100
We investigated his surroundings, but he had no reason to commit suicide.

388
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:12,960
However, they all had a guess as to the reason he died.

389
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,260
"It's Woo One Group's destruction of evidence."

390
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:22,140
Of course, that's what we think as well.

391
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:26,490
Your Honor, this is speculation irrelevant to the trial.

392
00:38:26,490 --> 00:38:27,950
Sustained.

393
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:32,630
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong, please refrain from speculating.

394
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,730
Woo One Group is damaging the value of Korea's sacred justice using enormous capital,

395
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,720
politicians, and powerful connections within the legal field.

396
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,540
In the past, Kim Woo Won's gang built enormous wealth by

397
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:55,360
trampling on the politicians and the legal field through violence.

398
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,400
And now, Chairman Kim Gang Heon, his descendant,

399
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,970
is destroying the value of justice that has been protecting this country for a long time.

400
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,770
That statement is irrelevant to the trial!

401
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,980
Listen to the end!

402
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:08,130
Woo One Group...

403
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:11,020
No, more like Woo One Gang.

404
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,480
Since they're organized violent criminals.

405
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:20,270
There's evidence that they attempted to destroy evidence using organized violence.

406
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:29,040
Would you allow me to bring in that witness right now?

407
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,130
Yes.

408
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:37,060
While investigating Kim Sang Hyeok's murder case,

409
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,790
she was almost murdered after being kidnapped by an unknown man.

410
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,880
I request Detective Jang Chae Rim, the detective in charge,

411
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:47,110
as the witness.

412
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,530
Hello.

413
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:31,700
I'm the team leader of Special Crimes Team 1 of Gangam Station, Woowon City, on Kim's case.

414
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,660
I'm Detective Jang Chae Rim,

415
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,900
[Witness]

416
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,470
Is it true you were handed the video file of the scene in person,

417
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:13,950
the strongest evidence that's being mentioned in this court?

418
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,210
Yes, that's correct.

419
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:16,840
Who did you get it from?

420
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:20,340
From a boy named Lee Cheong Gang, who was at the scene.

421
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,390
Who is Lee Cheong Gang?

422
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:25,580
He's the son of Lee Sang Taek, who died at the scene.

423
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:29,080
Why was the boy Lee Cheong Gang at the scene?

424
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:34,260
Lee Sang Taek, the likely suspect in the hit-and-run accident where Kim Sang Hyeon died,

425
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,130
attempted to smuggle out to Cambodia through a broker.

426
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:41,560
He was going to take his son, Lee Cheong Gang, which is why he was at the scene.

427
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,320
Once shooting began,

428
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:46,820
Lee Cheong Gang said he escaped the scene and began filming.

429
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:53,170
Then, Lee Cheong Gang must've witnessed the scene precisely.

430
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,930
Yes, that's correct.

431
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,310
He'll be a very important witness for this court.

432
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:04,970
Where's Lee Cheong Gang right now?

433
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:10,640
Recently, witnesses and evidence of Kim Sang Hyeok's shooting incident

434
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:13,300
have been getting damaged by someone.

435
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,860
Jo Bin's recent death, which was ruled suicide, is one of them.

436
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:22,620
Therefore, I'm protecting the witness at a safe place as a police officer,

437
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:25,340
for he'll be an important witness for this trial.

438
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:33,150
Can the witness stand before the court to testify?

439
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,000
Yes, of course.

440
00:42:39,030 --> 00:42:40,490
What's this?

441
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:42,350
What's going to happen...

442
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,150
I request Lee Cheong Gang, the witness who was at the scene,

443
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,370
to testify before court.

444
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,400
Of course,

445
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,990
after the witness' safety has been secured.

446
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,750
Yes.

447
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,840
Objection sustained.

448
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:41,090
[Kim Gang Heon]

449
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,800
Yes.

450
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:48,080
What do you plan to do?

451
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,340
I'm not sure yet.

452
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:52,970
You're not sure?

453
00:43:52,970 --> 00:43:55,170
Please give me some time.

454
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,590
I'll find a way.

455
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:14,450
As reported, proceeding with the trial will be difficult.

456
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:18,560
We'll prepare a response strategy as soon as possible.

457
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:41,580
The boy, Lee Cheong Gang...

458
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:44,000
He was with Jang Chae Rim.

459
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,680
I'll look into it right away.

460
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:57,990
[Woowon District Prosecutors' Office]

461
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:06,350
You should go home and sleep, Prosecutor Kang.

462
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:10,430
You almost died. I'm worried about you.

463
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,820
Don't worry about it. I'm comfortable like this.

464
00:45:27,530 --> 00:45:29,860
What do you think will happen to us?

465
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:32,880
What will happen to us?

466
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:38,500
We'll arrest Kim Gang Heon and achieve justice.

467
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:46,740
Prosecutor Kang, why are you so obsessed with Kim Gang Heon?

468
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:48,360
Obsessed?

469
00:45:51,030 --> 00:45:53,380
Was I being too clingy?

470
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:00,730
Then what about you? Why are you so obsessed with Kim Chang Hyeok?

471
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:05,880
Two years ago...

472
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:11,220
Jo Eun Hye committed suicide.

473
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:16,320
People think it was due to Kim Sang Hyeon's forced drug abuse,

474
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,840
but it was actually due to sexual assault.

475
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:24,630
I saw Kim Sang Hyeok's face when his charges were dropped.

476
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:28,110
He seemed at peace...

477
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:31,650
like a child who just got baptized.

478
00:46:31,650 --> 00:46:35,160
And I felt devastated as I looked at his face.

479
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,230
"There's...

480
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:43,010
nothing I can do about this.

481
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:47,030
This is the type of life I lead."

482
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,190
Nothing has ever made me feel powerless.

483
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:54,840
But that f***er destroyed me

484
00:46:55,910 --> 00:47:00,410
without breaking a sweat or betting an eye.

485
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:04,880
Working hard to live this life with conviction

486
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,390
became meaningless to me.

487
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,590
If I lose to that bastard again this time...

488
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:18,560
Gosh, I lived so diligently.

489
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,760
I think I'll have to deny the entirety of my life.

490
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:28,660
Because I think I'll have to show

491
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,240
the world and myself that it's not the case.

492
00:47:38,910 --> 00:47:40,510
I like it.

493
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:44,900
Because it's not something like the lame old justice.

494
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:01,200
The call is not going through-

495
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:07,350
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail-

496
00:48:16,650 --> 00:48:18,780
The call is not going through-

497
00:48:23,050 --> 00:48:26,040
[Kim Eun]

498
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,400
[Kim Eun]

499
00:48:59,830 --> 00:49:05,340
Regarding what happened to me after meeting you that day...

500
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:09,730
Aren't you curious why I hid the whole time,

501
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,810
not answering anyone's call?

502
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,590
Or could it be that...

503
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:19,810
you already knew?

504
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,320
Oppa...

505
00:50:14,630 --> 00:50:16,890
What's going on?

506
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,550
I-I kept calling you. But you kept not answering.

507
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:26,300
So I worried a lot.

508
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,070
We're in a library.

509
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:34,200
Can you please tell me... w-what on earth is going on and

510
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:36,650
w-why you didn't answer my calls?

511
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,930
You're disturbing other people's studies. Leave.

512
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:43,070
I...

513
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:47,600
missed you and was worried about you, so I couldn't sleep at all.

514
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:52,710
W-Why... Why are you doing this? Why?

515
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:58,000
Oppa- Oppa!

516
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,790
Oppa! Oppa! Oppa-

517
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,670
I'm sorry, Oppa.

518
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,220
Can you please tell me?

519
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,340
If there's anything I did wrong, I'll fix-

520
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,900
Your dad's a scary man.

521
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:14,700
I'm sure he blackmailed my dad.

522
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,290
If he finds out you and I are dating,

523
00:51:17,290 --> 00:51:19,500
my dad might get killed.

524
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:22,630
So, leave.

525
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:07,340
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

526
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:09,350
- She passed out.
- Hey.

527
00:52:09,350 --> 00:52:11,330
- Are you okay?
- Open your eyes!

528
00:52:11,330 --> 00:52:13,420
What do we do?

529
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,510
Hey, Ho Yeong. Did you have dinner?

530
00:52:38,510 --> 00:52:40,830
When are you leaving the library?

531
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,570
Give me a text when you leave.

532
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:46,570
Wait, should I go pick you up?

533
00:52:47,410 --> 00:52:49,430
Okay.

534
00:52:49,430 --> 00:52:53,710
I'll get worried if you come too late, so give me a call.

535
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,760
I'd rather meet secretly.

536
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,370
There are too many people here.

537
00:53:15,370 --> 00:53:18,300
Secret places are more dangerous for me.

538
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,960
Did something happen back then?

539
00:53:42,250 --> 00:53:44,350
You're here, Chairman!

540
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:49,940
She'll get supplements injected and

541
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:52,340
get some rest for a few days.

542
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:56,200
But if she happens to have symptoms of depression,

543
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,600
it might affect her adversely.

544
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:02,080
I understand.

545
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,650
I had someone unlock it.

546
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:31,520
[Ho Yeong]

547
00:54:32,620 --> 00:54:35,850
I had clearly warned that punk...

548
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:41,360
that if he hurts Eun, I'll have him killed.

549
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:06,480
Of course, I don't think you were involved in that matter, Judge Song.

550
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,920
Because you wouldn't overlook murder.

551
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:14,850
It must be Woo One's doing, right?

552
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,320
But I wanted to see you today about something else.

553
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,330
The hit-and-run suspect of Kim Sang Hyeon's death.

554
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,610
I had thought Lee Sang Taek was the culprit until then.

555
00:55:27,610 --> 00:55:30,130
But a different circumstance was found.

556
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:35,750
That Lee Sang Taek was elsewhere when Kim Sang Hyeon died.

557
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,080
What do you mean?

558
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:43,350
It means Lee Sang Taek might not be the culprit.

559
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,050
Then...

560
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,210
who are you saying is the other suspect?

561
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:54,320
I thought you'd know, Judge Song.

562
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:03,130
Why aren't you answering?

563
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:08,630
Why would you suddenly break off contact like this?

564
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:13,010
I-If there's something I did wrong, please tell me.

565
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:15,060
I'll fix it. Okay?

566
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:25,410
O-Oppa, nothing's wrong, right?

567
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:30,220
Why are you suddenly doing this?

568
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:33,230
I'm too worried, Oppa.

569
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:38,280
Please... Please get back to me. Please...

570
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:46,210
He said there are a total of 126 voice messages.

571
00:56:47,810 --> 00:56:53,380
To 126 voice messages, did he answer?

572
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:57,720
He didn't reply to any of them.

573
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:15,570
I was most worried about Eun after Sang Hyeon died.

574
00:57:17,470 --> 00:57:20,910
She's still too young and fragile.

575
00:57:20,910 --> 00:57:23,500
How could she endure the pain?

576
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:28,400
I was relieved that she seemed to be enduring it little by little.

577
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,240
But what's this?

578
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:35,310
Bring that bastard.

579
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:45,050
When you reported your car stolen,

580
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:49,450
I wasn't suspicious as to why you did it after two days had passed.

581
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:54,100
Because you'd turn yourself in, even if there was a car accident.

582
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:59,170
And you were in a trial at that time.

583
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:06,740
If it isn't Lee Sang Taek or you, Judge Song...

584
00:58:07,570 --> 00:58:10,840
the suspect narrows down to just one person.

585
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,450
I'll have to redo the investigation.

586
00:58:21,550 --> 00:58:23,610
But not now.

587
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:27,020
I have to get Kim Sang Hyeok right now.

588
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,670
And, after him,

589
00:58:30,430 --> 00:58:32,610
I'll get Kim Gang Heon.

590
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,170
Ho Yeong, where are you?

591
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,760
Stay there.

592
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,860
I'll go pick you up.

593
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,880
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to...

594
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,940
[Dad]

595
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,640
I don't smoke.

596
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:22,380
Did you say you attend Hanguk University?

597
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:23,750
Yes.

598
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,350
Eun is in a lot of pain right now.

599
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:37,830
'm sure it's not my fault that Eun is in pain, is it?

600
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,420
Let me ask you for a favor.

601
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,150
I'd like you to be by Eun's side until she gets better.

602
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:12,530
But my dad told me not to see her.

603
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:17,410
Aren't you the one who told him to tell me that, Ahjussi?

604
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,450
Something that you can't refuse...

605
01:01:22,450 --> 01:01:25,330
isn't a favor, but a threat.

606
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:31,630
If I refuse, my father and I won't be safe.

607
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,450
You're...

608
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,420
that kind of a person, Ahjussi.

609
01:02:45,770 --> 01:02:50,600
[Your Honor]

610
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:52,950
♫ Thank God it feels like home ♫

611
01:02:52,950 --> 01:02:57,200
♫ A wicked is born in the dark ♫

612
01:02:57,200 --> 01:02:59,630
♫ I never get it like that, mate ♫

613
01:02:59,630 --> 01:03:04,100
♫ Why not me? You always get it all ♫

614
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,370
♫ It's not fair anymore ♫

615
01:03:06,370 --> 01:03:11,750
♫ What's on your mind? Where is the truth? ♫

616
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:19,210
♫ Whenever it feels like never ♫

617
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:20,690
Are you feeling unwell?

618
01:03:20,690 --> 01:03:22,120
You're not the culprit.

619
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:24,400
Not my son. Please.

620
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,380
If you give a not guilty verdict...

621
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:29,460
I'll have to let the world know the incident I tracked down.

622
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,870
I'll enter the Blue House as soon as the trial ends.

623
01:03:32,870 --> 01:03:35,490
Why are you suddenly doing this?

624
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:36,890
Because I'm confident.

625
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:39,700
Is there any other way besides that?

626
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:43,030
It's not a difficult or complicated problem.

627
01:03:43,030 --> 01:03:47,370
It's simple. I just need to save Ho Yeong.
