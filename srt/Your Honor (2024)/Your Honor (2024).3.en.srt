It really doesn't make sense

18
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:51,400
The president is not in the mood to deal with this kind of thing right now.

19
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,133
Stay quiet at this time

20
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,700
Silently showing the power of support is Yuyuan’s style

21
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,300
So what do you mean

22
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,833
Are you going to war with those guys?

23
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:02,500
Woowon is no longer a violent organization

24
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,067
So you want us to just endure it?

25
00:04:06,067 --> 00:04:07,200
Aren't you angry?

26
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,333
Vice President, please speak too.

27
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,200
How could the vice-president be in that mood now?

28
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,500
You understand the situation

29
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,667

30
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:18,533
-how
-Are you a gangster?

We still haven’t grasped the whole situation.

36
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,900
I was scrambling to come forward to help.

37
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,600
It's just causing trouble for the people handling the matter.

00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,200

00:06:31,333 --> 00:06:34,200
Excuse me. We are from the Yuyuan Police Department.

42
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:37,800
What is the condition of the victim?

43
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,433
Help organize the scene first
Contact me immediately after the forensic examination is completed

44
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:52,100

Where are my grandma and Qinghe?

47
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:01,233
Oh, go ask the police.

48
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,967
-Really what should I do?
-Excuse me

49
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,500
Are you a family member of the victim?

50
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,100
Yes... may I ask how they are doing?

51
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,533
OK I got it

52
00:08:24,133 --> 00:08:26,967
I heard there was a fire at Lee Sang-taek's house

53
00:08:27,367 --> 00:08:30,833
His elderly mother and young daughter
All died from this

54
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:16,933
I've heard all about the angry outbursts.

55
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,767
It's Kim Kang-hyun's fault

56
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,967
As the saying goes, a father who loses his child
Will go through fire and water

57
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:30,700
But this is too much. How could you do such a thing?

58
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:35,600
Today's gas explosion case should be in the news

59
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,500
No, even if it’s not on the news

60
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,467
Li Xiangze will also know sooner or later

61
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:44,133
Lost his elderly mother and young daughter

62
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:46,200
He won't give up, right?

63
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:51,300
And he was unjustly accused.
Became the murderer of a fatal hit-and-run case.

64
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:58,100

00:10:21,667 --> 00:10:22,833
yes ma'am

68
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,033
I did everything as you told me.

69
00:10:25,033 --> 00:10:26,700
I see

70
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,067
Please don't worry I will contact you again

71
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,700
You have to do bad things without being aware of it.

72
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:49,167
But I found out

73
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,633
I heard you know a few
A lackey of the Futo Gang who specializes in dealing with troubles

74
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,500
-What does this mean...
-Brat

75
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,733
I came to you after knowing everything

76
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:10,867
Introduce me to the most obedient person

77
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:17,733
Then I will keep my mouth shut

78
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,700
Pretend I don’t know what you did

79
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:45,633
Damn it

80
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:51,633
How do you know I'm here

81
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,667
Really

82
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:06,567
What's the matter

83
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:12,767
The president wants you to come over

84
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,300
What if I say not to go?

85
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,633
I said

86
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:34,633
The president wants you to come over

87
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:54,400
No one knows where Lee Sang-taek is now

88
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,133
He's a very reckless guy

89
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,800
If he knew his house was in flames
It’s hard to guarantee whether he will do anything

90
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:08,467
Come on, let's sort it out.

91
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,367
Lee Sang-taek is at 5 a.m. on April 9

92
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,133
Drive away the car from the door of Judge Song Panhao's house

93
00:13:16,133 --> 00:13:19,833
Kim Sang-hyun, the second son of Woowon Group, was hit and killed by a hit-and-run car

94
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:22,733
It was around 7:30 in the morning on April 8th

95
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:28,400
Now Lee Sang-taek is wanted by the police
Became the hit-and-run criminal who killed Kim Sang-hyun.

96
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,267
The person who hit and killed the man was Song Panhao

97
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,967
So you should have kept your car low-key and abandoned it in the first place.

98
00:13:48,933 --> 00:13:51,533
Do you think you should take the car to be abandoned?

99
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:53,933
Will it not be discovered?

100
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,600
Say it

101
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,300
so what are you going to do

102
00:14:02,267 --> 00:14:05,300
Whether we know it or not

103
00:14:06,533 --> 00:14:10,467
If Chairman Kim Kang-heon learns
We tampered with this matter

104
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:12,800
Not just a few of us

105
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400
Even gang members are destined to die.

106
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:19,933
Should we go find Chairman Kim Kang-heon now?

107
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:23,000
Confess to him what happened

108
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Will we have a way to survive?

109
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It’s come to this point

110
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,033
What matters is not who is at fault

111
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:33,700
But how to deal with this problem

112
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,633
The more dangerous things

113
00:14:40,633 --> 00:14:44,067
It will cost more to process

114
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:50,400
Wait until the next year for Song Panhao to become a figure

115
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:54,767
Not becoming a justice of the Constitutional Tribunal
That's the President of the High Court

116
00:14:54,767 --> 00:14:57,100
Or the Minister of Justice

117
00:14:58,967 --> 00:15:01,800
except this matter

118
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,433
He is a man with no flaws at all

119
00:15:05,433 --> 00:15:08,833
The Fu Dou Gang who are always wiping Yu Won’s butt

120
00:15:10,067 --> 00:15:12,400
If we grasp Song Panhao's weakness,

121
00:15:13,533 --> 00:15:15,033
How much can you do?

122
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:25,400
are you sure

123
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,700
Nothing in the world can be 100% certain

124
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,867
Just place all your bets on the side with the highest probability

125
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,800
You brat

126
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:42,200
Just a gangster.

127
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,733
How dare you be disrespectful to members of Congress?

128
00:15:48,933 --> 00:15:50,367
sorry

129
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:56,133

Asking about his father's whereabouts

135
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:02,067
We need to confirm the identity of the victim before we can start the search, right?

136
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:05,833
Yes, we need to confirm the identity of the deceased before we can start.

137
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:08,533

-Is this level certain?
-yes

141

Whether it is from items that have been burned by fire
Or the traces are very obvious

142
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:09,267
Even if you look at the resident registration, it can’t be someone else.

143
00:18:09,267 --> 00:18:10,367
That's right

144
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,867

I will give him the punishment he deserves

It's not your turn to intervene in this matter

152
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:39,200
What are you thinking about and how are you feeling?

153
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,400

Is your father also scary?

191
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,433
No way

192
00:23:24,433 --> 00:23:26,733
He is very kind

193
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,367
So good that it's unbearable

194
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,733
That's it

195
00:23:36,033 --> 00:23:38,233
Brother Haoying, are you busy now?

196
00:23:38,233 --> 00:23:39,633
No. What's wrong?

197
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:41,467
I want to see you now

198
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,300
Really?

199
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:53,067
Do you want to meet now?

200
00:23:53,067 --> 00:23:55,433
Wouldn't your parents scold you for going out so late?

201
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,900
No, it doesn't matter

202
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:02,600
My parents are very busy and almost don’t care about me.

203
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,000
Really?

204
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,500
Where is the money?

205
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,167
Do you have to open here?

206
00:24:49,533 --> 00:24:51,433
Just do it in moderation, but be careful as it may cause your bones to rot.

207
00:25:03,267 --> 00:25:04,533
Hello

208
00:25:08,233 --> 00:25:09,500
Who?

209
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,400
I heard that you occasionally help Yuyuan with things

210
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,300
Woowon?

211
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:40,867
You are the eldest young master

212
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,533
-What's the matter here?
-I must catch Lee Sang-taek

213
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,833
do you know where he is

214
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,167
I have no idea

215
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,267
I don't mean now

216
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:26,933
"Hello emergency hotline, what services do you need?"

217
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,433
(Audio file of report from Yuyuan Fire Department)

218
00:26:31,867 --> 00:26:33,767
"Sir, are you okay?"

219
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,000
(General health examination results: Lee Sang-taek is normal)

220
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,500
"Are you feeling unwell?"

221
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,400
"Sir, do you have difficulty speaking at the moment?"

222
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,233
Lee Sang-taek is not a prisoner

223
00:26:49,233 --> 00:26:52,500
This is the wheezing sound of an asthma patient

224
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:55,833
Lee Sang-taek is not an asthma patient

225
00:26:58,733 --> 00:27:01,500
The last sound heard in the recording file

226
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,400
It's a tire blowout warning sound.

227
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,533
It must be an old model

228
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:09,067
I went to the car repair center near the accident scene to check.

229
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:33,933
it's beautiful

230
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,933
no

231
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:46,333
Why

232
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:50,600
This is wine, don't drink it

233
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,033
You drink this

234
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,833
The two of them match each other very well

235
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:02,233
Thank you

236
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:04,500
no…

237
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,000
Look at this

238
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:10,533
it's beautiful

239
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,400
Everyone, the business is closed.

240
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,867
Come again tomorrow

241
00:28:31,967 --> 00:28:33,700
what do you want to do

242
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,433
what are you doing

243
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:11,000
April 8, the day of the car accident

244
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,400
Monitor recording from 7am to 8am disappeared

245
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:18,900
He said that on the morning of April 9
Someone came and asked to see the monitor screen

246
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,333
After that person came, the record was deleted.

247
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,533
Alas...

248
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:53,033
who is this person

249
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:56,133
I really don't know

250
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,367
Looks very stable

251
00:30:00,367 --> 00:30:02,467
Said he was dating a young girl

252
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,633
Young girl?

253
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:07,867
Yes, looks over 50 years old

254
00:30:07,867 --> 00:30:11,233
My girlfriend is only in her 20s and she is crying while watching the scene alone

255
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,700
It doesn't matter if you don't give me money

256
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,933
I will contact you immediately if I think of anything

257
00:30:35,933 --> 00:30:37,467
Please give me a business card

258
00:30:40,833 --> 00:30:42,733
Since you want to give, of course you have to accept it.

259
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:44,400
Thank you

260
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:51,033
don't let anyone know

261
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,600
I won't let anyone know

262
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,600
(Cheque)

263
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,600
You said that car was a stolen car, right?

264
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,700
right

265
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,033
Who is the owner of the car?

266
00:31:15,167 --> 00:31:16,567
I'm going to investigate

267
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:21,667
I've been looking at the surface of the problem

268
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:24,333
But the answer usually lies at the core

269
00:31:25,767 --> 00:31:27,433
So stupid

270
00:31:40,433 --> 00:31:43,300
You lunatic, where are you from and how dare you come to your door?

271
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,333
What do you think

272
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:49,433
Grandma and Qinghe were both burned like charcoal

273
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:54,067
The thought of such a young child enduring such hot fire
I'm really going crazy

274
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:59,500
How can I survive with this anger and resentment?

275
00:32:01,167 --> 00:32:05,533
Although I don’t know who did it
But I must take revenge

276
00:32:05,533 --> 00:32:07,033
you crazy

277
00:32:07,867 --> 00:32:09,567
i want to kill them

278
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:16,233
Our family Qinghe... what is the crime...

279
00:32:16,233 --> 00:32:18,133
Shut up you kid

280
00:32:18,133 --> 00:32:20,433
Give the phone to some adult over there.

281
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:21,800
Listen to someone else

282
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,233
you say

283
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,367
represent

284
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,367
I'm so unjust. I can't just let this matter go.

285
00:32:33,367 --> 00:32:35,267
what do you want

286
00:32:35,267 --> 00:32:36,967
I have the advantage now, don't I?

287
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,933
Even if it’s Fu Dou’s Cho Mi Yeon

288
00:32:39,933 --> 00:32:41,767
I know things that no one knows

289
00:32:42,867 --> 00:32:45,167
I also know who wants to know the truth

290
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,233
Do you want to trade with me now?

291
00:32:51,267 --> 00:32:53,067
Because I have lost too much

292
00:32:53,867 --> 00:32:57,367
only mother only daughter

293
00:32:58,633 --> 00:33:01,133
What should your son do?

294
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:02,800
Whatever you want

295
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,967
But if something happens to that kid

296
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:08,100
I will immediately go find Chairman Kim Kang-hyun

297
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:11,267
I'll call you again. It's best not to act rashly.

304
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,900
I don't know this yet

305
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,933
If anything happens, I will contact you again

306
00:33:56,333 --> 00:33:58,300
There's one more thing I want to ask of you

307
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,633
What's going on

308
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,533
gun

309
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,133
Gun?

310
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,900
Leave this little thing to me and wait for my news.

311
00:36:25,733 --> 00:36:27,267
May I ask who it is?

312
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,167
I'm Lee Sang-taek

313
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:37,233
I'm not a sick cat who can be bullied by others

314
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:40,433
I'm not here to yell.

315
00:36:40,433 --> 00:36:43,233
I'm here to give you some good advice. Open the door.

316
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,167
Your home is so beautiful

317
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:22,333
Not too luxurious but clean and neat

318
00:37:23,867 --> 00:37:26,133
As expected of a highly respected judge

319
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,500
Even the home decoration is extraordinary

320
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:15,233
I heard you are famous

321
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,367
Such a big man can't do such a thing

322
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:42,733
You killed my only mother

323
00:38:42,733 --> 00:38:45,500
And my daughter whom I cherish so much

324
00:38:53,633 --> 00:38:55,067
This is my account

325
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,400
Let's do it. You're the judge.

326
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:03,600
A person who assigns blame for others

327
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:08,000
Convert your guilt into money and transfer it to my account

328
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:11,833
If you make an excellent decision

329
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,833
I will take my son to Cambodia

330
00:39:14,833 --> 00:39:16,700

331
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,933
If you didn't pay the corresponding price

332
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,400
I will go directly to Chairman Kim Kang-heon

333
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,400
Please…

334
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:37,967
this…

338
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:48,400
This case is bizarre

339
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,033
Please come and take a look inside

340
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,400
Look at the ceiling

341
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:56,000
This is where the fire first started

342
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,533
The flame starts from the incandescent light socket and spreads around

343
00:40:59,533 --> 00:41:01,167
At the same time

344
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,133
Look here

345
00:41:02,967 --> 00:41:05,900
The gas pipe cracked

346
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,367
It didn't break apart because of the explosion.

347
00:41:07,367 --> 00:41:09,167
It was cut with a sharp knife

348
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:12,767
This is deliberate arson

349
00:41:12,767 --> 00:41:15,700
You see, gas is leaking from the gas pipe here.

350
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,200
filled the whole house

351
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,933
When the homeowner comes back, he flips the light switch

352
00:41:21,933 --> 00:41:27,200
The connected incandescent lamp exploded and caused a gas explosion at the same time

353
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,933
How to make an incandescent light explode

354
00:41:31,933 --> 00:41:33,300
in this way

355
00:41:35,133 --> 00:41:41,533
Use a needle to inject diluent or gasoline here

356
00:41:41,533 --> 00:41:44,667
After injecting gasoline, put it back on the socket

357
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:46,500
Just press the switch

358
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:49,567
It will "bang"

360
00:41:57,533 --> 00:42:00,100
This is the actual owner of the Honors vehicle that caused the accident

00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:09,167
Found special matters and would like to report to you in person

364
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,133
What special matter is it?

365
00:42:19,133 --> 00:42:20,533
Please look at the second page

366
00:42:20,533 --> 00:42:22,933
In the kinship column, her daughter is Zhao Enhui

367
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:25,900
(Zhao Enhui died)
Died two years ago

368
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,033
Zhao Enhui?

369
00:42:28,033 --> 00:42:32,000
Her husband is Judge Song Panhao

370
00:42:33,533 --> 00:42:35,467
Judge Song Panhao?

371
00:42:40,367 --> 00:42:41,067
(Yuyuan Group)

372
00:42:48,867 --> 00:42:53,733
President, Detective Zhang Chailin from Gangam Police Station came to visit

373
00:42:54,467 --> 00:42:56,100
Gangam police station?

374
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,800
let her in

375
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,167
Hello, I am Zhang Cailin from the Crime Division of Gangyan Police Station.

376
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,767
nice to meet you

377
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,100
What's the matter?

378
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,900
I have something to ask about the fire at Jiangfan Cave last night.

379
00:43:20,833 --> 00:43:24,267
It seems that this matter needs to be discussed with the president alone.

380
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,600
Do you want to continue talking?

381
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,000
Just keep talking

382
00:43:33,667 --> 00:43:35,200
According to the results of on-site investigation

383
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,067
Determined to be a deliberate blasting accident

384
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:40,067
Do you know anything?

385
00:43:41,233 --> 00:43:43,600
how could i know

386
00:43:45,067 --> 00:43:47,933
Because the two victims

387
00:43:47,933 --> 00:43:52,400
They happened to be the family members of the hit-and-run suspect who killed the son.

388
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,267
It is inevitable that relevant investigations will be conducted on you

389
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:57,333
OK now?

390
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:01,567
No, not now, after we investigate clearly

391
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:02,967
if necessary

392
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,967
We will contact you again

393
00:44:12,667 --> 00:44:14,733
Have you caught Lee Sang-taek?

394
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,733
Currently still tracking

395
00:44:22,733 --> 00:44:24,400
Lee Sang-taek…

396
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,333
Is he the murderer who killed my son and then escaped?

397
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:30,133
very likely

398
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:33,867
are you sure

399
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,500
Senior, have you grasped Li Qingjiang's current position?

400
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,267
No, I'm still looking

401
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:58,533
He seemed to have entered the foreign residential area last night.

402
00:44:58,533 --> 00:45:00,800
Okay, I understand. Then I'll go look for it.

403
00:45:02,233 --> 00:45:04,800
Why are you so persistent in finding Li Qingjiang?

404
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,267
Last night's accident was caused by Yu Yuan

405
00:45:07,267 --> 00:45:09,000
Qingjiang will be in danger

406
00:45:16,633 --> 00:45:18,300
(Li Qingjiang)

407
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:44,500
are you sleeping

408
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:50,433
Did you get a call?

409
00:45:50,433 --> 00:45:52,533
No, didn't receive a call

410
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,333
I’ll send you and Lee Sang Taek off tonight

411
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:03,500
Smuggling to Cambodia

412
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:07,867
Then who will avenge our Qinghe?

413
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:11,300
Revenge?

414
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:13,900
How can someone like you avenge her?

415
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:16,400
You'd better eat well and wait for your dad to contact you.

416
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,367
(Missed call Detective Zhang Cailin)

417
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,767
It seems like I will meet with Lee Sang Taek tonight

418
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:51,767
yes

419
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,133
Now there are only two people in the hotel, Zheng Hailong and Li Qingjiang.

420
00:46:55,133 --> 00:46:56,900
Yes I will contact you again

421
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,333
Damn...

422
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,967
Why don't you come to me early in the morning?

423
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,833
Today…Friday

424
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,600
No court days

425
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,233
I want to give this to Lee Sang-taek

426
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:02,767
How much is it here

427
00:48:02,767 --> 00:48:04,200
500 million

428
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,900
Help me get this money...

429
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,633
Go to this account

430
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:16,333
(ABK Bank Lee Sang-taek)
Lee Sang-taek's personal account written to me

431
00:48:16,333 --> 00:48:21,267
I know the Futo gang you know will take care of this.

432
00:48:21,267 --> 00:48:22,633
Please

433
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,467
It is difficult for a person to make a mistake even once in this world.

434
00:48:29,467 --> 00:48:31,600
I actually committed it twice

435
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:35,533
It's like being the worst bad person

436
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:40,300
If this money could alleviate my guilt a little

437
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:42,767
I should feel a little more relaxed

438
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,833
Please

439
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,267
I haven't clearly remembered...

440
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:09,200
President, please give me a little more time.

441
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,433
I will definitely follow the Liuhe method

442
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:13,200
Explain to you carefully…

443
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,567
Is it this person?

444
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,133
Yes, that's right

445
00:49:22,133 --> 00:49:23,533
Not a judge...

446
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:26,667
Why would a judge talk to a young sister?

447
00:49:27,267 --> 00:49:28,700
are you sure

448
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,867
Yes I'm pretty sure

449
00:49:29,867 --> 00:49:32,267
He said he was dating a younger sister

450
00:49:32,267 --> 00:49:35,533
Because to be honest I'm a little envious...

451
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,033
I'm sure it's this guy

452
00:49:45,033 --> 00:49:49,367
Some people say that the left headlight of the vehicle involved in the accident was replaced.

453
00:49:49,367 --> 00:49:53,267
I think it comes from the scrap car recycling plant
Find similar parts to replace

454
00:49:54,167 --> 00:49:57,833
What if Song Banhao deleted the monitor records?

455
00:49:57,833 --> 00:50:02,267
I think it's probably from
A scrap car recycling plant near Song Banhao’s home

456
00:50:02,267 --> 00:50:04,733
OK I'll confirm

457
00:50:09,033 --> 00:50:10,600
(ABK Bank)

458
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,700
Have you received the money?

459
00:50:15,233 --> 00:50:17,567
I just confirmed and received the money

460
00:50:18,467 --> 00:50:20,733
But how can I trust you?

461
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:24,300
Could you have escaped without our help?

462
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,200
Smuggling a person out to sea is not an easy matter.

463
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,100
cost a lot of money

464
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:34,067
We said we were going to help you, why are you still talking nonsense?

465
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,467
How you can survive now

466
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:41,600
Just trust others

467
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,500
Don't underestimate me

468
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,833
I have never experienced any big storms or waves under your command.

469
00:50:47,733 --> 00:50:49,433
11 o'clock tonight

470
00:50:50,033 --> 00:50:52,100
Come to Dalian Port Pier 3

471
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:53,433
don't be late

472
00:51:06,033 --> 00:51:08,033
We made an appointment…

473
00:51:08,033 --> 00:51:10,367
Meet him at Dalian Port at 11 o'clock tonight and let him sneak out to sea.

474
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,600
Where is the money?

475
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,567
Has the money been delivered?

476
00:51:13,567 --> 00:51:15,033
Didn't any of you eat it?

477
00:51:15,033 --> 00:51:18,300
The guy wouldn't have shown up until the money was sent.

478
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,500
Okay, thank you for your hard work.

479
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,800
But…

480
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:25,867
I spent a lot of money

481
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:28,267
I haven't signed any guarantee contract.

482
00:51:28,267 --> 00:51:30,567
But you keep spending my money, which makes me very uneasy.

483
00:51:30,567 --> 00:51:32,400
Just wait patiently

484
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,533
Maybe I’ll work hard this time

485
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:39,000
There will be unexpected gifts of thanks in return in the future

486
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:44,200
But do we really want him to go to sea?

487
00:51:55,033 --> 00:51:58,533
Brother, here I come

488
00:51:59,833 --> 00:52:01,633
how are you doing

489
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:29,867
(Judge Song Fanhao)

490
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,733
I can't remember clearly

491
00:53:56,733 --> 00:54:01,567
Is that day the 8th or the 9th?

492
00:54:01,567 --> 00:54:04,700
Judge Song Panhao came to see me

493
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,433
He said he wanted to confirm the evidence

494
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:10,533
Put the original over there

495
00:54:10,533 --> 00:54:15,733
The headlight covers of the old Honors were removed

496
00:54:15,733 --> 00:54:19,800
I don't know what he did with it

497
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:27,367
Old Honors

498
00:54:57,833 --> 00:55:00,100
He was right when he said it was Judge Song Panhao

499
00:55:07,833 --> 00:55:08,900
(Judge Song Fanhao, as a citizen and citizen of Yuyuan
I want to thank you)

500
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,367
(I cried when I saw the report)
Judge Song Panhao’s warm feelings…)

501
00:55:10,367 --> 00:55:12,833
(Judge Song Panhao, I respect you very much
@model生kimJH)

502
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:43,067
Do you know what kind of person your dad is?

503
00:55:45,267 --> 00:55:46,633
have no idea

504
00:55:50,167 --> 00:55:53,867
Your dad is a bad guy

505
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:58,367
There really are only four people coming.

506
00:56:04,233 --> 00:56:05,600
where are you

507
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:09,333
I only believe you for the last time

508
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:18,367
Forget it, you brat

509
00:56:18,367 --> 00:56:20,267
Whatever you want

510
00:56:20,267 --> 00:56:23,033
How much money did I spend to save you?

511
00:56:23,033 --> 00:56:24,633
whatever you want

512
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:27,500
Brainless guy

513
00:56:53,333 --> 00:56:54,900
Qingjiang

514
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:56,700
come to me

515
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,167
Go over there

516
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,900
You brat, what are you doing over there?

517
00:57:08,567 --> 00:57:11,633
Do you know how badly I was hurt by you?

518
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:16,900
Where is the boat?

519
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:20,900
Ship?

520
00:57:20,900 --> 00:57:24,167
If you want to take a boat, come here

521
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,000
I'll take you there hand in hand

522
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,167
Have you ever killed anyone?

523
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:44,267
No

524
00:57:44,267 --> 00:57:45,900
Who said you can only do it after doing it?

525
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:48,167
If you are forced by the situation, you will do it naturally.

526
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:53,167
Take this and run away from here as fast as you can

527
00:57:53,167 --> 00:57:54,167
dad

528
00:57:54,167 --> 00:57:55,967
Otherwise you'll die, you brat.

529
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:57,533
Go quickly

530
00:57:59,233 --> 00:57:59,900
dad…

531
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:01,767
I told you to go quickly

532
00:58:01,767 --> 00:58:03,033
if i didn't go back

533
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:05,033
You can use this money to escape far away

534
00:58:05,033 --> 00:58:06,967
This money…

535
00:58:06,967 --> 00:58:09,500
Enough to last you until adulthood

536
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:14,133
You bunch of brats

537
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:19,700
Qingjiang, there's no point in running away.

538
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:21,700
I can find you in three days

539
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:23,133
Don't waste your energy

540
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,700
Kill me first and then make a fuss, you brat.

541
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:08,767
Back off…

542
00:59:15,367 --> 00:59:17,300
your son

543
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:19,233
I will definitely find out

544
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:23,933
We all know you received a large sum of money today

545
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,467
that money

546
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:29,067
We remitted it

547
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:30,800
Damn it

548
00:59:31,633 --> 00:59:36,100
Aizawa, just accept your fate and go on your way.

549
00:59:53,567 --> 00:59:55,300
who are you

550
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,833
Are you Lee Sang-taek?

551
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:58,567
who are you

552
01:01:16,267 --> 01:01:18,033
You are back

553
01:01:18,967 --> 01:01:21,833
Yes, where's dinner?

554
01:01:21,833 --> 01:01:23,567
Have eaten

555
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,500
(number not shown)

556
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:56,500
What happened?

557
01:02:00,667 --> 01:02:02,400
nothing

558
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:12,933
That…

559
01:02:13,833 --> 01:02:17,600
Someone came to my door when I wasn't home

560
01:02:18,467 --> 01:02:20,367
Or call?

561
01:02:21,933 --> 01:02:24,067
no

562
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,800
Okay, let's go back to the room and rest.

563
01:02:28,833 --> 01:02:30,467
good

564
01:02:44,767 --> 01:02:47,133
(missed call)

565
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:54,667
(number not shown)
(I know who killed Chairman Kim Kang-heon’s son)

566
01:03:34,233 --> 01:03:35,333
(number not shown)

567
01:03:38,233 --> 01:03:40,200
Is this Judge Song Panhao?

568
01:03:41,033 --> 01:03:42,800
Which one

569
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:45,700
What about me?

570
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,533
Witnessed by chance

571
01:03:47,533 --> 01:03:52,667
Very dangerous and important thing

572
01:03:52,667 --> 01:03:57,200
April 8, 7:55 am

573
01:03:57,200 --> 01:03:59,433
What happened at the car repair shop

574
01:03:59,433 --> 01:04:01,633
I saw the car was badly damaged

575
01:04:02,767 --> 01:04:06,100
It's like there was a car accident

576
01:04:09,733 --> 01:04:14,567
(Your Honor)

577
01:04:42,867 --> 01:04:44,033
Do you know who killed our gang members?

578
01:04:44,033 --> 01:04:48,233
And Lee Sang-taek?

579
01:04:48,233 --> 01:04:51,433
Find Sang Hyuk quickly and be one step ahead of the police.

580
01:04:51,433 --> 01:04:54,300
It’s not easy but I want to arrest Kim Sang Hyuk

581
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:57,033
I heard that the police have
Evidence that you killed Li Xiangze and Zheng Hailong

582
01:04:57,033 --> 01:04:58,500
what do you want

583
01:04:58,500 --> 01:05:00,367
You consider taking a look

584
01:05:00,367 --> 01:05:04,000
How much would it cost to silence me?

585
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,800
man so respected

586
01:05:05,800 --> 01:05:10,367
Would you really hit Sang Hyun like that and still choose to escape?
