Do you know who stole it?

17

Someone named Lee Sang Taek.

He's a man in his 40s who lives in Jangbeom-dong.

Lee Sang Taek is dead.

21
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,890
who killed my father and Jeong Hae Yong in here.

22

But something is strange.

23
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:44,120
My father isn't the hit-and-run culprit.

24
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,930
What do you mean?

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,890
One time, I was furious because

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,660
my father hit Grandmother.

27
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,620

G-Grandmother, are you okay?

30
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,840
But the time my father hit my grandmother was around the time

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,700
that guy Kim Sang Hyeon got into the accident.

32
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,780
I'm sorry.

33
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,770
Lee Sang Taek might not be the hit-and-run culprit.

34
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,630
At the time of Kim Sang Hyeon's accident,

35
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,450
Lee Sang Taek apparently assaulted his mother, Kim Mi Yeong.

36
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,300
And the gas explosion happened when he was about to report this to the police.

37
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:33,940
Does that mean the car's owner is the culprit?

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:37,320
At that time, Judge Song Pan Ho was in a trial.

39
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,920
There's someone who drove that car from time to time.

40
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,110
- Who?
- Judge Song Pan Ho's son...

00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,910
Song Ho Yeong.

42
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:57,630
Should we start this case after Kim Sang Hyeok's case is over?

43
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:04,500
Judge Song is concealing a case?

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,300
But we're not trying to catch the hit-and-run culprit right now.

Something that you can't refuse...

Why would you meet that man?

90
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,540
I didn't go to meet him.

91

93
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,160
No, you can't.

94
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:35,690
You can't get involved with those people.

95
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:38,220

"When a person commits a crime,

97
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,400
he's bound to get punished in one way or the other."

98
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,250
That's what you told me when I was little.

99
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,910
And it's true.

100
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,230
Did you do it on purpose?

101
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,530
The hit-and-run incident...

102
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,240
The victim, Kim Sang Hyeon...

103
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:14,310
was the half-brother of Kim Sang Hyeok, whom you despised.

104
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:17,500
Did you do it on purpose to avenge your mom?

105
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,030
You didn't.

106
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:31,180
It was purely an accident, right?

107
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:41,310
The reason I fabricated the evidence and concealed the case that day was

108
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,680
because you won't get an appropriate punishment for a hit-and-run accident...

109
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:51,460
You won't get an appropriate punishment for it.

110
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,380
Because Chairman Kim Gang Heon will take it out on you.

111
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,780
If appropriate punishment by the law was possible,

112
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,500
I would've made you turn yourself in.

- However?
- However...

114
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:08,890
if you committed an intentional murder to avenge your mom,

115
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,030
I become an accomplice to a murder.

116
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,810
That's...

117
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,110
something I cannot accept.

118
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:18,810
You want to keep your conviction as a judge now?

119
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,740
Stop it. Please stop.

120
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,850
The law you tried to protect even in the wake of Mom's death...

121
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:32,270
You'll protect it again this time, right?

122
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,910
I trust you will.

123
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:44,330

124

126
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,350
Yes.

127
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,270

my father, Uncle Hae Yong...

131
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,600
and other foreigners as well...

132
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,500
with a gun.

133
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,070
Why were you there that day, Witness?

134
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:52,170
Jeong Hae Yong said he'd smuggle my father and me to Cambodia.

135
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,780
We were going to go live in Cambodia.

136
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:59,850
My father had been in hiding and showed up for the first time.

137
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:10,790

- Are you Lee Sang Taek?

138
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,880

139
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:19,110
Did you film that video?

140
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,600
Yes, I- I filmed it.

141
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:27,830
That's all.

142
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,150
Defendant, you may question the witness.

143
00:13:47,190 --> 00:13:49,660
At the time, there was no streetlight.

144
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:52,740
The moonlight was probably the only source of light.

145
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,650
Based on what,

146
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,580
do you say the man who shot the gun is my client sitting here?

147
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,820
When the trigger was pulled, there was a combustion

148
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,560
and that allowed me to see his face.

149
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:11,280
Are you saying the face you saw in a split second is accurate?

150
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,380
Based on what?

151
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:22,280
My father was never kind

152
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:25,490
and beat up my sister and me whenever.

153
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,310
However...

154
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,990
still...

155
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,160
he was my father.

156
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:36,230
The one who gave birth to me.

157
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:45,950
It was the moment that my father was shot to death.

158
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,210

how did you know?

163
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,520
We're the Blue House.

164

We have all the numbers we feel we might need.

00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,560
I'd like to meet with you.

167
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,310
I have something to say to you.

168
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:40,930
Judge Song, we're always...

169
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:43,320
ready to welcome you.

170
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,960
Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa recommended you last time,

171
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:53,150
so we're reviewing in a very positive and enthusiastic direction.

Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

176
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,990
Because I felt the limitations of being a judge.

The trial result needs to become an issue.

183
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:38,730
Competency and integrity are like water and fire.

184
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:41,210
Money follows competent people.

185
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:44,320
But there's no way such money can be clean.

186
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,270
So, please show us competency and integrity...

187
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,090
can be combined.

188
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:58,500
We plan to symbolize your competency and integrity

189
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,080
as the motto of our regime.

190
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,100
What does integrity mean for you?

191
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:09,090
An appropriate verdict for the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok.

192
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,210
The maximum sentence.

193
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,740
Please be symbolic.

194
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:26,260
How much later after the trial can I enter the Blue House?

195
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,520
We'll first create an issue in the media.

196
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,970
Woo One Group is only a violent criminal organization.

197
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,010
But it grew too much.

198
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:40,210
The countless incidents that followed the death of Kim Gang Heon's second son.

199
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:45,000
Kim Gang Heon is having his way with the world.

200
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,690
After Kim Sang Hyeok's trial ends,

201
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:52,960
our regime plans to teach him a lesson.

202
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:59,170
In that case, when will I...

203
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,820
Wouldn't two months be...

204
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,970
enough to make an issue out of it?

205
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,820
[Woowon District Prosecutors' Office]

206
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,120
Hang in there until the witness testimony ends, even if it's uncomfortable.

207
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,560
Oh, I'm fine.

208
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,470
What I hate the most in this world are

209
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,550
bastards who rule the world with money.

210
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,270
Because their behavior is ruining the world.

211
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:46,140
You can trust Detective Jang and me and stay strong, right?

212
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,330
I also have to...

213
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,160
exact revenge for my personal reasons.

214
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:54,700
My Cheong Ha... and grandmother...

215
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,320
Stuff like this isn't tough at all.

216
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,620
Please don't worry.

217
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,100
It's snack time.

218
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,770
You're a good eater. Good eater.

219
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:28,730
It's delicious.

220
00:19:32,330 --> 00:19:39,370
How much later after the trial can I enter the Blue House?

221
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:43,490
Wouldn't two months be enough to make an issue out of it?

222
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:45,970
Two months after the trial...

223
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:48,410
Is he telling me to die?

224
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,250
Are you confident?

225
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,260
You only have one chance.

226
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:10,240
If you fail, we'll all die.

227
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,980
Oppa?

228
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,380
Are you okay?

229
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:18,730
D-Did my dad force you...

230
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,100
to stay here?

231
00:21:31,550 --> 00:21:34,110
I'm sorry, Oppa.

232
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,560
I was just too worried...

233
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,430
because you seemed to be

234
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:47,810
in so much pain.

235
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:56,130
You smile whenever you look at me.

236
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:58,740
But you're always sad

237
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,520
when you look elsewhere.

238
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,670
That's why...

239
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,050
That's why I wanted to be by your side.

240
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,830
Oppa...

241
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,600
p-please don't hate me too much.

242
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm sorry.

243
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:50,840
I'm sorry, Eun.

00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:10,750
Excuse me, are you all right?

245
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,630
Are you feeling unwell?

246
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,990
Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment?

247
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:32,600
Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors?

248
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:37,650
[Song Pan Ho]

249
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,870
- Are you suffering from respiratory distress?
- There was...

250
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,710
Lee Cheong Gang's testimony during yesterday's trial.

251
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:49,990
I know. I heard.

252
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:52,740
There's one last method.

253
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,700
I'll tell you in person.

254
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:01,870
Sir, you must pull it together.

255
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:05,190
Please tap the phone once, even if it's difficult.

256
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:09,750
In the current situation,

257
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:14,530
there's nothing to stop Lee Cheong Gang from testifying.

258
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:18,990
We must bring Lee Cheong Gang to join our side.

259
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,730
Before that,

260
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:24,410
there's something I need to tell you.

261
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,390
About what?

262
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,290
Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors?

263
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:48,480
Are you suffering from respiratory distress?

264
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,130
Sir, it's hard to confirm your location right now,

265
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,260
- we'll check your phone's-

266
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,110
The sound you hear at the end is the flat tire alert.

267
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,060
Using that as a clue, I found a nearby auto shop and

268
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:13,520
I learned you stopped by the auto shop and deleted the CCTV records.

269
00:25:14,190 --> 00:25:16,360
That's why...

270
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,280
I thought you were the culprit.

271
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,620
However,

272
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:26,970
a sound kept bothering me.

273
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:32,600
The raspy breathing you hear from the phone call with the 119.

274
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,880
An asthma patient's breathing.

275
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:42,300
I saw your son...

276
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,670
use a nebulizer.

277
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,610
You're not the culprit.

278
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,230
The boy who killed Sang Hyeon

279
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,550
is next to Eun right now.

280
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,450
Could it be intentional?

281
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:17,610
If it was intentional,

282
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,810
what does he want?

283
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:25,620
I-It's by chance.

284
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,530
He doesn't want anything. Nothing at all.

285
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:40,700
You must think you can do as you wish

286
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:44,860
with my child's life with that shallow authority of a judge.

287
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:49,410
But... I also have that much power.

288
00:26:59,930 --> 00:27:04,520
Your oldest son, Kim Sang Hyeok...

289
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,020
raped my wife.

290
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,640
His case was dismissed as he was acquitted.

291
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,610
But my wife was living with a horrific memory.

292
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:25,320
Two years ago, my wife killed herself and

293
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,190
my son has been

294
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:30,610
living hellish days

295
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,020
after losing his mother.

296
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,330
Of course...

297
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:40,950
Of course, my son couldn't have caused the accident intentionally.

298
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,030
He just happened to run into your son on that road

299
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:48,400
at that particular time... by c-chance-

300
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,200
Enough!

301
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:03,060
You lost your son and

302
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,020
my child lost his mother.

303
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,820
Losing something more precious than your own life...

304
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:12,590
I'm sure you know how painful that is.

305
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,390
Since you're experiencing it now.

306
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:25,280
A-Assemblyman Jeong Yi Hwa...

307
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:28,440
Tell him to meet Lee Cheong Gang.

308
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:34,220
Tell Lee Cheong Gang that Judge Song Pan Ho is the culprit.

309
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:39,280
Tell him that Detective Jang Chae Rim knows that the hit-and-run culprit is Judge Song

310
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:45,360
but she used him to get Chairman Kim Gang Heon and Kim Sang Hyeok of Woo One.

311
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,620
If you tell him that, Lee Cheong Gang will turn his back on them.

312
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,100
If Lee Cheong Gang changes his testimony,

313
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,060
the trial can end with not guilty.

314
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,490
After that,

315
00:28:57,490 --> 00:29:00,610
I'll come to you. And...

316
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:03,100
I'll accept the consequences.

317
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:09,160
So, not my son. Please...

318
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:15,480
Just understand how much pain and agony my son has been experiencing.

319
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:44,840
N-No. No.

320
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,450
If you lure Chairman Kim Gang Heon,

321
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:52,610
we'll ambush him on his way back.

322
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:54,320
No.

323
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,640
No.

324
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:13,760
- What was he talking about?
- Pardon?

325
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,910
Pardon?

326
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:17,410
Sang Hyeok raped Song Pan Ho's wife?

327
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,230
I didn't know about it, either.

328
00:30:19,230 --> 00:30:21,530
Sang Hyeok has caused way too many problems.

329
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,690
Look into the details.

330
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,230
Yes, sir.

331
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,370
No. No.

332
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,360
Chairman!

333
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,210
Stay put.

334
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,890
You can't do it.

335
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,590
Just go back.

336
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:03,170
Don't lay a finger on him!

337
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,630
You might end up in danger, too.

338
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:13,160
I'll earn some time.

339
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,430
Right now!

340
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:23,040
Run away if you want to live.

341
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,470
Yes, I understand.

342
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,790
Let's go back.

343
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,320
Let's go back!

344
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:03,880
Hey, get back!

345
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,510
Shit, I said to get back!

346
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,280
- Stuffy, huh?
- Huh?

347
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,580
No, I'm fine.

348
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:07,150
Go and get some fresh air in the garden in the front.

349
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,800
Hang in there until the trial ends.

350
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,260
Even if we win the trial,

351
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,330
will I be safe?

352
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,620
Will you also be...

353
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,540
safe, Detective?

354
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,020
Yes.

355
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,470
I'll defend you.

356
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,170
This country isn't that sloppy.

357

359
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,990
You're Lee Cheong Gang, right?

360
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,690
Who are you?

361
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,490
[Jeong Yi Hwa]
I'm an assemblyman.

362
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:37,160
If they find out the witness stayed with the prosecutor and the detective in charge,

363
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,330
it will be disadvantageous for you during the trial.

364
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,450
Did you know that?

365
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,740
The most important thing is that your father's not the hit-and-run culprit.

366
00:34:57,740 --> 00:35:01,340
In that case, who could be the culprit?

367
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:05,350
Whose doing is it that your grandmother, sister,

368
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,000
and your father passed away?

369
00:35:19,210 --> 00:35:22,440
Making your father steal that car and

370
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,360
junk the car without anyone knowing

371
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:29,000
was an order from Jo Mi Yeon of Boodu Gang.

372
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,320
And I asked her to do it.

373
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:36,490
Then, who exactly asked me for this favor?

374
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,530
This is Song Pan Ho.

375
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,040
Are you available for a phone call right now?

376
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,700
Let's meet briefly.

377
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:57,670
Who is it?

378
00:35:57,670 --> 00:35:59,510
Song Pan Ho.

379
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:04,320
He's the judge in charge of Kim Sang Hyeok's trial right now.

380
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,840
Song Pan Ho, Prosecutor Kang So Yeong, and Detective Jang Chae Rim

381
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,130
are all in this together.

382
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:16,020
But can you trust them?

383
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,190
Stop lying to me.

384
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,240
Here.

385
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,710
What about now?

386
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,530
What are you doing?

387
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,680
Assemblyman.

388
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:04,700
What brings you here?

389
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:10,060
We're from the Internal Affairs.

390
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,490
We got a report.

391
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:14,190
Is the prosecutor on the case allowed to stay with a witness

392
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,100
who can influence the trial greatly?

393
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,740
Wouldn't it be possible to fabricate evidence?

394
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,700
It's a witness protection program.

395
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,670
We can't help it.

396
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:26,950
You should've reported it to your higher-ups first.

397
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,150
Because it's dangerous!

398
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:33,080
We're up against Woo One! Who can we trust?

399
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,690
Detective Jang...

400
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:45,780
is this true?

401
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,560
Is Judge Song Pan Ho...

402
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:52,380
on your side?

403
00:37:56,090 --> 00:38:00,110
I will protect this child from now on.

404
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,040
He wishes to be with us.

405
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,630
Really?

406
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,980
Do you wish to stay with Detective Jang or Prosecutor Kang?

407
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:11,390
Or do you want to go with me?

408
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:14,180
I can give you what you want.

409
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:20,330
The thing that's more brutal than killing your father...

410
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:25,870
Let's catch the bastard who framed all of this on your father.

411
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,720
You and I will, that is.

412
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,430
Can you guarantee my safety?

413
00:38:36,430 --> 00:38:38,610
That's not all.

414
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:42,970
Shouldn't you think about the rest of your life as well?

415
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:58,290
Detective Jang...

416
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,520
did you try to use me...

417
00:39:04,010 --> 00:39:06,870
so you can get Chairman Kim Gang Heon?

418
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:20,270
Hold on.

419
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:22,940
This is nuts, seriously.

420
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:50,780
I was in the middle of work, so I only have about 10 minutes.

421
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,770
I'm getting pressured because of the trial.

422
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:59,230
You wouldn't know Woo One Group's power since you're in there.

423
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,850
If I sentence Kim Sang Hyeok guilty,

424
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:05,610
I don't know what will happen to me.

425
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:09,430
What do you need us to do?

426
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:14,000
I'll enter the Blue House as soon as the trial ends.

427
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,030
If that's not possible,

428
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,650
I can't give Kim Sang Hyeok a guilty verdict.

429
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,190
What we want is...

430
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,000
a judge who sets the standard for law and principles, never giving in to pressure.

431
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,440
And that firm standard will become the cornerstone that supports the world.

432
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:45,600
That's...

433
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,890
That's the same thing.

434
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,560
I'm saying I can protect the law and the principles

435
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:57,370
if you promise my entrance as soon as the trial ends.

436
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,710
There's another Chief of Political Affairs candidate.

437
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:38,450
We thought you were the best fit for the job.

438
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:42,230
But they sent me these pictures.

439
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:46,350
Taking pictures around Chairman Kim Gang Heon must've been difficult.

440
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:49,150
But they somehow managed to take pictures.

441
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,010
Anyhow, I understand what you mean, Judge Song.

442
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:00,030
I'll go and report to the VIP.

443
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:04,680
If he gives the word, I'll call you before the trial ends.

444
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,920
I didn't know you and Assemblyman Jeong

445
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,500
were connected like this, Chairman Kim.

446
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:47,000
I can grant you all your wishes until the day you die.

447
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,990
The hit-and-run culprit...

448
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:58,130
Is it really Judge Song Pan Ho?

449
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,620
If Judge Song Pan Ho is really the culprit,

450
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:05,370
can you make sure...

451
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:07,680
he's punished justly for his crime?

452
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,360
That was my job, to begin with.

453
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:13,320
Anything else you want?

454
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,060
No.

455
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,700
In fact, I'm not certain.

456
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:57,310
I just assumed that the man must be Kim Sang Hyeok.

457
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:06,150
- Why?
- My grandmother and...

458
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,840
younger sister, Cheong Ha, died from a gas explosion.

459
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,190
Back then,

460
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,220
people said it was Woo One Group's doing.

461
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:17,780
I also thought so.

462
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,780
So, I thought that man must be Kim Sang Hyeok.

463
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:25,940
At the time, I wanted to kill everyone in Woo One Group.

464
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:31,340
By chance, do you have evidence the deaths of your grandmother

465
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:35,400
and sister were caused by Woo One Group?

466
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:44,080
That's what people were saying.

467
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:51,380
Of those people, did anyone say that to you a lot?

468
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:03,740
Yes.

469
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:08,940
Would that be Detective Jang Chae Rim?

470
00:45:11,370 --> 00:45:12,730
Yes.

471
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:17,910
Is there anyone else?

472
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:25,310
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong.

473
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:40,160
Your Honor,

474
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:45,310
Before the trial began, Witness Lee Cheong Gang met Detective Jang Chae Rim

475
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,400
with the video footage he recorded.

476
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,310
He gave her the video and communicated with her for about a month.

477
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,790
Of course, while staying at a place she arranged for him.

478
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,870
And when the trial began and stood on the witness stand,

479
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:02,460
he stayed in Prosecutor Kang So Yeong's office.

480
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,120
Under the reason of witness protection, those two have been

481
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,030
gaslighting Witness Lee Cheong Gang

482
00:46:10,030 --> 00:46:12,340
throughout their time together.

483
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:25,690
Those two have been madly engaged in catching Chairman Kim Gang Heon.

484
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:27,820
Two years ago, Detective Jang Chae Rim

485
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,530
tried and failed to arrest Kim Sang Hyeok, sitting in the defendant's seat.

486
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:34,120
And three years ago, Prosecutor Kang So Yeong

487
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:38,060
gave Chairman Kim Gang Heon a three-year sentence.

488
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:40,610
Although the reason eludes me, Your Honor,

489
00:46:40,610 --> 00:46:46,250
this trial is being manipulated by a detective and prosecutor who abhor Woo One.

490
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:49,560
Your Honor!

491
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,760
This sacred court was being controlled by their personal greed.

492
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,560
That is all.

493
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:19,610
With that...

494
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,910
the court is adjourned.

495
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:26,710
The verdict hearing will take place in three days

496
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:31,120
on May 17th at 2 p.m.

497
00:47:58,510 --> 00:48:00,090
Yes, Chairman.

498
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,810
The final hearing ended without a hitch.

499
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,580
Continue.

500
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:09,850
Yes.

501
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:14,620
Two years ago in 2022, your oldest son-

502
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:18,920
Kim Sang Hyeok forced drugs on Jo Eun Hye, who was already high...

503
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:23,940
Well, Jo Eun Hye was volunteering in a slum outside of Woowon City.

504
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:27,390
Sang Hyeok was accused of...

505
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:30,880
forcibly administering drugs to Jo Eun Hye.

506
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,580
And...

507
00:48:35,420 --> 00:48:40,140
it seems he also sexually assaulted her.

508
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:45,020
At the time, the investigation was led by Detective Jang Chae Rim.

509
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:49,430
The investigation of the forced drug use was closed without pressing charges

510
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:52,560
and the sexual assault case was buried.

511
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:58,410
Why wasn't I informed about all this?

512
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:02,880
Yes, well, you were in prison at the time.

513
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:07,160
And this was only one of many small incidents.

514
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:12,040
After the investigation concluded, we sent him to America right away.

515
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,780
Ever since then, Jang Chae Rim has become very resentful

516
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:18,860
and she wouldn't listen to me.

517
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:23,250
She kept tracking Sang Hyeok, saying she'd catch him somehow.

518
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,080
She's been a thorn in my side.

519
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,620
She's so obsessively persistent.

520
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:31,400
I'll manage her so she doesn't become a nuisance to you.

521
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:46,650
We'll probably lose again.

522
00:49:48,730 --> 00:49:50,600
Probably.

523
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:54,660
Is it utterly impossible to beat him?

524
00:49:56,180 --> 00:49:58,210
Chairman Kim Gang Heon.

525
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,590
This was probably the best opportunity of our lifetime.

526
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:04,900
If we fail again this time,

527
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,840
it means he's an invincible being.

528
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:16,580
How can the world function like this?

529
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:21,880
No, it's probably because we're not skilled enough.

530
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,100
Don't blame the world like an idiot.

531
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,060
Judge Song...

532
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:45,820
How could Judge Song do that?

533
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,930
We can't end it here.

534
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,300
There's still more we can do.

535
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,800
I can't help it, even if I have to play dirty.

536
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,470
Call Jo Mi Yeon.

537
00:51:51,470 --> 00:51:54,110
W-What's the matter?

538
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:56,940
Do you think you can hide it forever?

539
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:03,270
Judge Song, lies have many flaws.

540
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:06,430
In order to hide the flaws, you must tell another lie.

541
00:52:06,430 --> 00:52:08,740
Then, you end up with more flaws.

542
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,340
Do you know what happens then?

543
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,260
You get caught in the end.

544
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:18,130
What could've ended with a slap on the wrist will turn into a death sentence.

545
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:22,190
- I-I don't know what you're saying-
- Song Pan Ho!

546
00:52:26,950 --> 00:52:28,580
If I find Jo Mi Yeon,

547
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:31,790
I'll kill you even without Chairman Kim's permission.

548
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:35,560
I'm letting you live only until the trial ends.

549
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,310
After that...

550
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:41,660
I'll bestow you with unimaginable pain.

551
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:43,760
I don't know, either.

552
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,590
I don't know what to do...

553
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:51,000
from here, either.

554
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,640
[Jang Chae Rim]

555
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:34,860
Detective Jang, what is it?

556
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:36,560
Are you free right now?

557
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:38,200
Isn't it too late?

558
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:40,560
You have to meet me tonight.

559
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:43,610
What is this regarding?

560
00:54:43,610 --> 00:54:45,800
It's about Ho Yeong.

561
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:47,230
What about him?

562
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:49,670
I'll tell you in person.

563
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:54,950
If it's about Ho Yeong, I become impatient. Tell me now.

564
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:57,240
No, I can't tell you right now.

565
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:00,880
I'll text you a location. Meet me there within the hour.

566
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,780
It's not difficult or complicated.

567
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,640
It's simple.

568
00:55:22,490 --> 00:55:25,570
I just need to save Ho Yeong.

569
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,860
What do you have to tell me?

570
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,730
Ho Yeong's accident...

571
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,670
wasn't by chance.

572
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:42,760
It was a crime he prepared for a long time.

573
00:55:42,760 --> 00:55:44,660
As to his motive,

574
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,760
you and I can both guess why.

575
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:52,180
To avenge his mom.

576
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:57,400
He prepared for at least six months and committed the crime on the day he set.

577
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,390
No. There's no way.

578
00:55:59,390 --> 00:56:03,690
I've obtained both witness and evidence.

579
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:08,030
He will be tried as a criminal, not as a car accident.

580
00:56:23,660 --> 00:56:25,240
However,

581
00:56:28,070 --> 00:56:30,450
I also want revenge.

582
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:35,570
Just like Ho Yeong.

583
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,010
If Kim Sang Hyeok receives the punishment he deserves for his crimes,

584
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:47,110
I'm willing to bury the truth I know.

585
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:52,720
If you give Kim Sang Hyeok a not-guilty verdict

586
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:55,280
when you're aware he's the culprit...

587
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:02,590
I'll have to let the world know the incident I tracked down.

588
00:57:02,590 --> 00:57:06,180
- How dirty of you.
- The dirtiest person...

589
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:10,930
is you, Judge Song.

590
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,200
- Must I give you an answer today?
- Yes, you do.

591
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:23,180
After today,

592
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,940
I don't know what I might do.

593
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,990
Can you give me a cigarette?

594
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,220
[Park Chang Hyeok]

595
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:21,230
What is it?

596
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,190
Let me ask you for a difficult favor.

597
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,260
I'll be honest.

598
00:58:36,260 --> 00:58:38,930
If Kim Sang Hyeok is ruled guilty,

599
00:58:38,930 --> 00:58:43,950
Chairman Kim Gang Heon won't leave Ho Yeong and me unscathed.

600
00:58:43,950 --> 00:58:47,280
I also must find a way to survive.

601
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,090
We'll protect you.

602
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:54,340
No. There's no one in this world who can protect us

603
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:56,680
from Chairman Kim Gang Heon.

604
00:58:57,770 --> 00:58:59,640
Which leads to the question...

605
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,900
After the trial ends,

606
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:08,950
is there any way you can stow us away without anyone noticing?

607
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:19,180
Yes, I can help you do that.

608
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:25,290
After that accident,

609
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,080
everything fell apart.

610
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:39,940
It feels like the world is going insane.

611
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:43,890
A lot has happened.

612
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:54,020
I hope we never see each other after today.

613
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,110
Chairman.

614
01:00:45,770 --> 01:00:47,690
How should I proceed?

615
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:19,090
You're home?

616
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:24,390
Was it intentional?

617
01:02:27,620 --> 01:02:30,050
To avenge Mom?

618
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:36,950
Why can't you think about the people who remain alive?

619
01:02:39,290 --> 01:02:44,780
Can't you see why I gave in to the trial?

620
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:50,480
It was for you, who's still alive.

621
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:59,820
I didn't care if I became a cowardly and shabby man who lost his beloved wife like that.

622
01:02:59,820 --> 01:03:03,050
As long as you're safe,

623
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:06,860
I don't care if this entire world collapses.

624
01:03:06,860 --> 01:03:10,220
That was the best I could do.

625
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:18,900
The best you could do?

626
01:03:23,670 --> 01:03:26,330
You did that for yourself.

627
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:32,040
You forced me to live a life

628
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,260
that was worse than dying.

629
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,610
Ho Yeong...

630
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:41,350
Why...

631
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:45,800
Why do you think I killed Kim Sang Hyeon?

632
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:50,340
A life that's worse than dying.

633
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:55,860
I wanted to gift that kind of life to Chairman Kim Gang Heon.

634
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:02,750
But you're just trying to save me because that's what you're afraid of.

635
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:13,320
Do you wish for me

636
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,660
to leave you to die?

637
01:04:20,770 --> 01:04:22,160
Yes.

638
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:24,960
No.

639
01:04:26,090 --> 01:04:28,090
You must live.

640
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:33,450
I'll keep you alive, no matter what.

641
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,570
[Your Honor]

642
01:04:43,070 --> 01:04:51,120
♫ At a familiar stop, you and I realized ♫

643
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:57,150
♫ We're not that naive ♫

644
01:04:57,150 --> 01:05:00,500
♫ What is in your mind? ♫

645
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:08,800
♫ Come across the line our eyes, already decide ♫

646
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:11,010
You'll be found not guilty.

647
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:13,050
I'm going to find him guilty.

648
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:19,720
Moving the world means you know everything that's going on!

649
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,150
I'll get your revenge.

650
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:25,970
What's your son plotting this time and why?

651
01:05:25,970 --> 01:05:28,740
That's the only way for survival.

652
01:05:28,740 --> 01:05:30,650
You've got to be prudent.

653
01:05:30,650 --> 01:05:34,910
What on earth must I do to end this?

654
01:05:34,910 --> 01:05:37,160
I'll announce the verdict.
