180
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:44,440
and declared that he would pay for all crimes on behalf of Woo One Group.

181
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,930
For his symbolic act of being a chaebol chairman who doesn't avoid punishment,

182
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:51,020
he had received support from the people.

183
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:54,970
Get out and find me some evidence!

184
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,370
The victim is Chairman Kim Gang Heon's second son!

185
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,340
Do I turn myself in now?

186
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,830
Why-

187
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,790
You're telling me...

188
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:57,180
this is Sang Hyeon?

189
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:03,000
No. It can't be.

190
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,390
This isn't my dear Sang Hyeon.

191
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:12,340
His face is...

192
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,070
How?

193
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:21,840
How did his face get so damaged?

194
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:27,180
This isn't my Sang Hyeon's face!

195
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,160
His son passed away?

196
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,700
Yes.

197
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,060
Who did it?

198
00:24:48,060 --> 00:24:49,530
Just stay quiet.

199
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:53,030
Hey, what if we all get screwed over this?

200
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:55,480
Shut your trap, will you?

201
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,450
I swiftly requested a furlough,

202
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:50,600
so you can meet your son.

203
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,710
How could this happen with just four months left until your release?

204
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:05,520
I'll hurry and get the approval from my superiors.

205
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,550
It won't be a furlough.

206
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
Prepare for my release.

207
00:26:11,410 --> 00:26:13,980
Attorney Jo will be in touch with you.

208
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:41,780
Don't leave a single detail out, and write down what happened after the accident.

209
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:43,500
Why?

210
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,860
Just do as I tell you.

211
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:58,260
Judge Song, is something wrong?

212
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,160
You weren't in your office.

213
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,810
- Did you go somewhere?
- Yeah.

214
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:06,040
Judge Han, I forgot it was my wife's memorial day today.

215
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:09,710
I'll head back in the late afternoon after taking care of some things.

216
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,690
Get it together.

217
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:48,750
Someone died because of your mistake.

218
00:28:48,750 --> 00:28:51,990
Feeling tormented with guilt and self-pity...

219
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:55,330
None of that is helpful right now.

220
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,390
Was this purely a hit-and-run accident?

221
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:09,190
Or was there a gang involvement in a dispute of interests?

222
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,790
The reason this case has emerged as an issue

223
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,660
is because the deceased is the second son of Woo One Group's Chairman, Kim Gang Heon.

224
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:20,280
Chairman Kim Gang Heon of Woo One Group is a legendary figure.

225
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,830
In the 1960's, a corrupt political force...

226
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,520
Judge Song?

227
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,990
You must've left work early today.

228
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,230
Yes.

229
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,230
You must have the day off.

230
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,780
I took the morning off. I had an errand to run this morning.

231
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:47,940
I see.

232
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,250
Okay.

233
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,700
Well, then...

234
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,620
Kim Joo Han's son, the founder Chairman Kim Woo Won,

235
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,520
inherited the business from Kim Joo Han

236
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,770
to create the right-wing faction and established Woo One Future Construction.

237
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,800
For the past 60 years, he has maintained the reputation of the right-wing faction

238
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,980
as the leader of a crime organization for two generations.

239
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,620
Around the time of Chairman Kim Gang Heon's era, he declares the following.

240
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:18,610
"I will no longer run an underground business."

241
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,070
The internal opposition from the group was quite heavy.

242
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,860
There was a bloodbath within Woo One Group.

243
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,450
The five gang leaders went missing or died mysteriously.

244
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:29,240
That's right.

245
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:33,650
The most likely suspect at that time was Chairman Kim Gang Heon...

246
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,130
There he comes!

247
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,930
Block the reporters. Block them!

248
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,760
Block the reporters!

249
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:47,350
Stop taking pictures!

250
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:48,800
Stop!

251
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,980
Please stop taking pictures!

252
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:01,590
- Excuse me!
- Grab him!

253
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,570
Chairman Kim Gang Heon!

254
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:09,570
Block them off!

255
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,630
Get in the car!

256
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,900
Judge Song! What brings you here?

257
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:37,720
I'd like to ask you something.

258
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,670
Yes, go ahead.

259
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:42,270
The scrapped cars record from Park Sin Yeong's case...

260
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,930
You handed it over to the prosecution, right?

261
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,130
That's right.

262
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,820
I think there's missing information.

263
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:51,390
The perpetrator's lawyer was talking about the possibility of evidence tampering.

264
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,430
Sorry? No way. What are you saying?

265
00:32:55,430 --> 00:32:57,640
I have nothing to do with the victim whatsoever.

266
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,860
Why would I tamper with the scrapped cars record?

267
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,800
I'm not good with computers, so I wrote it by hand.

268
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,100
Other than that, I have no shame under heaven.

269
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:09,420
Is that so?

270
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:15,870
Can I have a look at this?

271
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,400
Yes.

272
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,080
Hello, this is Master of Parts Repair.

273
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:34,370
I'll be showing you the removal and assembly of the Honors' headlights.

274
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:39,910
Open the Honors bonnet and remove the bolts connected to the grill.

275
00:33:39,910 --> 00:33:43,400
Next, untie a bolt attached to the headlight,

276
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,600
and another inside the hole.

277
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,230
Once you remove the pin under the bumper's lower part,

278
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:52,200
you can take it out easily like this.

279
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,880
Insert the connector again and align them back together nicely.

280
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:59,690
And it's done after you screw the bolts back in.

281
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:06,560
After that, neatly align the bumper back with the seams and give it a nice push.

282
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,120
[Woo One]
To give a brief explanation of Woo One Group here,

283
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:35,170
Woo One Group's name doesn't come from the name of the city it's in, Woowon.

284
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,200
That's right.

285
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,530
They bought the reclaimed land from the government 10 years ago,

286
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:44,220
built residential and commercial areas, and created a city.

287
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
It's a city made by Woo One Group,

288
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:49,430
which is why it got its name from the government, Woowon City.

289
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:54,170
It's the first corporation to have a city named after it in the history of Korea.

290
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,780
- That's right.
- And the person who made this possible is

291
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,700
Chairman Kim Gang Heon. That's what I'm saying.

292
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:20,580
The estimated time of the accident was around 7:30 a.m. today.

293
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,200
He was riding the bike, Basterbik Kiruna,

294
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,490
when he collided with an unidentified vehicle

295
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:31,010
and was left in negligence for 30 minutes.

296
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:35,960
The vehicle's driver took off right after.

297
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:42,490
He was found by a 21-year-old woman named Kang Mi Gyeong, who was jogging at 8 a.m.

298
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:49,710
Around 8:05 a.m., the EMT rescued Kim Sang Hyeon and transported him to a hospital.

299
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:53,510
He was alive when he was found.

300
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:57,940
They arrived at the hospital around 8:20 a.m.

301
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,610
and attempted an emergency operation,

302
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,170
but he passed away.

303
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,610
If he was...

304
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:22,170
transported to the hospital right after the accident, would he have lived?

305
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:26,430
They said that would've been highly likely.

306
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,200
And the sentence?

307
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,990
If there was a clear intent of murder, he'd get at least 10 years.

308
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:41,280
But if that's not the case, it's a fatal car accident and a hit-and-run combined,

309
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,050
which is five years at most.

310
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,190
That's...

311
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:51,050
- Pardon?
- That's it?

312
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,760
Oh, well...

313
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,200
There is a recording of the call made to 119 on your son's phone at the time of the accident.

314
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:13,190
I'll take my leave.

315
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,750
Hello, this is 119. What's your emergency?

316
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,590
Excuse me, are you all right?

317
00:37:36,150 --> 00:37:38,390
Are you feeling unwell?

318
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:45,760
Caller, are you unable to speak at the moment?

319
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,430
Caller, where are you? Are you outdoors?

322
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,000
Judge Song...

323
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,010
I've been telling her she can't for the past 30 minutes.

324
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:10,050
But she just won't take no for an answer.

325
00:39:10,050 --> 00:39:11,360
Ma'am!

326
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:14,190
Hello!

327
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,290
I'm allowed to meet with you now that the trial is over, right?

328
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,320
I'm sorry.

329
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,750
I have nothing to say to you regarding the ruling.

330
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,400
I'm not here to make a complaint.

331
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:40,230
I once read what you wrote in the newspaper.

332
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:43,870
"Life After Sin and Trial."

333
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,780
I felt so wronged after the trial ended.

334
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:54,100
So, I went to the perpetrator's house to confront him.

335
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,330
A mere two-year sentence when he killed someone?

336
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,620
Isn't that absurd?

337
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:06,980
But those people live the same sad lives as we do.

338
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:12,080
Struggling people can recognize the struggles of others.

339
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:17,120
I went to lash out at him but returned without saying a word.

340
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,970
Drink it.

341
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:44,040
You should thank him.

342
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,880
Thank you.

343
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,420
I couldn't help but think this last night.

344
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,340
Two years.

345
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:04,830
In two years, I'll be able to heal the pain of our children's loss of their mother.

346
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:11,400
The time it'll take for the man who killed my daughter-in-law to repent for his sin.

347
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,110
The time it'll take for our rage to be appeased.

348
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,420
The "life after trial" you spoke about...

349
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:29,850
I thought perhaps that could take precedence over the crime that was committed.

350
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,870
Say, "Thank you."

351
00:41:42,870 --> 00:41:45,670

00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:52,470
because I heard you won't accept even a single cookie.

354
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,760
Please just accept my gratitude.

355
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,580
Thank you for your thoughtful judgment.

356
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,280
Please...

357
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,760
give her time to finish her snack.

358
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,270
You are truly a great judge.

359
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,710
What will you do?

360
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:33,050
If our Sang Hyeon had been immediately transported to the hospital,

361
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:37,080
they said he could've survived.

362
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:43,280
Someone...

363
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,630
had the intention of killing Sang Hyeon...

364
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:25,930
[Late Kim Sang Hyeon]

365
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,900
What do you plan to do?

366
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:50,990
Do you still wish to remain a well-respected Chairman?

367
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:57,620
You hated Sang Hyeon the most.

368
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:01,810
When Sang Hyeon died,

369
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:06,510
you were the first person I thought of.

370
00:45:15,710 --> 00:45:18,130
Are you sure you didn't do it?

371
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:24,490
Can you prove you didn't do it?

372
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:55,620
Eun.

373
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,680
This is hard on you, isn't it?

374
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,920
I'll take care of things once the funeral is over.

375
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,190
You just return to America.

376
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:41,920
Give it to me.

377
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:48,440
Why do we always want a drink poured by someone else?

378
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:51,330
It's convenient to pour it ourselves.

379
00:46:51,330 --> 00:46:55,100
However much we want and when we want it.

380
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,530
That's because it makes us look shabby.

381
00:46:57,530 --> 00:46:59,790
We spend all day picking up after other people

382
00:46:59,790 --> 00:47:03,620
and we finally get some time to ourselves at night.

383
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,710
It feels good to have someone pour a drink for you.

384
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,690
It looks good to other people, too.

385
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,080
Goodness. This is a first.

386
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:25,050
Should I call someone to pour your drinks?

387
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,320
At this rate,

388
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,960
I won't even get a taste.

389
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,430
Tell me.

390
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:44,760
Gosh, this is frustrating. Go on and tell me.

391
00:47:44,760 --> 00:47:46,420
You're such a...

392
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:52,460
Today was Eun Hye's memorial day.

393
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,300
It feels like forever ago,

394
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,360
but it's only been two years.

395
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:04,640
When a person dies, they leave behind many things.

396
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,630
Most of them are here...

397
00:48:07,630 --> 00:48:12,420
No matter how hard I try to forget, I just can't.

398
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:15,160
Terrible, right?

399
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:21,640
At least I have a lot of experience, so it's bearable.

400
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:25,780
What to do when I'm hurting, and what to do when I feel sad.

401
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,550
You get seasoned as you get older.

402
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:43,560
But Ho Yeong doesn't know how.

403
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:47,540
He has no way of knowing.

404
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:50,340
Since he has yet to know...

405
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:53,430
the world nor people.

406
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:04,600
When Eun Hye was alive, we used to leave her car in her mother's garage.

407
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:08,960
At 3:00 p.m. today, her mother left it in front of our house.

408
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:13,560
It probably holds a lot of memories of her.

409
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,820
Eun Hye took Ho Yeong on a lot of trips in that car.

410
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:25,210
He must've sat in the car crying.

411
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:27,620
He was probably hurting a lot.

412
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:30,100
Well, Ho Yeong is kind.

413
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,760
Kind people usually hurt more.

414
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:36,460
I want to...

415
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:40,590
get rid of that side for him...

416
00:49:40,590 --> 00:49:44,780
without me, Ho Yeong,

417
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:47,410
or my mother-in-law knowing.

418
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,190
Without anyone knowing.

419
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,100
I understand what you mean.

00:50:04,130 --> 00:50:06,260

How's Chairman Kim Gang Heon's condition?

442
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,350
Some view this accident as a warning from a rival gang.

443

What are your thoughts?

444
00:53:10,870 --> 00:53:12,950
This must've caused a shift in succession.

What's the gang's- I mean, the group's reaction?

Everyone's worth is different.

448
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,600
How much do you think the bastard who killed Sang Hyeon and fled was worth?

449
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:45,500
I'm sure you all know how much Woo One Group's second son, Kim Sang Hyeon, was worth.

450
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:52,810
Just how much was the guy who killed Sang Hyeon and ran off worth?

451
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,440
The law will probably view this as a fatal hit-and-run case.

452
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,880
Just an ordinary hit-and-run case.

was that I had to save you.

When did you start replacing them?

Four days ago.

00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:02,370
We're replacing all CCTV cameras in all public institutions in this area.

This is for confirmation of evidence.

Would it be possible to check all cars that visited the ossuary in the last three days?

487

The thing is, we need to replace the cameras and match the frequency with the server.

So, they don't work until the construction is done once it begins.

Isn't there a way?

00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:44,440

01:05:46,410 --> 01:05:48,800
♫ It's not fair anymore ♫

531
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:54,130
♫ What's on your mind? Where is the truth? ♫

532
01:05:54,130 --> 01:05:58,490
♫ Whenever it feels like never ♫

533
01:05:58,490 --> 01:06:00,840
I'll find Sang Hyeon's killer and make him pay.

534
01:06:00,840 --> 01:06:02,840
It's a guy named Lee Sang Taek.

535
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:05,730
He works for Jo Mi Yeon of the Boodu Gang.

536
01:06:05,730 --> 01:06:08,750
Exactly what date was your car stolen?

537
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:11,670
I'd like your son to be a material witness, too.

538
01:06:11,670 --> 01:06:14,140
Is there a need for that?

539
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:17,360
Even if they find evidence and investigate you,

540
01:06:17,360 --> 01:06:21,170
you must deny it until the end.

541
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:24,410
The one I'm facing is Chairman Kim Gang Heon.

542
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,070
♫ It doesn't feel like home long ago ♫
