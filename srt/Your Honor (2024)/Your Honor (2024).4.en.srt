Why were you late?

It won't be easy.

221
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:08,550
Currently, there are too many figures within the police who collude with Woo One Group.

301
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,800
He said he asked about a foreigner who used to work at the auto shop.

302
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,090
A foreign worker?

303
00:38:47,090 --> 00:38:48,730
- Yes.
- Why?

306
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,300
He said he didn't tell him that.

Why am I wanted-

00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,690
Why did I become wanted?

310
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,610
I don't know the specifics.

323
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:36,100

00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,300
Well, 1,500 cc.

00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:47,440
Just plain old white.

You can take a look around here all you want.

328
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:55,110
I'd like one with a very dark tint.

329
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,560
Dark enough that you can't see inside from the outside.

330
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,580
A tint?

331
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:06,220
That means...

332
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,600
Yeah.

333
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:10,030
I'm in a rush, so hurry it up.

334
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,700
To anywhere. Get one that leaves tomorrow at dawn.

335
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,490
Yeah. Yeah, okay! All right.

336
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,770
What the hell?

337
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:45,210
Gosh, just stay put!

338
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:53,370
Sunbae, I requested an arrest warrant for Kim Sang Hyeok for first-degree murder.

339
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:55,710
And it just got approved.

340
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,610
Hey, Jang Chae Rim.

341
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,190
So, why are you doing this to me?

342
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:10,260
Because I knew all along you've been handing over information to Woo One, Sunbae.

343
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:24,840
If I catch Kim Sang Hyeok and link you, you'll be guilty of accessory to murder.

344
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,960
Listen carefully, Sunbae.

345
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,600
My target is Kim Sang Hyeok.

346
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,780
As long as I catch Kim Sang Hyeok,

347
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:35,630
I can bury the crimes you committed deep down.

348
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:38,170
Unobtainable for the rest of your life.

349
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,030
Kim Sang Hyeok?

350
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,000
Yes.

351
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,490
Let's go.

352
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,710
Which ship am I taking?

353
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:10,180
Don't tell me this is the ship.

354
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:14,260
You paid a lot, so you'll be traveling in an expensive yacht.

355
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,760
Departure and arrival are both easier on a yacht.

356
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,090
You can think of it as a cruise trip.

357
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:00,380
This is the Korea Coast Guard. Stop right there.

358
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:02,940
This is a warning. Stop the engine.

359
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,100
Detective Bae, that motherf***er.

360
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,610
Geez...

361
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,270
Gosh, what an asshole.

362
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,230
I want to see my attorney.

363
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,970
Aigoo, we'll get you your attorney.

364
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,600
You called for the most expensive attorney two years ago, too.

365
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:27,610
Don't stall, and just get to it, please.

366
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,360
However, we're not at the police station.

367
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,820
This is a special investigations headquarters.

368
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:35,070
We'll conduct a special investigation on you.

369
00:46:35,070 --> 00:46:39,210
You can call your attorney once the investigation is over. Do you understand?

370
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:42,770
Oh, I'm sure this is illegal.

371
00:46:46,230 --> 00:46:48,100
I'll just be disciplined.

372
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,480
<i>Who are you?</i>

373
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,630
<i>Are you Lee Sang Taek?</i>

374
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,270
<i>Who are you?</i>

375
00:47:13,470 --> 00:47:14,600
This isn't me.

376
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,160
Right. I knew you'd say that.

377
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,580
However, there's a witness, you see.

378
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,550
I hid away...

379
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:27,000
that witness tightly.

380
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:30,230
The witness will show up when the trial begins.

381
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,060
This one will be hard to get out of.

382
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:03,930
<i>I am the person who...</i>

383
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:09,410
<i>coincidentally witnessed something dangerous and important.</i>

384
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,900
<i>Think about it.</i>

385
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:18,150
<i>How much money it'd take for me to keep my mouth shut.</i>

386
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,900
[Jang Chae Rim]

387
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:31,580
[Jang Chae Rim]

388
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,500
<i>Hello, Judge.</i>

389
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:38,360
Yes. What's the matter?

390
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:40,580
We got Kim Sang Hyeok.

391
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:46,400
This is good news, so I've been calling you all morning to let you know first.

392
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,320
Everything is okay, right?

393
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:53,180
It's fine. What about that kid, Lee Cheong Gang?

394
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,960
I hid him in a safe place. Don't worry.

395
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,640
I don't know how Woo One will react.

396
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,870
So, I'm keeping Kim Sang Hyeok's arrest under maximum confidence.

397
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,130
I see. That's great.

398
00:49:04,970 --> 00:49:07,540
Good job, Detective Jang.

399
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:24,890
- H-Huh, Tee Rab!
- Tee Rab!

400
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:29,270
Man, I heard you're really leaving.

401
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:31,090
What will we do without you, Tee Rab?

402
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:33,250
I should make your coffee.

403
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:36,240
Tee Rab makes the best coffee.

404
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,310
- What will you do there?
- I'll need to look.

405
00:49:42,310 --> 00:49:45,950
You're a good worker with a great personality, so you'll be fine anywhere.

406
00:49:45,950 --> 00:49:48,040
Let's get together for a meal before you go.

407
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,010
We need to grab a meal.

408
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,390
<i>Song Pan Ho left the auto shop and is on the move.</i>

409
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,120
What the heck?

410
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:51,840
Who the hell are you?

411
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,350
What are you doing here?

412
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,070
How did you know where we live?

413
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,640
- Please calm down-
- How did you know where we live?

414
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,200
I tailed you because I wanted to talk.

415
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:06,180
Talk about what?

416
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,480
Let's negotiate.

417
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,330
Negotiate what?

418
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,290
How much money you want...

419
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:16,150
Is it on a scale I can give you?

420
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:18,830
I'll do whatever it takes to get you the money.

421
00:53:18,830 --> 00:53:22,020
- Let's find a way-
- If you're f***ing messing with me,

422
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:25,280
I'll tell Woo One Group everything right away.

423
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,300
I beg of you.

424
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:32,710
L-Let's find a way to resolve this quietly.

425
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:38,220
How much do you want?

426
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:52,590
Obviously, the more, the better.

427
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,780
1 billion won.

428
00:53:55,780 --> 00:54:02,240
With that money, I can return to my country and live like a king.

429
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:07,070
I can't give you that much right now.

430
00:54:07,070 --> 00:54:11,060
If I could, I wouldn't even have followed you here.

431
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:15,710
Shit!

432
00:54:21,010 --> 00:54:22,930
Do you know what kind of person I am?

433
00:54:22,930 --> 00:54:26,260
Am I a joke to you? You've got the balls to have tailed me!

434
00:54:26,260 --> 00:54:29,370
Want me to kill your f***ing kid, too?

435
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:33,500
You didn't even bring the money I asked for. What bullshit is this?

436
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,600
Don't... do this...

437
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,540
Am I joke to you?

438
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:51,000
Who the hell are you?

439
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:27,910
He turned 21 years old this year.

440
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:32,310
I asked him what he wanted most for his birthday,

441
00:56:32,310 --> 00:56:34,470
and it was a motorcycle.

442
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:39,950
He said it could take him anywhere in the world he wanted to go.

443
00:56:39,950 --> 00:56:44,980
He said it was fun and exciting wherever he went.

444
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,710
You killed...

445
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:52,580
a boy like that.

446
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:57,100
It was an accident.

447
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,060
I had no choice.

448
00:57:06,350 --> 00:57:11,650
How could a judge manipulate and conceal a case?

449
00:57:11,650 --> 00:57:17,770
What could be the only way for me to survive when I've killed your son?

450
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,680
This morning,

451
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,560
your son, Kim Sang Hyeok, was caught.

452
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:40,720
For murdering Lee Sang Taek and three members of the Boodu Gang.

453
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:45,550
Maritime police caught him as he attempted to stow away.

454
00:57:53,350 --> 00:57:55,480
There's evidence, too.

455
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:59,850
A video captured by Lee Sang Taek's son, Lee Cheong Gang.

456
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:03,360
It's not only that.

457
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:08,060
The explosion of Lee Sang Taek's house. Even arson....

458
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:11,040
Your son, Kim Sang Hyeok, did all that.

459
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,970
If his charges are revealed,

460
00:58:13,970 --> 00:58:16,330
the death penalty would be inevitable.

461
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:28,960
I can...

462
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,020
get him a not-guilty verdict.

463
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,190
If you kill me now,

464
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:45,550
you'll also lose the chance...

465
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:49,740
to save your only remaining son.

466
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,910
Prove your promise.

467
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:42,280
W-Why are you doing this?

468
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:45,010
You're a judge!

469
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:48,430
H-How can a judge kill someone?

470
01:00:56,050 --> 01:01:00,620
Until my last breath, I'll never speak of H-Ho Yeong-

471
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:13,740
