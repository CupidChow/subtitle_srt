183
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,860
Believe me, I want to,

184
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,950
but it's not something I can control.

185
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:13,260
You have to.

186
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,500
You must do it, Judge Song.

187
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,850
We have more things to worry about.

188
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,570
Last night, your son

189
00:20:21,570 --> 00:20:25,030
met up with one of our kids.

190
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,890
He was looking for a gun.

191
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:31,410
I did some thinking after hearing that.

192
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,430
Why is your son looking for a gun?

193
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,930
What is he plotting this time?

194
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,290
Judge Song...

195
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:50,310
We always take light of matters we can cover up with our hands

196
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:53,270
and eventually, cover them up with our lives.

197
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,650
A gun...

198
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:02,090
- Did he get one?
- Who do you think I am?

199
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,660
Who do you think I am?

200
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,480
I stopped it so he can't get one.

201
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,750
However...

202
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,260
a person's mind always changes.

203
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,700
You've got to do better, Judge Song. Okay?

204
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,310
The evidence material the Prosecution submitted

205
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:37,120
lost a lot of its effectiveness as evidence.

206
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,270
Lee Cheong Gang's reversal of testimony...

207
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,400
Isn't this complicating the trial right now?

208
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,020
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong and Detective Jang Chae Rim kept

209
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,400
the witness with them under the guise of

210
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,670
a witness protection program, which has become problematic now.

211
00:21:51,670 --> 00:21:53,810
Regarding the witness protection program,

212
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:57,640
Assemblyman Jung Yi Hwa is pressing us, saying he'll publicize it.

213
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,010
Prosecutor Kang So Yeong also made a mistake, so...

214
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,730
Judge Song, why aren't you saying anything?

215
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,170
- Judge Song.
- Judge Song?

216
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,010
Yes?

217
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,090
Could you say something, please?

218
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:22,990
It's a complicated problem.

219
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,760
Let's give it some more thought and discuss it after.

220
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,050
Let's meet.

221
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:43,860
I'll do everything you people want, so let's meet right now.

222
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,760
This is Song Pan Ho.

223
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,210
There's a man wearing a blue jacket in the parking lot across the street.

224
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,670
He seems to be holding a grudge over a trial's results.

225
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:06,190
Please take care of him because he looks dangerous.

226
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:08,000
Excuse me.

227
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,160
What are you doing right now?

228
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,290
Come this way, please.

229
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,170
Ho Yeong.

230
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:30,970
An intentional car accident.

231
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,870
A murder that was planned

232
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:36,510
for six months and systematically executed.

233
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:39,340
Is that something that can stay hidden?

234
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,100
It's not true.

235
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,630
It can't be.

236
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:46,770
He's still too young.

237
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,410
It can't be.

238
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:51,170
It's not true.

239
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,220
What's the matter?

240
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,660
Why are you in such a hurry?

241
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:14,830
Don't you want to bring down Woo One Group?

242
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:20,530
Well, there's no better way to showcase the regime's power.

243
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,260
There's a way to bring down Chairman Kim Gang Heon and Woo One Group.

244
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,910
If I tell you the method, will you call me

245
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:33,570
into the Blue House before Kim Sang Hyeok's trial ends?

246
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:39,850
It's under the condition I enter the Blue House as soon as the trial ends.

247
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,370
If you'll promise me, I'll find Kim Sang Hyeok

248
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:45,690
guilty in the verdict.

249
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:14,550
This is the café where Detective Jang Chae Rim and Judge Song Pan Ho met.

250
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:19,880
There has been no signal after 9:28 p.m.

251
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,850
I should've gone with her then.

252
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,340
It can't be anything serious, right?

253
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,650
She went to meet no one other than

254
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:42,120
Judge Song Pan Ho, you know?

255
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,070
How many people can you utilize?

256
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,560
Three people? Okay.

257
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,920
Proceed unofficially for now until the trial ends.

258
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:55,410
Look up every CCTV and vehicle record nearby and bring them to me.

259
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,140
What brings you here?

260
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,190
How did you come in here?

261
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:19,420
I said there's something I must tell you regarding the trial.

262
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,780
You have something to tell the prosecutor right before the verdict hearing?

263
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,980
You're not that kind of a judge, sir.

264
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,670
Regarding Kim Sang Hyeok,

265
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:46,860
I plan to declare him guilty.

266
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:52,110
I don't know if you know, Prosecutor Kang,

267
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,370
but there's severe pressure from Woo One.

268
00:26:55,370 --> 00:27:00,200
The witness was bought, and I'm also getting threatened right now.

269
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,540
At this rate, Kim Sang Hyeok...

270
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,530
will be found not guilty.

271
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:10,000
We can't let that happen, can we?

272
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,860
What are you going to do?

273
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:16,040
I'm going to find Kim Sang Hyeok guilty

274
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:21,420
and become the Chief of Political Affairs at the Blue House.

275
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,640
Is that possible?

276
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,250
That's why I need your help.

277
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:34,100
Hand over all information you investigated

278
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:38,760
regarding the evil deeds Chairman Kim Gang Heon and Woo One Group committed

279
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,250
after Lee Sang Taek's hit-and-run incident.

280
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:49,150
I'll hand your research over to the Blue House tonight.

281
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:13,120
This is the case record Detective Jang Chae Rim, and I investigated so far.

282
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:22,150
You met Detective Jang Chae Rim two days ago, right?

283
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,810
I did, and?

284
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,090
Detective Jang Chae Rim can't be reached.

285
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,560
Well?

286
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,980
What time did you last see her?

287
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:48,370
We met around 9:00 p.m. and separated around 9:30 p.m.

288
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,770
What did you talk about?

289
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:55,240
She blackmailed me regarding the trial.

290
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,620
Was it because she was scared Kim Sang Hyeok would be

291
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:04,610
found not guilty since Lee Cheong Gang changed his testimony?

292
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,910
She blackmailed me with some nonsense.

293
00:29:07,910 --> 00:29:10,190
What kind?

294
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:14,620
That my son is the hit-and-run culprit.

295
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,060
And so?

296
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,720
What do you mean?

297
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,730
So, how did you part ways?

298
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,980
She spoke some complete nonsense.

299
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:30,530
So, I got mad at her and left.

300
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,170
Is that all?

301
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,100
Are you interrogating me right now?

302
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,480
Yes.

303
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:42,940
As a prosecutor.

304
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,940
That's rude.

305
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:51,200
The fact that Ho Yeong is the culprit

306
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,030
and the accident was caused on purpose...

307
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:01,480
We have evidence to back that up.

308
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,680
You'll have to manage this.

309
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,280
Judge Song Pan Ho?

310
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,460
Chief Secretary Kang Moon Seok sent me.

311
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,900
He told me to get some documents from you.

312
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:02,800
Why didn't Chief Secretary Kang come in person?

313
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,290
He had to join an urgent meeting.

314
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,340
How can I trust you?

315
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,230
I said I am.

316
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:18,440
He's in a meeting right now.

317
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:20,760
He probably won't answer his phone.

318
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:24,790
The call is not going through. You'll be connected to-

319
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:26,660
No.

320
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,200
I can't trust you.

321
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,790
Trust me.

322
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,660
It was very hard for me to come out in secret.

323
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,750
There's no time.

324
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,510
Forget it, then.

325
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,730
Lives are at stake here.

326
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,260
Please tell him to call me

327
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,150
as soon as he gets the documents.

328
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:58,740
Yes, I got it.

329
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,650
Give it to me.

330
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,060
Why are you here?

331
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:53,540
How is it going?

332
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,410
What?

333
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:58,890
Tomorrow's trial.

334
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,630
I'm going to find him guilty.

335
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:13,210
So...

336
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:16,520
don't do anything foolish.

337
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:26,900
[Secretary's Office]

338
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:44,200
I've reviewed the documents you sent me.

339
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,230
They're good...

340
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,580
but not good enough.

341
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:55,190
What else do you need?

342
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:58,500
We've done investigations on our end, too.

343
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:04,140
Chairman Kim Gang Heon's wife had done something, didn't she?

344
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,940
Arson and instigated murder...

345
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,400
If we can add those on top,

346
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:15,440
I think it'll be a good cause to oppress Woo One Group.

347
00:34:16,350 --> 00:34:20,480
It'll also look better when you come and take charge in person.

348
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,450
After finding the oldest son of Woo One guilty,

349
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:26,490
you left the legal field, and

350
00:34:26,490 --> 00:34:30,630
now use political power to punish evil.

351
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,600
Doesn't it look great?

352
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,070
Isn't what you have enough?

353
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:39,760
Chairman Kim Gang Heon has committed countless evil deeds so far.

354
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,110
I know. I know, but...

355
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,880
You need to know

356
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,800
he is just as powerful as well.

357
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,670
I'll send the documents you mentioned before sunrise.

358
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:03,900
I must hear a firm answer before Kim Sang Hyeok's verdict hearing tomorrow.

359
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,850
As soon as it's confirmed that I can enter the Blue House,

360
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,570
I plan to find Kim Sang Hyeok guilty.

361
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,220
Hello?

362
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,030
Let's meet.

363
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:58,930
- When?
- If possible, before sunrise.

364
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:04,250
Looks like you're in a hurry.

365
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:08,060
- Do you need something?
- Number one.

366
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,790
Evidence of Kim Gang Heon's wife's arson and instigated murder.

367
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,840
Number two.

368
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,930
I need to go meet you, CEO Jo.

369
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:19,770
But there's a Woo One employee spying on me right out the door.

370
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:25,120
Yes, I understand.

371
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,350
You can't park here.

372
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,600
- I already told them.
- I didn't hear anything, though.

373
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:28,130
What are you agonizing over?

374
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:30,350
It's all about to end now.

375
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:56,630
You didn't give a gun to Ho Yeong, right?

376
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,230
Of course not!

377
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:01,400
I told them to report to me if he came to our neighborhood.

378
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,910
So, don't worry.

379
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:06,260
Thank you.

380
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:10,160
I don't need you thanking me only in words anymore.

381
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:14,420
Chairman Kim Gang Heon isn't the only one I have intel on.

382
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:18,820
Yours is even more critical.

383
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,580
I'll keep that in mind.

384
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,530
How?

385
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,160
H-How did you know?

386
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:14,410
Didn't the Blue House's Chief Secretary show you some pictures?

387
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,570
There's another Chief of Political Affairs candidate.

388
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:22,360
They sent me these pictures.

389
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:34,280
We're the ones who sent him those pictures.

390
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:39,100
Moving the world means

391
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,900
you know everything

392
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:47,110
that's going on, Judge Song.

393
00:41:41,630 --> 00:41:44,580
This must've been your last-ditch effort, right?

394
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:51,730
Did you really believe you can bring me down with just this?

395
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:55,070
What on earth must I do

396
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:59,460
to end this?

397
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:08,450
That's what I want to ask.

398
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:15,530
Do you think everything came down to this because of me?

399
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:42,910
My son was going to turn himself in in the first place.

400
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,280
We were in front of the police station

401
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,820
when I realized the dead boy was your son and

402
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,930
I decided to hide him.

403
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:56,080
Ho Yeong was going to turn himself in.

404
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,480
I hid him away.

405
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:07,510
I'm the one who manipulated and intended to conceal the case.

406
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:11,110
It's all my fault.

407
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,850
I-I don't mind dying.

408
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:23,350
As long as you promise you'll spare my son,

409
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,240
I'll throw everything away.

410
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:30,100
I'm fine with that.

411
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,120
Just promise me you'll spare my son.

412
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,130
There's nothing I can do.

413
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,140
Besides trusting you,

414
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:47,390
there's nothing I can do anymore.

415
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:56,460
You also have children, so you understand how I feel, right?

416
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:00,700
Please understand me.

417
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,940
Please understand.

418
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,290
I-I'm sorry.

419
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,530
You brought it upon yourself.

420
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:56,210
I was in a hurry to overstep.

421
00:44:56,210 --> 00:45:01,500
I didn't kill a human being, but a principle!

422
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,810
I killed the principle,

423
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:08,170
but I didn't overstep,

424
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:10,560
I stopped on this side.

425
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:24,600
I was only capable of killing.

426
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:30,140
And it seems I wasn't even capable of that.

427
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:35,460
No, life is only given to me once

428
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:38,790
and I shall never have it again.

429
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:42,460
I don't want to wait for 'the happiness of all.'

430
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:45,100
I want to live myself,

431
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:50,210
[Verdict]
or else... better not live at all.

432
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,830
He walked on without resting.

433
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:11,380
He had a terrible longing for some distraction,

434
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,800
but he did not know

435
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:18,140
what to do, what to attempt.

436
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:22,660
New overwhelming sensation was gaining

437
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:28,250
more and more mastery over him every moment.

438
00:46:33,670 --> 00:46:35,160
What? What?

439
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,950
- What the f***?
- You scared?

440
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,150
Are you afraid?

441
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,000
Let go!

442
00:46:42,550 --> 00:46:46,950
Black and grimy and spiders in every corner,

443
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:50,970
and that's all eternity is?

444
00:46:50,970 --> 00:46:54,050
Prosecutor, file charges, please.

445
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:11,790
Your Honor, we're discussing a heinous crime in this court today.

446
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:16,500
Four innocent lives were sacrificed due to a fatal shooting

447
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,360
and their families and friends are in deep sorrow.

448
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:24,790
I request all of you today

449
00:47:24,790 --> 00:47:28,590
for a stern punishment of the law upon the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok.

450
00:47:28,590 --> 00:47:32,440
Surmising all evidence and testimony regarding this case,

451
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:36,050
the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok, is clearly guilty!

452
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,600
You are crying, sister,

453
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,870
but can you hold out your hand to me?

454
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,330
"Crime? What crime?"

455
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:11,270
he cried in sudden fury.

456
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:14,870
I charge the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok,

457
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:19,430
the maximum punishment allowed by law.

458
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:22,480
This will deliver a strong message that

459
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,390
our society doesn't tolerate crimes but protects the law and justice.

460
00:48:27,390 --> 00:48:31,320
And I hope it's a small consolation for the victims and their families.

461
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,800
- Was that a crime?
- Please bring a just judgment

462
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,830
- I am not thinking of it and
- on the defendant. That's all I request.

463
00:48:36,830 --> 00:48:39,780
I am not thinking of expiating it,

464
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:46,210
and why are you all rubbing it in on all sides? 'A crime! a crime!'

465
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:50,100
Let go!

466
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,930
Let go!

467
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:06,490
Kim Gang Heon... Where's Kim Gang Heon?

468
00:49:06,490 --> 00:49:08,700
Where is he?

469
00:49:09,770 --> 00:49:12,350
Kim Gang Heon!

470
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:25,020
Now that I have decided to face this superfluous disgrace.

471
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:29,520
It's simply because I am contemptible and have nothing in me.

472
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:39,350
Brother, brother, what are you saying?

473
00:49:39,350 --> 00:49:43,510
Why, you have shed blood?

474
00:49:43,510 --> 00:49:47,140
Cried Dounia in despair.

475
00:49:47,140 --> 00:49:50,920
Which all men shed.

476
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,120
He put in almost frantically.

477
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,960
The Prosecution submitted a testimony Kim Sang Hyeok was at the scene

478
00:49:57,960 --> 00:50:00,930
and a few pieces of physical evidence.

479
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:08,100
However, they are utterly inadequate in proving that Kim Sang Hyeok is the culprit.

480
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:14,880
Which flows and has always flowed in streams.

481
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,840
Which is spilt like champagne.

482
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,910
Look into it more carefully and understand it!

483
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:32,500
I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds,

484
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:38,000
thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity,

485
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,090
not stupidity even, simply clumsiness.

486
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:47,680
For the idea was by no means so stupid.

487
00:50:55,460 --> 00:50:58,100
The Prosecution is ignoring this important fact and

488
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:02,210
consistently trying to frame the defendant as the culprit.

489
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:04,910
Number four.

490
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:09,930
The intent the Prosecution suggested doesn't align with the defendant at all.

491
00:51:09,930 --> 00:51:15,200
The defendant has regularly been living a diligent and peaceful life

492
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,060
along with his father, Chairman Kim Gang Heon of Woo One Group.

493
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:23,400
It's difficult to understand rationally

494
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,990
the defendant would commit such an extreme crime.

495
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:31,590
Please make a judicious and fair decision.

496
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,290
The defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok, is not guilty.

497
00:51:38,830 --> 00:51:40,700
But I...

498
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:44,340
I couldn't carry out even the first step,

499
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:46,790
because I am contemptible,

500
00:51:49,490 --> 00:51:52,190
that's what's the matter!

501
00:51:54,830 --> 00:51:59,420
And yet I won't look at it as you do.

502
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:04,440
But now I'm trapped.

503
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:26,360
Are there any other processes you want to pursue or documents you want to submit?

504
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:57,470
[Police Line / Do Not Cross!]

505
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:16,560
Which flows and has always

506
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,250
flowed in streams.

507
00:53:20,250 --> 00:53:24,210
Which is spilt like champagne.

508
00:53:25,210 --> 00:53:27,340
I'll announce the verdict.

509
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:38,120
Regarding the shooting incident at the third pier of Daeyeon Port,

510
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:42,390
the witness' testimony largely opposes

511
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:47,480
objective evidence or other victim's witnesses.

512
00:53:48,810 --> 00:53:50,620
The evidence is also lacking,

513
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,330
so it's difficult to say the allegations were proven.

514
00:53:56,210 --> 00:54:01,470
As such, for case number 2024 F.C.* 4630...
(First trial, Criminal)

515
00:54:01,470 --> 00:54:04,650
the prosecutor's submitted evidence are

516
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:09,680
inadequate in proving the defendant's allegations as fact.

517
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:16,550
Therefore, the defendant, Kim Sang Hyeok,

518
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,220
is hereby found not guilty.

519
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:06,240
Judge Song Pan Ho!

520
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,980
Detective Jang Chae Rim...

521
00:56:24,910 --> 00:56:26,800
is dead.

522
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:45,460
Are you aware?

523
00:58:33,550 --> 00:58:36,310
[Freedom, Equality, Justice]

524
00:58:36,310 --> 00:58:38,830
There he comes!

525
00:58:38,830 --> 00:58:41,110
I'd like to deeply thank the fair trial

526
00:58:41,110 --> 00:58:45,400
and the judge's decision that created the fair trial...

527
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,080
What's after?

528
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:54,410
and the team of attorneys who...

529
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:57,470
protected my innocence to the end.

530
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:08,600
I know you killed Kim Sang Hyeon intentionally.

531
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,480
I'm not trying to do anything to you.

532
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,100
Oppa!

533
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,100
What's this?

534
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:22,140
My goodness!

535
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,450
Don't you want revenge?

536
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:33,460
Oppa, can I bring my boyfriend home this evening?

537
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,350
Do you know

538
00:59:35,350 --> 00:59:38,890
how many people died because of what you did?

539
00:59:38,890 --> 00:59:41,510
You must end this yourself.

540
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:45,930
[Kim Eun]

541
00:59:45,930 --> 00:59:49,640
Oppa, come to my house this evening

542
00:59:49,640 --> 00:59:53,040
and eat dinner with my dad, mom, and oldest oppa.

543
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,210
We agreed to eat dinner before my oldest oppa goes to the U.S.

544
00:59:56,210 --> 00:59:58,390
You should come, too, Oppa. Please?

545
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,790
Please come with me!

546
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,270
[Dad]

547
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:14,990
This is nuts!

548
01:00:14,990 --> 01:00:16,890
Why...

549
01:00:16,890 --> 01:00:21,270
and where all of this started...

550
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:23,880
Does Kim Gang Heon know?

551
01:00:26,260 --> 01:00:28,220
He doesn't, does he?

552
01:00:29,450 --> 01:00:31,470
I'm sure he doesn't know...

553
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,360
that it wasn't an accident

554
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,520
but a planned murder.

555
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:45,500
And how far out could that brat have planned?

556
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,420
No one would know.

557
01:00:49,420 --> 01:00:52,050
I'm sure he'll go to the end!

558
01:00:52,050 --> 01:00:55,200
Even to the place he mustn't go!

559
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:58,360
He'll end up going there.

560
01:01:02,650 --> 01:01:04,220
Put her in.

561
01:01:34,890 --> 01:01:39,650
[Your Honor]

562
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,680
♫ I'm breaking down to my voice ♫

563
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:54,020
♫ Thank God it feels like home ♫

564
01:01:54,020 --> 01:01:58,450
♫ A wicked is born in the dark ♫

565
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,700
♫ I never get it like that, mate ♫

566
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:05,150
♫ Why not me? You always get it all ♫

567
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:08,030
♫ It's not fair anymore ♫

568
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:10,500
He started planning it six months before the accident.

569
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,870
He must've approached my daughter, Eun, intentionally as well.

570
01:02:13,870 --> 01:02:16,520
Does he want to avenge his dead mom?

571
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:18,320
How dare he... Against me?

572
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:19,900
I'll take him away.

573
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,160
Please don't do anything.

574
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:24,620
Didn't we meet somewhere before?

575
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:26,380
Please... Not my son.

576
01:02:26,380 --> 01:02:28,180
H-Ho Yeong...

577
01:02:28,180 --> 01:02:29,660
I'll see this to the end.

578
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:32,680
Ho Yeong! Let me go! Ho Yeong!

579
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:35,830
No, I'm already at the end.
