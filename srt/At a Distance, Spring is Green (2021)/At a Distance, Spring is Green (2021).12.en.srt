🌿 [Last episode] 🍃

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,450
Excuse me.

3
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,100
Are you Senior Kim Hye Yoon from the Mass Communications Department?

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,970
I'm Yeo Joon, Business Administration, First Year.

5
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,680
Ah, Yeo Joon? I know you.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,500
I have something to tell you. Can you give me some of your time?

7
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,640
Okay. Let me hear what you have to say.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,650
What is Kim Hye Yoon like?

9
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,370
Something like the shock I got when I saw you first.

10
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,460
Is she also a psycho?

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,550
Ah, I just meant that she is that unique.

12
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:48,620
Anyway, did you cast her?

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,780
Hye Yoon wants to see the concept first.

14
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:54,970
Let's have the concept as a bright, passionate, and green youth.

15
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,270
Will there be any meaning in making a fantasy? Instead, it will be non-realistic.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,690
I also think that we have to make it a bit realistic.

17
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,980
Do you want to do hyper-realism?

18
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,660
This is a brand advertisement, not a documentary.

19
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:09,660
No one wants to see their hard reality even in an advertisement.

20
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:12,560
If this were a commercial advertisement then what you are saying may be right.

21
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,080
Only bringing out the happy side of youth that people want to see?

22
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,110
- But this is an assignment we're talking about.
- Does an assignment have to be so heavy?

23
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:23,210
Think about what our professor says every day.

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:27,120
Will expressing only the bright side of youth appeal properly?

25
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,170
It's enough if we get good energy and make it while having fun.

26
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,660
We don't really have to match professor Park's standards.

27
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,060
Our grades depend on this assignment.

28
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,370
You won't have the burden of grades because you are a freshman.

29
00:01:37,370 --> 00:01:39,400
Why does me being a freshman matter in this situation?

30
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,810
Group leader's words are also right. As you guys know,

31
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,740
I did mess up the previous project.

32
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:48,990
We have to do at least a bit better and compensate for it.

33
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:50,910
Me too.

34
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:56,450
But there are many cases of getting good results while enjoying the process.

35
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,140
We are not able to decide easily.

36
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:01,310
I have class so I'll get going.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,770
- I'll be late because I have my part-time job.
- I also won't be home.

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,100
Did something happen between you and Soo Hyun?

39
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:26,550
No. Our relationship is the best it has ever been.

40
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:33,640
Joon, reconsider Soo Hyun's opinion.

41
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,380
What? You were on my side earlier, right?

42
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:41,210
I am always on your side.

43
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,600
But I also want to do a

44
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,420
realistic one more than a bright one.

45
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:54,700
Me having a bright youth is only when I am with you.

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,840
Mine is also dark.

47
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,150
No. It was dark.

48
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:07,190
But later on, when we look back on these times,

49
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,550
won't we want to remember the bright side and erase the dark memories?

50
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,420
The hurt you is still you.

51
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,080
I want to abandon that kid.

52
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:20,930
Then I will have to pick that kid and put him in my pocket.

53
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:30,330
Won't it be uncomfortable with Soo Hyun at home?

54
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,150
Hey, we're cool.

55
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,140
Hyung is a bit short-tempered.

56
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:37,950
He isn't the petty type.

57
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,890
- You go first.
- No you go first.

58
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,750
- It's not that urgent for me.
- Same for me.

59
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:30,850
- You are older so...
- Why does age matter in pooping?

60
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:34,560
Okay. Then I'll go because I'm younger.

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,170
No, I'll go first.

62
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:47,610
It's a bit urgent.

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,860
I'm craving a late-night snack.

64
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,240
I'm craving a late-night snack.

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:18,460
Pizza? Chicken? Tteokbokki?

66
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,310
Ah, it's going to be tasty.

67
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,010
How far will the smell go?

68
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,580
It's a lot to eat alone.

69
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,810
There's no other way. I will have to throw out the leftovers.

70
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:52,610
What? I made it only for myself. This is only one serving.

71
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,220
This is one serving? You waste a lot.

72
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:01,450
Eat it.

73
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,760
If I just called you, you would have pretended to sleep.

74
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:15,930
- Why are you so sensitive about the assignment?
- Was I?

75
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:19,720
Is it really about the assignment or are you just against me?

76
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,350
I am against the dark and difficult concept.

77
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,820
It is weird that you are doing the assignment so sincerely.

78
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:26,730
That is right, but...

79
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:30,300
aren't you even tired of it? We had hard times.

80
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:35,070
- Does the assignment also have to be dark?
- That's more reason that we have to see the reality clearly.
- Can't we avoid that reality for some time?

81
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:38,820
There will be a day that we run away and when we come back, we are totally all right.

82
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:42,170
- We need to work hard even to heal wounds.
- I don't want to do that now.

83
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,000
Will you feel better by procrastinating?

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,830
- Yes, it might be better.
- I have lived a bit longer than you—

85
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,830
- Ah, Why does age come up here?
- Because you are a freshman—

86
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,360
Why does the word "freshman" come up here now? Are you a young boomer?

87
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,730
There are people who can't avoid reality, even if they want to.

88
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,700
There are people on the edge of the cliff, too.

89
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,380
You want us to have a misery battle?

90
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,750
- Do you want to?
- Why not!

91
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,860
Why are your faces like that?

92
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:24,020
What? Am I more handsome today?

93
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:27,140
Are you a narcissist or something?

94
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:31,430
What? Who? Me? Not you?

95
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,420
Did you perhaps fight all night?

96
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,100
Or did you leave me out and drink all night?

97
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:50,740
We ate tteokbokki all night.

98
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,810
Tteokbokki?

99
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,410
Yes, Goo Hyun.

100
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,960
He is so affectionate to his brother.

101
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,790
Are you jealous?

102
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:12,970
What... jealous?

103
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:15,660
We just don't match.

104
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:20,850
I hear a married couples quarrel is like cutting through water with a knife.
(T/N: easily mended fights)

105
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,490
Married couple?

106
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:33,250
Why is my ear so itchy?

107
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,050
Someone must be cursing you. So fix your personality.
(T/N: Korean superstition)

108
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:39,630
Why did you come when you don't even have the time to study?

109
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:41,110
What is that gift?

110
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:43,860
The gift is... me.

111
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,890
- You didn't waste money, right?
- No, I didn't.

112
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:57,470
This. Mom sent it through parcel post and asked me to give it to you.

113
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:59,230
What is this?

114
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,080
Dad's diary.

115
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,140
- Why this?
- Mom said you wanted to be a police officer like dad.

116
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:18,150
I didn't know. You always did part-time jobs to let me do what I wanted and to look after me.

117
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,180
That was a long time ago. Why did Mom tell you that?

118
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,400
Brother, you don't have to send my exam fee and Mom's daily expenses hereafter.

119
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,990
You also paid back dad's debt.

120
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:31,970
Why would you talk like that? I'm all right.

121
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:34,160
No. I'm not all right.

122
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,460
- You should also do what you want to do.
- Goo Hyun.

123
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:41,580
I've grown up. You raised me so handsomely.

124
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,620
Do you think it's too late to send me away?

125
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,380
I'm taking the photo.

126
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,530
What is that? Salute once.

127
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,920
Yes. That's cool! I'm taking the photo.

128
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,550
1, 2, 3.

129
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,350
You want to take a look?

130
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,310
My son is so handsome.

131
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,310
When did you grow up so much?

132
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,980
I will grow up more and wear matching uniforms with you.

133
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:26,440
Sure. Let's hold hands and take a big picture then.

134
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,900
We should hang a big picture of that here.

135
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,780
Where is Assistant Seol?

136
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:26,640
I wonder if it is because she is going to quit, she's not in her place mostly.

137
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,460
Quit? Who will quit?

138
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,480
Did you not know? Assistant Seol is getting married soon.

139
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:36,390
Marriage? With whom?

140
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:40,920
Well, with her boyfriend I guess. I heard that he is younger than her.

141
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,510
- Anyway, Professor, please take care of me.
- About what?

142
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:49,490
If Assistant Seol quits then I will...

143
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,390
Do you think you will obviously be the next one?

144
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:55,110
Of course. Is there anyone fit for this job other than me?

145
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,330
- Not you.
- What?

146
00:11:58,330 --> 00:12:00,650
How would I know what kind of lies you will tell?

147
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,490
What did I do?

148
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:05,690
You know very well, what.

149
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,370
What is this? It's nameless.

150
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,320
Ah, that is mine.

151
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,730
If you need it, you can use it any time.

152
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:20,630
- That is...
- A lie gives birth to another lie.

153
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:23,720
If that is how you get by in life, you'll never be able to stop that.

154
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:26,930
Fix it at least for now, it isn't too late.

155
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:36,540
Joon.

156
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,880
[Incoming call: Father]

157
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:57,460
You go first, I have to take this call.

158
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,290

- Then since we've all told our stories—
- I still haven't.

00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:28,480
[General shopping mall for the people in their 20's MM
"What is youth...?"

316
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,590
[Nam Soo Hyun, Kim So Bin, Yeo Joon, Park Hye Ji, Oh Chun Gook, Han Jung Ho]

317
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:34,910
So, our group has decided to present

318
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:36,450
a promotional video for MM, a general shopping mall

319
00:24:36,450 --> 00:24:39,190
that respects a wide range of personalities.

320
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:41,160
Here's the plot of the story.

321
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:44,150
The two characters who portray the bright and dark side of youth accordingly,

322
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:47,330
are totally different from head to toe.

323
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,230
Personality, taste, and background.

324
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,350
Everything.

325
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,560
They keep fighting because they can't understand each other.

326
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,750
Then they realize...

327
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,880
that the other person is just different from them.

328
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,220
That they are not wrong.

329
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:08,500
The two characters, who are so different from one another, meet in one world

330
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:11,250
and fight and hurt each other,

331
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,950
until they eventually get to love each other.

332
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,820
Let's watch the video.

333
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:23,090
Good times it is.

334
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:25,310
Don't talk like you have lived your entire life.

335
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,580
You can also make good times for yourself.

336
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,410
There is no way.

337
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:31,410
Will there really not be a way?

338
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,300
Do you think you get good people on your side so easily?

339
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,210
There is someone on your side, for sure.

340
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,550
For sure?

341
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:41,630
- Because you are a good person.
- Because you are a good person.

342
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:44,150
- Talk only the truth.
- Okay.

343
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:46,060
Talk only the truth.

344
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:49,220
If I tell only the truth, will you listen to me?

345
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,410
A good person on your side,

346
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,760
I'll be that person.

347
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,260
What?

348
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,680
You must be thinking "Who is this bastard?", right? I'm a BA first year, Yeo Joon.

349
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,980
It's because I want to be close with you.

350
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:05,450
I might turn out to be a good guy once you get to know me.

351
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:07,900
Go, I have no intention of getting to know you.

352
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,420
- Do you hate me that much?
- Yes.

353
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,270
Wow! Your reply was so fast.

354
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,900
I think you are clinging onto me because you can't have your way with me.

355
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,470
There are things in this world that you can't have your way with.

356
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:24,110
♫ ...and awkwardly smiled ♫

357
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:27,220
Here. This is my daily wage.

358
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,530
It's not even enough to buy the meal you just had.

359
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:32,710
We can't get close,

360
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:34,430
nor do we have the need to.

361
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,740
You won't understand me even if you die and come back to life.

362
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,750
Do you have a complex about not having money?

363
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:43,520
Do you perhaps think that you are the only one unhappy, not knowing anyone else's story?

364
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,760
So you distance yourself from others and hurt innocent people.

365
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,450
You aren't such a pitiful person, right?

366
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:52,600
How will you compensate for trampling on my heart?

367
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,320
Call it even with you annoying me.

368
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,340
I'll do what I do the best.

369
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,220
You also do what you are best at.

370
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,160
What is it that you are the best at?

371
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,950
Clinging onto people.

372
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:06,180
Do you know when I feel pathetic?

373
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:09,270
When I don't have money,

374
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,130
so I can't protect what is precious to me.

375
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,300
How about making the lie I said into the truth?

376
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:18,670
Let's live together.

377
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,770
If someone told you hellish words,

378
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:27,170
their hearts are the ones in hell.

379
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:29,650
You don't have to believe it as it is.

380
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,310
Even if

381
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:34,560
those are your parents' words.

382
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:39,450
♫ You were the way for me ♫

383
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:45,550
♫ Even when no one understood ♫

384
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:50,120
♫ You were the only one who reached out to me ♫

385
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,540
♫ Like the sun shining on the moon ♫

386
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:56,380
[Thank you]
♫ You were always there smiling for me ♫

387
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:59,740
Adults tell us sometimes,

388
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:02,870
"Don't waste time in relationships."

389
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,570
"Cut the friendship of the people who you don't match with."

390
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,820
"Don't devote yourself to anyone."

391
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:10,340
"All of that is of no use once you get older."

392
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,060
"All things yield to friends, family, or money."

393
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,720
One day, we might even be the ones telling that to others

394
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,920
when we get older.

395
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,730
But they, too, will live a life

396
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:27,140
where during their youth, people matter to them,

397
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
so they will continue to love each other,

398
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,220
get hurt,

399
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,770
love again,

400
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:34,700
and get hurt again,

401
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,570
not being able to go to sleep at night. Haven't you?

402
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:41,470
We have defined youth,

403
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:43,510
as the time when you can be brave,

404
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:47,770
meeting anyone and befriending them, with no barriers to cross and without anything to fear.

405
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:50,500
Even if we might end up regretting it one day,

406
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:53,360
we will continue to live, during this youth of ours,

407
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:56,910
loving, getting hurt,

408
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,200
and loving again, with all our might.

409
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,980
♫ Even when the world turns its back at me ♫

410
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:21,590
♫ All I need if you to be there for me ♫

411
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:32,870
Nice.

412
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,820
How did you all feel working with the same teammates?

413
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,400
Do you still think that it is the worst?

414
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,820
- Do you still believe in people's evil nature?
- No.

415
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:46,670
- That's good.
- Excuse me.

416
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:48,790
- Professor.
- Yes, Kim So Bin.

417
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:53,490
Is it okay for me to show an extra video?

418
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,380
About what?

419
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,530
I'll take it.

420
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,300
Get some rest.

421
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,410
Let's do it together!

422
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,010
♫ Spring, spring, spring, spring has come ♫

423
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,560
Focus on Hope.

424
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,670
Don't argue.

425
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:23,840
♫ The tree next to the bench ♫

426
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,840
♫ that you sat on is still there ♫

427
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,950
This is nice.

428
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,460
- Oh, wow!
- Senior!

429
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,340
- That's good.
- You have this.
- No, no.

430
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:39,950
- I'm fine.
- You have it.

431
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:42,250
Joon, you have this.

432
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,560
I'm fine, it's okay.

433
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:48,210
Senior, you take this. I have another.

434
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:51,380
Oh, it's coming out good.

The highest grade for this assignment is given to

437
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:31,000

441
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,820
What is the reason? I am curious about the basis of grading.

442
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,840
Basis of grading.

443
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:54,780
Coordination with the teammates?

444
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:58,670
Different people coming together to make one result.

445
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:04,410
I gave the highest grade to the team who expressed how well their coordination was.

446
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,460
Is there any problem?

I have something to tell you.

453
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,020
I know, you are getting married.

454
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,990
So, you know.

455
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,430
Here, Professor.

456
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:51,390
You have hidden it well all this while.

457
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:54,140
You just had no interest in me.

458
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,540
Now that you are going to quit, you are saying all sorts of things.

459
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,110
Assistant Seol, how old are you?

460
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:03,250
- Twenty-eight.
- Twenty-eight?

461
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:06,500
Na Young.

462
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,980
Yes.

463
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:11,180
Professor, you know my name.

464
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:14,730
Why are you getting married at such an early age?

465
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:19,390
Because I love my boyfriend very much.

466
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:24,340
Yes, I also loved a lot and got married and that didn't turn out well.

467
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:30,910
- Can't you just congratulate me?
- No.

468
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,600
Look at you all excited.

469
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,190
Why are you so happy today?

470
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:44,860
Students had to do presentations for their assignments. They all did very well so I'm happy.

471
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,370
They have matured a lot in such a short time.

472
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:50,960
It must be good for you. Being happy with such things.

473
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,350
- You also were like that.
- I was?

474
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,770
When we were in college.

475
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:59,080
You were always passionate and would come forward and take care of everything.

476
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,860
You might have been what the kids these days call an "outsider,"

477
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,670
but do you know how cool you were in my eyes?

478
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,850
You are talking about the old days.

479
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:08,120
You have changed a lot.

480
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,230
Time has flown, I have to change.

481
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,470
Then, should I stay that immature self?

482
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:17,460
I am the same as back then.

483
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,210
I haven't thrown my hope away.

484
00:34:21,210 --> 00:34:26,310
I believe that that amazing and cool senior will come back someday.

485
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:27,540
There is no way that will happen.

486
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,360
You are my role model, I can't give up easily.

487
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:35,090
I wanted to become like our department's head, Song Soo Kyeong.

488
00:34:37,990 --> 00:34:39,750
Park Shi Jae.

489
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:43,450
Do you have plans after college?

490
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,000
- Why?
- Well,

491
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,330
do you want to eat with me?

492
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,260
I don't know.

493
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:00,180
I won't ask you twice.

494
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,300
Park Shi Jae, let's eat together.

495
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,610
Park Shi Jae, let's eat together.

496
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:17,650
Wow, it's really possible to get the highest grade.

497
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:21,210
It's my first time getting the highest grade for an assignment since I entered this school.

498
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,040
But who shot the making film?

499
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,990
- Hye Yoon.
- I just sent it to you. Check your messages.

500
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:36,510
I also have a making film of the project I did.

501
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:40,260
Later when I saw it, it was a nice memory and I could recall it.

502
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,210
We have worked hard.

503
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:50,740
If you focus and do your best with the process,

504
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:55,360
you don't focus on the result but still get good results.

505
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,060
That was the case for me.

506
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,370
Thank you.

507
00:35:59,370 --> 00:36:03,770
I always had too many worries to enjoy what I did.

508
00:36:03,770 --> 00:36:07,240
Thank you, too. I also had a nice time.

509
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,670
I think we shouldn't believe rumors without evidence.

510
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:12,920
It wasn't true for Hye Yoon

511
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,540
and Soo Hyun.

512
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:21,810
Once you get to know them, being an undefeatable psycho is just a rumor?

513
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:24,370
But part of the rumor was true.

514
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,740
Let's reveal each other's Manitos and finish it up.

515
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,940
You reveal it first.

516
00:36:32,740 --> 00:36:34,270
Are you asking because you don't know?

517
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,970
I did so much for you.

518
00:36:36,970 --> 00:36:38,360
What?

519
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:44,000
I thought I didn't have a Manito.

520
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,450
What?

521
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,010
The day you were almost late for morning class, I woke you up at least thrice.

522
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,680
- Please.
- But you didn't wake up.

523
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,860
When you were not home,

524
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,110
I cleaned the bathrooms fully.

525
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:11,880
It was very difficult but I didn't complain at all.

526
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,840
Also, I prayed for you and So Bin to date for a long time without breaking up.

527
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,140
[Youth Villa]

528
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:29,730
I told you my key points to get good grades, but

529
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:33,360
you didn't know I was telling you such precious things and you didn't even listen properly.

530
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,090
Joon, these are the key points to get good grades.

531
00:37:36,090 --> 00:37:38,620
Write everything the teacher says in your notebook.

532
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,540
Then go home and read it thoroughly, and then

533
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:46,990
mark the important points. During the exam period, if you just look at the marked points, it will be easy for you to study.

534
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,580
And I saved you a seat for class, but you didn't sit.

535
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,620
Wow! Wow!

536
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:08,420
I didn't know you could talk so much.

537
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,230
Hey, Nam Soo Hyun, so you were serious about the Manito.

538
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:17,030
Then let's cheer for the happiness of my Manito, Nam Soo Hyun who has worked so hard.

539
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,670
Shall we all cheer?

540
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,670
Cheers!

541
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:35,650
I didn't hate you because I wanted to.

542
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,280
I also just wanted to be loved.

543
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:44,780
Hye Ji, drink water.

544
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:51,620
I started my YouTube channel because my dream was to be a movie director,

545
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,680
but there aren't many subscribers and there are a lot of hate comments.

546
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,960
I don't have skills or money.

547
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:02,840
I was living just fine,

548
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:06,730
but I saw you working so hard for everything.

549
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:10,580
I was envious of you and I was also annoyed.

550
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,580
I also found myself pathetic.

551
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,530
It was all my inferiority complex.

552
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:19,070
I am sorry.

553
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:21,010
I'm sorry.

554
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,940
Why aren't you guys talking to me about your worries?

555
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,890
Joon, it doesn't feel nice to do that with you.

556
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,680
Because you are too well off.

557
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,900
Senior, tell me also.

558
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,920
Soo Hyun can't relate to others' stories.

559
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,540
Is he called the undefeatable psycho for no reason?

560
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:58,360
What? What? I am right.

561
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,040
Did I say something wrong?

562
00:40:16,490 --> 00:40:18,390
Hong Chan Ki.

563
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,180
- Why is your face like that?
- So Bin.

564
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:27,650
What are you going to say now?

565
00:40:27,650 --> 00:40:29,330
I'm leaving.

566
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,380
I'm going into the military.

567
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,750
- When?
- Soon.

568
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:54,990
This is a bit sudden.

569
00:40:54,990 --> 00:40:56,690
Are you upset?

570
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:03,500
There has never been a time that we were separated.

571
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:07,190
Yes... we weren't.

572
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,640
Thank you, So Bin.

573
00:41:11,230 --> 00:41:14,100
I never said that to you.

574
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,430
Thank you, Kim So Bin.

575
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,670
Why are you talking as if you are going away forever?

576
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,090
You stayed by my side and listened to what I had to say

577
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:30,390
and comforted me. It's all thanks to you

578
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,340
that I grew up feeling warm and never once feeling lonely.

579
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:36,340
I only realized it after we got distant.

580
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,640
What was I thinking,

581
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,190
living like that?

582
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:44,030
I guess I stayed in the grass field

583
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:46,860
you made me and cluelessly ran around.

584
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,640
Being alone at my lowest,

585
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,420
I don't know what to do.

586
00:41:59,970 --> 00:42:01,930
But I will find out.

587
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,850
Me without you.

588
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:06,690
The real me.

589
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:10,020
I'm going to look for it.

590
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:12,970
You will be able to find it.

591
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,390
You are a guy who does what he says.

592
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:18,420
As expected,

593
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,080
you know me better than I do.

594
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,430
Just don't leave suddenly,

595
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,760
- contact me before you leave.
- Will you throw me a party?

596
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,720
I'll buy you pork belly you like so much.

597
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,670
Can I...

598
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,180
hug my friend Kim So Bin just once?

599
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:49,400
♫ We call this the end ♫

600
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:58,330
♫ Other people probably do too ♫

601
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:00,940
- So Bin, close your eyes.
- Huh?

602
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:03,950
I will run away without looking

603
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,440
back after counting to three.

604
00:43:07,070 --> 00:43:08,620
Don't look at my face.

605
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:10,780
Never.

606
00:43:10,780 --> 00:43:13,580
- Why?
- Promise me.

607
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:18,500
One.

608
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:20,170
Two.

609
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:25,340
Three.

610
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:33,160
♫ warmer and much smaller than I thought ♫

611
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,770
♫ I felt sorry (I felt sorry) ♫

612
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:38,000
♫ and hoped it ♫

613
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:44,810
♫ wouldn't be the end ♫

614
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:48,390
Soo Hyun.

615
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,690
This is somewhat different from usual.

616
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:55,690
You too.

617
00:43:55,690 --> 00:43:57,800
Did you drink?

618
00:43:58,990 --> 00:44:02,820
Yes. At the after-party for our project.

619
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:08,450
- Soo Hyun.
- If you say my name again that will be the tenth time.

620
00:44:10,370 --> 00:44:13,180
I know that you knew that

621
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:15,130
I liked you.

622
00:44:16,700 --> 00:44:19,650
I know what it means that you haven't done anything,

623
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,840
although you knew.

624
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,910
I know,

625
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:28,220
but I couldn't give up.

626
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,330
I want to give up now.

627
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,670
I think it was a habit.

628
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,050
And because habits are hard to fix,

629
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,060
I've been avoiding doing so.

630
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:49,940
I can only hear that you are saying you won't meet me.

631
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,370
How can I cut you off, you fool.

632
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:58,380
You should cut off a guy like me.

633
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:00,830
You're too good for me.

634
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,880
I know.

635
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,870
But, Soo Hyun,

636
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:12,730
if there is another time that you like

637
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:16,040
a person but do not have the leisure to,

638
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,540
make sure you grab onto her.

639
00:45:24,150 --> 00:45:26,190
If you miss the timing,

640
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:28,830
it won't come back to you.

641
00:45:36,490 --> 00:45:38,900
You seem like you are going to go away.

642
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,330
I will stay away from you,

643
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:46,130
but I don't know if I can live without seeing you forever.

644
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:50,480
That I will decide. If I decide to stay your friend,

645
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,680
you can't go anywhere.

646
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:56,050
Where will I go?

647
00:45:56,050 --> 00:45:59,300
Wait for me patiently.

648

♫ A word that make my weary heart flutter 'now' ♫

♫ fades away like a morning shower ♫

652
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:22,670
Hey, girl with a story.

653
00:46:22,670 --> 00:46:25,460
- Is this also a coincidence?
- Is this fate?

654
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:27,330
I wanted to go for a midnight run,

655
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,080
someone is already doing this.

656
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:30,910
I will win against you.

657
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:34,000
- I'm a sportswoman.
- And I'm a wanted man.

658
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,370
Running away is my expertise.

659
00:46:53,590 --> 00:46:56,030
Why are you running like that at night?

660
00:46:56,030 --> 00:46:57,840
You?

661
00:46:57,840 --> 00:46:59,550
I wanted to cry so I ran.

662
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:01,890
To say it's sweat when it's actually tears?

663
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:03,630
You too?

664
00:47:05,010 --> 00:47:08,250
I continued to run on a track with no finish line,

665
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:10,020
while only looking forward.

666
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:14,660
- That must be exhausting.
- So I just drew the finish line myself.

667
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,770
- Now I'm going to rest.
- Yes,

668
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,960
you can only run again if you rest.

669
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,610
Will I be able to run again?

670
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:26,550
Yes, of course.

671
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,910
If this is the end, then it will be heartbreaking.

672
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:35,040
I will set straight what wasn't,

673
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:37,460
and walk alone properly.

674
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:39,130
Alone?

675
00:47:39,130 --> 00:47:41,700
One can learn to walk well with someone

676
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:45,950
once they know how to walk alone.

677
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:48,820
You also know how to say useful things.

678
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,750
Did you not know?

679
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,880
So, look at what I do

680
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,050
and you also get up and run.

681
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,850
Is that so? Then shall we run?

682
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,670
Bet on drinks?

683
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:23,810
Did you meet Young Ran noona well?

684
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,980
Yes.

685
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,100
Did you walk So Bin back safely?

686
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:31,070
Of course.

687
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,550
Then, shall we have some more drinks?

688
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:38,310
Go up first, I'll buy some beer and come.

689
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,560
I didn't mean it.

690
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,000
Nam Soo Hyun wants a second round.

691
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,630
Nam Soo Hyun wants a second round. Woohoo!

692
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,680
Be quiet.

693
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,350
- There must be some beer in the fridge.
- There isn't.

694
00:48:50,350 --> 00:48:53,090
Ah, right. I forgot to say one thing.

695
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:55,250
I cleaned the fridge fully.

696
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:58,030
I threw away the food that you ordered too

697
00:48:58,030 --> 00:49:00,730
much of and wasted.

698
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:07,080
What would I have done without my Manito?

699
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,050
Let's keep doing it, Manito.

700
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:12,050
- How about we renew the contract.
- No.

701
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,640
Why won't you?

702
00:49:13,640 --> 00:49:16,010
Then, do you want to be my Manito?

703
00:49:16,010 --> 00:49:18,230
That... I don't want to.

704
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:20,160
You don't want to, then why would I?

705
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,600
[Youth Villa]

706
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:32,620
I got my dad's diary that he wrote when he was young from my mother.

707
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:34,860
Diary?

708
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,800
It seems like my mom found it when she was organizing things.

709
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,250
I read it all.

710
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:45,610
You shouldn't read your dad's secrets.

711
00:49:45,610 --> 00:49:47,980
Not even if you are his son.

712
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:52,720
They are secrets because I didn't know those things.

713
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:03,710
Dad also worried a lot and

714
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:07,350
lived with pain and difficulty at my age.

715
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:12,730
He wanted to be the best dad.

716
00:50:12,730 --> 00:50:16,400
I always resented my dad but

717
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:24,770
I actually wanted to become a police officer like my dad.

718
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:26,700
Oh, I just imagined it.

719
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:30,480
A very right and just

720
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,390
police officer Nam Soo Hyun who never tolerates injustice.

721
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,410
My father was that kind of a policeman.

722
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:46,240
He spent his life for others till the end and died in an accident.

723
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:50,290
So I threw away my dream.

724
00:50:50,290 --> 00:50:54,840
Why did you throw it away? You can just make your own ending.

725
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:57,160
Look at you, all grown up.

726
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:00,290
I would have said cool things then and now.

727
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:02,340
"Annoying."

728
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,860
I don't remember anything other than this.

729
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:10,200
I have hurt you.

730
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,610
You still remember it.

731
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:16,560
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

732
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:21,610
Is there something you want to be?

733
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:25,560
I don't know for sure.

734
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:31,060
I did what I wanted to do at the moment when I had a hard time,

735
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,780
but I don't think they were things I actually wanted to do.

736
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:36,360
You can find it at least now.

737
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,160
There are many things you are good at.

738
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,980
I do have a lot that I'm good at.

739
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,820
What should I start with?

740
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:47,330
When the holidays start...

741
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:49,980
During the holidays...

742
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,840
shall we go out and have fun? Let's all go camping.

743
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:58,240
I am going to my uncle's place where my mom is.

744
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,560
To take care of my mom, too.

745
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:05,180
Only during the holidays?

746
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:09,450
I might also go back and live with my mom.

747
00:52:13,820 --> 00:52:16,180
I was thankful for all that you did.

748
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,640
This is all I can tell you.

749
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,620
Should I cry?

750
00:52:26,620 --> 00:52:29,230
Is it the end if we don't live together?

751
00:52:29,230 --> 00:52:34,220
Because there is no relationship that lasts forever.

752
00:52:34,220 --> 00:52:36,180
We'll get distant.

753
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:43,380
Once we do, I'll just come closer to you.

754
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,350
See how arrogant I act.

755
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:51,580
Do it moderately.

756
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,820
I don't want to. I will get my revenge.

757
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:07,800
I am an adult who can give and take sincerity.

758
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:12,040
Because of the people who love me.

759
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:13,870
Why not?

760
00:53:17,410 --> 00:53:20,120
- What?
- What's what?

761
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,900
Get up.

762
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:49,020
Yeo Joon.

763
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,560
I'm sorry.

764
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:01,550
I'll do it.

765
00:54:03,530 --> 00:54:04,920
You smiled?

766
00:54:04,920 --> 00:54:07,020
Wasn't it cold?

767
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:09,490
Ice is cold, should it be hot?

768
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:11,010
Thank god.

769
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:12,750
Thank god?

770
00:54:12,750 --> 00:54:15,740
No, I didn't mean that this is good. Anyway, I'm sorry.

771
00:54:15,740 --> 00:54:18,120
I think we should get this washed first.

772
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:19,000
It's okay.

773
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,470
♫ I think about you every day ♫

774
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:22,710
It's because I am not okay.

00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,830

- Laundry fees: 10,000 won.

778
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:31,630
Transport and time fee: 400,000 won. New pants: 550,000 won.

779
00:54:31,630 --> 00:54:34,040
Pants at 550,000 won?
($550)

780
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:36,130
Do you think money grows on trees?

781
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:39,180
I have a naturally cold body, so ice is really the worst for me.

782
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,180
I should go get a medical check-up.

783
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:44,860
Just think you had a cool shower, it's a hot day.

784
00:54:44,860 --> 00:54:46,360
Aren't you going overboard?

785
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,400
What? What about you?

786
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,060
Did you guys fight again? You guys come to college for this only, right?

00:54:57,960 --> 00:55:00,000
Thank you, So Bin.

790
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,490

Senior Soo Hyun spilled coffee on me.

794
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,280
I'm going to become a judge.

795
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:18,550
What? Did you just decide that?

796
00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:22,380
You guys always fight and ask me to judge it. I can't do it anymore.

797
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:25,400
It was at least 2% more of Senior Soo Hyun's fault.

798
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:26,620
2%?

799
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,490
What?

00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,770
There's one left, do you want it?

801
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:45,290
I have bought her coffee sometimes, so I have the right.

802
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,390
I am the senior.

803
00:55:48,660 --> 00:55:51,900
Take this, I haven't had any yet.

804
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,000
Can I?

805
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:57,770
This is the precious coffee that Senior Nam Soo Hyun bought for me.

806
00:55:57,770 --> 00:55:59,920
Thank you.

807
00:56:06,190 --> 00:56:08,390
"Thank you."

808
00:56:11,420 --> 00:56:13,520
You are almost at the end of the third year.

809
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:17,320
- Time does flow fast.
- Yes.

810
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:22,320
I also nagged you guys all year to take care of yourselves.

811
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,130
I also feel sorry,

812
00:56:24,130 --> 00:56:29,860
but I think I didn't tell you guys to think about yourselves.

813
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:33,480
Living life, that is the most important.

814
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,500
Knowing who I truly am.

815
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:42,460
That is how I can meet the people I like and find what I want to do.

816
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:44,260
That is why...

817
00:56:44,260 --> 00:56:46,070
That is an assignment from now on.

818
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:47,670
It can also not be an assignment.

819
00:56:47,670 --> 00:56:50,820
The assignment for this semester is...

820
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:53,690
I should only listen to my girlfriend.

821
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:59,420
This will also help you to apply for jobs and help you know yourself.

822

[Portfolio]

823
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,870
Make a portfolio of yourself.

824
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,990
There isn't any set format, so feel free to write what you'd like.

825
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,480
- Professor.
- Yes?

826
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:16,850
Can we think of this as a free-form personal statement?

827
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,700
Personal statement?

828
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,630
Personal statements are written to appeal ourselves to others.

829
00:57:22,630 --> 00:57:25,170
Of course, I'll get to see what you write.

830
00:57:25,170 --> 00:57:28,490
But this is a kind of "self-exploration."

831
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:30,930
Looking deep into yourself.

832
00:57:30,930 --> 00:57:34,370
What you like, what you dislike, and what you are good at,

833
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:37,850
and who you like.

834
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,820
Professor Song is very human.

835
00:57:42,820 --> 00:57:46,400
No way. Is something troubling her?
