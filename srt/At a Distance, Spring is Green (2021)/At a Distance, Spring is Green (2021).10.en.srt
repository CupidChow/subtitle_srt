1
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:04,020
Why did you not tell me this before?!

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,730
Because I am your brother.

3
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:21,190
You should have let me at least not hate you.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:26,080
You should have let me at least rely on you!

5
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,830
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:52,080
The only method of protecting you from Father was by doing what he wanted me to do.

7
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,020
While doing as he said, I lost track of how hard it must have been on you.

8
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,470
Why did you live like that? For what?

9
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:05,840
Every person has their role in life.

10
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:09,420
I chose this life.

11
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,090
That is what I believed was the best. And I'll continue to do so.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,410
This is my role. It's not related to you.

13
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:24,290
You live your life freely.

14
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,140
The freedom that I get after stomping all over your life?

15
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,920
I'm fine.

16
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,410
I'll drop you home. Let's go.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,620
Thank you...

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,310

Good night.

I have hope again.

Even if I get hurt again,

34
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,050
I have no other way but to have hope.

35
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,690
Professor, why do we like people?

36
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,620
I don't want to do difficult things.

37
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,420
Wasting your feelings on dating?

38
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:55,820
You're going to say it's all of no use, right?

39
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,020
No.

40
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,630
It's better to waste some feelings at your age.

41
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,800
It does hurt even in our age.

42
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,830
I know that it hurts.

43
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,500
But it isn't nice

44
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,600
doing that after aging.

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,190
We can't follow our hearts and we have a lot to think about,

46
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,150
we have to walk on eggshells... it's not nice.

47
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:21,960
There is no age for dating. My grandmother also dates someone.

48
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,720
Your grandmother is cool.

49
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,780
I hope Joon isn't in trouble.

50
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,810
He'll handle it well.

51
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:39,920
Excuse me, Professor.

52
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:45,190
- Yes, tell me, Soo Hyun.
- The soup and rice last time was delicious.

53
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,460
I was also thankful for your advice.

54
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,120
It helped me a lot.

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,310
Are you okay now?

56
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:58,560
I wanted to ask you but restrained myself because I didn't want to burden you.

57
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,680
I have received my friend's help.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,090
Good job.

59
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,950
Where is Joon?

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,340
Joon went because he had some urgent work.

61
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,300
He left?

62
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:20,020
I thought of calling Professor Yeo.

63
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,560
Professor Yeo Joon Wan?

64
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,320
It's nice if we all get close. Considering his brother is here, I thought he might come.

65
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,500
Why are you here?

66
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,540
I should sleep at home.

67
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,870
Did everyone come back?

68
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
Yeah.

69
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,640
I feel like the trip has been cut short because of me.

70
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,110
We did have fun.

71
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,760
Then I feel more sorry.

72
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:14,310
Did you talk it out?

73
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,100
You're asking me first? I'm touched.

74
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,360
There.

75
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:31,060
Let me go too.

76
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,810
Let's go there.

77
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,160
I told everyone that I was a single child

78
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,010
since I was a kid.

79
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,490
Why?

80
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:53,240
Because I hated my brother. But that was of no use.

81
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,520
Even though our age difference was big,

82
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,440
the whole school knew me as Yeo Joon Wan's brother.

83
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,260
I was always compared with my successful brother.

84
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:10,120
The brother the people see him as was there.

85
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:14,460
But my real brother wasn't there.

86
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,170
One day my brother told me,

87
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,600
"You don't have a family."

88
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:27,880
"You don't have a brother or parents."

89
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,160
I don't know

90
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,070
why he did that to me,

91
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:38,460
and how he lived like that.

92
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,970
I can't understand.

93
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:49,060
I also didn't understand you at first.

94
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:54,610
- I should be the one saying that.
- Why is it easy for you to spend money?

95
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:58,410
Why you acted all nice to people,

96
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,360
why you clung onto me and didn't let go.

97
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,760
Why you were so picky. Why you had to complain about the world.

98
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,640
Why you see yourself as a lacking person when everyone likes you.

99
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,530
I did see myself as lacking.

100
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,700
I still feel like I'm lacking in many things.

101
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,110
You think I don't?

102
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:30,900
There will be a day that

103
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:37,260
you and your brother will talk about the past saying,

104
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,940
"Why were we like that?"

105
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:46,400
Will such a day come so easily?

106
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:53,700
It will. It will surely come.

107
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,020
So, what do you think you lack?

108
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,190
Do you want to spend the whole night talking?

109
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,880
What is it?

110
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,970
Tell me just three.

111
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:17,490
Even I have a lot inside.

112
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,960
Please?

113
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:33,020
Joon, did you talk well with your brother?

114
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:34,890
What happened?

115
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,160
Fold your finger if the person you like is here.

116
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,500
It must be Mi Joo.

117
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:17,540
It must be Young Ran unni.

118
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,530
Senior! Senior! Senior! Senior!

119
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:25,060
Let's go together.

120
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:27,720
Just give me five minutes.

121
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,370
But... are you really going to go out like that?

122
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:33,810
Why?

123
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:39,630
You didn't sleep well yesterday, right?

124
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:41,980
No. I slept tight.

125
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:44,100
No. Come with me.

126
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,340
I'm running late.

127
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,370
Come quickly.

128
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,810
Why are you so strong?

129
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:54,220
Look at yourself. If you frown like that, you'll get wrinkles.

130
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,040
- You do it.
- I'll do it.

131
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,100
Trust me. Should I do it for you?

132
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:15,660
I'll do it. How do I do it?

133
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:17,390
Below your eyes,

134
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,390
right, and your lips,

135
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,970
and your neck.

136
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:30,070
- Happy?
- Yes. Now you're glowing.

137
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,750
I'm leaving.

138
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:34,470
While you are staying at my home,

139
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,400
I will make straight your personality and looks.

140
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,520
Just don't use it without me knowing.

141
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,990
You worried a lot about me, right?

142
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,430
I didn't.

143
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,600
You didn't even sleep properly, right?

144
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,960
I slept tight.

145
00:11:55,500 --> 00:12:00,070
Why are you so expressionless? You're not even looking at me.

146
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,680
I'm not looking because you are blinding me.

147
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,340
Oh! You are coming straight in.

148
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,220
Are you okay?

♫ Other people probably do too ♫

150
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:25,140
Then it's fine.

151
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,650
I suddenly feel like I've become a puppy.

152
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:30,180
You need not tell me if you don't want—

153
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,930
I met my brother and asked him what I wanted to ask and also got my answers.

154
00:12:34,930 --> 00:12:39,260
- Good job.
- There was a misunderstanding. We even sorted it out.

155
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,750
That's even better.

156
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,730
Is it really better? I still don't know.

157
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,080
It is better.

158
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:53,740
Your eyes seem warm now when you talk about the professor.

159
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,430
They were as cold as ice before.

162
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,610
You guys know how important the role of a leader is in a group.

163
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:15,680
What do you think are the most crucial qualities a leader should have?

164
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,560
Who can answer this?

165
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:22,000
Why are you guys so dull?

166
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,490
You should answer well at times like this so that it's easy when you are going to interviews.

167
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,450
Seriously!

168
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,760
You there... red pen.

169
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,460
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Answer me.

170
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:40,890
Uh... a good leader should...

171
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:44,550
understand his teammates well and—

172
00:13:44,550 --> 00:13:46,620
That is the basics of the basics.

173
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:49,600
One who makes great results is a true leader.

174
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,650
Then, what is one crucial quality that all successful leaders have? Maintaining themselves.

175
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:59,430
All the successful people invest a lot in maintaining themselves.

176
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:02,700
- You there, red pen.
- Yes, Ma'am.

177
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:06,000
What do you do to maintain yourself?

178
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,510
Maintaining myself?

179
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:13,620
I... play basketball with my friends sometimes.

180
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:16,430
- Basketball? Maintaining stamina.
- Yes.

181
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,190
And what else?

182
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,950
- Is that all?
- Yes.

183
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:25,680
I get up early every morning at four and do pilates and then read a book.

184
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,580
I also do meditation and plan my whole day, to the minute.

185
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:35,110
As a professor, I do this much. You guys should at least do as much as me.

186
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:44,050
How are you so careless when the world's such a scary place these days? You should maintain yourselves.

187
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:47,550
You will at least be able to answer this.

188
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:52,730
Anyone who thinks there is a person around you who is good leader material.

189
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:58,200
Yeo Joon, seems like you have been listening to my classes.

190
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,420
Yes, Ma'am. Your classes are very popular so

191
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:05,120
even though I'm a freshman I'm attending. It's okay, right?

192
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:09,920
I'm proud of you. Tell me who you think so highly of.

193
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,260
Yes. I consider...

194
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:15,540
Nam Soo Hyun to be a good leader.

195
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,560
- Nam Soo Hyun? What made you think like that?
 - (What?)

196
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,980
He doesn't depend on anyone and doesn't care about what people think of him.

197
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,810
So he doesn't care how

198
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:31,090
other people see him. He is that kind of a person.

199
00:15:31,090 --> 00:15:35,050
That isn't enough to say he'll make a good leader.

200
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,030
He is the same inside-out.

201
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:44,180
He always does what he says and takes responsibility for what he has to.

202
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,390
So he makes people around him rely on him.

203
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:51,090
That is the kind of person Nam Soo Hyun is.

204
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,040
I thought that only your grades were good,

205
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,520
Nam Soo Hyun, I see you in a different light now.

206
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,920
Both of you, what do you want from me?

207
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,550
- We just like you.
- Me also.

208
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:23,300
Can't you just like each other? Exclude me from this.

209
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,330
Yes, Mom.

210
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:35,700
I want to go to a different school with a different major

211
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,160
before it's too late.

212
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,230
No, I told you from the beginning.

213
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:46,660
I thought it was too late,

214
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,420
but I think I won't regret it only if I try my best.

215
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,090
Joon.

216
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:17,400
Are you all right? Ah! That Oh Chun Gook, why did he do that?

217
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,900
He crossed the line so much.

218
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,230
I told him not to call your girlfriend. Don't treat me like an accomplice.

219
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:26,480
Are you trying to get your hands off of him now? You guys were close, weren't you?

220
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,180
I wasn't that close to him.

221
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,390
We also got close with Young Ran noonim.

222
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,130
- That noona—
- She's not a noona to you.

223
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,150
She even bought us makgeolli. Like a reward for reporting.

224
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,850
Yes. It must have been tasty.

225
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,150
I almost went down the drain with you.

226
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:50,750
You non-loyal brat.

227
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,870
You too.

228
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:06,440
Aren't we making it too obvious?

229
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:12,190
I am doing this to make it obvious so that everyone knows that we are a campus couple.

230
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,420
Before class starts, I want to ask you all something.

231
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,820
What kind of assignment is the most difficult for you to do?

232
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,720
I am thinking of taking your opinions into account for next semester's assignment.

233
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,590
Team project assignments!

234
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,400
Why do you not like a team project?

235
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,960
Isn't it good to do it with others instead of doing it alone?

236
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,260
I hate it.

237
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:44,220
After doing a team project, I have started disliking people more instead of liking them.

238
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,990
I started believing in individuality.

239
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,760
This won't do.

240
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:55,960
Then I will give a simple assignment.

241
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,990
Write down how you felt about the previous team project assignment.

242
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,950
Twenty points total, fill out the A4 sheet.

243
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:09,730
Life is something that can't be done alone.

244
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:15,200
You will definitely have felt something and learned something.

245
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,220
Let's start class.

246
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,360
Mi Joo?

247
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,920
Soo Hyun, do you have a moment?

248
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:00,470
Yes.

249
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,540
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

250
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,530
Is the person that you like Young Ran unni?

251
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:27,050
I'll give up.

252
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:32,140
It's funny that I'm saying I'll give up even though I was dumped.

253
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:37,830
But I thought you would only be comfortable if we make it sure.

254
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:43,260
- Yes.
- But...

255
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,800
Are you not curious...

256
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,530
about why I started liking you?

257
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,410
I am curious.

258
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,880
I didn't ask...

259
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,650
because I didn't have the right to be curious.

260
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:09,320
The first time when I saw you in the convenience store.

261
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,610
Back then I was...

262
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,820
having a tough day.

263
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:22,440
I dropped a beer and it started leaking.

264
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:28,050
I had to pick it up, close it, and pay for it.

265
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:33,710
But because my mind was blank, I stood there like a fool not being able to do that simple thing.

266
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,230
You did what I had to do, patiently

267
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,220
as if it wasn't a big deal.

268
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,650
Are you going to have it?

269
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:49,500
I thought I could do anything if only

270
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,310
this person was by my side.

271
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:56,770
That's what I thought.

272
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:59,720
You seemed like a reliable tree

273
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,940
who held my hand ignorantly, but affectionately,

274
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:08,210
and like you were guiding me.

275
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,940
That tree was also handsome.

276
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,590
I don't regret it.

277
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,830
It's the first time I have ever tried my best in my life.

278
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:24,100
Even if I go back,

279
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,960
I would like you.

280
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:31,110
I would have had a one-sided crush.

281
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,490
I would have confessed to you.

282
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,970
I'm sorry.

283
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,380
There's nothing...

284
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,190
I can give you.

285
00:22:53,670 --> 00:23:01,350
♫ I just need you to stay with me ♫

286
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,960
Please accept this.

287
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:33,520
It's hard for me to have it or throw it away.

288
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,370
I drew you. It's the same as you, right?

289
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:43,730
Thank you for...

290
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:47,570
appearing in my life

291
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,100
so that I was able to like you.

292
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,020
I told you I'd drop you off.

293
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:25,120
For some reason, I want to drop you off safely.

294
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,250
I'm fine.

295
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,010
I had misunderstood my brother for a long time.

296
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,600
I thought my brother hit me

297
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,380
and that he hated me.

298
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,720
I was always hungry for love.

299
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,220
My parents' love and my brother's.

300
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,600
I got hope whenever...

301
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,360
I thought I should give up, because

302
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,810
I was getting hurt.

303
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,390
So that's why you said that.

304
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,550
- What?
- You told me before when I

305
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,480
liked Chan Ki.

306
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:10,000
I thought you also liked someone one-sidedly.

307
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,540
You just didn't have another option.

308
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:19,430
It's not easy to find someone to save you from that kind of a

309
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,680
sad feeling.

310
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,240
It was a one-sided love.

311
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,630
Did you understand me and pity me because I was like you?

312
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:39,360
I did, but I also hated that you were hurt by Hong Chan Ki.

313
00:25:41,450 --> 00:25:45,370
Why did you hate that? I was just a senior to you back then.

314
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:48,480
That's right. Back then you were just a senior.

315
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,460
But why did I hate that so much?

316
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,860
Ah! From when did you start liking me?

317
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,240
Just a moment.

318
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:20,330
Who is she?

319
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,380
Why are you here?

320
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,620
Did I come at a bad time?

321
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,090
Let's go, get in.

322
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,680
I think I have to go.

323
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,370
Your mother?

324
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,790
Aren't you coming?

325
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:08,970
This isn't yours. Whose are these cheap—

326

Even if you try to forget, your brain remembers it.

Just like how I cannot forget you.

Nothing. Why did you not answer the call?

I didn't tell you about myself.

503
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:49,040
When I was eight years old,

504
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:51,670
my parents got a divorce and

505
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,680
my mom left.

507

I got a phone call today

508
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,210
and I knew right away

509
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,350
that it was my mom's number.

510

I'm sure she had her reasons.

511
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,390
But I don't want to hear it.

512
00:42:15,390 --> 00:42:19,090
Maybe I want her to experience the same pain I did.

513

No matter how happy I am,

I often think...

517
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:32,670
that I can't be happy forever.

518
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:35,770
And that part of me might never get fulfilled.

519
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,880
Even though I know it,

520
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:42,340
it would still sadden me.

521
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,810
We can't forgive our parents,

522
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:49,100
nor understand them either.

I felt bad for her.

I have you,

530
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:19,340
but my mom doesn't have someone like that.

531
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,910
It must be lonely.

Yes.

547

00:52:58,290 --> 00:52:59,580
You sent me an email?

656
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,660
You should tell me that you sent it if you did.

657
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:05,470
Do I have to come all the way here and ask you?

658
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:07,730
Seriously!

659
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:10,110
People who live like me without free time,

660
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:14,450
our five minutes is more useful than five days of an average person. Did you know that?

661
00:53:14,450 --> 00:53:16,480
I'm sorry, Professor.

662
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:19,170
Seriously. Sor-

663
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:23,910
Why would you do something to be sor- Get it soon!

664
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:34,760
She needs a place to pour it all out.

665
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:36,970
Do whatever you want.

666
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,790
It's almost the end now.

667
00:53:51,980 --> 00:53:53,830
Your father has sent me.

668
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:55,890
Father?

669
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:00,060
You wouldn't have searched all over the school.

670
00:54:02,290 --> 00:54:04,520
Did you follow me?

671
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:05,990
Let's go.

672
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:08,240
I have another class left.

673
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:16,330
It seems like a rich young master is being taken away.

674
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:18,410
He's calling you urgently.

675
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,840
You know his personality.

676
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,420
I also have no other choice.

677
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:32,810
I have to go home.

678
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,190
Is something wrong?

679
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:35,640
No.

680
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,080
It seems like my father's missing me a lot.

681
00:54:38,080 --> 00:54:40,620
Oh, okay.

682
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,130
Nothing's wrong, right?

683
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:33,780
Professor, did something good happen to you?

684
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,320
I have an appointment.

685
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,350
I am curious about who it is.

686
00:55:43,390 --> 00:55:45,370
Why isn't he picking up?

687
00:55:46,170 --> 00:55:48,320
- Did you perhaps—
- Yes, tell me, Professor.

688
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:50,850
...contact Joon?

689
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:53,910
You made an appointment with Joon.

690
00:55:53,910 --> 00:55:55,700
Yes.

691
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:00,560
He doesn't usually pick up my calls, but now it seems like he will but he didn't.

692
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:02,230
Joon went home.

693
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,050
Home?

694
00:56:03,050 --> 00:56:07,090
He went urgently so I think he couldn't contact you.

695
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,070
We decided to meet after classes at the gate.

696
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:14,750
It seemed like he was going to see his father urgently.

697
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,930
Joon went to see Father?

698
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:22,710
No, not that.

699
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:24,870
Did someone take Joon?

700
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:29,340
Yes. He said your father sent him.

701
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:38,250
Mother, where are you?

702
00:56:38,250 --> 00:56:39,730
Joon Wan?

703
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,240
Are you at home?

704
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,090
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

705
00:56:43,090 --> 00:56:45,600
Did Father call Joon?

706
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,050
Joon?

707
00:56:47,050 --> 00:56:48,590
You didn't know?

708
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,470
I don't know. I came out because I had some work to do.

709
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,430
Go back home soon. I'm also on my way.

710
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:57,370
Okay, Joon Wan.

711
00:56:57,370 --> 00:56:59,270
Come quick.

712
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:27,770
Listen carefully.

713
00:57:32,210 --> 00:57:37,660
If you mess with Joon once more, you will all die.

714
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:43,910
What are you saying, Joon Wan?

715
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,690
You know I keep my word, right?

716
00:57:49,290 --> 00:57:53,270
I will do as you asked so don't do what you did to me

717
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,230
to Joon.

718
00:58:02,430 --> 00:58:05,610
What you did is all in here.

719
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,630
You.

720
00:58:08,630 --> 00:58:14,800
Your son is only me, Yeo Joon Wan, and me only, until death.

721
00:58:16,190 --> 00:58:22,270
Joon doesn't have a family from today onward.

722
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:58,320
What do you do these days?

723
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:07,020
Father, why did you call me?

724
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:15,700
I asked you to live quietly and not cause any issues.

725
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:19,550
I caused an issue?

726
00:59:19,550 --> 00:59:22,790
I asked you to be careful because your brother also goes to your school.

727
00:59:22,790 --> 00:59:24,520
I didn't cause any harm to him.

728
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:27,110
I don't even act like I know him.

729
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,050
It's my fault for listening to you.

730
00:59:46,050 --> 00:59:53,080
Hey! Do you want to damage my image also? Wasn't damaging Joon Wan's enough?

731
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,870
My Joon Wan left that good offer

732
00:59:58,870 --> 01:00:02,930
and went to your school because of you. Right?

733
01:00:06,050 --> 01:00:08,920
You shouldn't have been born.

734
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,750
You aren't perfect at anything.

735
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,980
Nothing perfect.

736
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:18,410
Father.

737
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:20,450
Shut up.

738
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:25,000
Come back home.

739
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:35,250
I don't want to.

740
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:38,450
Don't want to?

741
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:41,310
Yes, I don't want to.

742
01:00:41,310 --> 01:00:44,320
I don't want to come back to this home.

743
01:00:47,740 --> 01:00:51,190
You have learned to talk back since moving out.

744
01:00:51,190 --> 01:00:54,890
What? Don't want to?

745
01:00:56,350 --> 01:00:58,500
Tell me again.

746
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,390
Don't want to?

747
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,810
What are you doing? Come in.

748
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,630
Come inside.

749
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:25,170

This is all my money.

752
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:31,570
Do you earn money so that you can use us as your punching bags?

753
01:02:31,570 --> 01:02:36,260
I thought that pushing you away and handling dad alone was protecting you.

754
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:38,880
I'm sorry that that has hurt you more.

755
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,320
I do think about it.

756
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,680
That the best thing I did in my life was to cling on to you.

757
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:46,430
I have an announcement to make.

758
01:02:46,430 --> 01:02:48,320
You want us to become each other's pinch hitters?

759
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,810
- You should also date someone.
- How do I do that?

760
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:54,240
You should do well with Kim So Bin before telling me.

761
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,360
Why aren't you asking me if Joon is fine?

762
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,310
I miss him more if I talk about him.
