It's an effort to get close with others,

and an effort to not go too close.

Why can't you help being curious?

00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,290
I think tens of thousands of things about why a particular person did something.

00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:23,430
That messes up my mind and it feels like it's going to explode.

443
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,220
Ask before it explodes.

444
00:38:28,030 --> 00:38:33,520
Why did you not see the mail I had sent for the group project?

445
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:39,040
I am not trying to nitpick. I had worked as best as I could on the material research and sent it to you.

446
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:43,190
But I saw that you had not even opened my email.

447
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,630
- You are Kim So Bin from the third year, right?
-Yes.

448
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,760
I never got an email from you.

00:38:56,120 --> 00:39:00,150
Then, it must be my fault. I am sorr—

No, it may not be your fault.

It could have been my mistake, too.

453
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:07,690
There is no way you would make a mistake like that.

And you would?

Your grades are uncertain and you have no other certifications.

If you think you are late, then you already are.

458
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,040
It must be my mistake. I am sorry.

459
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,260
It may not be your mistake.

And you still call yourself a friend?

Did she say that? That me and her dated?

466

That's right you punk, I heard it all at the class gathering.

Do you not have anything to say?

469
00:40:20,350 --> 00:40:24,770
She told me it was her birthday and asked me out to a movie. So, we went to the movie, ate, and then I dropped her at home. That's all.

But why did you not tell me that?

471
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:31,030
Because it was not important. Did you like Mi Ra?

How can you do a part-time job without knowing stuff like this? You young people

639
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:25,960
aren't in your right minds.

640
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:32,100
Not that one! The one next to it.

641
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,130
No, no. The one below it.

642
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:36,380
Below it. That's right!

643
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:41,900
How many times did I have to tell you it was that one!

644
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:44,990
You're studying English?

645
00:56:44,990 --> 00:56:49,230
Give me a cigarette. It means you should give me cigarettes, you jerk.

646
00:56:49,230 --> 00:56:51,470
You keep the change.

647
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:04,190
Are your eyes broken?!

648
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:07,860
Mister, did you hit me now?

649
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,400
What did you say?

650
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,160
You threw yourself at me first!

651
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,510
The part-time worker saw it, too.

652
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:16,770
Should I call the police right now!?

653
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,610
Look here...

654
00:57:20,140 --> 00:57:23,360
Where did this wench fall from?

655
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:26,850
Where did this crazy person like you fall from?

656
00:57:26,850 --> 00:57:28,650
What?

657
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,170
I'll hold back because I'm a man.

658
00:57:35,170 --> 00:57:39,840
Hey! Man! Let's fight! Where are you going?

659
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:43,180
Should I call the police?

660
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,310
Shall I hold back for the sake of this good-looking part-timer?

661
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,870
Such a troublemaker.

662
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:53,340
Oppa, buy this troublemaker some alcohol.

663
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:57,200
Young Ran wants to drink some.

664
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,360
Hey!

665
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,450
What's going on?

666
00:58:09,450 --> 00:58:14,570
I thought you would starve on your own. If I don't feed you, who will?

667
00:58:14,570 --> 00:58:18,250
- Eat up.
- It's fine. Just eat up and go.

668
00:58:18,250 --> 00:58:23,020
If I don't come find you at work, I never get the chance to see you.

669
00:58:24,950 --> 00:58:27,560
I prefer that no one comes.

670
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,960
So, I interrupted your sweet break?

671
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:35,100
Drink. All you need is alcohol, right?

672
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:38,210
You need something to eat with it for the alcohol to taste better.

673
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:40,430
Even the excuse is good.

674
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:12,020
[Notice of school suspension]

675
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:17,430
Senior!

676
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:25,400
If I had known it would be like this, I would have slept in. Right?

677
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:30,470
When I think about it, I never properly thanked you that day.

678
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:34,780
If it weren't for you that night, it would have been really bad.

679
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,320
Thank you for helping me.

680
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:44,360
I get that you are used to favors. But I did not help you.

681
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,750
Is it that you have an overinflated ego?

682
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:54,080
Then... were you helping Senior So Bin?

683
01:00:58,650 --> 01:01:00,690
How agitating.

684
01:01:03,610 --> 01:01:06,350
That look that says you understand everything...

685
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:12,220
it's annoying.

686
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:20,900
As someone who's so twisted they can't accept another's kindness, what do you know about me to judge me?

687
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,040
Do you have that right?

688
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,470
I was going to treat you as a senior because you are so pitiful, but I can't because you are so fake.

689
01:01:31,770 --> 01:01:34,260
That's better.

690
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:37,750
It's better than donning a red mask and smiling widely.

691
01:01:54,820 --> 01:01:58,290
♫ My dear ♫

692
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:04,230
♫ When I first saw you, I knew right away ♫

693
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:08,250
♫ My dear ♫

694
01:02:08,250 --> 01:02:09,760
🌿 At a Distance, Spring is Green 🍃
♫ be with me ♫

695
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:11,110
You think I am a pushover, don't you?

696
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:12,560
Yes, that's why I like it.

697
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:13,720
What does that mean?

698
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:16,690
Don't be anxious and just wait a little while.

699
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:17,780
Does it look like the group project will be fun?

700
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:18,950
What do you think about being the team leader?

701
01:02:18,950 --> 01:02:23,310
3rd year student Kim So Bin. You know that I had a selected another student originally, right?

702
01:02:23,310 --> 01:02:25,850
If you expect something from someone and are disappointed, it becomes difficult to forgive.

703
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:28,200
Senior, you are always negative.

704
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:32,060
If every day is a test, then it could be hard to be positive.

705
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:35,580
Are you the sort who thinks they are the most miserable without knowing anything about others?

706
01:02:35,580 --> 01:02:40,220
You're not... the type of person with a knife in his mouth, stabbing innocent people, are you?

707
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:44,330
You can just say it with words! Why hit me!

708
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,570
♫ When I first saw you, I knew right away ♫
