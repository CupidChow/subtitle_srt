It's time for the truth game!

I'm a human lie detector.

486
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:25,050
The consequence for lying... I'll leave that up to your imagination.

487
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,190
I'll get going...

What do you do if the guy you like, likes another girl?

491
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:50,420
Mi Joo, did you prepare your question ahead of time?

492
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:55,090
I'll let him follow his heart. At least have him get his way.

Hey! Did you make another friend?

Who!? I thought I was Nam Soo Hyun's one and only friend!

Am I that 0.5?

00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,240
Don't misunderstand. You wouldn't even be 0.1

When was your first kiss? Where and how did it happen?

505

Our first kiss was...

Not at all.

516

You don't want to or you're restraining?

517
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:48,790
If it's something you can restrain from, better off not doing it.

518
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:55,090
You'll tell me if you find someone you can't restrain yourself for, right?

Don't tell me, you've fallen for Nam Soo Hyun?

Until when are you going to sleep in the lounge?

534

Are you asking for my plans, or are you asking because you're worried?

535
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm a mayfly so I don't have a plan. If it is a worry then don't do it.

No, no! Ten drinks!

She's here. She's here.

645
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:34,060
Everyone, everyone. You've waited a long time.

646
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,520
It's time for Yeo Joon's girlfriend Q&A time!

647
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:42,100
Ask whatever you want to ask, for ten Miracle Drinks.

648
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,820
Okay?

649
00:52:43,820 --> 00:52:46,480
- Just stay for a while.
- Let go of me.

650
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,380
Is it her? Did you see the online community board?

651
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:52,770
She photoshopped the picture and bought what Joon has and says that they are a couple.

652
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:55,870
Wow, she puts so much effort into her delusion.

653
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:59,430
- I heard Joon is dating Instagram star Lee Hye Ra.
- How did you get to date him?

654
00:52:59,430 --> 00:53:03,490
- Are you really dating?
- Joon wasn't the first to confess, was he?

655
00:53:03,490 --> 00:53:07,140
Answer! Why can't you speak?

656
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,500
Of course not.

657
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,790
She's gotten herself in that mess.

658
00:53:11,790 --> 00:53:15,300
She photoshopped the picture and bought what Joon has and

659
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,290
says it's a couple-item.

660
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:21,870
You uploaded it at the online community board, didn't you?

661
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,230
What are you saying?

662
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,420
What's wrong with you today?

663

What's going on?

664
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,520
- Why ten drinks?
- What the heck? Why won't she say anything?

665
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:34,440
- What's so great about her?
- Do you find her pretty?

666
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:38,590
- What about her?
- She's not pretty.

667
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,430
- Yeah?
- Joon, where are you?

668
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,030
Let's meet up next time.

669
00:53:47,030 --> 00:53:51,340
Kim So Bin, she's pretending she's some kind of celebrity.

670
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:55,640
You were nice to just anyone, weren't you? Don't be like that. Did you forget what happened before?

671
00:53:55,640 --> 00:54:00,290
- What are you saying?
- In the past, there was a truck-full of girls who lied about dating you.

672
00:54:00,290 --> 00:54:04,730
Is she one of them? She's not your taste though.

673
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,680
Where are you?

674

You're that curious?

675
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,590
Then I'll tell you.

676
00:54:23,810 --> 00:54:27,740
We're still getting to know each other. Okay?

677
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,900
- Is she a celebrity, or what?
- Let's just go.

00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:53,880
You finally came! You should have come earlier.

681
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:58,300
Here, here everyone. The star has arrived.

682
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,960
So Bin has begun sharing your love story.

683
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:04,650
Do you like living this way?

684
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:10,070
You wouldn't live like this because you like it. This is all you learned to do.

685
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,980
- This atmosphere...
- What a thing to say.

686
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:16,370
Are they going to fight?

687
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:21,170
- What did you say?
- You're using someone to make money.

688
00:55:21,170 --> 00:55:24,020
So that you can get back all the money you used to drink.

689
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:27,020
This jerk, has he gone crazy.

690
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:35,070
Take it.

691
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:39,160
Joon, let's go.

692
00:55:45,540 --> 00:55:49,180
Just because you've got a bit of money, you think you're all that?

693
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:51,580
Hey, Hey! Is this your money?

694
00:55:51,580 --> 00:55:54,680
It doesn't matter to you, whether it's my parent's money or some beggar's.

695
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,520
Beg. I'll give you more.

696
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,760
We were totally fooled.

697
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,220
You were just pretending to be nice, weren't you?

698
00:56:04,220 --> 00:56:06,420
It's driving you nuts, isn't it?

699
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:09,820
Then just kill me.

Oh no!

Record all this first. Capture their faces.

00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:37,720
- Get closer to record it.
- Shouldn't we stop them?

Okay.

706
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:47,530
- Oh my god! Call the police or report this.
- Stop them.

707
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:51,270
Is this enough?

708
00:56:53,370 --> 00:56:57,020
What's wrong with them? Stop them at once.

Hurry up!

710

Stop them somehow.

Hit me more.

712
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,300
I'll give you 100,000 won per punch.

Huh? Hit me.

What should we do?

715
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,790
Shouldn't we try to stop them?

716
00:57:24,790 --> 00:57:27,510
Hit me. Hit me more.

717

Come here. Come. Come. Come.

718

There are cameras around. They're filming.

Let go of me.

Let go of me!

Do you think he's all right?

727
00:58:23,260 --> 00:58:26,510
They must be dating for real.

728
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,560
Hey, shouldn't he go to the hospital?

729
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:51,010
What did you say? Wait a moment.

730
