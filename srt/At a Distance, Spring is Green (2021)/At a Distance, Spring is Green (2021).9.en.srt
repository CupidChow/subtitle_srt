I just came to know about it somehow.

164
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:04,010
Then you must also know that I got rejected.

165
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,960
Do you regret it?

166
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,610
No.

167
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:10,680
I would have confessed sometime or the other.

168
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:14,150
But...

169
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:17,420
it hurts more than I thought it would.

170
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:19,870
I am jealous of you.

171
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,930
I don't have the courage to confess my feelings.

172
00:13:24,930 --> 00:13:27,740
I am afraid that I would lose Soo Hyun forever.

173
00:13:56,990 --> 00:13:58,930
Tada!

174
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,230
How is this? Does it not go really well with me?

175
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,480
I frequently see you wearing this outfit.

176
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,610
What?

177
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:13,140
What are you talking about? I wore this for the first time.

178
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,130
It seems like I have seen it.

179
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,240
Come here.

180
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,190
Tada!

181
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,450
Why did you buy so many similar-looking clothes?

182
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,650
V-neck,

183
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:38,360
round, large fit, slim fit,

184
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,050
crisp white, something that is close to ivory,

185
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:45,170
the color, material, style, etc. all differ.

186
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,390
Hey, do you have any money left after all this?

187
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,860
It looks like the same white t-shirt to me.

188
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,990
So, if everyone cuts their bangs the same way, do all of them become Nam Soo Hyun? No, right?

189
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,360
Ah, I see.

190
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,300
Good for you!

191
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,420
Pick one out of these.

192
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,590
This is a present for you moving in.

193
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:08,340
These are the good times.

194
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,650
Don't talk as if you have seen everything in the world.

195
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:13,280
You can also make it so you are having a good time.

196
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:16,840
- That won't happen
- Will it really not?

197
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,760
Do you think you can win over a good person that easily?

198
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,640
I am sure they are right beside you.

199
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,030
You are sure?

200
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,290
It's because you are a good person.

201
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,160
Just be honest.

202
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,760
Yes.

203
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:39,660
Someone is sincerely staring at you.

204
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:46,720
Do you have a bit of time?

205
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,580
Will just a bit do?

206
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,240
I just need three minutes.

207
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,080
I will go ahead.

208
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:58,020
Who could that be?

209
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,610
Who are you coming out of the house acting so lovable with?

210
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:04,310
Why don't you get to the point? One minute has passed.

211
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:07,260
You are pretty popular, so it does not have to be So Bin particularly. Right?

212
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,750
I thought about it all night, but I could not get it at all.

213
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,160
Why is it So Bin after all?

214
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,530
Because it is Kim So Bin.

215
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:15,300
- Do I need to say more.
-Yes, you completely need to explain more.

216
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,600
You are going to date her for a while and then leave her, aren't you?

217
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,750
- You think I don't know it?
- Three minutes are up.

218
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,420
Then, I will be off.

219
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,570
Don't make So Bin cry.

220
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,630
I did my duty at every spare moment.

221
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:33,460
I maybe insincere with other things, but

222
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,140
I am at So Bin's side around the clock.

223
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,390
Around the clock?

224
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,910
Even late at night?

225
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,810
Round, round, round, round the clock during the day!

226
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,510
I have been super diligent!

227
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:48,640
Great work, getting the job done all this time.

228
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,910
You can rest up now.

229
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,160
Wow! Look at his guts, that have it all!

230
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,070
You are annoying!

231
00:16:57,070 --> 00:17:00,740
That's why we should stop coming across each other.

232
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,010
Professor, excuse me.

233
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,860
But is there some issue with the materials?

234
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:33,340
If you tell me what's wrong, I can redo it.

235
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,190
He's my older brother.

236
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:44,770
He is the person I hate the most.

237
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,620
Ms. Kim So Bin.

238
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,290
Yes, Professor, go on.

239
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,030
Do you know anything about the incident where student Yeo Joon got beaten up?

240
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,490
Yes.

241
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:09,260
Can you tell me what happened?

242
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,420
Well...

243
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,850
I cannot let this go as a professor of the Business Administration Department.

244
00:18:18,710 --> 00:18:21,010
Joon was trying to help me.

245
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:22,880
There was a disagreement.

246
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,260
He is not the kind of kid who would start something like this.

247
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,530
I am sorry.

248
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,670
It looks like the two of you are really close?

249
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:37,180
Yes.

250
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:41,260
What kind of kid does Yeo Joon seem to you?

251
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,750
Joon is—

252
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,020
Ah, this does not mean that I am particularly interested in that student.

253
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,930
Well...

254
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,300
I know that you are his brother.

255
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,030
I heard it.

256
00:18:58,030 --> 00:19:00,780
I thought I should let you know.

257
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:07,480
Joon told that to you himself?

258
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,440
It seems the professor

259
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,130
worries about you

260
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,600
and likes you a lot.

261
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:22,100
It must look like that from the outside.

262
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,260
I don't think so.

263
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,840
There was no issue with me too from the outside, right?

264
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,880
Is this an issue with the blood of our family?

265
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,040
You cannot judge a book by its cover.

266
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:43,210
You did not forget that we were supposed to go see the sea, right?

267
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:45,120
Of course.

268
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,260
What do you want to do over there?

269
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:50,020
I have a lot of things I want to do there, so we must not be late.

270
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:52,430
Why would I be late?

271
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,750
Ah, I want to leave quickly.

272
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,740
I have to go to my electives class!

273
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,170
I don't want to be apart from you.

274
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,890
Isn't it good enough we're at the same school? We see each other every day.

275
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:06,820
I keep wanting to look at you again and again. What do I do?

276
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,390
See you again.

277
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:12,590
See you later My Bin!

278
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,730
Soo Kyeong!

279
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,530
- Is there something wrong?
- I was dropped from the research team.

280
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,290
Can you believe it?

281
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:33,000
Your dissertation.

282
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,750
You did not submit it just like that, right?

283
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,590
Are you crazy?

284
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:39,790
I was really stuck then, so for a moment...

285
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:42,300
Do you really think I would plagiarize for people to talk about it, just for that little section?

286
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,030
I obviously took it out.

287
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,770
TA Seol.

288
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,720
- She did not say something weird to Professor Seo, right?
- Come on!

289
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,350
Is Professor Seo the type to be moved by rumors?

290
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:55,430
Even if I don't know how to recognize people very well, I know that much.

291
00:20:57,090 --> 00:21:01,380
You know my request for research funds has always been approved, right?

292
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,280
This does not make any sense. There is something fishy.

293
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,330
Let it go. You can apply for it again next time.

294
00:21:07,330 --> 00:21:09,720
Yeah, sure.

295
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:14,400
I have come here to discuss an amazing idea with you.

296
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,880
Get out.

297
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,690
I will do it next time.

298
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,850
So Bin, where are you going?

299
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,470
Are you going to meet Yeo Joon?

300
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:35,190
Yes.

301
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:37,160
I also met him.

302
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,210
Why?

303
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:40,940
I asked him not to make you cry.

304
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,110
- Chan Ki-
- Don't call my name so affectionately.

305
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,340
Don't you meet girls these days?

306
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,350
No, I don't.

307
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,800
You're finally facing puberty.

308
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,420
I hate you.

309
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,510
Hey, Kim So Bin. Ah, you scared me.

310
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:26,390
Why are you so surprised? Am I a pervert or what?

311
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,170
Senior.

312
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,840
What happened?

313
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,320
I have to tell you something and I also want to apologize.

314
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,700
Not just me.

315
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:43,890
Jung Woo hyung and Hye Ji also want to apologize.

316
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,530
What?

317
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,220
Drink this.

318
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:12,370
When will Jung Woo and Hye Ji come?

319
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:14,520
They'll be here soon.

320
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,050
Drink it.

321
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:46,290
[Does she have a boyfriend?]
OMG he's actually doing it. LOL]
[Does that girl not have a clue?]

322
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:54,280
[Isn't this a little dangerous. LOL]
[Isn't Chun Gook going face a lot of trouble?]
[Who cares, it's not like he's locked her up.]

323
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,890
[She's not that pretty.[
[Does she have a boyfriend?]
[She might say too much on camera. LOL]

324
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,940
I'm going crazy!

325
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,150
This crazy guy is actually doing this.

326
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,190
Why? Who is doing what?

327
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,490
What?

328
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:10,700
No. I don't know.

329
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:14,830
Look at you. What do you not know?

330
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,510
Isn't this Kim So Bin?

331
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,250
Yes.

332
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,500
What about So Bin?

333
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,520
- No, that is—
- Tell me what happened to So Bin!

334
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,560
Where is this?

335
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,160
Hey, even I don't know. It's not my fault.

336
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,180
What?

337
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:48,460
You only talked about it so it's not your fault.

338
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:52,500
But do you know that if something happens to her, you are also an accomplice?

339
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,790
Why me?

340
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:57,820
Conspiracy of crime. You can go get investigated at the police station

341
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,280
and might leave with a criminal record if you're unlucky, at just twenty years old.

342
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:02,020
No.

343
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,840
I also don't know.

344
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,120
Hyung, where is this?

345
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:15,920
Uh... This looks like Chun Gook's club room.

346
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,740
Look at that cabinet. It looks like the one in Chun Gook's club room.

347
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,340
- Right?
- Yes, yes.

348
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,510
Yes, it does look like his club room.

349
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:27,810
Ah, Chun Gook!

350
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,920
- Give that here. Just a moment.
- What are you doing?

351
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,410
- Just a moment. Leave me.
- Why are you doing this? Give it to me.

352
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,370
Let go of me!

353
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:02,570
Hey! Why did you run in? It's your fault.

354
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,890
Senior, do you know that you're acting strange?

355
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,310
It's a live internet broadcast!

356
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:15,520
You were lying all this while, weren't you? Move. Move away!

357
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,480
I'm not trying to do anything to you! Stay still!

358
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:27,090
Senior So Bin. Kim So Bin!

359
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,300
Senior So Bin.

360
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:40,660
Kim So Bin!

361
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:53,630
Let go off her you bastard!

362
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,550
Get up!

363
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,100
Are you hurt?

364
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,760
No! Stop this!

365
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,220
You bastard.

366
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,960
Are you okay?

367
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,720
Yes, I'm okay because you are here.

368
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,090
Thank god.

369
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,390
Hey, are you guys all right?

370
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,520
Unni!

371
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,630
How did you come here?

372
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:29,620
Joon, are you okay?

373
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:46,990
- Drink up!
- Drink up!

374
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:54,770
Chun Gook's video cannot be replayed. It got reported and the broadcast station must have suspended his account.

375
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:58,770
Did you see Joon earlier? It was the first time I saw him run so fast.

376
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,760
Even Noonim wasn't easy on him.
(Formal way of saying Noona)

377
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,770
When she came looking for Soo Hyun, she just flew over as soon as she heard about it.

378
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,000
I thought she was a human rocket.

379
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:11,960
We have paid back the money for what we drank so you won't follow us to our grave, right?

380
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,820
What's so nice there that I would follow you?

381
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,600
Hyung, but Noonim must be a year younger than you.

382
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,830
Oh, is that so?

383
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:22,290
Anyone who is stronger than me is Noonim only.

384
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,960
I'll buy today because we found them because of you.

385
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,270
Eat a lot.

386
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:33,570
But... what is your relationship with Nam Soo Hyun?

387
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,770
Are you curious about that?

388
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:41,960
The answer for that is... let's leave it to fate.

389
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,130
Oh! That card is for passionate lovers.

390
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,960
The tarot card is going overboard.

391
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:11,360
My skin is sensitive.

392
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,170
Sorry.

393
00:30:15,570 --> 00:30:18,930
I also got hurt on my lips.

394
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,700
Huh? Ah, okay.

395
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,000
This isn't lipstick.

396
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,970
You feel sorry, don't you?

397
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,900
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,260
You got hurt because of me. Why did I go there with him?

399
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:53,140
It would be suspicious to anyone. Maybe I'm really an idiot.

400
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,160
Who would think that, at school,

401
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:00,770
a senior whom they have known for years would do that to them?

402
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:05,240
You aren't an idiot. He's a criminal.

403
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,930
You were scared a lot, right?

404
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,200
Yes.

405
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,130
I was scared.

406
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:17,630
I'm sorry for coming late.

407
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,000
I also went crazy thinking something might have happened to you.

408
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,860
Let's talk.

409
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,120
Yes. Let's talk.

410
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,340
I also have something to tell you.

411
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:25,180
Is it a coincidence that you are working with So Bin?

412
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,470
Someone recommended her to me.

413
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,560
I don't like that you are working with So Bin.

414
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:34,490
I hate that So Bin is near you and that you are in our lives.

415
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,890
Why do you hate it so much?

416
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,100
Is she your girlfriend by any chance?

417
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,130
Why do you need to know that?

418
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,920
Are you going to eat a meal with her?

419
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,540
I saw the video that was taken during the festival.

420
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,490
Why did you only get hit?

421
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:55,230
You look like a brother who is upset because his brother got hit.

422
00:32:55,230 --> 00:33:00,050
It doesn't hurt at all. You know that I'm good at getting hit, right?

423
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,970
Don't do that anymore.

424
00:33:02,970 --> 00:33:05,450
Do you have the right to say that?

425
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:08,830
You hit me to death!

426
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:12,020
Did you forget everything already?

427
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:19,120
It seems like you forgot everything. I haven't forgotten it. Not a single day.

428
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:23,750
So you also shouldn't forget it. At least not without my permission.

429
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:25,410
Joon.

430
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,260
Brother!

431
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,250
Brother, save me.

432
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,040
You want me to save you?

433
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,820
- You?
- Brother!

434
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,090
I... I am sorry.

435
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:12,780
Brother!

436
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,640
It's okay.

437
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:17,020
Because you are not our family.

438
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,940
Brother!

439
00:34:18,940 --> 00:34:20,680
Brother!

440
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,900
Brother!

441
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,060
BROTHER!!

442
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,930

So Bin, I'm really sorry but...

Huh?

458
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,750
I don't think I can come.

459
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,980
What's wrong with your voice? Are you sick?

460
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,850
No. I'm really sorry.

461
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,670

Okay.

So Bin.

466
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:42,350
Is Joon there?

467
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,440

655
00:51:49,270 --> 00:51:51,270
Don't you have to go to the hospital?

656
00:51:51,270 --> 00:51:54,250
No. I don't think it's that bad.

657
00:52:05,740 --> 00:52:09,110
Put a finger down if you have a GPA greater than 4.0.

658
00:52:15,990 --> 00:52:18,650
The person who isn't a student fold.

659
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:25,460
The person who ate soup and rice with Nam Soo Hyun fold.

660
00:52:26,970 --> 00:52:31,060
Did you even understand the game rules?

661
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:36,320
Campus couple fold.

662
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:49,470
Put a finger down if you have straight bangs.

663
00:52:58,070 --> 00:52:59,840
My bangs aren't straight.

664
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:04,250
It's different every day. It's not the same straight bangs.

665
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,700
It's my turn, right?

666
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:12,400
The person who likes a girl here fold.

667
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,040
Soo Hyun should have got caught.

668
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,250
Again! Let's do it again.

669
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:37,920
No. You should fold only if you like a person here.

670
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,800
I know.

671
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,380
Professor,

672
00:53:51,380 --> 00:53:53,230
since this is a trip that you initiated,

673
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:58,500
the ocean of tears that you planned, should we do that too?

674
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,220
Sure.

675
00:54:17,080 --> 00:54:19,000
Anything is fine.

676
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:24,680
Wounds or worries that you can't talk about usually can be shared now.

677
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:28,030
You will spill it all here in front of the campfire and forget it all.

678
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:31,300
Don't do that. You will regret it tomorrow.

679
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,110
Questions are fine, too.

680
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:36,590
If it will be of any use to you,

681
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:39,000
I'm ready to talk about my shameful past.

682
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,870
They say a moment can change your entire life.

683
00:54:49,650 --> 00:54:53,110
When was that moment for you?

684
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:02,430
There was something I believed as the truth for a long time.

685
00:55:02,430 --> 00:55:07,650
I thought that my girlfriend dumped me because I was poor.

686
00:55:07,650 --> 00:55:11,570
It bothered me the whole of my youth.

687
00:55:11,570 --> 00:55:16,920
I was absorbed by my inferiority complex.

688
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:19,220
Even if someone just looked at me, I thought they were looking at me because I was broke.

689
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,950
I got to know that she was sick

690
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,790
after a lot of time had passed.

691
00:55:27,170 --> 00:55:32,560
I didn't know that and was hurt

692
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:34,640
because I thought she dumped me because I was poor.

693
00:55:35,550 --> 00:55:38,730
Don't lose things that are precious to you just because of the

694
00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:41,450
things that you now believe to be the truth.

695
00:55:41,450 --> 00:55:47,150
We never know when the truth will show us its true face.

696
00:56:02,050 --> 00:56:04,580
Brother, get me my trophy.

697
00:56:04,580 --> 00:56:07,630
The one I won for running the race.

698
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:14,790
Can you not?

699
00:56:14,790 --> 00:56:16,560
You are tall.

700
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,960
I don't think I can.

701
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,000
I'll ask dad to get it for you.

702
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:35,140
[Incoming call- Yeo Joon Wan]

703
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,320
Brother.

704
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,150
Yeo Joon.

705
00:57:06,150 --> 00:57:10,400
Why are you calling me Yeo Joon instead of Joon?

706
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:16,240
Listen carefully. You are alone from today. You don't have parents.

707
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:17,190
Why?

708
00:57:17,190 --> 00:57:19,260
Those people aren't your parents.

709
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,240
Brother? I have you though.

710
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,520
No, you don't.

711
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,800
Why are you being like this?

712
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,320
I'm scared.

713
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:36,810
Don't tell anyone what happened today.

714
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,590
Forget it all.

715
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:45,990
Don't go!

716
00:58:01,390 --> 00:58:03,460
I'm sorry!

717
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:13,230
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

718
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:32,080
Are you okay?

719
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,730
Hyung.

720
00:58:35,730 --> 00:58:37,470
Yes. Tell me.

721
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:39,950
I'm scared that

722
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:45,510
my memory might not be true.

723
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:49,880
Are you scared of knowing the truth?

724
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:51,620
No.

725
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,200
I want to know it.

726
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,110
Then find it.

727
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:04,130
If you at least make amends now, you can start over.

728
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:59,420
I told you but you didn't listen!

729

Get up! Get up! Get up, you little bastard!

Tell me.

733
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,860
It was father.

734
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:53,980

Did you talk it out?

01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,660
You're even asking me things like this. It's touching.

751
