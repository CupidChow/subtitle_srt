You couldn't do anything you wanted,

00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:34,220
Ask Kim So Bin. She's his girlfriend so she must know.

167
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,640
Aren't we making it too obvious?

168
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:47,480
I'm purposely doing this to make it obvious.

169
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:50,710
To make everyone know that we are a CC.
(T/N: CC - Campus Couple)

170
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,420
Senior, why are you standing here?

171
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,400
I was waiting for you.

172
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,800
Me?

173
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:16,840
I thought it would be weird for you to be alone after being with Joon for quite a while.

174
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,850
Are you going to eat food with me instead of Joon?

175
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,960
Had I started to speak casually with you?

176
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,360
You did that so quickly with Joon.

177
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:28,350
Did I?

178
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:31,250
I really didn't expect you to get close.

179
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:38,420
You're uncomfortable that I'm at Joon's place, right?

180
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,990
No. I feel reassured.

181
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:48,990
I feel reassured to have a person like you near Joon.

182
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:51,990
I can't fight well, though.

183
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,300
Even if I'm not by Joon's side,

184
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:59,500
I know that he's got you by his side,

185
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:04,050
and being with you will make him laugh at times.

186
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,760
Is it like that to like someone?

187
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,830
Even if we're not next to them, we want them to be happy?

188
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:21,570
Do you really not have such a person?

189
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:24,330
That's not what you are curious about.

190
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,570
Why aren't you asking how Joon is?

191
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,540
I miss him, even more, when I talk about him.

192
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,260
Don't worry too much about Joon.

193
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,530
That's not Joon, right?

194
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:10,200
♫ Even when the world turns its back at me ♫

195
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,250
I missed you.

196
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,430
♫ When I open my eyes ♫

197
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:39,500
♫ The same day repeats every day ♫

198
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,930
I missed you.

199
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:48,770
♫ and awkwardly smiled ♫

200
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,160
♫ Sometimes, I feel burdened when things get hard ♫

201
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,760
♫ When everything was falling apart ♫

202
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,130
♫ The reason I was able to hold on ♫

203
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,600
♫ Was because you were standing at the end of this road ♫

204
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,220
What are you doing? Not going?

205
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,800
Being a third wheel?

206
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,170
To give you notes.

207
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:23,200
I wrote notes for you. The ones I have marked are very important, so make a note.

208
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,030
This is mine.

209
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,590
What are you two doing? This isn't what I need.

210
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:34,730
What are you saying? If a student has missed classes then he should catch up soon.

211
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,830
Whose notes will you choose? Choose just one, also you have only one chance.

212
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:45,630
I don't want to go to school.

213
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:50,670
There are two of you who love me and make notes for me, why would I come to school?

214
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,820
- No!
- No!

215
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:58,130
Don't hang out with him. It seems like he's changing you.

216
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:05,260
[Incoming call: Professor Yeo Joon Wan]

217
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,930
He interrupts at the crucial moment.

218
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,860
Just a minute.

219
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,830
Yes, Professor.

220
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,480
Are you feeling better now?

221
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,280
I actually came home after everything got better.

222
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:40,340
But strangely I started crying as soon as I saw you.

223
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:47,080
Being hurt for a long time seems like nothing because I am used to it.

224
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:51,420
Maybe that pain had been an old friend of mine.

225
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,120
I've held out for too long, holding it in my arms.

226
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,690
But once I felt I was letting it go,

227
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:04,840
it felt like I was bidding farewell to my past self.

228
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:10,910
That's why you cried so much. Because you bade farewell?

229
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,040
We're even.

230
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:19,830
- What?
- I have also seen you crying.

231
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:21,450
Me?

232
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,230
I never cried.

233
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:30,220
Then maybe you didn't cry.

234
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,640
Maybe I saw you crying through your heart.

235
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,510
You would have seen me crying through my heart a hundred times.

236
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,140
I think about it sometimes,

237
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,700
that the best thing I've done in life

238
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,340
was clinging onto you.

239
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,200
Yes. You do that well.

240
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,940
No, actually I can't do that well.

241
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:25,670
I'm scared that I'll get rejected.

242
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:28,020
Then, why did you do that?

243
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,390
I just wanted to do so.

244
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,340
You are speaking informally.

245
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:37,180
I was very hurt back then.

246
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,790
I think I did well not giving up.

247
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:45,070
I wouldn't have come this far if I hadn't met you.

248
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:49,990
I would have lived as a person who couldn't express his true feelings.

249
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,910
Maybe I do feel a bit grateful.

250
00:23:57,750 --> 00:24:00,560
What would I have been like if I hadn't met you?

251
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,200
I never think of that.

252
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:09,830
I don't want to think of that.

253
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:13,370
When I had nowhere to go,

254
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,200
I thought of whether I should end it all.

255
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:21,000
But it seems like I don't get to decide the end of my life,

256
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,990
seeing that I met you.

257
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,660
Maybe I do feel a bit grateful.

258
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,870
- Why did he come here—
- Senior,

259
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,860
I'll talk to him.

260
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:54,300
I'm sorry.

261
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,060
You should apologize to So Bin and not me.

262
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:00,850
I did come to apologize to Kim So Bin.

263
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:04,740
Otherwise, how would I dare show my face at school?

264
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,610
But I saw you first and since I also have things to apologize for to you...

265
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:15,520
I will a-apply for l-leave

266
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,920
after this semester is over.

267
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,850
You have changed a lot.

268
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:27,590
Reality hit me once I went to the police station.

269
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,720
I reflected on all of my actions before.

270
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,820
It was scary there.

271
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:36,630
I don't even want to go near that place.

272
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:40,120
I will end my social life at school.

273
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,920
I'll attend classes as if I'm dead and disappear.

274
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,620
As if you're dead?

275
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:51,820
You make the people around you unhappy.

276
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,440
We won't have any problem if you do well. Please live as if you're dead.

277
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,490
Don't affect your brother.

278
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,690
It's your life, you shouldn't do that.

279
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:09,990
- What?
- Make it right.

280
00:26:09,990 --> 00:26:12,780
Anyone can start again.

281
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,320
- Yeo Joon...
- And don't use violence.

282
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,280
That will hurt people.

283
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:28,670
Their heart more than their body.

284
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,730
Okay. I'm sorry.

285
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:53,830
You worried a lot about me, didn't you?

286
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:59,580
Of course. I even lost my appetite.

287
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,800
It seems like you look healthier.

288
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,780
You had a hard time. Shall I buy you tofu?
(T/N: eating tofu is usually done after coming out of jail)

289
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:08,350
Did I go to jail?

290
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,640
I thought you would.

291
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,250
Let's live kindly.

292
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:17,210
If you follow me, you won't have any problems.

293
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,170
I'm nervous.

294
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:23,440
- About what?
- Will I be able to do it?

295
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,480
What is he doing?

296
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,480
I have something to announce publicly.

297
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,200
Kim So Bin...

298
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,750
I am sorry.

299
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:00,560
I made a mistake— No,

300
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,180
I did very wrong things. Please forgive me.

301
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:12,200
Okay. I get it, so stop.

302
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:17,980
Not just to me, don't do that to anyone else either.

303
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,770
Ever again.

304
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:23,940
I will not do so again.

305
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,790
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

306
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:29,840
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

307
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,830
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

308
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:36,140
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

309
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:42,140
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

310
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,020
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

311
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:47,510
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

312
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:50,820
I get it so stop calling my name.

313
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:57,380
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry. Sorry. Kim So Bin, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

314
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,680
Why is he going overboard?

315
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,430
Is this a show or real?

316
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,770
Did he go to an acting academy all this time?

317
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,000
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

318
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,490
- Kim So Bin, I'm sorry. Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.
- Let's talk outside.

319
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:13,660
Kim So Bin, I'm sorry. Kim So Bin, I'm sorry.

320
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:18,760
That's all for today's class.

321
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,780
Silence.

322
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,390
The semester is about to end. You guys are upset, right?

323
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,610
No!

324
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:29,500
I know you are actually upset.

325
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,030
So I prepared an assignment.

326
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:36,460
Company, brand, product. Anything's good.

327
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:40,150
Choose one between your groupmates, and make a promotional marketing video together.

328
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:44,720
The context and format are up to you. It sounds like a lot of fun, doesn't it?

329
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,740
Will this be included in our grades for the finals?

330
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:54,530
I said that the previous project will come in the exam, right?

331
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,440
That and this are 50/50.

332
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,080
This is a chance for the people who ruined their group project last time.

333
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,720
Planning, creativity, and level of completion. I'll be looking at all of those, so

334
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,970
each of you, do your part sincerely.

335
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,200
Should the groups be chosen freely like last time?

336
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,250
Groups...

337
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,350
You all can do it with the same team you did last time.

338
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,130
I asked you all to write how you felt and you all reacted like this.

339
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,390
In a negative way. It's sad to end it negatively.

340
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,010
Let's take another opportunity.

341
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:32,860
Why? Do you hate to meet people you don't like again?

342
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,160
Yes!

343
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,900
It's all part of society to find out how to handle people you hate.

344
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,030
Trust me and do this again.

345
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:45,540
That's all. Ah! One more thing.

346
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:50,150
How about you guys play manito in your groups?
(T/N: Secret Angel)

347
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:54,630
- Ah!
- I really hate it.

348
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,140
Manito? It would be so obvious.

349
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,880
Imagine I get So Bin and start treating her nicely.

350
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:10,140
Then you will get reported for stalking.

351
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,210
That's dangerous.

352
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,720
I hope we get each other.

353
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,830
Then it won't be obvious because we're so affectionate.

354
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,340
- Me?
- No, me.

355
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:31,160
Let's start meeting immediately.

356
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,700
Ah, where shall we do it? How about a grand place...

357
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,950
Ah, I don't have my card.

358
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,000
Then let's do it in the school cafe.

359
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,530
I want to buy you all drinks.

360
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:48,200
Huh? Hey, people die if they change suddenly.

361
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,130
Don't change so much all at once.

362
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:53,950
Then you don't come, that will reduce the bill by half.

363
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,590
We will go together. Hey, Chun Gook, wait up.

364
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,120
Hey! Hey!

365
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:06,230
The thing is that I want to buy you all drinks as an apology.

366
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,150
What's wrong with you?

367
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,280
It's a bit awkward for Joon and So Bin, right?

368
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,900
Right? How can you forgive him easily, just because he kneeled in front of you?

369
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,690
Then, at least next time...

370
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:21,280
Let's go.

371
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,180
Huh?

372
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,130
Don't strain yourself.

373
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,040
I wasn't a victim so I'll leave.

374
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,150
I'll go...

375
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,490
if we all go together.

376
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,880
Let's also decide our Manito.

377
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,960
Let's go.

378
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,180
♫ Just talk to me if you need anything ♫

379
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:57,030
♫ And I'll do it for you ♫

380
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:02,420
♫ I think about you every day ♫

381
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:06,830
♫ Every moment of my life, you're there, everywhere ♫

382
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:12,940
♫ Sad scenes like break ups in movies ♫

383
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,550
♫ We don't have such things, No sad ending ♫

384
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,000
Why? Is it me?

385
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,180
It may be.

386
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,150
Next person, pick.

387
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,670
♫ Woo~ You probably don't know, how much I like you ♫

388
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:30,630
♫ Talk to me ♫

389
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,670
♫ On a beautiful sunny day ♫

390
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,700
Oh!

391
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,060
What are you doing? Am I your Manito?

392
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,790
Never.

393
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:43,490
Soo Hyun got caught immediately.

394
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:48,340
♫ My eyes are full with you ♫

395
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,290
Hye Ji, did you also get me?

396
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,870
Why are you all frowning?

397
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,360
Eat a lot and stop frowning. Order a few more snacks.

398
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,130
A few more.

399
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,780
Let's not get stomach upset. I'm not doing this because of money.

400
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:09,300
- Excuse me. Please give us spicy stir-fried chicken with cheese and fish cake soup!
- Yes.

401
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,460
Hyung, stop ordering.

402
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,340
Hye Ji, you like spicy stir-fried chicken with cheese. Right?

403
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:16,150
How did you know?

404
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:20,700
I didn't subscribe to your youtube channel, I only saw the comments. Only the comments.

405
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,190
Hyung, why would you say that.

406
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,340
Hye Ji, don't worry about him.

407
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:28,100
You are more burdensome.

408
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,770
What does a Manito do?

409
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:34,080
Anything is fine. What are you going to do... for me?

410
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,620
Huh?

411
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,070
You are not my Manito. Don't misunderstand.

412
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,820
Let's stop ordering, I think we are all full.

413
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:53,370
No, order.

414
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,250
Especially you can order anything you want.

415
00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:58,460
Yeo Joon, you don't even think of paying.

416
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,490
I am not Myeongil University's ATM anymore.

417
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,510
I don't have my gold card.

418
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:06,830
Congrats on becoming a human and not a machine.

419
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,070
Senior Soo Hyun has changed a lot.

420
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,780
We have chosen our Manito also, shall we talk about the project now?

421
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:19,830
You didn't change.

422
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:21,960
Let's drink more.

423
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,200
Drink! Drink! Drink! Cheers!

424
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,550
Senior, you should also do this.

425
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:30,980
Nam Soo Hyun, cheers! Cheers!

426
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:34,250
Bottoms up.

427
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:40,440
I don't force myself to smile anymore.

428
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,290
What took away my mask?

429
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,140
Bottoms up!

430
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,830
Drink up.

431
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:58,090
Yeo Joon, get up! Yeo Joon.

432
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,260
Let me sleep a bit more.

433
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,880
Get up, you'll be late for class.

434
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,870
Let me sleep a bit more. A bit more.

435
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:10,880
I can't stay still for you.

436
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,540
Please. Don't be my Manito, please.

437
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:20,890
Get up! Get up, you'll be late for class.

438
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:22,320
Let me sleep a little longer.

439
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,280
You'll be late for class, get up!

440
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,340
- Get up!
- Ah! Please!

441
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,370
You aren't late thanks to me.

442
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,340
Thank you.

443
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:39,490
Who the hell is my Manito?

444
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:42,790
They do nothing for me.

445
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:45,530
Maybe your Manito is doing a good job at staying anonymous.

446
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:52,370
Huh!

447
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:58,300
♫ We don't have such things, No sad ending ♫

448
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,230
He's being so obvious.

449
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,320
He thinks this is being anonymous.

450
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:10,330
♫ Talk to me ♫

451
00:37:10,330 --> 00:37:12,850
♫ Ever since I met you ♫

452
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:16,810
♫ My eyes are full with you ♫

453
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,720
How is the script going?

454
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,850
Ah, don't get me started.

455
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:24,450
I can't go to sleep at night, feeding my hunger for creativity.

456
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:29,790
But my Manito won't stop waking me up early in the morning.

457
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,820
Soo Hyun?

458
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,680
Why does my forever Manito look like she has some worries?

459
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,890
To make sure my boyfriend's precious script is put to good use, I need to find a great casting.

460
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:48,630
But I don't know who to ask. I don't have connections.

461
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:51,890
What's wrong with not having connections. Go up to anyone.

462
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:55,210
They will agree after seeing My Bin's charms.

463
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,910
I want you as the male lead. Myeongil University's most popular guy, Yeo Joon.

464
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,870
Let me use my boyfriend for this.

465
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:04,360
My appearance fee is expensive.

466
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:06,470
Talk to my manager.

467
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,100
- Manager?
- Yes.

468
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,480
Business Administration Second Year, Kim So Bin.

469
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,300
Mr. Celebrity, let's go to our next schedule.

470
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,640
I don't want to work. I want to go to meet my girlfriend.

471
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:24,250
I miss her so much.

472
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,010
Please hold it in. We have to succeed.

473
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,910
- No, I don't want to work.
- No, no, you have to work.

474
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:34,520
- Do I have to work?
- Yes, you have to work.

475
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,160
What are you going to do?

476
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,210
Blind date.

477
00:38:38,210 --> 00:38:39,830
You do those things, also?

478
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,200
My classmate wanted me to go instead of her.

479
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:48,700
Instead? Is that how you date and get married instead?

480
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:52,240
What is this? Are you being jealous?

481
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,280
You don't meet random people.

482
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:57,560
Not random people. He works at our college's library.

483
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,290
3rd-year student in Law.

484
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:02,610
I looked him up secretly.

485

Yes. Just my style.

488

494

I know you don't go to the library.

496

What are you saying? I go to the library to drink the vitamin drink.

497
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,240
Because I heard the ones from the vending machine over there taste good.

498
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,410
I'll get going then, to have a vitamin drink from the library.

499

510

It's so sweet. Why would you drink this when your insides hurt?

511
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,120
You need to coat your stomach with something sweet.

512
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,580
Even I don't feel my insides.

513
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,990
You confessed but got turned down. Is there something other than that?

514
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:08,470
There is. I still have feelings for her.

515
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:12,610
These feelings are stubborn. They don't know when to give up.

516
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:16,590
How did you endure those 7 years, when you felt that way all this time?

517
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:19,740
Well, as time passed it became seven years.

518

Who starts an unrequited love by deciding the time period to be seven years?

519

Will I also go along with this for seven years?

521

I lied to Nam Soo Hyun that I'm going on a blind date.

522
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,050
What did he say? He didn't ask you do to it all at once, did he?

523
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,940
He did.

524
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:44,890
I got rejected before even confessing, right?

I cannot do it, as I am not strong enough.

650

651

What style of clothes should I go for?

660

663

Whatever you are good at.

664
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:37,230
I sing all of them well, so it's a bit difficult to pick.

665

You should be at the center of everyone's attention that day,

668

We have come up with a promotional video for Fashion brand 'G'.

721

What is the brand catchphrase?

722

This is not simply about fashion,

It was creative and the story was also good.

But why are you asking that?

734

I don't think we will get the best grade if we go on like this.
