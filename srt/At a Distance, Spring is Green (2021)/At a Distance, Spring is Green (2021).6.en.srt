00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,410
Stop acting so high and mighty and get lost.

[Vitamin]

17
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,190
It seems I get angry every time I come across you.

18
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,820
It's because my reality sucks.

19
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,830
I have lived my life without even having the leisure to think about things like that, but I get angry when I see you.

20
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:58,420
People live the way they are used to, as that is convenient.

21
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,420
Even if they try to change, they end up going back to being what their mind and body are used to.

22
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:06,650
As I am used to living.

23

As I was used to living.

24
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,050
Leave.

25
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,650
You too, weren't able to finish?

26
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,320
What are you doing?

27
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,560
A composite sketch. To look for a person.

28
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,160
What do you think?

29
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,210
I will be able to find this person quickly, right?

30
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:56,820
Just look for him with this. This is quicker.

31
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,060
It looks the same.

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,610
I cannot capture his handsomeness in a picture.

Who is it?

34
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,390
Could this be Yeo Joon?

Yeo Joon?

36
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,470
Ah, that popular freshman? It's complete chaos in our department.

37
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,860
They're calling her the "open-air concubine," because people found out Yeo Joon was dating her at the open theatre.

38
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:18,290
Why is it Kim So Bin?

39
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,580
- Kim So Bin?
- Yeah.

40
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,800
- Which Kim So Bin?
- 3rd-year Business Administration, Kim So Bin.

41
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,000
There must be another person with the same name.

I have the picture. Look.

43
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:33,040
Some haven't given up yet. They say they will break up soon.

44
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,280
They think they have a shot, too, I guess.

Mi Joo, are you unable to close your mouth?

46
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:44,930
Shall I close it for you?

47
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:48,180
But I don't have any energy today.

48
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,320
They are saying that Kim So Bin is dating Yeo Joon.

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,000
Did I take a bath too long?

50
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,920
Shall I dry your hair with cold air? Just say the word.

51
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,110
Why are you guys being like this? Did I do something wrong?

52
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,460
What do you mean? The female lead cannot make mistakes.

53

What is it?

54
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,350
I heard you are the open-air concubine celebrity.

55

Open-air concubine?

56
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,810
They are saying that two guys fought over you at the open-air theatre.

57
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:26,520
Yeo Joon and a guy with a loud voice.

58
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,160
All people passing by could hear the guy who was so loud.

59
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:34,750
Oh no! I am so embarrassed. Hong Chan Ki!

60
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:38,060
You must have laughed so much at us all while we were talking about having a crush.

61
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:42,200
We should have got it when a guy came looking for her so late at night.

62
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,350
- Such an idiot!
- It's nothing like that.

63

Stop teasing me.

64
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,150
I misunderstood and hurt him all by myself.

65
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:59,170
What do I do now?

66
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:03,050
Can I not give him anything other than a vitamin drink?

67
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:06,010
I cut him off unilaterally.

68
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,750
How do I make it all right?

69
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,430
Why don't I have a house with other rooms?

70
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,180
Student, you came again.

71
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,010
Hello. You remember me.

72
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,400
No one asks about the meaning behind a flower these days.

73
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,010
I am going to ask today, too.

74
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,970
Do you think you are Mathilda or something?

75
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:03,340
Have you come looking for the loud Léon?

76
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,760
- Excuse me—
- I am not buying it.

77
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,820
- Joon...
- I know I look nice.

78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,440
I have nothing to give you.

79
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,000
- I am telling you, I am not buying it.
- Please accept it.

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,650
One day you ask to not see each other again, then again come to me with flowers and ask me to accept it on another day.

81
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,560
And you said that you were not sure what kind of a person I was.

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
Then, what about you?

83
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,470
It's called "Hyacinth." Look up its flower language meaning.

84
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,470
Meaning? Why?

85
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:36,250
Why not send me a message through those pigeons over there?

86
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:41,120
I have a pigeon phobia, so I can't do that, even if I wanted to.

87
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,730
You were not the one who spread the rumors. I am sorry for misunderstanding and accusing you.

88
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:49,350
I have a bit of a hard time being the center of everyone's attention.

89
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,700
Not a bit, a lot.

90
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,730
I am also sorry that I took my anger out on you when in reality I have some issues.

91
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:58,510
This flower signifies my feelings.

92
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,700
What does the flower signify?

93
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:05,600

96

Eternal love?

97
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,160
Who confesses their love in the old analog way out of nowhere?

98
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,590
Nothing's eternal.

99
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:25,280
Am I supposed to stop being upset just with this one thing?

100
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,680
Do you think I am this easy a guy?

101
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,270
About the team assignment...

102
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:34,900
Why did you give us the important materials and go there?

103
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,930
Come to us.

104
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,320
I will wait.

105
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,550
Hey, Kim So Bin, give us Joon's material.

106
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,650
Joon's on our side, so it's ours.

107
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:59,280
Ask Joon.

108
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,050
- I don't have the right to say anything.
- Joon is nice, so he can't take it from you.

109
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:03,950
You give it to us.

110
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,330
I don't want to.

111
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,660
Will you move?

112
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,150
The issue isn't about you liking it or not.

113
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:13,880
Let it be. This is petty. Let it go, Hye Ji.

114
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,550
- Even if we don't have it—
- What do you mean by "let it be"?

115
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:20,280
Joon is with us. But what are we supposed to do if they have the material?

116
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,730
- It does not make any sense.
- Even I think so.

117
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:27,080
So Bin, you are more stubborn than I thought.

118
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:30,600
- You will give it to us right?
- Answer us.

119

Why can't she talk now?

121

What are you doing right now?

126
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,190
I just asked her to give back your material.

127
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:51,590
Then, you could have just asked me. Why are you doing this to Senior?

128
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:54,830
Joon, you are being weird.

129
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:58,020
- Whose side are you on?
- I'm quitting this group.

130
00:08:58,020 --> 00:09:00,230
Are you betraying us?

131
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,560
Let's go.

132
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,180
How many classes do you have left for the day?

133
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,600
I think it's better for you to go home and rest.

134
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,920
No, I have a lot of classes including liberal arts ones.

135
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,860
What can I do to make you feel better?

136
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,520
Does eating help you regain energy?

137
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,730
I just heard it from someone,

138
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,860
but only I don't know anything.

139
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,790
It becomes all right after some time has passed.

140
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,230
- About that—
- If you don't want to talk about it,

141
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,450
you don't have to talk about it.

142
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,090
Although I do want to know really badly.

143
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,140
It's not because I don't want to tell you

144
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:02,770
or because I think you won't understand.

145
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,870
Then?

146
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,530
Words...

147
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,890
Nothing will come out.

148
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:18,900
Senior,

149
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,030
I know we lived fine without any knowledge of each other,

150
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,520
but I don't want to go back to how it used to be.

151
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,510
Let's go in quickly.

152
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,780
Senior Soo Hyun must be waiting.

153
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,810
I don't care if he waits or not.

154
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,610
We cannot do that to Senior.

155
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,840
I wonder if I'll be accepted here.

156
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,540
Sit down.

157
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:06,900
Senior Soo Hyun asked me to bring you back.

158
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,480
Maybe I'm useful or something.

159
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,990
You must get the grades you earned fairly.

160
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:25,920
Don't involve your personal reasons in the project. You do your part.

161
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,870

Thankfully, he just gave me a great excuse.

Yeah, it's a good thing I fired him.

Let's take ten steps back for one step forward. Why don't we put our names in it and then make a mess of it?

480
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,660
That viper will never let us in.

481
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:28,850
- You want us to put your names in now?
- If not, we are going to tell on you to the professor.

482
00:38:28,850 --> 00:38:31,150
What does the team leader think?

483
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:40,070
So Bin, you know who belittled us and who we left the group for, right? You understand us, right?

484
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:44,790
Right, you look like the kind of person with a lot of empathy.

485
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:47,300
Who is she to hesitate?

486
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,920
I can't.

487
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,760
I won't add your names to the project. That will be a free ride.

488
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,680
Just wait for it.

489
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,450
This is the reason you have to stand on the better side.

490
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,950
Nam Soo Hyun made her like that.

491
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,170
Kim So Bin was not like that.

492
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:17,730
It's not over until it's over.

493
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,350
[Result Analysis]

494
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:31,180
Then today is the final day and Group 5's presentation.

495
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:35,280
Since today marks the last day of group presentations,

496
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,470
I hope that Group 5 does its best until the end to complete it successfully.

497
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:40,190
Let's start.

498
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:45,140
Hello, our Group 5 has decided to do a presentation about the first company in the country,
[Mi Jin Foods Marketing Success Strategy]

499
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:48,650
Mi Jin Foods, who ranked 1st in the East-Asian market last year.

500
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,470
We will also analyze the cause for Ping Pong, their main beverage's, success, failure, and reform.

501
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,340
...created a virtuous cycle, which successfully reconstructed the business.

502
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,180
Right. On this note, we'll conclude Group 5's presentation and move on to the Q&A session.

503
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,720
[Kim So Bin / A]
[Nam Soo Hyun / A]
[Yeo Joon / A]

504
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:13,910
- They did a great job.
- Nam Soo Hyun did well as expected.

505
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,710
But...

506
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:17,860
there are only 3 people here.

507
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,030
Weren't there 6 people, originally?

508
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:24,200
Ah, we left the group because of unavoidable reasons.

509
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:28,270
Tell me what those unavoidable reasons are.

510
00:40:28,270 --> 00:40:31,100
We did everything possible as groupmates,

511
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:34,170
but we were excluded due to Nam Soo Hyun's arbitrary decision.

512
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:37,030
Nam Soo Hyun made that arbitrary decision by himself?

513
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,940
Wasn't the team leader, Kim So Bin?

514
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,250
The thing is...

515
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:45,480
We actively participated in researching the data and attended the meetings.

516
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,670
But because we had to follow Senior Nam Soo Hyun's personal likes and dislikes,

517
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:51,060
the team broke up, Professor.

518
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:57,630
It seems like Nam Soo Hyun's powers are incredible.

519
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:59,050
So?

520
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,320
Is it the end after you guys got kicked out?

521
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:07,090
You should've tried to do something, like join again.

522
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:10,560
Nam Soo Hyun played solo, controlling So Bin who was too shy to refute,

523
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:14,270
and a mere freshman who doesn't know anything. There was nothing we could do.

524
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:17,210
We didn't slack off preparing for this topic, nevertheless.

525
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:20,350
Can you prove what you guys are saying?

526
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:23,140
If you can't, the situation becomes serious.

527
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,160
Then I will ask a question to the presenters.

528
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,930
Ping Pong was a failed drink

529
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:32,560
and made a brand story called 'Ping Pong Family' to fulfill their business reform.

530
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,720
The Ping Pong family consists of a grandfather, a grandmother, a father, a mother, a son, and a daughter,

531
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,030
and were presented as a "perfect family."

532
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,810
I'll watch your stuff for you.

533
00:41:47,810 --> 00:41:50,030
Don't worry and go.

534
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,800
Thank you.

535
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,820
Then I'll leave this to you.

536
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:04,890
Hye Ji, I got my hands on So Bin's presentation notes.

537
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:09,560
Wow! Take pictures and send them to me. I'll treat you to lunch for a week.

538
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,900
[Expected Questions]
[The title of perfect family could be seen as a discriminatory term.]

539
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,890
What do you mean by perfect family?

540
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:17,940
Then, are you saying that a family that doesn't have complete members is an imperfect family?

541
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:24,170
Isn't it unethical for a company to produce results based on such discriminatory values?

542
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:26,380
- I will answer that.
- No.

543
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,480
You stay still. Let's see if Yeo Joon and Kim So Bin...

544
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,990
served only as sidekicks.

545
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:37,420
Or if you really prepared it together.

546
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,150
I have to confirm it for myself.

547
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,810
It is true that Yeo Joon helped us sincerely but he's a freshman.

548
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,620
Please take that into consideration.

549
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,510
Okay. Freshman pass.

550
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,000
Then,

551
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,280
Kim So Bin.

552
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:54,300
Come forward and present it.

553
00:43:06,870 --> 00:43:08,460
Sure.

554
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:21,100
Are they really sidekicks?

555
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:24,560
- He's right.
- Did she even do anything?

556
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,700
So annoying.

557
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,070
With boys...

558
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,290
Gosh, really...

559
00:43:33,290 --> 00:43:35,990
She's so annoying...

560
00:43:35,990 --> 00:43:39,880
Why is she there?

561
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,840
Kim So Bin.

562
00:43:47,350 --> 00:43:49,960
- Yes.
- This is serious.

563
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,560
Is this really Nam Soo Hyun's solo presentation?

564
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:57,670
If this is how it is, I can't give all three of you marks for Group 5.

565
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,280
I'm- I'm- I'm sorry but—

566
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,600
What? I can't hear you.

567
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,710
Can you repeat the

568
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,530
question again?

569
00:44:42,530 --> 00:44:48,550
What do I think about the negative impact of such discriminatory marketing copy on the public?

570
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:58,320
Do you know why people collect Ping Pong's drink labels?

571
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,900
Labels?

572
00:45:01,060 --> 00:45:03,080
To recycle them.

573
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,110
The PPT material showed only the brand's marketing strategies,

574
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:12,010
but if you look at the details closely...

575
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:14,310
on the backside of labels with the characters drawn on them,

576
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:18,550
each family member's personal story is included, as a raffle.

577
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,740
The stories of each of the ten family members.

578
00:45:21,740 --> 00:45:24,040
What relation does it have with my question?

579
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:26,190
If you collect all of the stories together,

580
00:45:26,190 --> 00:45:30,110
you can see how the Ping Pong family became a family.

581
00:45:30,110 --> 00:45:34,030
The grandfather who was abandoned by his children and lived a homeless life.

582
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,210
The grandmother who started dating the grandfather for the first time in her life.

583
00:45:38,210 --> 00:45:41,870
The dad who lost his entire family in an accident.

584
00:45:41,870 --> 00:45:44,260
The terminally ill mom.

585
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,580
The son who was abandoned in a baby box.

586
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:50,980
The daughter who ran away from home due to domestic violence...

587
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:55,590
If you just look at the title of a perfect family,

588
00:45:55,590 --> 00:45:59,780
it could lead to misunderstandings and backlash from consumers.

589
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:05,210
However, the brand used that negative reaction as a strategy to increase more interest in the product

590
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:09,840
and draw consumers into the real story.

591
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:14,850
- She really is the group leader.
- They did do it together.
- They checked everything.

592
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,360
- Ah, that...
- You seem to have only seen the questions that

593
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,780
- I made and not the answers.
- No!

594
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:25,020
Are you trying to say that I stole a look at your expected questions or what?

595
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:26,750
This is a question that anyone can make.

596
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,760
If you study a bit harder,

597
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:33,930
anyone will know this much.

598
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:37,370
- Ah! Seriously.
- That must be embarrassing.

599
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:39,500
Quiet.

600
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Does that answer your question?

601
00:46:44,150 --> 00:46:47,700
The problem is getting serious.

602
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,440
That's enough.

603
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,980
Let's end it here.

604
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,720
Professor.

605
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:58,080
Then what happens to our group?

606
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,030
For now, I'll only acknowledge you three members from Group 5 who presented today.

607
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,780
Good work.

608
00:47:10,350 --> 00:47:12,880
You did well.

609
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:28,690
Everyone pay attention.

610
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:33,830
The professor asked me to tell you that finals for this class will be based on the group presentations.

611
00:47:33,830 --> 00:47:35,970
Especially from the group that did well.

612
00:47:35,970 --> 00:47:38,360
It will also be uploaded to the notice board soon.

613
00:47:41,610 --> 00:47:45,160
- Could you send me your files?
- Let's exchange with my group.

614
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,080
Let's exchange documents with my group.

615
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,890
- I beg you.
- I need to graduate.

616
00:47:48,890 --> 00:47:52,390
We don't need it. We took notes for it all.

617
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:57,480
You knew from the beginning, didn't you?

618
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,270
You did this to screw us over, didn't you?

619
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,020
Screw over who?

620
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:02,690
I don't have enough time for myself.

621
00:48:02,690 --> 00:48:06,190
If we had known this would be in the exam, we wouldn't have done this.

622
00:48:06,190 --> 00:48:09,970
We should get what we deserve, at least with the school grades.

623
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:16,420
Joon.

624
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,400
- My hands are trembling.
- You did the presentation well.

625
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:28,170
So this is the feeling of accomplishment.

626
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,700
- High five.
- Yay!

627
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,270
Ah! That scared me.

628
00:48:33,270 --> 00:48:36,410
- Senior.
- I thought it was a ghost.

629
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:38,520
I'll treat you guys.

630
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:41,260
- I have to go work part-time.
- Part-time?

631
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,980
Well, I was copying someone.

632
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:46,120
I have to go work part-time.

633
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,650
Ah, Senior! Can't you skip work for just today?

634
00:48:49,650 --> 00:48:51,520
We have to celebrate today.

635
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,300
It seems like you got your job back.

636
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,540
Where?

637
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:55,930
So you knew I got fired.

638
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,970
I went to the canteen and couldn't find you.

639
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:01,690
I thought you got fired because of your temper.

640
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:05,000
Didn't you get my message? To meet later.

641
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,830
I don't have time.

642
00:49:06,830 --> 00:49:09,610
- Joon, you're also not free?
- Of course, I am free.

643
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,660
Shall we go now?

644
00:49:15,770 --> 00:49:17,780
Let's hang onto him more.

645
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,490
Senior!

646
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:30,260
For the first time, I have a friend.

647
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,160
You really won't eat?

648
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:44,460
I can't do my diet because of my roommates. I should at least do it at school.

649
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:46,380
Sit down and wait.

650
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,000
Have a nice meal.

651
00:50:07,610 --> 00:50:09,550
Have a nice meal.

652
00:50:14,410 --> 00:50:16,130
Do you want more?

653
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:20,240
Don't you know me?

654
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,970
- Oh.
- Oh?

655
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:29,880
Please give me more, a lot.

656
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:36,730
Have a nice meal.

657
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:45,950
Where is your chicken breast salad?

658
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:48,250
Aren't you on a low-sodium diet?

659
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:50,450
Starting today, I am on a spicy pork diet.

660
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:55,090
This is very high in sodium. At least eat it with rice. Want some rice?

661
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,570
This place is famous for spicy pork. The texture is not like others.

662
00:50:59,670 --> 00:51:01,510
They only gave you the lean meats.

663
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,300
They must know that you don't eat fat.

664
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,150
Know what?

665
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:08,630
What's wrong? Are you feeling sick?

666
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,810
You seem to have a fever.

667
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,020
Hm, what?

668
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:31,370
You picked up. You picked up!

669
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:33,830
Run after you know where I am.

670
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:42,510
Let's go and fight on a mat. If I don't let my anger out through sports...

671
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,960
You can't win over me.

672
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:47,590
What? Did you let me win all this time?

673
00:51:47,590 --> 00:51:50,180
Yes. You were always excited when you won against me.

674
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:55,870
Hey! Then you should have kept losing! You could've taken my calls. What's this?

675
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:58,330
This isn't the first time. Why are you so worked up?

676
00:51:58,330 --> 00:52:01,220
- At least pick up my calls.
- You should have come and seen me at my B.A. building.

677
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:04,660
I didn't go there on purpose. I was just seeing when you'd actually pick up. I've got a lot of patience.

678
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:07,280
Why would you waste your energy?

679
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,450
I am not going to be friends with you anymore.

680
00:52:10,450 --> 00:52:12,280
Because I didn't pick up your calls?

681
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:13,880
Yes.

682
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,450
I got it.

683
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:18,330
How can you answer so easily? It's a promise then.

684
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:21,870
It's a waste of my phone bills. I should get rid of my phone, too.

685
00:52:21,870 --> 00:52:24,030
Are phone booths still around?

686
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:27,290
Nam Soo Hyun, do you want to eat some ramen?

687
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,820
I have plans.

688
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,100
Now? With who?

689
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,730
With someone.

690
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:39,460
You don't have anything to say to me?

691
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,300
Probably not.

692
00:52:43,300 --> 00:52:45,230
I don't have a place to stay.

693
00:52:49,550 --> 00:52:51,750
Did you cut down on your alcohol consumption?

694
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:55,520
Why don't you give your liver a 5-day work schedule, too? So that it can get some rest.

695
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:00,460
Hey! You never smiled in your life. Now that you're suddenly smiling, my heart is aching.

696
00:53:00,460 --> 00:53:03,700
How can you smile in this situation? How can you smile?

697
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:06,330
- Go, go. I won't smile.
- Where are you going?

698
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:09,090
- Why would I tell that to you, Young Ran?
- We can just go together.

699
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:12,440
- It's on my way.
- It's not somewhere for you to tag along. Just leave.
 Let's just say...

700
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,430
It felt like a cactus thorn had stuck in my heart.

701
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:19,010
- You think I'm funny?
- Stop using your strength on me.

702
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:23,130
- No. We should fight properly. Let's fight.
- Leave, hurry.

703
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:26,870
- Go! What fight? Just go.
- Okay. Where are you going?

704
00:53:39,950 --> 00:53:42,260
Is it that hard to do that for me?

705
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,420
Why are you so slow?

706
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:49,960
If I work with you in a group project one more time, I'll be intoxicated for sure.

707
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,530
It's refreshing.

708
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:55,980
It would be nice if Senior Soo Hyun were here too.

709
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:01,220
Then we wouldn't be able to talk about little Kim So Bin.

710
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:08,360
Then now it's little Yeo Joon's turn.

711
00:54:11,170 --> 00:54:15,560
I was the same as I am now.

712
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,430
Popular and rich?

713
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:22,070
You know it well.

714
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:29,480
You don't really talk about yourself.

715
00:54:31,350 --> 00:54:33,870
You said you weren't curious at all.

716
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:38,720
You also remember things I say to you.

717
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:40,510
Are you like that, too?
(He's using casual language)

718
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:45,050
You can't say that to a noona.

719
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,870
Call me "Noona, So Bin Noona."

720
00:54:51,510 --> 00:54:53,800
I am really going to call you noona.

721
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,770
Then it's the end.

722
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,170
What is?

723
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:05,570
When you don't smile sometimes your eyes look sad.

724
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:10,640
That's just how I feel.

725
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,860
I am a really good listener.

726
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:16,000
You can use me, too.

727
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:25,100
Is Kim So Bin useful to Yeo Joon?

728
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:33,850
Yes. No. Yes. No.

729
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:38,490
I guess not.

730
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:49,050
I wasn't the one to put this in your hair this time.

731
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:56,010
- You keep touching me.
- I touched you again?

732
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,470
Will you only come to your senses if you're arrested?

733
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:05,080
Do it in moderation.

734
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,360
Okay. I'll drink in moderation.

735
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,910
I will just drink ten more cans.

736
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:13,830
You're really going to get into trouble.

737
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:16,190
I'm going to be a big person?
(Big persion = successful)

738
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:28,680
Joon, let's go together.

739
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:52,480
Joon, if I don't tell you this now, I don't think I will ever be able to.

740
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:59,010
Thank you for helping me make up with my past self.

741
00:56:59,010 --> 00:57:01,190
It's all thanks to you.

742
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:08,440
You make me sound like I am a nice person. I am not though.

743
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,220
Are you feeling dizzy?

744
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,970
I'll take you back. Let's go.

745
00:57:17,970 --> 00:57:19,400
No.

746
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:23,840
I like walking by myself.

747
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:30,200
How should I put this? It's like my own healing time.

748
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,740
Then I should also do that too.

749
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,400
We'll just walk apart from each other.

750
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,460
Do it in moderation.

751
00:58:43,270 --> 00:58:46,960
Why do you keep telling me to do it in moderation?

752
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,640
Am I overboard? I am not a girl that goes overboard.

753
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,770
That's my biggest insecurity.

754
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,810
I feel like I am always stuck in the middle. So ambiguous.

755
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:58,320
Be cute in moderation.

756
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,130
Do it in moderation!

757
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:11,660
What are you going to do if I don't do it in moderation?

758
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:14,650
I'll avoid you, Senior.

759
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:18,910
- Huh?
- I won't see Kim So Bin.

760
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,750
I want to see you for a long time, Senior, that's why.

761
00:59:24,330 --> 00:59:27,100
Let's go then.

762
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,680
Tell it to me clearly.

763
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:44,030
The words that you say without even thinking,

764
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,810
make me stay up all night and think

765
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:51,400
about it more than five thousand times.

766
00:59:53,420 --> 00:59:57,570
What do you mean when you say to do it in moderation?

767
00:59:59,050 --> 01:00:01,850
You said you're going to avoid me,

768
01:00:02,530 --> 01:00:04,920
that you're not going to see me,

769
01:00:06,330 --> 01:00:09,280
what does that all mean?

770
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,950
I am scared that I'll start liking you, Senior.

771
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,870
That's why I want you to do everything in moderation.

772
01:00:27,350 --> 01:00:29,750
Then you do it in moderation.

773
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:33,880
I'll do what I want to do.

774
01:00:41,470 --> 01:00:43,710
Will you be able to handle it?

775
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:50,480
- What?
- I will end up hurting you.

776
01:00:58,910 --> 01:01:01,040
I've warned you, Senior.

777
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:05,520
I won't stop once I have started.

🌿 [At a Distance, Spring is Green] 🍃

790
01:01:58,910 --> 01:02:00,790
How many friends do you have?

791
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:03,350
2.5 people?

792
01:02:03,350 --> 01:02:06,080
- Unni, support me.
- Nam Soo Hyun! Nam Soo Hyun—

793
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,200
- I'll confess. Confidently.
- What?

794
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:12,020
- I like you.
- I also like you a lot.

795
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:14,670
- Wait.
- I'm a woman with savings.

796
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:17,190
To our lovely Soo Hyun.

797
01:02:17,190 --> 01:02:19,670
You don't have any intention of telling me about you, right?

798
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,540
- Did he perhaps hurt you?
- What are you doing here?

799
01:02:22,540 --> 01:02:24,950
This is what I learned from watching.

800
01:02:24,950 --> 01:02:26,590
What should we do? Will you be all right?

801
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,620
Even if you split him from his girl best friend, you two aren't made for each other.

802
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:31,680
Her destiny is a different person.
