Let me ask you one thing.

159
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:26,320
What is the reason that you asked a favor

160
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,520
of me whom you hate so much?

161
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,470
Don't lie saying it's for the assignment.

162
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,220
It's because of a friend.

163
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,060
Friend?

164
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:45,420
I made a promise, that I would do it.

165
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,330
You have such a friend?

166
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,260
You don't have to know!

167
00:14:54,830 --> 00:14:58,490
I told you over the phone, too.

168
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,280
Don't come to the family gathering next week. No one's waiting for you.

169
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:08,830
Did you know that I took a DNA test?

170
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,280
To check if my parents are really my parents?

171
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,320
No. Because there is no way that you're my brother.

172
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,350
It's unfortunate but you are my real brother.

173
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,350
If you want this spot, promise that you won't come back home.

174
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:27,920
No, I'll go.

175
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,020
Since when did I listen to you?

176
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,920
No matter how much money you give me, I'll go there.

177
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:06,730
Did you meet the person you waited for?

178
00:16:07,390 --> 00:16:10,150
- Yes.
- Then go fast, the University President is waiting for you.

179
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:11,490
I'm coming now.

180
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,950
How important is he that you even pushed back your meeting to see him?

181
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:45,190
Yeo Joon Wan. Yeo Joon?

182
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,660
Do you have any brothers?

183
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,220
I don't. I'm on my own.

184
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,910
Why did you leave earlier? You saw me, right?

185
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,720
You do stand out wherever I go.

186
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,690
Am I really that great? Do I have a halo above my head or something?

187
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,880
Then that means you can find me anywhere.

188
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,020
Sure.

189
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:20,240
I saw you because I have to tell you something.

190
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:24,040
I'll answer what I couldn't before.

191
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,890
Hold on.

192
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,950
Let me prepare myself.

193
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,550
Do it.

194
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,450
Thanks for telling me how you feel.

195
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:43,490
But what I said about being scared of you

196
00:17:43,490 --> 00:17:47,130
and that I don't know you, still remains.

197
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,510
Do you want to know?

198
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,720
You do, don't you?

199
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,890
A bit, well.

200
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:06,800
It's because I can't hold in my curiosity.

201
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:12,030
Not because I like you. I'll make that clear.

202
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,950
You didn't have to make it so clear. Chill.

203
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:18,490
Don't hold in your curiosity. You'll get constipation.

204
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,210
Okay, okay.

205
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,290
I'll tell you a bit about myself every day.

206
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:29,080
Remember everything. But don't fall for me too hard.

207
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:34,000
No way! I'm not the same old me.

208
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,920
This is my declaration to you! You make sure to remember that.

209
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,660
Strong denial is an affirmation.

210
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:45,990
Okay. Then fall for me a little bit. Although that will be hard.

211
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:48,060
You?

212
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,280
Are you curious about me?

213
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,730
You said it's your first time telling someone how you feel.

214
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:58,510
Did I really have to be the first person?

215
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:02,620
It's not that I'm trying to give some meaning to it—

216
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:06,090
I am curious... about you.

217
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,830
You! If you're going to call me senior then speak formally, and if you're not then speak informally.

218
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,530
Why do you go back and forth? Have some consistency.

219
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,350
I'm going.

220

You don't listen to me at all.

226
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,380
Do you know how much a week of hospital bills cost? Why would you pay for all that?

227
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:34,850
Do you want me to lay there and forget about my life?

228
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:38,140
Do you really hate the idea of being able to rest comfortably for just a week, thanks to me?

Did we agree to give money for the documents?

236
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,090
It's what I owe you.

237
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,520
Did you work all night in this state?

238
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,460
Why did you pay me back so quickly?

239
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:17,970
Did you get a loan?

240
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,020
People like me can't get loans.

241
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,240
Then a loan shark?

242
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:25,530
Senior, are you going to get pulled away one day, get beat up, and buried somewhere?

243
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,320
Enough.

244
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:33,590
Then did you perhaps sell your organs

245
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,500
so that I won't have an excuse to be near you?

246
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,860
Let me see! If your internal organs are all still there.

247
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,550
Why can't you look at me?

00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,190
Did you sell your eyeballs?

249
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:48,110
The hospital bills for the remaining six days should have been canceled. Check them.

250
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,530
I no longer owe you anything.

Who will steal that?

254
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,650
I compensated for the watch with the market price.

255
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:09,110
But tell me the rate if it has a deep connection with you.

00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,150
I don't know it well.

A debt of the heart.

258
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:21,870
A debt of the heart for stomping over a junior's feelings.

So what? You want to eat with me? I don't want to.

320
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:02,310
I think that you copied off a student's work.

321
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,820
I took a chunk and used it because it seemed pretty useful.

322
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,320
What's wrong with that? There was a scum who took my entire work and changed my name to his.

323
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:12,520
My gosh, Professor Choi.

324
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,260
It was because of that Professor Choi, that you took a break from school and disappeared.

325
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:19,150
Do you know how much I searched for you?

326
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:21,230
I know how you felt.

327
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:23,440
But are you following in Professor Choi's footsteps right now?

328
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,770
To be the same kind of person he is?

329
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:29,550
Or to get some kind of revenge...

330
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,510
on Kim So Bin?

331
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:36,360
Kim So... Why are you mentioning Kim So Bin out of nowhere?

332
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,970
This is Kim So Bin's thesis.

333
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:43,660
I had a look at it. Although I only read over it for her.

334
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:47,880
Is that all you see me as?

335
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,560
Let's not cross the line,

336
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,520
Senior Soo Kyung.

337
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,450
Park Si Jae, you watch out which line not to cross. And watch your mouth, too.

338
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,340
Kim So Bin!

339
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:29,790
I ran to you because you called me first.

340
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,210
Did you tell the others?

341
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,100
That we were dating?

342
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,790
Aren't we supposed to be dating secretly?

343
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,780
But if you want to, we can go public.

344
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,200
Only we two know about it.

345
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,580
There's no way Chan Ki told others.

346
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,900
Your words are weird.

347
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:53,500
You're openly taking his side.

348
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,710
And you think I would have done that?

349
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,690
No, what I'm saying is...

350
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:02,000
That isn't a one-sided love. That's a habit.

351
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,100
Whether our relationship is real or fake, don't take Hong Chan Ki's side in front of me.

352
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,920
Whatever it is...

353
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,780
I hate people spreading rumors about me.

354
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,540
You might be used to it but...

355
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,400
I don't like it either.

356
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,640
It is not true...

- They really don't look good together.

Joon had a girlfriend?

I heard the girl wouldn't stop flirting with him.

364

Her mom had an affair and left.

365
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:27,690
No, her dad had an affair so her mom left, and immediately her dad brought in a new wife.

Apologize? Who needs to apologize to whom?

Are you perhaps going to stick to Nam Soo Hyun?

374
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,110
That team has Nam Soo Hyun and Kim So Bin. If you come to us, we will be stronger in numbers.

375
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:28,780
Joon, are you really dating Kim So Bin? Is that the reason that you cannot come to us?

No... well.

- Then Senior, aren't you a nobody, too?
- What?

Hey, Yeo Joon. How can you say that to your senior?

You are always busy. What are you, into politics?

Of course, I am into it. Why shouldn't I?

To make me understand that whenever you look at me you are reminded of dogs?

When I open my wallet, I'm reminded of yours.

When I see your home, I think of my home.

I see. You even gave up your place to pay me back.

546

He didn't answer;

552
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:58,410
instead, he took out papers of loans, his salary, the money they spent on me,

553
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:01,710
and showed me all of those numbers.

554
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,990
He probably thought it was the fastest way for me to understand.

Is there any benefit for you by asking?

Think of that first.

628

You don't get to know the truth just by asking.

629

00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:58,460
Because there was a reason for you to be fired.

637
00:52:58,460 --> 00:53:01,300
What will you do with knowing that?

638
00:53:01,300 --> 00:53:04,820
I don't want to hate myself.

639
00:53:05,650 --> 00:53:12,550
Even if I hate myself, I would like to know what part I should hate and what I should fix.

640
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:17,650
I didn't like you from the beginning.

641
00:53:17,650 --> 00:53:23,980
I don't like people who are incompetent but greedy and use other people.

642
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:29,830
I judged you as being lacking from the beginning, so I can't help but continue to see you as such.

643
00:53:29,830 --> 00:53:32,400
Wouldn't that be stressful for you too?

644
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,500
I would only point out all your faults.

645
00:53:39,020 --> 00:53:39,710
But you...

646
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:43,550
I'm sorry if I came across as rude.

647
00:53:43,550 --> 00:53:46,350
Thank you for your answer.

648
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:03,960
[Myeongil University]

649
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,010
These documents?

650
00:54:11,010 --> 00:54:13,120
Yeo Joon did it.

651
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:22,160
He gave this to you and went over there?

652
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,400
So that means...

653
00:54:26,590 --> 00:54:28,560
his mind changed in that time.

654
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,890
I have to go to my part-time job.

655
00:54:30,890 --> 00:54:33,570
Let's prepare as we planned.

656
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,250
Yes.

657
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:43,190
Shall we meet in a new place?

658
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,290
Give me a lot of meat without onions.

659
00:54:47,290 --> 00:54:49,640
I have an onion allergy.

660
00:54:52,470 --> 00:54:54,420
Are you ignoring us now?

661
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:56,390
He just doesn't want to do it.

662
00:54:56,390 --> 00:54:59,130
He just wants you to die eating onions.

663
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:01,400
Did you come here looking for me?

664
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:03,620
It must be hard for you working,

665
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,440
so we'll do the project and add your name.

666
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,550
Aren't you thankful?

667
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:13,060
I will do it alone with Kim So Bin and will not add your names.

668
00:55:15,790 --> 00:55:18,630
Do as you want. Let's see who wins.

669
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:22,980
Ah, why isn't our Joon coming?

670
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:25,470
Joon says that he's scared of Nam Soo Hyun.

671
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,050
Because he snatched money from him.

672
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:28,440
I see, that's how it was.

673
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,380
You are 25 years old and snatching your junior's money.

674
00:55:32,380 --> 00:55:34,750
I feel ashamed as a senior.

675
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,460
Is Joon running a loan-sharking business by any chance?

676
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,230
Maybe he lends money and earns a load of interest on it.

677
00:55:40,230 --> 00:55:43,170
A man of two faces?

678
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:46,240
Maybe he's a psychopath?

679
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:48,390
Do you not have a brain?

680
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,150
What?

681
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:53,780
I was wondering what you were thinking while living.

682
00:55:55,830 --> 00:55:58,280
Maybe you don't have thoughts at all.

683
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,890
Hey! Seriously!

684
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,440
I can't hold back anymore.

685
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,490
Hey! Come here immediately.

686
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:05,630
Come here, I said.

687
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,040
What's wrong with you?

688
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,800
Nam Soo Hyun!

689
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,730
You didn't go home, right?

690
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:20,340
We're in the school cafeteria. Hurry over Joon.

691
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:29,590
The psycho and Jung Ho had a fight.

692
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,650
You fight with your friends at your workplace?

693
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,190
Is this your playground?

694
00:56:39,190 --> 00:56:40,000
I'm sorry.

695
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,460
The food you wasted,

696
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:44,890
the cost for ingredients, the cost of labor. Pay for all of it.

697
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:47,220
That... You can compensate for it in my pay.

698
00:56:47,220 --> 00:56:51,170
What are you talking about!? Of course, you're fired!

699
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:55,590
Kids these days have thick skulls these days.

700
00:56:55,590 --> 00:56:58,520
I was trying to look at you favorably because you're a student here.

701
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:01,480
Is earning money a joke to you?

702
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,160
Please overlook this just once!

703
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,500
- I'll try harder! I'll try harder!
- Let go.

704
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:09,090
Let go. Let go.

705
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:10,430
- I'll...
- I said let go!

706
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:11,740
Give me one more chance, I'll work really hard.

707
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,260
I said you're fired! Fired!

708
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,020
Get out of my face. Hurry!

709
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:22,400
Seriously...

710
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,550
He was making up all types of excuses.

711
00:57:36,550 --> 00:57:38,710
I fired him.

712
00:57:38,710 --> 00:57:43,240
He asked me to let him sleep in the lounge room. That already didn't please me.

713
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:46,640
You should have said so in advance.

714
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:49,320
It's not that hard to make a place for you.

715
00:57:49,320 --> 00:57:51,190
Hold on.

716
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,720
Oh, no, it's nothing.

717
00:58:35,300 --> 00:58:37,020
Yeo Joon!

718
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,540
Since when have you been here?

719
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,250
The group meeting had ended.

720
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:58,910
About that...

721
00:59:00,350 --> 00:59:03,280
I shouldn't have called you there.

722
00:59:04,310 --> 00:59:06,270
I'm sorry.

723
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,000
I ate well, so what's wrong?

724
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,580
I found you pitiful.

725
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,140
I also get your anxiety.

726
00:59:28,450 --> 00:59:32,080
I think I may have even felt a little relieved. That life is fair, after all.

727
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:35,380
It's not like your misery will be my happiness.

728
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,410
I was rotten.

729
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,860
Without even having a home, who is calling who pitiful?

730
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,400
Don't be arrogant.

731
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:52,840
I didn't know this before...

732
00:59:53,860 --> 00:59:57,500
We can only communicate if our standards are similar.

733
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:01,960
It was interesting so I was curious, but it wasn't very amusing.

734
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,950
I'm going to stop.

735
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:09,430
It's hard to quit a habit.

736
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:12,980
People should live as they are, that is comfortable.

737
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:17,140
Even if they try to change, they will go back to their old self because their mind or body remembers it.

738
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:22,950
It's the same for me. Even if I'm determined, I'll go back.

739
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,290
What are you saying?

740
01:00:25,290 --> 01:00:26,470
I know that you're not being truthful!

741
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:29,010
What do you know!?

742
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:37,990
Stop acting all high and mighty, and just get lost.

743
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:49,950
It's scary.

744
01:00:49,950 --> 01:00:52,800
I am scared to go out of my comfort zone.

745
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:56,760
I'm scared.

746
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:12,730
♫ Talk to me ♫

747
01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:17,650
♫ On a beautiful sunny day, I'll come pick you up ♫

748
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:19,220
♫ Woo~ To me ♫

749
01:01:19,220 --> 01:01:23,200
♫ Talk to me ♫

750
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:30,400
♫ Ever since I met you, my eyes are full with you ♫

751
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,280
🌿 At a Distance, Spring is Green 🍃

752
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,020
- The thing is...
- I'm not interested.

753
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,860
It's okay if you can't or won't help.

754
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,260
You kept your promise, right?

755
01:01:43,260 --> 01:01:44,390
I won't be fooled.

756
01:01:44,390 --> 01:01:46,930
Then let me ask a question to the presenter.

757
01:01:46,930 --> 01:01:48,140
Nam Soo Hyun, stay quiet.

758
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,520
Kim So Bin, come forward and present it.

759
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:51,690
What did you say?

760
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:53,680
We can't hear you!

761
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,510
I'm so sorry.

762
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:59,800
We did live better when we didn't know each other, but I don't want to go back to that time.

763
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,210
Be cute in moderation.

764
01:02:01,210 --> 01:02:03,110
What if I don't do it moderately?

765
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,980
I'm warning you.

766
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:06,560
I won't stop if I start.

767
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:09,880
Montage. I'm looking for someone.

768
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:11,110
You don't know me?

769
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,320
Enjoy your meal.

770
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,920
I don't want to be your friend.

771
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:15,720
Hi-five

772
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:16,740
Yay!

773
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:17,690
Dang, you scared me.

774
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:20,930
For the first time, I have real friends.

775
01:02:20,930 --> 01:02:23,960
♫ I knew right away ♫
