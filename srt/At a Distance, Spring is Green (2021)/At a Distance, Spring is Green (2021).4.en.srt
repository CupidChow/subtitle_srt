00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,720
What time do you think it is?

164
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,310
I'm only late by ten minutes. Ten minutes!

165
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,990
Just ten minutes?

166
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,570
I told you to come on time.

167
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,640
You really have no sense of time. How will you be on time for the test?

168
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,930
I don't know where I am!

169
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:19,810
I'm at the fountain. Brother, you come here.

170
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,530
The nagging!

171
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:26,380
I skipped my test so that I can be here when he doesn't have class!

172
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:34,200
It'll take some time before he gets here, right? I'm going to look around the campus.

173
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,170
Wow. That—

174
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,080
You're at it again.

175
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,760
If you bleach your hair, your scalp will suffer.

176
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,420
Is it your hair? Your scalp? Who cares?

177
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,820
I know because I've done it before.

178
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:53,590
Senior, you cursed with your eyes saying I'm an oldie, didn't you?

179
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:55,670
How am I an oldie? Me?

180
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,500
Then, what is it?

181
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:03,530
My small expectation is that I would be able to sit down with students and talk about life.

182
00:14:03,530 --> 00:14:08,510
Because I've lived before them, so I just want to teach them.

183
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:11,400
That's being an oldie, Professor Park.

184
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,460
♫ Just tell me if you need anything ♫

185
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,630
♫ I'll do it all for you ♫

186
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:50,320
♫ I think about you every day ♫

187
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,270
♫ In every moment of my life, your existence is everywhere ♫

188
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,160
♫ We don't have sad scenes like a breakup movie ♫

189
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:04,220
♫ No sad endings ♫

190
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,820
Oh, that was high.

191
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,920
♫ You won't know how much I like you ♫

192
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,100
Not bad.

193
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,910
He's good!

194
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,730
Oh, Senior Soo Hyun!

195
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:33,850
Oh!

196
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:41,320
We're matching today.

197
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,670
Did you copy me?

198
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,830
Why don't you take off your pants while you're at it?

199
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:53,750
In your underwear. Nice and cool.

200
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,580
You have a strange ability.

201
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,920
What is it? I have so many.

202
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,540
Ignoring whatever a senior says.

203
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:04,620
And responding however you want with a smile on your face.

204
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,380
I'm not like that to just anyone.

205
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:15,200
It could be just as you said, that I'm more like this because you're not interested in me.

206
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,050
But why do I think you're just being pretentious, like me.

207
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,810
Pretentious?

208
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:23,190
I'm the one who is all grins,

209
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,470
but it seems like you actually like me, but you're holding back.

210
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:29,160
Is that not also pretentious?

211
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,550
You smiled!

212
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:39,930
I don't know why I keep having to say these words to you, but listen...

213
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:44,120
The world also has people who don't like you.

214
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:47,000
There are.

215
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,290
But not you, from what I can tell.

216
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,380
I'll apologize. Not knowing what you're really like,

217
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,700
I talked about you wearing a mask or whatever.

218
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:02,100
Just ignore it. You know what kind of person I am, and it's not just towards you.

219
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,940
That apology...I'll take it in the form of a meal. Please treat me to a meal.

220
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:16,050
I heard no one has been treated to a meal by you. I want to be the first.

221
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:20,320
Even if I say I'll buy it, you won't eat, so buy me a meal.

222
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,630
Why do I have to get you a meal?

223
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,240
What's with that guy?

224
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:45,360
Look at him. He can't take his eyes off of Mi Joo.

225
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,920
You haven't found a model yet, right? How about him?

226
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,240
Forget it.

227
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,460
Excuse me. Would you like to be our model?

228
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,660
- Model?
- Don't do it.

229
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,410
She's looking for a model. You would have to see her every week.

230
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:03,180
What? Every week? With her?

231
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,610
I said stop it.

232
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,040
Are you confident?

233
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:11,060
Of course! I have confidence in my physique. Want to see it?

234
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,270
What are you doing here?

235
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,570
Brother...

236
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,490
Let's go.

237
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,440
Excuse me!

238
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,380
Did I ask you to strip?

239
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,250
No, that was me.

240
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,400
You're looking at us as if we've all committed sexual assault or something.

241
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,910
- Were you not?
- Of course not!

242
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:42,890
Then I misunderstood since you were all ogling him.

243
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,570
Please apologize.

244
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,740
Apologize for misunderstanding.

245
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:54,260
I can't do that, since I can't confirm the truth.

246
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:08,730
Hello! I'm Senior Soo Hyun's junior, my name is Yeo Joon.

247
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,450
What? Junior?

248
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:14,280
A junior to this rude Nam Soo Hyun?

249
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,330
You don't hate it?

250
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,220
My anger is better than your nasty personality.

251
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:20,820
Just stay still.

252
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:23,030
Thank you for being my brother's junior.

253
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:26,790
I'm Nam Soo Hyun's one and only younger sibling, Nam Goo Hyeon.

254
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,730
It's my first time seeing something this fascinating.

255
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,360
Why is someone like you his junior?

256
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,320
Excuse me, but does he have something on you?

257
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,030
Shut your mouth and get going.

258
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,870
It hurts! It hurts!

259
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,590
I skipped training and didn't even have lunch yet, because you said you'd show me the study room. I'm going to tell Mom!

260
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:48,990
Okay, go ahead and brag to Mom about stripping in front of the female students, too.

261
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:51,660
Excuse me. Would you like to have a meal together?

262
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:56,080
- Please save me, his nagging...
- Nam Goo Hyeon!

263
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,360
- Sure, let's go together.
- That's great!

264
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
Hyung, what tastes good?

265
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,810
The cutlet tastes good.

266
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,940
Then I'll have a cutlet and... cheese ramyeon!

267
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,050
I'll buy it.

268
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,880
Then, were you planning on letting your junior pay?

269
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,140
It's a first.

270
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,750
Hurry up and choose.

271
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,580
Please.

272
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:41,990
What should I have that would start rumors that say I ate well...

273
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,480
Army stew?

274
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:54,160
What's with your hair? For someone who's getting ready to become a police officer...

275
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,260
Once I become a police officer, I can't dye my hair like this. So I'm enjoying it while I can.

276
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,020
This punk...

277
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:11,810
Eat this meat, too.

278
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:14,510
- You're not eating?
- You just eat.

279
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:18,880
Comb your hair! What is this?

280
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,910
Eat the beans.

281
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:38,950
Hurry up and eat it.

282
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,900
Hurry up and eat.

283
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,530
Eat.

284
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,910
I'm going to the restroom.

285
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,530
Wow, you've got a really nice watch.

286
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:08,520
Do you like my watch?

287
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,600
I'll get going.

288
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,230
Come here.

289
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:23,170
What? What are you going to nag about now?

290
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,560
Eat well and make sure to circulate the air.

291
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,590
Look after yourself and rest properly.

292
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,140
Go.

293
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,660
Don't abandon my brother. He's a pitiful person.

294
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,070
You're not going!?

295
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,590
I'm going, I'm going. I'll see you again!

296
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,510
You're not going?

297
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:56,010
I should.

298
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,420
You're quite tender towards your younger brother.

299
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:07,510
Tender? What's that?

300
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,660
It's how you are with your younger brother.

301
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:15,490
You don't have siblings?

302
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,020
I don't. I'm on my own.

303
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:22,430
It's more comfortable alone. You don't have anything to be concerned about.

304
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,090
Go ahead first. Thank you for the meal.

305
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,440
Okay.

306
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,370
Senior.

307
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,970
What now?

308
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:33,990
Can I call you again?

309
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:36,810
No. Don't.

310
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:39,460
You could call first.

311
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,860
That won't happen.

312
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:46,220
I even got a meal from Nam Soo Hyun.

313
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:48,420
You don't know me yet.

314
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,220
Go.

315
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,580
Oh? It's my girlfriend.

316
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,650
Cute.

317
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:07,790
It would be nice if someone like you were my girlfriend.

318
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,680
Hye Ji.

319
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:21,450
Why did you call? It's so bothersome.

320
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,030
Oh...

321
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:25,690
Sorry. Should I hang up?

322
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:29,150
You believe anything I say. Will you really not come today?

323
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:31,710
Yeah... that's why I'm worried.

324
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:35,300
If anything happens, take care of it.

325
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,980
You're good at things like that.

326
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:40,660
Why does everyone keep saying I'm so good at things?

327
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:45,520
I'll count on you then. Thank you. Bye.

328
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:51,490
Worrying about nothing.

329
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:04,660
Why are you acting shy?

330
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,170
Hye Ji, let's go eat.

331
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,330
Please stop.

332
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:15,510
- Hye Ji.
- All right, So Bin and Hye Ji sent their parts through email.

333
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:18,200
If you haven't sent your part yet, give them to me now.

334
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,120
This punk...

335
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:30,280
Senior! You saw my materials, right? Let's start with that.

336
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,030
Your resources were pretty impressive.

337
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:37,370
Once I set my mind to something I get it done properly.

338
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,930
Well, I can't say it was done properly.

339
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,460
What?

340
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,200
Why?

341
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,980
I researched three different marketing strategies. And I did go a little overboard with the brand concepts,

342
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,810
but the content was abundant.

343
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:56,350
Mijin Foods is a conglomerate. You ignored the advantages of conglomerates' distribution networks;

344
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,130
and because you focused on the advertising too much, it's not realistic.

345
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:05,780
There were also so many typos, that it seemed like you just didn't know grammar. I checked through all of them.

346
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,040
And there was a lot of repeated information.

347
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,480
Didn't you just copy it?

348
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,940
If we turn this into the professor, he'll say it's cheating.

349
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,400
First grammatical errors and now cheating?

350
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,270
You're so nit-picky.

351
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:22,260
We're on limited time, go easy on it!

352
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,360
If you don't have enough time, give me your part first.

353
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,910
Yes, of course, I should hand that in.

354
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:33,930
However, isn't there something you should give to me first?

355
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,180
I did hold back because he was trembling, but

356
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:44,110
you never properly apologized to me for that day.

357
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,900
Apologize...?

358
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,980
Did you prepare your part or not?

359
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,520
Is that the issue right now!?

360
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,030
So,

361
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:56,800
you didn't do it, did you?

362
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:01,270
If you look down on us that much, does it make you feel good?

363
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:07,010
Hearing I'm a stupid cheater from such a smart ass like you,

364
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:11,660
I can't be a part of this team anymore. I'm leaving.

365
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:18,580
Yeah. I knew this would happen.

366
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,700
You do well alone, you jerk.

367
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,780
Hey. Come out.

368
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,490
Why didn't you follow them?

369
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,060
I'm not sure.

370
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,170
I'll do the research with Junior So Bin, so you don't have to do anything.

371
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:52,970
You are a first-year, and I don't have any expectations of you.

372
00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:02,470
Why are you predetermining that I won't be good at it? I may turn out to be good.

373
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:08,340
Are you perhaps planning on toying with me instead of Junior So Bin?

374
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:11,170
Did I play around with So Bin?

375
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,550
You should joke around after knowing the person. You get hurt as much as you hurt people.

376
00:28:16,550 --> 00:28:21,230
If that's the case then you will be the one to get hurt a lot.

377
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:28,540
You said it's hard to get marketing data for Mijin Group, right? I heard this time that's going to be the key to this presentation.

378
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,570
I'll do it.

379
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,900
- You?
- Believe in me this one time. See if I'm playing around or not.

380
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:45,660
I don't have a hobby of believing in something and getting disappointed. Don't push yourself.

381
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:53,770
For the coffee. Bye.

382
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,750
Can't you just believe in me?

383
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:31,260
Yes, Father, it's me, Joon.

384
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:33,790
I'm sorry for contacting you while you're busy.

385
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:38,660
There's something I'd like to speak to you about concerning my classes.

386
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,590
No, no, no. It's too long.

387
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,120
Believe in me this one time. See if I'm playing around or not.

388
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,730
I don't have a hobby of believing in something and getting disappointed. Don't push yourself.

389
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:08,140
[Mijin Group Secretary's Office]

390
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,220
Hello. This is the Secretary's Office.

391
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,590
Yes, of course. I'll give you the intranet ID.

392
00:30:19,590 --> 00:30:20,550
Secretary Cha!

393
00:30:20,550 --> 00:30:22,220
Yes, CEO.

394
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,860
Who are you talking to that you'll share the ID with?

395
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,640
It's your son. He said he needs resources that haven't been published yet.

396
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,260
My kid?

397
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:36,420
If it's him, then give it to him.

398
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,380
The boss has given his approval.

399
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,810
Thank you!

400
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:45,520
That guy, is he going to prepare another paper?

401
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:50,110
It's not your first son, but your second.

402
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,030
What!?

403
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:25,880
[Kim So Bin, congratulations on your thesis being chosen for the contest.]

404
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,800
Hello?

405
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,760
Oh, Kim So Bin. Congratulations on the grand prize for your thesis.

406
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,550
Why would you treat me out?

407
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,170
Yeah, yeah.

408
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,770
I'll think about what we should eat.

409
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,840
Kim So Bin should be treating me to a meal.

410
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,910
Why you?

411
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,270
She got the idea from me.

412
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,190
You?

413
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:59,410
You only look at the good in people.

414
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:01,110
When I was researching for Professor Song's resources,

415
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:04,850
she got the idea from the research I handed to her.

416
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:08,460
That could just be what you're thinking.

417
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,670
- Are all the materials for the lecture ready?
- Yes.

418
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,770
But, Professor,

419
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:18,410
as I told you last time, I have to send the documents to the administration office within today.

420
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,920
What?

421
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:24,670
If you choose one of the students that are working for you and designate them as the main student,

422
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,870
then that selected student will receive more financial aid.

423
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,070
Oh, that.

424
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:31,350
Oh! Professor! So Bin won a prize for her thesis!

425
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:34,190
And it was a topic related to what you're writing about right now.

426
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:35,820
Is that so?

427
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,160
Impressive Kim So Bin. Then Kim So Bin will be the main...

428
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,430
Why are you being like this?

429
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,530
I told you So Bin got the idea because of me.

430
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:46,020
So Bin is a third-year and it was her first time, so she probably didn't know any better.

431
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,780
I supervised her, teaching her how to research material for you, and showing her dissertations.

432
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,150
That way, we can support you properly.

433
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:57,230
Kim So Bin...

434
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,740
Then you be the main.

435
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,530
Thank you.

436
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,710
Goodbye!

437
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:29,280
Who is this? Isn't it Nam Soo Hyun?

438
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,180
Wow. Look at you.

439
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,180
Are we invisible?

440
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,450
I guess you can't see us.

441
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,400
Buy what you were going to get and go.

442
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,570
Stop causing trouble at someone's workplace.

443
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,370
Look at how you're talking to your customers.

444
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,680
I'll treat you like a customer once you purchase something.

445
00:33:57,290 --> 00:34:02,090
Oh, I'm sorry. I'll pay for that.

446
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,000
Then I'm a customer, right?

447
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,220
It'll be in your best interest not to do that.

448
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,760
Why? Are you going to beat me up like last time?

449
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,340
No matter how much you look down on me,

450
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:21,520
you wouldn't do that to a customer. Right?

451
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,700
You lame jerk. Why are you acting like a little middle school student?

452
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,020
My foot! My foot!

453
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:52,970
My foot! Foot!

454
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:56,780
Let go!

455
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,720
You got a death wish?

456
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:09,560
Seriously!

457
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,600
Stop it!

458
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,110
What are you doing to our senior?

459
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,950
Did you pass a test or something?

460
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:37,200
Brother, you should enjoy the small things as well.

461
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,360
You're always so serious.

462
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:43,370
Why don't you pass a test at the very least? Please.

463
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,740
Let go!

464
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:51,790
What is it?

465
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:53,780
Nothing much.

466
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,150
It's money.

467
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:04,340
Where did you get it from?

468
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,850
What's the fuss over ₩100,000.

469
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,290
Hey. Over ₩100,000?

470
00:36:08,290 --> 00:36:11,440
I worked for a day since you're always slaving away.

471
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,940
Why don't you tell the truth?

472
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,330
Brother, just let it go. It's not that big a deal.

473
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:18,480
Nam Goo Hyeon.

474
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,360
I just sold something that I got for free.

475
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,570
From that junior of yours that looked rich.

476
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:33,270
- Yeo Joon?
- Yeah.

477
00:36:33,270 --> 00:36:36,680
I said his watch was really nice and he told me I could have it.

478
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,120
Hey! You accepted it!?

479
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:40,070
How could I not accept something that expensive?

480
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,880
Are you some beggar!?

481
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,890
How could you say it like that? He said he didn't need it anymore.

482
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,920
Is this all of it?

483
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,410
The leftovers after paying for the dorm room.

484
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:54,150
Hey!

485
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,580
[Youth Villa]

486
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:07,800
- Senior?
- I'm in front of your house. Come out.

487
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,890
- Right now?
- Yeah.

488
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:12,130
I'll wait until you come out.

489
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,420
Then just wait a little bit.

490
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,940
Senior...

491
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,390
I heard about it from Goo Hyeon.

492
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,930
Oh, that.

493
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:34,250
What's your motive?

494
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,430
It seemed like he wanted it so I gave it to him.

495
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,550
I can buy another.

496
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,420
I'm sorry.

497
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,780
For what?

498
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:49,490
I can't repay you right away, but I will repay you.

499
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,800
Do you have to do that to be comfortable?

500
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:55,870
Yeah. When you said I might call,

501
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,650
was it this?

502
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,700
Did I say something like that?

503
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,980
It turned out the way you wanted.

504
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:05,260
I called you first. Practically begging.

505
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:08,040
I didn't think that far ahead.

506
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:10,870
You could have never found out until the end.

507
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,060
What do you want from me?

508
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,230
What could it be?

509
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,390
Forget about the money.

510
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,230
I don't need money.

511
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,570
As you already know, they just give me money.

512
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,590
Warm up to me.

513
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:35,970
Without having to trick someone or spend money,

514
00:38:35,970 --> 00:38:38,040
but just sincerely liking you

515
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,670
and warming up to you, has there never been someone like that?

516
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:46,930
Yes.

517
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,160
There hasn't been a single one.

518
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,600
I'm pitiful, aren't I?

519
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't look at me like that.

520
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,930
What's the difference between you needing money and me needing affection?

521
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:11,200
You do everything you can to earn money.

522
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,760
I'm doing what I want to get what I want.

523
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,590
Yes.

524
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:25,250
You win. Do as you want.

525
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:29,940
Pick up your phone.

526
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,630
I'll get going.

527
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:54,630
Kim So Bin!

528
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,830
So Bin, So Bin, Kim So Bin!

529
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,030
So Bin! Are you mad?

530
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,220
I came to pick you up, knowing you tutor here.

531
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,100
Where is there a friend like me?

532
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,370
Here!

533
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,780
So Bin, don't be mad.

534
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,380
Can you just let me go?

535
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,330
That's why. Why did you happen to come that day?

536
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,860
I was told that was the day!

537
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,430
That my luck would be good if I went to your house that day.

538
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,110
Although I just extended my bad luck of humiliation.

539
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,560
Who told you that that was the day?

540
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,610
Don't tell me... Yeo Joon?

541
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,720
That's right! My boyfriend.

542
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:34,380
Promises are meant to be kept. I was told to go on that day!

543
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,420
Are you really dating Yeo Joon?

544
00:40:38,430 --> 00:40:40,180
It's a lie isn't it?

545
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:43,410
- That...
- Are you?

546
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:47,150
You aren't, you aren't! I knew it!

547
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,300
I knew it?

548
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,640
I mean...

549
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,650
You meant it doesn't make sense for someone like me to be dating him?

550
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:59,690
Now I can rest easy. This is more like Kim So Bin.

551
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,280
You're timid and sensitive but aren't afraid to come at me like that.

552
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,950
That's Kim So Bin.

553
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,400
What? You were serious?

554
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,800
Hey! Even if I have a girlfriend, it doesn't matter for us.

555
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,050
Why does our friendship have to end because of him?

556
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:17,390
That "person?" He's not someone you can just casually refer to like that.

557
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:26,020
Don't trust him.

558
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,880
Yeo Joon knew that there would be a girl at my place that day.

559
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:32,960
I told him.

560
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,070
So what? You're saying Joon purposely told me to go then?

561
00:41:41,070 --> 00:41:43,520
Say something that makes sense.

562
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:57,740
How about telling him tomorrow?

563
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:01,090
If not then hurry up and come to me.

564
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:04,130
How could you have called me at just the right timing.

565
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,410
Because I was uneasy.

566
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,380
And I regretted it.

567
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,150
It's because Yeo Joon doesn't feel right.

568
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:15,940
People like him are like poison to transparent people like you.

569
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,710
You don't know Joon.

570
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:21,250
I know him better than you do.

571
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,080
You... were serious.

572
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,320
Yeah.

573
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:43,540
One-sided love.

574
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,700
It ended.

575
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,840
How about as friends?

576
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,600
I don't know.

577
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:01,200
I'm going to take care of myself first now.

578
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,560
Don't trust him.

579
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,550
Yeo Joon knew that there would be a girl at my place that day.

580
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:35,530
Please make my assumption wrong.

581
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:44,360
Senior Nam Soo Hyun.

582
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,680
Where are you?

583
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,990
Joon...

584
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:09,820
Could you possibly meet up right now?

585
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,690
Is this a nice place?

586
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:21,180
To me it is.

587
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:26,460
I'll let it go. Since you asked to meet up first.

588
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,860
I have to do it.

589
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,710
- Joon.
- Yeah?

590
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:36,290
Do you know how much I suffered? Senior Soo Hyun and Senior Jung Ho...

591
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:39,170
Let's talk about that later.

592
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:44,620
I have something to ask you.

593
00:44:46,130 --> 00:44:48,700
Whatever it is, ask away.

594
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:54,250
You...

595
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:59,710
that day, the day I confessed.

596
00:44:59,710 --> 00:45:02,770
Chan Ki's girlfriend...

597
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:06,070
Did you know she was going over there?

598
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:11,860
You think I made it so that you bumped into them?

599
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:15,080
No.

600
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,150
That person...

601
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:21,570
- Did you meet him?
- Yeah.

602
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,540
He came to pick me up from where I tutor.

603
00:45:30,660 --> 00:45:33,110
If that's not the case then never mind.

604
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:39,100
To be honest, I did wonder if you did it on purpose.

605
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:41,070
I'm sorry.

606
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:43,880
You're right.

607
00:45:46,190 --> 00:45:50,890
- What?
- I knew there would be a girl there and sent you there.

608
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:53,730
I didn't know if the timing was right, but

609
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,890
it seemed like you would bump into them.

610
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:03,230
I'm saying your assumption was correct.

611
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:08,330
- Why did you do it?
- I wanted it to end.

612
00:46:08,330 --> 00:46:11,610
It's hard for you too, Senior. Getting your hopes up and getting them crushed.

613
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,300
- Is that all you could do?
- It was the fastest method.

614
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,600
Not that you wanted to see me get hurt?

615
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,950
Was it fun to see me cry like an idiot?

616
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:37,060
Just as expected, he rejected you.

617
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,800
That's why you should have ended things faster.

618
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,550
Or maybe you did.

619
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:53,690
Using you, what did it mean?

620
00:46:53,690 --> 00:46:57,010
"I hurt you,

621
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:00,040
so it's only right that you get something."

622
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:04,730
- Hey, Yeo Joon.
- It's the only thing I learned.

623
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:07,100
Give and take.

624
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:10,730
There's nothing that I got for free.

625
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:13,490
Even if it weren't for you, it's a wound I would have gotten anyway.

626
00:47:13,490 --> 00:47:16,450
I'm not trying to blame you.

627
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:20,360
I don't know you.

628
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,130
You scare me.

629
00:47:28,430 --> 00:47:31,460
I don't think we can remain close.

630
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,200
Just...

631
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,530
Let's just meet as group members.

632
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,800
I'll get going.

633
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:55,030
♫ We call this the end ♫

634
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:05,950
♫ Other people probably do too ♫

635
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:13,220
♫ The more we try to find our feelings ♫

636
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:22,110
♫ The more we try hide each other, it gets harder  ♫

637
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:28,990
♫ If one last time, I embrace you ♫

638
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:30,590
You keep your promise too, okay.

639
00:48:30,590 --> 00:48:33,000
I'll give you the job if you get close to me.

640
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:36,030
You'll do well, don't worry.

641
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:39,640
It's going to be exciting since you're doing it with me.

642
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,590
She's my girlfriend.

643
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:47,900
Isn't she pretty?

644
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,440
