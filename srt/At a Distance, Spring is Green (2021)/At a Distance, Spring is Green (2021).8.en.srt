00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:38,820
I'm sorry. I was being selfish.

166
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,410
Why you hate him,

167
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:44,420
can I ask?

168
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,470
Never mind. Next time...

169
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:51,690
I have a memory of getting severely beaten by him when I was little.

170
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,020
Enough to pass out.

171
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,350
Professor, did that to you?

172
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,150
That event was traumatic for me.

173
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,580
Don't come near. You'll catch my cold.

174
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,520
I have a strong immune system.

175
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:14,660
No. Step away.

176
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,250
- I don't want to.
- Don't. I've warned you.

177
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:23,510
Hey, BA Major '21! Listen to the words of your '19 senior.

178
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:32,090
I don't have much patience. Don't provoke me.

179
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:36,940
How-How is the medicine?

180
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:40,100
It supposedly has fast effects.

181
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:44,070
Now I feel warm. Did I catch your cold?

182
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:47,210
What do you mean? We didn't do anything.

183
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,450
Come here.

184
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:54,890
- Sit down.
- No. No. I feel like I have a fever now.

185
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,200
I didn't even do anything.

186
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,640
- One moment!
- Soo Hyun, here! Hurry!

187
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,800
Enjoy.

188
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:05,950
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

189
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,450
Wheel of fortune?

190
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,840
What does this mean?

191
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,660
A fate that you can't avoid.

192
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,600
A fate that can't be avoided?

193
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,010
- How about you?
- I...

194
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,700
If not then fine.

195
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,840
I'll look.

196
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,880
Ask what you're curious about.

197
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,730
That man and I... how will it turn out?

198
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,570
Choose one.

199
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,720
[STRENGTH]

200
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,380
In the end, it'll end well.

201
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,860
It ends well? I wasn't even getting my hopes up!

202
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,100
It won't be easy.

203
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,210
The results are what matter!

204
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,910
Don't you think so?

205
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,470
Yeah, right.

206
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:02,310
The results will be good in the end. A happy ending.

207
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:05,280
Give me the fees for reading your tarot fortune, 1,000 won each.

208
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,580
[THE MOON]

209
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,210
This is suffocating.

210
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,120
[NSH]

211
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,130
I still haven't returned this.

212
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,700
Yeah?

213
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,170
What? You picked up on the first ring.

214
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,990
I was going to pay you back with three missed calls.

215
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:55,590
- I'm hanging up.
- I'm sick.

216
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:00,210
Your voice sounds lively though? If you don't have anything to say...

217
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:04,680
I do have something to say! You have no patience.

218
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,980
What is it?

219
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:08,880
Do you have time tomorrow? I have something to give you.

220
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,700
I'm busy.

221
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:20,780
Ah, I was going to cut the call first.

222
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,990
I might just not return this to you!

223
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,620
But... he should have bought a more vivid color.

224
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,920
I heard you punched someone.

225
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,840
- Because of Yeo Joon?
- Yeah.

226
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,760
Yeah? I asked you to stop the fight, not to participate in it.

227
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,540
It turned out that way.

228
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,470
This is the first time I'm seeing you worry about others' problems.

229
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,490
Did I not care about any of your matters?

230
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,590
You nagged a lot.

231
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,940
But you've never used your fists for my sake.

232
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,220
You're the one who uses her fists.

233
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,130
Is that my problem?

234
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,240
I take care of myself too much.

235
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:06,200
But he's magician Yeo Joon these days, making you change and all.

236
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,870
Because he's so different from me,

237
00:17:08,870 --> 00:17:11,840
I thought that there was no reason to become friendly.

238
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:14,090
That is what you thought, but?

239
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:18,440
I don't know either. He's also like my younger brother.

240
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,000
Maybe you grew fond of him.

241
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,850
Fond?

242
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:25,320
Sit over there. I'll go buy some coffee.

243
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,440
No, I'll go.

244
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,670
No, the one you buy tastes bad.

245
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,310
Wait.

246
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:34,250
Gosh.

247
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,040
Soo Hyun!

248
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:39,290
Yes.

249
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,820
Please lend me your phone.

250
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,350
My phone?

251
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,870
You're holding yours in your hand though.

252
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:52,290
It turned off. I have an urgent call to make.

253
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:54,710
Is that true?

254
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,890
It's not true.

255
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:00,640
My number is 010-366-7883.

256
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,220
That's my phone number. You've memorized it right? Since you're smart.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,140
I should learn your number, too. Life is about give and take.

258
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,030
I didn't memorize it. I'm not that smart.

259
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:14,210
That's all right. You're good-looking.

260
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:17,730
I'm also not someone who is that good-looking.

261
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:19,200
Why is everything wrong?

262
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,720
Am I that wrong for you?

263
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,230
Don't answer. There's an order for everything.

264
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,890
I won't bother you.

265
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,440
Can't you just give me your number?

266
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,110
I will just look at your messaging app profile.

267
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,970
Do you not want to do that either?

268
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:50,110
Did something happen?

269
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:52,630
Why does Mi Joo look so devastated?

270
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,860
I think I did something wrong.

271
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,570
What?

272
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,850
Mi Joo asked for my phone number.

273
00:19:03,850 --> 00:19:05,520
She asked and?

274
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,270
I didn't give it to her.

275
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,620
Why?

276
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,900
I don't have that kind of luxury.

277
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,460
Who needs luxury to share a phone number.

278
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,810
To have interest in someone and start something,

279
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,860
I don't have time for that.

280
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:21,730
And... there's nothing I can do for the other party.

281
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,370
Do you have to do something?

282
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,820
The other party could do something for you instead.

283
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,150
And if you like someone, you can make the time for them.

284
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:35,570
Even if you like someone, you might not be able to afford it.

285
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,330
It was like that for me.

286
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,770
Towards who?

287
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,230
You.

288
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:50,200
Don't be too startled. It's something of the past.

289
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,740
I was only sick for a couple of days, but my skin is all dry.

290
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:28,010
It's really glowing.

291
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,870
- Hey, Joon.
- I told you I would see you at school.

292
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:46,210
We went to school together before, too.

293
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,950
If I were there, I would have thrown a punch at Oh Chun Gook!

294
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,790
I didn't know you would come, so I left.

295
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:56,250
I saw you there.

296
00:20:56,250 --> 00:21:00,000
You probably saw wrong.

297
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,190
I have somewhere to go. So you can head off first.

298
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,760
My mother's sick so I rented out my room.

299
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,090
Can I stay at your place for just one month? That's fine, right?

300
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,860
- I don't think it'll work out.
- Why not?

301
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,240
Do I have to explain that to you?

302
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,550
So you're really dating Kim So Bin.

303
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,390
Introduce her to me sometime. I have a lot to share.

304
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:35,990
Shouldn't you not be like this to me? Why can't I stay at your place?

305
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,040
I have a roommate.

306
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,160
Roommate? Who? Kim So Bin?

307
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,500
Senior Nam Soo Hyun.

308
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,300
- That psycho?
- Shall we all live together?

309
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,250
You're lying!

310
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,860
You lied about your father being ill that time.

311
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,920
Did you repay the money you borrowed from that time?

312
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,550
How many times do you plan to fool me until you stop?

313
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,910
Who is lying to who?

314
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,960
Gosh.

315
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,640
Will Yeo Joon really press charges?

316
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,730
There's too much definitive evidence.

317
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:23,570
Ah, Yeo Joon. Isn't there any other way?

318
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:26,100
Don't touch him. He's a scary kid.

319
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,120
You shouldn't get fooled by his looks.

320
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:30,020
What is scary?

321
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,110
How should I put it? His money, popularity, smarts.

322
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:37,290
He uses everything he has to get what he wants, but it doesn't show.

323
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:39,850
Because he's always going around smiling.

324
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:43,430
Even during the festival, he deliberately got beaten up at a place with a lot of people.

325
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,720
He provoked you so that you would punch him.

326
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,960
He'd be the victim and you the perpetrator.

327
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,770
Do you think Joon can't use his fists?

328
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:55,620
Hey, do you have proof? You're making him look too bad.

329
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:00,120
Even now, I wanted to stay at his home for some time, but he said that he lives together with Nam Soo Hyun.

330
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,060
Nam Soo Hyun?

331
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:05,490
He must have lied because he didn't want you around.

332
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,130
Habitual liar.

333
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:09,640
- Habitual?
- Everything about Joon is a lie.

334
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,020
- You don't know who his older brother is, do you?
- He doesn't have a brother.

335
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,460
What do you mean? Professor Yeo Joon Wan.

336
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,690
- The new Professor, Yeo Joon Wan?
- Yeah!

337
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:19,580
All the professors have totally got his back.

338
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,030
Even if he bombs his exams this time, I bet he will get good grades.

339
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:24,840
There were stories that he stole some tests in high school.

340
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,050
He comes from such a rich household. That's what makes him so arrogant.

341
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:32,190
Wow!

342
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,150
Come see me for a moment.

343
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:38,150
"See" you?

344
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,440
Go talk it out.

345
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,690
You'll be contacted by the police soon.

346
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:55,090
Hey, you bastard, you provoked me first.

347
00:23:55,090 --> 00:23:57,830
There was just so much evidence, I had no choice.

348
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,800
I figured I'd inform you in advance so you wouldn't be shocked.

349
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,180
So this is how it turns out... I guess Nam Soo Hyun will be my cellmate.

350
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,920
- What are you saying?
- You didn't know?

351
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:17,180
The day you got beat up by me, I got punched by Nam Soo Hyun.

352
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,690
Soo Hyun punched you?

353
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:21,020
See this?

354
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:26,470
I have evidence, too. I won't settle, I'm suing him.

355
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:33,500
Stay quiet. That'll be best for you.

356
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,260
Don't mess with him.

357
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,200
That psychotic jerk.

358
00:25:09,690 --> 00:25:11,550
I don't like pineapple pizza.

359
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:15,670
You're the one who likes pineapple pizza. I just eat the crust.

360
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:19,300
I didn't even know that So Bin didn't like it.

361
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:28,590
You're serious?

362
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:31,930
I've ended my one-sided love.

363
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,180
How about as friends?

364
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,920
I'm going to care for myself first from now on.

365
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,590
So what did Joon say?

366
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,350
To not mess with Nam Soo Hyun.

367
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:48,160
Joon did?

368
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,490
These two are best friends for life now.

369
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,260
Gosh, Joon that two-faced bastard.

370
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:02,750
The real psycho wasn't Nam Soo Hyun but Yeo Joon.

371
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:05,320
Hey. Quiet down.

372
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,350
Why? Or else, you'll punch me again?

373
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,520
What?

374
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,930
I messed with your roommate. What are you going to do about it?

375
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:27,070
I heard you're living with Nam Soo Hyun. That's a lie, isn't it?

376
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:31,600
This jerk... I heard you were quite famous in high school.

377
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,720
Saying you didn't have a brother when you had one.

378
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,730
Isn't this also bullying?

379
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:39,960
Lying and treating others like fools, stabbing them in the back.

380
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,920
Things like that are considered psychological bullying.

381
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,800
It turns out that your brother is a professor here—

382
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:48,020
I'm living with Joon.

383
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:53,250
- Why is that any of your business?
- Really?

384
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,270
Bullying is what you guys are doing.

385
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:59,620
Should I make it a bigger case? There are a lot of witnesses.

386
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:03,190
What? You're going to punch me again?

387
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:07,720
Geez, these people really have a knack for angering others.

388
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,350
Remember what I said earlier.

389
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,930
I told you to stay quiet.

390
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,390
Did you really punch him to avenge me?

391
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,260
I did not know you could punch people.

392
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,560
For me? Unbelievable.

393
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,860
Is your fist okay?

394
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,820
Was I that important to you?

395
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:46,670
To the point that you would want to avenge me?

396
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,400
How can you smile right now? Why are you leaving Oh Chun Gook alone? Report him to the police.

397
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,930
I'll take care of it.

398
00:27:54,930 --> 00:28:00,660
This was always my dream. To have a brother who would punch someone who beat me up.

399
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,090
What a dream to have...

400
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:05,560
- It makes me want to call you brother.
- Stop it and go.

401
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,000
Then I should cling on more. You know how I am.

402
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Why did you say we were living together?

403
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,290
No one would come if I said you were living with me.

404
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,360
You're really taking advantage of my image well.

405
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,730
I was even thinking of selling emojis of you.

406
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:22,070
"No. Go away. Get lost. Forget about it."

407
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,360
All of your lines are golden.

408
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,360
Yeah, Goo Hyun?

409
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,970
- Brother...
- What's wrong with your voice?

410
00:28:37,970 --> 00:28:41,960
Mom said not to tell you but...

411
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:44,520
her back problem must be bothering her again.

412
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:51,330
Uncle said if she doesn't get surgery she may never walk again.

413
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:55,090
But Mom said that even if she dies, she won't have the surgery.

414
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,570
- What do I do?
- What do you mean?

415
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,860
Don't worry about it. Just study.

416

Okay.

417

419
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:36,730
- What's the urgent matter?
- I don't have an appetite.

420
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,240
Even pineapple pizza doesn't taste good.

421
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,100
You called me out to say that? I'm going.

422
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,890
Whenever I think of you, there seems to be a huge hole in my heart.

423
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:48,070
At first, it was small so I didn't notice,

424
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,600
but now it's just gotten bigger.

425
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,970
Now it's this big.

426
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:57,230
It's just emptiness. You feel it when something you are used to is gone.

427
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:00,700
There's something I have to confess to you.

428
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:10,630
The day your mom left, she said this to me,

429
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:13,630
"Stay by my So Bin's side."

430
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:18,640
"Take care of all of the bad people who make So Bin miserable."

431
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,400
Why would she pressure a young child? When she couldn't even do it herself.

432
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,300
No.

433
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:29,500
I liked it. It felt like I became Superman.

434
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,090
I never once felt pressured.

435
00:30:34,430 --> 00:30:36,930

asked Soo Hyun for his number and got rejected.

452

- I know.
- Even I know that you like Nam Soo Hyun.

453
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,010
- Was it obvious?
- A lot.

454

- Nam Soo Hyun?
- Yes.

457
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:16,410
I know I'll get rejected considering he didn't even give me his number,

458
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,360
but I can't give up.

459
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,150
Have you ever told him that you liked him?

460

Even if you like someone,

461

- Let's do this together. The confession.

What? You want us to do it together, holding hands or something?

471
00:32:57,110 --> 00:33:00,800
- So that Nam Soo Hyun can choose?
- No, let's each do it separately.

00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,610
I consider this as a notice that I am going to confess.

655
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:38,140
You're going to confess?

656
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,410
Yeah. Tomorrow.

657
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,050
So Bin, help me a bit.

658
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,310
Soo Hyun,

659
00:46:48,310 --> 00:46:50,470
do you have time tomorrow?

660
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:52,600
Next time?

661
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:56,550
No, let's meet tomorrow.

662
00:46:57,950 --> 00:47:00,200
Why?

663
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,910
I have something to say to you.

664
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:12,170
There are three kinds of concentrated growth.

665
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:16,290
They are market penetration, market development, and product development.

666
00:47:16,290 --> 00:47:19,340
Integrated growth is further divided into three things.

667
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:24,170
Backward, forward integration, and horizontal growth.

668
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,880
Senior, why are you so sleepy lately?

669
00:47:57,660 --> 00:48:00,950
I picked up another job, so I'm a bit tired.

670
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:04,140
Senior, here are my notes.

671
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,930
I'll use them well.

672
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:10,410
I will give you the list of possible questions that can come on the final exam to you later.

673
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,370
You're okay, right?

674
00:48:13,370 --> 00:48:15,660
- What?
- This is weird.

675
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,270
He isn't acting like Nam Soo Hyun. Why is he smiling?

676
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,230
What? It's nice to see.

677
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:24,590
Well, his character has changed too much.

678
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:29,120
Senior! To celebrate your change, I'll buy us a meal.

679
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,820
No.

680
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:32,720
Oh, he didn't change.

681
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:36,420
Is there no other method...

682
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:39,900
I'll...

683
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:42,220
treat you to a meal.

684
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:49,450
Yeah, a meal...

685
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:57,370
You should've chosen something nicer.

686
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,520
I don't know if I'll get the chance to treat you again.

687
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,150
What are you talking about? This is just the start.

688
00:49:01,150 --> 00:49:04,040
I am going to slowly mooch off you.

689
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:10,830
Mi Joo, what brings you here?

690
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,910
I just felt like eating with you

691
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:15,540
and you were just here.

692
00:49:16,510 --> 00:49:19,420
What's going on? You two are speaking in a similar way.

693
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:21,340
Is it because you're roommates?

694
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,960
Hello.

695
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,890
Yes.

696
00:49:27,890 --> 00:49:31,000
You know Mi Joo is a drawing genius.

697
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,450
Show them the profile photo.

698
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:44,850
She's a genius, isn't she?

699
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:48,210
Yes. It's drawn well.

700
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:50,260
It's a portrait.

701
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,420
Is that me?

702
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:57,770
What? Why are you laughing?

703
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,250
What part was funny?

704
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:02,100
It looks just like me.

705
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,040
It doesn't look like you.

706
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:07,910
What? What's with this atmosphere?

707
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,720
Soo Hyun,

708
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,490
please spare me some time later.

709
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:29,070
The weather's nice today.

710
00:50:29,070 --> 00:50:32,310
Do you have something to tell me?

711
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,290
I like you.

712
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,250
I'm sorry.

713
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,530
Are you rejecting me? In just three seconds?

714
00:50:45,690 --> 00:50:48,100
I want to know the reason at least.

715
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:52,460
Someone, if not me, will like you.

716
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:54,970
Why not you?

717
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:59,570
I only need you. You are enough.

718
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,430
I am...

719
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,660
I'm sorry.

720
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:13,820
I'm the one who's sorry for liking you as I wished.

721
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:27,480
He should at least not look so handsome going around if he is not going to be mine.

722
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,050
I shouldn't have confessed.

723
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,590
I should have just had a one-sided love.

724

00:56:19,850 --> 00:56:23,690
We return to our old self even if we try to change because our mind or body remembers who we were.
