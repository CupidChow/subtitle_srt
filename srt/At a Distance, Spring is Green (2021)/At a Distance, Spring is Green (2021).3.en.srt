491
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,070
What is it? It'll be a while until I'm done.

492
00:42:38,070 --> 00:42:40,690
Did you not bring your phone with you?

493
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:46,730
That's right... I forgot.

494
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,340
Let's step out for a little. I need to wake up.

495
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,640
One, two, three, four...

496
00:42:57,640 --> 00:42:59,680
One, two, three...

497
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,250
Two, three, four...

498
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:02,590
Yes, Young Ran noona.

499
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,050
3, 4, 5

500
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,890
What? Why are you answering Soo Hyun's phone?

501
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:07,390
He left his phone behind.

502
00:43:07,390 --> 00:43:10,010
He's been forgetful lately. He must be really tired.

503
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:12,640
Really tired? Why?

504
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,140
We have to move out.

505
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,330
So he has to work more part-time jobs or something.

506
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:19,650
What!? He's going to work even more!?

507
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:25,350
And it's a live-in job? Is your brother really crazy?

508
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:27,430
Nam Soo Hyun...

509
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,400
Drink up.

510
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,380
You... have nothing going on lately, right?

511
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,560
It's the same every day.

512
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,200
Nothing is wrong?

513
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,400
Your job too, it's the usual?

514
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,150
Yeah. The same.

515
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,570
Okay.

516
00:44:12,570 --> 00:44:14,660
I'm going.

517
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:17,780
Already?

518
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:26,040
Hey... am I really your friend?

519
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,530
What are you saying?

520
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:33,560
Just that you're so tired lately that it seems you've forgotten that.

521
00:44:34,790 --> 00:44:37,610
How could I forget when you're my only friend.

522
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,430
Please enjoy your drink.

523
00:44:55,430 --> 00:44:57,460
Yes, thank you.

524
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,380
One second.

525
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,380
Oh, Young Ran.

526
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,200
He's really a good guy. Can you put in a good word?

527
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,290
Please.

528
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:02,260
Stop it.

529
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,290
- What?
- I'm saying keep it at a limit.

530
00:46:06,290 --> 00:46:08,360
Don't get prettier.

531
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:10,710
You're at it again.

532
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:16,180
I really don't think this is it. I look weird today, don't I?

533
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:19,840
No. It looks perfect.

534
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:21,920
Really?

535
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,770
Really.

536
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,890
Are you really So Bin?

537
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,970
I almost didn't recognize you!

538
00:46:35,970 --> 00:46:37,990
What's the occasion?

539
00:46:37,990 --> 00:46:40,230
But our Hye Ji is still better.

540
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:43,530
At least he's saying the right things. What's the occasion, Kim So Bin?

541
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:48,530
What happened to you suddenly? You never stood out. It was the same if you turned up to school or not.

542
00:46:48,530 --> 00:46:51,220
I thought you became Joon's girlfriend.

543
00:46:51,220 --> 00:46:52,800
Joon's girlfriend?

544
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,800
So Bin? What nonsense.

545
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,980
You're here, Senior?

546
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,360
Senior.

547
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,760
Hasn't Senior So Bin completely changed?

548
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,640
Let's start with the group meeting.

549
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:41,180
I must have studied so hard.

550
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:42,810
I'm so thirsty.

551
00:47:42,810 --> 00:47:45,590
What do you say? Shall we go quench our thirsts?

552
00:47:45,590 --> 00:47:47,540
I have plans already.

553
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,150
See you tomorrow, Senior.

554
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,350
At least he responds to you.

555
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:58,480
Jerk.

556
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:01,350
Is he some boss?

557
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:03,750
Joon! Where are you going!?

558
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,660
He's really following every footstep.

559
00:48:11,630 --> 00:48:13,950
Senior!

560
00:48:13,950 --> 00:48:15,670
Senior!

561
00:48:17,820 --> 00:48:19,480
Did you carry me, Senior?

562
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,580
Who said that? Kim So Bin?

563
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:24,880
No. Senior So Bin kept her mouth shut.

564
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,030
But, Senior, you left a trail, so I knew.

565
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:28,890
What?

566
00:48:28,890 --> 00:48:31,260
Hair.

567
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:35,340
After doing a DNA test, it was you.

568
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:39,890
Why do you think I called you?

569
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:44,480
To such a prickly senior just to get hurt.

570
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,810
Did you get hurt?

571
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,890
Ouch!

572
00:48:59,910 --> 00:49:01,390
I'll buy you food.

573
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:05,230
You carried me on your back and I threw up and ruined your clothes. This isn't a mistake that goes both ways.

574
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:07,310
I'm the one at fault.

575
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,060
You seem bored, go find someone else.

576
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,110
But you still did come because you were worried about me.

577
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,500
- I'm not that great of a junior.
- Stop following me.

578
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,580
You said some weird things so I felt a sense of responsibility.

579
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,540
Responsibility?

580
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:21,670
Did I say I would die?

581
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,710
You must say that often.

582
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,890
Without even knowing what it's like to really want to die.

583
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:31,360
- Do you dislike me that much?
- Yeah.

584
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,660
Wow, what a fast reply.

585
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,400
I think you keep bothering me because things aren't going the way you want them to. But there are things that won't happen the way you want

586
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:44,530
in this world.

587
00:49:44,530 --> 00:49:47,320
Things do work out the way I want.

588
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,720
Don't follow me. I don't have the time to waste with you.

589
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:01,730
I got my hopes up thinking something changed.

590
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:13,390
♫ Spring, spring, spring is here ♫

591
00:50:13,390 --> 00:50:19,580
♫ With that scent of when we first met ♫

592
00:50:20,390 --> 00:50:23,620
♫ The tree next to the bench ♫

593
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:29,630
♫ that you sat on is still there ♫

594
00:50:31,300 --> 00:50:35,390
♫ I thought I’d forget about it as time went by, but ♫

595
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:38,560
I didn't know the enemy lived so close.

596
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,390
Enemy?

597
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:42,280
Of course, he's the enemy if he's hurting you.

598
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:44,250
♫ My dear ♫

599
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,700
I guess we don't know yet.

600
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,620
♫ When I first saw you ♫

601
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:48,620
Should I just go?

602
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:51,400
♫ I knew right away ♫

603
00:50:57,910 --> 00:50:59,750
Is it that weird?

604
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,590
Chan Ki bought me this bracelet at the stationary store when we were eight.

605
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:06,700
I see.

606
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,780
Whatever! I'll get going.

607
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,310
He didn't forget today, too. Or has he?

608
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,340
Chicken and beer tonight. Okay?

609
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,690
Okay!

610
00:52:05,860 --> 00:52:07,550
Tada!

611
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,710
I'm seeing you again?

612
00:52:14,430 --> 00:52:16,920
I'm at the wrong place.

613
00:52:26,580 --> 00:52:28,660
Excuse me!

614
00:52:31,190 --> 00:52:32,160
So Bin!

615
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,720
Excuse me, your bag—

616
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:38,170
Hey, is today a special day?

617
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:40,350
Are you here to see me?

618
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,510
No.

619
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:46,380
Who's here, other than me?

620
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,360
No...

621
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:01,090
Joon.

622
00:53:01,090 --> 00:53:04,630
Or come to me. Quickly.

623
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:12,490
I'll be there soon.

624
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,760
I came to the wrong place.

625
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,040
What was that?

626
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,770
I came to Joon's but I guess I came here out of habit.

627
00:53:20,770 --> 00:53:23,270
Joon? Yeo Joon?

628
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:25,580
What's happening?

629
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:27,240
So Bin!

630
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,680
So Bin!

631
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,450
Why aren't you coming in?

632
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:54,960
Mom and Dad...

633
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,590
are getting divorced.

634
00:53:56,590 --> 00:54:00,040
What Seong Chan's parents did?

635
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:02,140
I think I did something wrong.

636
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,650
What could you have done?

637
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:06,980
I didn't do my homework or eat broccoli.

638
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:09,880
Then my parents would have already gotten a divorce, too.

639
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,200
You're always good, but I'm always getting in trouble.

640
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,330
I'm not always good! I always do things wrong.

641
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:21,420
I have to choose if I want to live with my mom or dad, but I don't know.

642
00:54:33,050 --> 00:54:35,260
What is this?

643
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,910
It's a magic bracelet.

644
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:46,630
If you say to the bracelet, "Hong Chan Ki, come out!" then I'll appear.

645
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:47,590
Lies.

646
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,330
Try it.

647
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:51,950
Hong Chan Ki, come out!

648
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,180
Tada!

649
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,520
What are you doing?

650
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,300
There are things that won't happen the way you want in this world.

651
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,600
Things do work out for me.

652
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,820
Come in.

653
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,390
You're going to go out like that?

654
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:12,670
So that jerk can see?

655
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:32,880
You helped me,

656
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,020
but I failed.

657
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:45,990
Why did I have to go today? I should have gone another day.

658
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,430
Would it have been different any other day?

659
00:56:51,430 --> 00:56:52,730
Still...

660
00:56:52,730 --> 00:56:55,140
What happened?

661
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,640
He said they broke up a few months ago.

662
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:03,120
He definitely said that there was nobody right now.

663
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:10,780
Chan Ki isn't one to lie to me.

664
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:13,890
I don't want to hear it anymore.

665
00:57:17,630 --> 00:57:19,220
I'm sorry.

666
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,360
Why are you sorry?

667
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:28,590
I'm going to get going. You should rest, but because of me...

668
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:35,000
Senior,

669
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,780
don't cry.

670
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:51,830
I'm not crying.

671
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:59,610
Just... seeing you...

672
00:58:08,840 --> 00:58:10,820
I'm sorry.

673
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,620
Why are you sorry?

674
00:58:14,660 --> 00:58:17,280
I did something I shouldn't have

675
00:58:18,420 --> 00:58:21,330
not knowing I'd feel so crappy.

676
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:26,100
Why did I tell you to confess your feelings?

677
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:31,670
No. You have no fault.

678
00:58:31,670 --> 00:58:33,890
It was my decision.

679
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:39,550
I'm leaving.

680
00:58:40,970 --> 00:58:45,120
Use me. I'll be your boyfriend.

681
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:46,640
♫ We ♫

682
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:49,020
You can use me when that jerk is around.

683
00:58:49,020 --> 00:58:50,640
♫ say that ♫

684
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,130
Or you can use me so that he'll get jealous.

685
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:55,060
Why would you...

686
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,760
I can't stand it.

687
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,730
Because you're being so stupid.

688
00:58:59,730 --> 00:59:02,850
♫ A little like that ♫

689
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:10,850
♫ The more I try to find what's in my heart ♫

690
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:15,250
♫ The more we try to hide from each other ♫

691
00:59:15,250 --> 00:59:16,170
♫ Oh ♫

692
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:18,050
What should we do?

693
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:21,220
You decide, Senior.

694
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:25,510
♫ I hug you for the last time ♫

695
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:30,860
♫ In your arms ♫

696
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:36,250
♫ it's warmer than I thought and it's so small ♫

697
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,800
♫ You are my precious person ♫

698
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,950
♫ My heart which realized too late ♫

699
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,460
♫ I hated it ♫

700
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:16,570
- Hey!
- Oh, hey.

701
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:19,690
I heard something funny earlier.

702
01:00:33,990 --> 01:00:36,900
What is this? You really meant to go there?

703
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:40,140
I thought you had made up an excuse not to be in my way.

704
01:00:40,140 --> 01:00:44,190
♫ Just say the word ♫

705
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:49,070
♫ The sunlight is beautiful, I will go pick you up ♫

706
01:00:49,070 --> 01:00:50,240
♫ Oh baby ♫

707
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,500
This is my girlfriend.

708
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:54,500
♫ Just say the word ♫

709
01:00:54,500 --> 01:00:57,700
♫ After meeting you ♫

710
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,960
She's pretty, isn't she?

711
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:08,090
♫ I did not know what you liked,
I am sorry I prepared according to what I liked ♫

712
01:01:08,090 --> 01:01:14,070
♫ I am a bit anxious that you won't like me ♫

713
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:18,860
♫ The you who thanks me is  ♫

714
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:24,110
♫ really adorable, oh baby ♫

715
01:01:24,110 --> 01:01:28,170
♫ Just say the word ♫

716
01:01:28,170 --> 01:01:33,100
♫ The sunlight is beautiful, I will go pick you up ♫

717
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:38,460
♫ Oh, baby... Just say the word ♫

718
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:45,950
♫ After meeting you, I can only see you ♫

719
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:52,460
🌿 At a Distance, Spring is Green 🍃

720
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,390
Can I call again?

721
01:01:53,390 --> 01:01:55,020
No. Don't.

722
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:57,490
Was it fun watching me cry like that?

723
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,780
There are people who don't have likes in this world.

724
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,020
But you're not one of them, Senior.

725
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:05,010
Do you have a death wish?

726
01:02:05,010 --> 01:02:06,570
Apologize.

727
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:08,620
You should apologize for the misunderstanding.

728
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:09,860
I don't think I can.

729
01:02:09,860 --> 01:02:13,020
Trust in me once, to see if I am playing with you or not.

730
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:15,390
I don't want to trust and then get disappointed.

731
01:02:15,390 --> 01:02:19,990
I hurt someone, but what can I do so that we can go back to the way things were?

732
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,470
Just tell them your feelings, the way they are.

733
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:25,660
You don't know how to do that. Do that thing you don't know how to.

734
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,160
It's not you!

735
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:29,130
What?

736
01:02:30,050 --> 01:02:32,680
♫ My dear ♫
