🌿 Episode 2 🍃

2
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:03,580
Joon?

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,370
Did Joon say that he was going to give that part-time job to you?

4
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,330
I did not hear anything like that.

5
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:10,390
He never came to the office either.

6
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:12,160
Yeo Joon.

7
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:16,460
Yeo Joon!

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,030
I was going to treat you like a senior because you were so pitiful.

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:22,430
But I can't because you are too fake.

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,370
That's better.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,330
It is better than wearing a red mask and smiling widely.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,540
Is that so? I acted a bit thinking you would like it.

13
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:52,740
Senior So Bin?

14
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,470
- Shall we meet next time?
- Don't go.

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:12,160
Did you come to see me?

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,400
Yes, I came to see you!

17
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,390
Did you come to fight?

18
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:20,980
Or because you missed me?

19
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,710
Hey, Yeo Joon! Am I a pushover to you?

20
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,030
Yes.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,050
Even if you think I am easy, keep your promise.

22
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,920
Instead of playing with people.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,740
- Don't joke with someone who is desperate.
- But I was not joking.

24
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,410
I confirmed with the department office.

25
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:44,300
If you did not want to give the part-time over to me, you could have just said so.

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,570
Is that so hard?

27
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:50,320
Yes. It is difficult for me.

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,680
I don't want the other person to hate me.

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,030
But I just forgot your request.

30
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,670
I had something come up while I headed to the department office.

31
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,610
Don't worry. I will tell them as I promised you.

32
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,620
- When?
- Whenever I have the time.

33
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:12,270
Yeah, so I am asking when will that be.

34
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:17,610
I am a bit of a tree frog. If someone keeps bothering me,
(T/N: Someone who does the opposite of what they're being asked)

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,850
I don't know what I might end up doing.

36
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,060
- What does that mean?
- Stop being anxious and

37
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,510
wait a bit.

38
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,170
So that I can help you with good intentions,

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,400
wait for it.

40
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,650
- You are seriously—
- Annoying, right?

41
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:44,050
Yes, you are super annoying.

42
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:45,760
So similar.

43
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
Are you going somewhere?

44
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,360
The dorm.

45
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,150
Do you have an umbrella?

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,360
- No.
- Let's go together. I have an umbrella.

47
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:34,050
No, that's fine.

48
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,330
We should drop by the department office, too. Right?

49
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:41,280
Is it okay to give away the part-time job with Professor Song?

50
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,160
Yes, we already talked it out.

51
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:48,210
That was smart of you Kim So Bin. How did you manage to persuade him?

52
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,840
Rather than me doing anything—

53
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,520
I still have a lot of opportunities.

54
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,440
I should be considerate.

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
Joon, how is it that both your looks

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,670
and your actions are all adorable?

57
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:02,450
Unni, please talk to Professor Song.

58
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:07,040
Don't worry. You worked hard at the setter. I have to keep my promise.

59
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,030
Also, your application for the new class has been processed.

60
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:14,040
Be ready for it. You are aware that Professor Park's classes are tough, right?

61
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,970
Are you also taking that class?

62
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:17,250
You too?

63
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,440
Why is a freshman taking that class?

64
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,460
It is because I am very greedy.

65
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:24,700
That's great. We would be able to see each other every week from now on.

66
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,360
♫ Spring, spring, spring, spring has come ♫

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,770
Your shoulder will be all wet.

68
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:45,790
Hold the umbrella properly.

69
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,150
This is a scene from a movie though.

70
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,530
Movie?

71
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,070
"Bungee Jumping of Their Own."

72
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,900
They hold the umbrellas like this in that movie.

73
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,710
Also...

74
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:09,260
we actually did the bungee jumping.

75
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:15,250
♫ My dear, please be with me ♫

76
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,960
♫ Before this spring ends ♫

77
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,620
You came early.

78
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,600
What's this? Did you not take your umbrella?

79
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,540
You should have called me.

80
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:36,790
This is nothing.

81
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,240
Did you eat?

82
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:46,370
Cleaning fees: 10,000 Won; Transportation and time: 40,000 Won; New shoes: 50,000 Won.

83
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,040
Here.

84
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,950
You did not eat, did you?

85
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,270
- Shall I cook ramen for you?
- Goo Hyun, shall we eat something good today?

86
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,750
Really? Is today something special?

87
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,050
Quickly order something you want to eat.

88
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:00,020
Yes! Awesome.

89
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,070
Eat slowly.

90
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:13,920
But, really, is something going on today?

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,730
Are you giving me up for adoption?

92
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,950
Who will take you?

93
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,810
I am better than you hyung.

94
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,290
Goo Hyun.

95
00:06:31,710 --> 00:06:34,500
Why is your voice so low? It's making me anxious.

96
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,630
- I am sorry.
- For what?

97
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,510
Ah, seriously.

98
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:42,040
- You went out wearing my underwear, didn't you?
- Eat quickly.

99
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,790
Yeah, that's it! Come here!

100
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,360
- Hyung, come here!
- I am telling you I did not wear your underwear!

101
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,260
Take them off quickly!

102
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:21,010
I thought you were just proud, but your inferiority complex

103
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:23,570
is no joke either.

104
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,950
You are a twisted person who does not know how to accept someone else's kindness.

105
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,240
Who are you to judge me? What do you know about me?

106
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,750
Do you have the right to do that?

107
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:38,540
I was going to treat you like a senior because you are so pitiful.

108
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,130
But I can't because you are too fake.

109
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:58,780
Cheers!

110
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,420
Don't drink too much.

111
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,280
You guys...

112
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,470
There is no more alcohol, right?

113
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:09,970
Who will drink this soju?

114
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,300
Are you anxious?

115
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,440
Everyone has to like you in order for you to relax.

116
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,880
But you met someone who bothers you.

117
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,990
That look that says that you know everything,

118
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:21,940
it's annoying.

119
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,310
That's better.

120
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,360
It's better than wearing a red mask and smiling widely.

121
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,380
Let's all do cheers once!

122
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,660
Cheers!

123
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:32,260
Cheers!

124
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,040
Cheers!

125
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:28,980
Someone died!

126
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:36,650
- I am done for.
- What are you talking about?

127
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,020
She is the last roommate left.

128
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:42,340
She has been using the dorm for a long time.

129
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:43,910
Unni.

130
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,590
Unni, your mouth will turn if you keep sleeping on the ground.

131
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,990
- Unni.
- She looks like she is dead.

132
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,660
Wang Young Ran, let's go for a third round.

133
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,490
Okay! Go! Go!

134
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,840
When did you come in?

135
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,890
So Bin!

136
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:04,420
Our little Kim So Bin!

137
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,980
Let me borrow your knees for a long time.

138
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,560
Ah, this troublemaker has come in.

139
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:15,990
Hey, Ann! Ann with the red hair!

140
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,050
Me?

141
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,700
Mouse.

142
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:29,820
- Ah, cramp.
- Quickly, lift her legs up at the calf.
(T/N: Mouse and cramp are homophones.)

143
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,510
Yes, yes, right there.

144
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,620
Do it harder. With more force!

145
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,420
Yes, you are doing well.

146
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,750
Are you leaving already? You also stayed out last night!

147
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,950
I can just sleep on the bus.

[Police Training Exam Preparation Guide]

149
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,540
What is this?

150
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,710
- I said what is this!
- You don't have to know.

151
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,160
Seriously!

152
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,630
Let's talk about this later.

153
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,050
Mom also knows about this.

154
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,400
Mom gave me permission and asked me to talk about this with you.

155
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,530
I thought you'd be against it so I didn't tell you.

156
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,660
What about returning to school?

157
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,450
I don't go to a fancy school like you do. Neither do I have the brains to get a scholarship.

158
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,400
Even if I get a scholarship and graduate from university, it will still be difficult to get a job.

159
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,340
Do you think the police training entrance exam will be easy?

160
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:45,760
Textbooks and tutoring academies will also cost a lot. Just get ready to go back to school.

161
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,980
Whatever you say, I've already decided.

162
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,770
I'm going to take the bar exam next month with my friend.

163
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,330
Goo Hyun!

164

3rd-year student Kim So Bin?

169
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,550
Yes, Ma'am.

170
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,950
You know I had selected another student originally, right?

171
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,780
- Yes.
- Have you been to my class before?

172
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:40,220
I have taken all the basic major and mandatory topic classes.

173
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,570
But it seems like I'm seeing you for the first time.

174
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,600
If you are a 3rd-year student then I must have remembered your face.

175
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,930
I don't have much of a presence.

176
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,190
Your grades are also average.

177
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:56,560
I'm sorry.

178
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,440
You should not be sorry about my research.

179
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,430
It's a very important project to be presented in the next quarter.

If Assistant Seol hadn't recommended you, you wouldn't have had a chance.

181
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,670
- I'll do my best.
- I don't need your best.

182
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:16,420
Give the best results.

183
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,170
Yes, Ma'am.

184
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,470
It's not fun for either of us now, right? It's time to break up.

185
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,670
I'm taking the initiative.

186
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,640
You want to break up but you aren't saying it.

187
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,910
Since when did you know so much about me?

188
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:48,100
That is our problem. I can't understand your feelings no matter what.

189
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,110
Being pretty doesn't last that long.

190
00:14:50,110 --> 00:14:54,960
It felt like I couldn't fill the box no matter how much water I poured in. Was it any different for you?

191
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,830
Oh, Ann! Come and sit here.

192
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,980
Are you insane? You're drinking alcohol in the dorm. Do you want to get kicked out?

193
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,710
I know. I know, but Unni wanted to do a roommate unity competition.

194
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:48,040
Stop talking like a warden and come sit here.

195
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,570
- I can't drink.
- Sit down and at least eat the snacks.

196
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:54,010
- I don't have any thoughts to do so.
- If you don't have thoughts then make some.

Are you with a girl by any chance?

Ah! I haven't cleaned up yet.

205
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:27,710
We don't care about that. Let's have a 5th round Chun Gook! The 5th round!

Oh! Wow!

208
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,510
Do you have OCD or something? It's so clean.

209
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:39,670
It's beer. Beer! Chun Gook.

210
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,200
Get some snacks.

211
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,750
It seems like you already drank a lot.

212
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,550
How about you sleep early?

213
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,100
I will drink forever even if I die. I won't waste my youth.

214
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,450
We have to enjoy our lives.

215
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,880
That's right.

216
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:13,870
The world does not want to see the youth shine brightly.

217
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,300
That's why we are appropriately obedient,

218
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,640
and appropriately diligent. We are just imitating adults like that.

- Can you follow me back too?
- Of course. I'll do it.

229
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,850
But who were you with yesterday?

230

- Senior!
- Oh my god!

231
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,090
It's Joon.

232
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:32,870
Why do you look so tired?

233
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:35,280
Did you meet Professor Song well?

234
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,300
I did.

235
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:42,630
Professor Song wants you, but I'm not sure I'll do well.

236
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:45,030
You even gave up this job for me.

237
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,910
Professor didn't actually want me.

238
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,790
You can do well. Don't worry.

239
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,480
- Thanks.
- Only with words?

240
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,040
You know that we still have to get close, right?

241
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:06,930
Aren't we close enough already? We are, by my standards.

242
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:09,850
You don't know anything about me, right?

243
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,480
You are...

244
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,080
very popular and...

245
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,160
I'm here. Trust me.

246
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,300
I don't think I promised to give you the job for just a bungee jump.

247
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,890
I don't know.

248
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:32,240
What do you not know?

249
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:42,920
You seem like a different person sometimes.

250
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,360
No, I mean...

251
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,890
that you have various charms.

252
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,730
You also.

253
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,100
No. I only have one.

254
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:02,230
One? What is that only charm?

255
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:05,510
Huh? Ah! No. No. No.

256
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,790
- I didn't mean it that way.
- What is it?

257
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:10,160
- No. No.
- What is it?

258
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,060
- No, I don't have any charm.
- Why?

259
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,370
Joon! Joon!

260
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:16,290
Hello.

261
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:19,560
Did you text and ask him to buy coffee?

262
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,790
- No. I thought it was you.
- No, it's not me.

263
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:24,350
Wow, his sense is amazing.

264
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:26,100
What? Why is he sitting there?

265
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,840
Nam Soo Hyun might have asked him to bring him coffee.

266
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,800
Hey, Joon! Hey, Joon! Your seat is over here.

267
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,370
Ah! I didn't wear my lenses today.

268
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:45,430
I wanted to apologize for the last time. I said too much.

269
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,630
Have this refreshing coffee and forget it.

270
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:27,090
That's all for today's class.

271
00:21:27,090 --> 00:21:31,280
I forgot to tell you all in the previous class,

272
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,960
your midterm will be graded based on your group projects.

273
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,470
No! Not group projects!

274
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:40,440
Silence! Silence!

275
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,450
Instead, you can select your teammates and topics.

276
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,550
Decide your topics by next week

277
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:48,580
and the leader should tell me.

278
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,980
Order of presentations will be randomly drawn.

279
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,410
- Okay?
- No!

280
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:58,040
But what do people without friends do, sir?

281
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,890
Once you're out in society,

282
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:05,050
sometimes it's all about interpersonal relationships.

283
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:07,600
In your college days when you're studying hard,

284
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,970
it is a good experience to, at least

285
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,800
force yourself to mingle.

286
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,110
Professor, I'm a freshman though.

287
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,270
- Isn't my course for third years?
- It is.

288
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:23,680
So I want to be in the group of a senior with good grades.

289
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,760
I think he's talking about you, Soo Hyun.

290
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,910
- You take care of him, Soo Hyun.
- Professor, that is...

291
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,700
Professor, I'll take good care of Joon.

292
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:39,740
- You? Han Jung Ho?
- I'm no rookie at this either, sir.

293
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,500
I think you will have to take care of your classmate, too.

294
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,550
People who aren't confident about making

295
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:51,070
their groups, raise your hands.

296
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,800
I'll make...

297
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,780
some awesome groups here.

298
00:22:56,780 --> 00:23:00,200
No, we should at least grab a meal together and...

299
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,010
Hey, Nam Soo Hyun!

300
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:07,640
What was your expression back there?

301
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,720
Even if we're in the same year, I'm a year older than you.

302
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:15,020
What was your shitty expression back there?

303
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,090
- Ah! That expression again!
- Senior.

304
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:20,620
Don't do this! We're on the same team now.

305
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:23,520
How can I be on the same team as that jerk!

306
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,460
I'm here.

307
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,560
Okay. Joon, you can learn from what Chun Gook and I do,

308
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,720
and do some errands properly.

309
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,130
And, Hye Ji, you should just follow me.

310
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,690
Yes, yes.

311
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,580
Then I'm the only girl.

312
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,620
But we still need another member and Joon is still a freshman.

313
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,410
Wait a moment.

314
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:50,710
- Me?
- Did you find yourself a group to work with?

315
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,840
- No.
- How about joining our group?

316
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,380
- That is a bit...
- I need some trustworthy people on the team.

317
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,280
- Does that mean you don't trust us?
- It's better if you're sincere.

318
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:08,300
If you're okay with it, I want you to join our team.

319
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,460
If you're doing this because of the previous semester's project,

320
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,170
I'm fine.

321
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:15,400
Did something happen between them?

322
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,660
I don't care about useless things.

323
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,710
I did see it late but when I read your material,

324
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,130
I thought I could trust you. That's why I'm asking you.

325
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,420
Think well.

326
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:28,130
Hey! You don't have to think. Just do it.

327
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:29,740
Shall we leave?

328
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,500
We should have our first meeting in a nice place.

329
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

330
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,570
Is it because you don't know?

331
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,410
It hurts!

332
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,230
Hey! I didn't do that.

333
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,790
Leave it.

334
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:56,730
Do you not like walking with us or are you just slow?

335
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,000
Oh my god!

336
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,380
Why are you surprised every time?

337
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,660
I'll send you texts 4-5 seconds before I come near you.

338
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,230
Give me your number.

339
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,220
We will anyway have to share our contacts because of the group project so, here.

340
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,450
Don't you think this project is going to be fun?

341
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,360
We will know when we do it.

342
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,610
Think of it as bungee jumping.

343
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,320
It will be adventurous because you're doing it with me.

344
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,790
All right, all right. What would be a good topic?

345
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,250
What about case studies of marketing success strategies?

346
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:33,710
No, it's easy to find resources for that,

347
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,270
and there's a big chance that other groups will take that topic first.

348
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,990
Then we can just tell the

349
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,900
professor that we are doing it first.

350
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,850
No, the competitiveness will be lowered if we do what others are doing.

351
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:46,410
It will be hard to get good grades no matter how good our presentation is.

352
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,970
Then, what is your idea?

353
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:53,700
Instead of success strategies, case studies of failures.

354
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,270
That's new.

355
00:25:57,270 --> 00:26:00,620
I don't know much about it but I'm sure it will stand out.

356
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,060
Right?

357
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,110
Maybe it's good?

358
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:09,890
I don't know. You, seniors, can decide it.

359
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:12,870
- It doesn't sound too bad.
- Since looking at case studies of success strategies is easy,

360
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:15,020
isn't it a joke to look at case studies of failures?

361
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,040
In the end, the gist is going to be the same.

362
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:19,180
You must experience this type of failure in order to succeed.

363
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,720
Something like that. Kim So Bin,

364
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,440
what do you think?

365
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,220
Uh...

366
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:32,390
I think it will be fun.

367
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,590
Do you do projects for fun?

368
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,800
But...

369
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
a case study of failures,

370
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,560
is a wide topic.

371
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:47,120
So, if we're not careful, just like Senior Jung Ho mentioned,

372
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,940
it might look like we're just changing the name.

373
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,480
So I think...

374
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,090
that up-and-coming premium products failing due to marketing failure,

375
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,810
along with instances with strategies for lower group products

376
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,690
with the consumer's needs changing

377
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:05,730
we can focus on cases with failed marketing plans like this.

378
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:12,750
Wow! I'm seeing you in a new light now.

379
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,890
No, it's just what I thought.

380
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:18,660
Then we have decided our topic, right?

381
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,970
Okay. Let's have that topic and decide our leader first.

382
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:25,520
Of course, you should do it being the eldest here.

383
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,960
What? How can you do that?

384
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:31,250
We are all 3rd-year students except Joon.

385
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,170
- Then will you do it, Hye Ji?
- No.

386
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:35,190
I have other group meetings to attend.

387
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,520
How about Senior Soo Hyun?

388
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,180
The professor also seemed to trust you.

389
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,040
Let's just vote instead of wasting time.

390
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,880
Choose one out of Jung Ho and Soo Hyun.

391
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,600
How about you?

392
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,310
What?

393
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,210
I'm fine with either of you.

394
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,340
You were clear when you chose the topic.

395
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,540
How about being the leader?

396
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,990
What?

397
00:27:56,990 --> 00:27:58,740
I agree.

398
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,670
How will a person with no prominence become a leader?

399
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:02,090
I know her from the setter.

400
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,830
She is very diligent and has a sense of responsibility.

401
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,590
Someone like that should be the leader.

402
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:09,690
Right. So Bin is like that. I also agree.

403
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,660
No. No. Wait up.

404
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,960
I also agree.

405
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,770
it's decided by the majority.

406
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:19,000
Then the team leader will notify the professor in the next class

407
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,470
about the subject of our presentation and the topic we picked.

408
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,330
You're leaving already?

409
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,810
Ugh! That stern jerk.

410
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:29,730
I can't get used to him.

411
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,590
He at least needs to drink something while we are at these things.

412
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:34,440
It is only fun living if there is someone unique like that.

413
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,740
Hey! Unique?

414
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,910
Nam Soo Hyun isn't unique. He's just a psycho.

415
00:28:38,910 --> 00:28:41,780
Do you know what happened when I was a freshman?

416
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:44,040
When I saw him for the first time...

417
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,800
Oppa!

418
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:50,940
Can you buy us a meal?

419
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,530
My name is Park Hye Ji, a first-year majoring in business.

420
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,900
Senior, I'm Lee Gi Seon.

421
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,910
So?

422
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,290
What?

423
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:04,500
Why should I buy food for

424
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,690
someone I'm meeting for the first time?

425
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,320
Sorry.

426
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,140
How come there are people like him?

427
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,590
I told you, right?

428
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:21,820
That oppa is only handsome but

429
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,650
he's a total beggar.

430
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,240
Are you freshmen?

431
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,270
Yes, Senior.

432
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:39,520
What grade did you get for your language paper?

433
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,260
I got a B.

434
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,910
Your logic is wrong.

435
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,560
What?

436
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,300
The people who are asking others to buy them food

437
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,860
are the beggars.

438
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:55,790
- Sure.
- Widen your perspective a bit.

439
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:59,040
To be able to judge who will be kind enough to treat you.

440
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,490
Ah! I should have been there.

441
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:11,960
Even by just hearing this, can't you imagine how he was?

442
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,400
It is true though.

443
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,840
It isn't a compulsion for a senior to buy food for a junior that he doesn't know.

444
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:19,750
Are you taking Senior Soo Hyun's side?

445
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,160
What side?

446
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,390
I'm just saying I understand him.

447
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,450
How about a senior taking away a junior's part-time job?

448
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:31,320
You! Are you going to talk about this every time after giving it up?

449
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,510
Yes.

450
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,610
Do you really see me as a pushover?

451
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,560
Yes. That's why I like you.

452
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,140
Hey! Yeo Joon! Don't joke like this.

453
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,880
I'm also scary when I get angry.

454
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,950
Ow! So scary.

455
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,380
Go first, really scary senior.

456
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,350
I have to pickup this call.

457
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:00,230
Okay.

458
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,980
Hello?

459
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,390
Come home Friday for dinner. Your uncle and aunt are also coming.

460
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:19,390
Okay. I will be seeing you and Dad also after a long time.

461
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,690
Do you actually miss us?

462
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:25,160
Yes. I miss home food a lot.

463
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:27,750
Don't lie just because I can't see you.

464
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:30,350
I can also see your voice.

465
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm not happy about you coming home either.

466
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,900
What have you done to be proud of, that I would want to show you off?

467
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,990
Joon Wan is too busy with a lot of stuff. Can you at least come and sit here?

468
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:42,260
Our family is very small.

469
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,190
Come, even if you don't like to.

470
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,260
Yes. I'll see you then.

471
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,550
Come on time. You don't keep time, right?

472
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,690
Yes.

473
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:57,740
is your hair still yellow?

474
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,620
I don't like that so come neatly.

475
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,300
Did your brother ever have such hair?

476
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,890
Okay, Mother, I'll do so.

477
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:07,740
Don't worry—

478
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:19,830
I also don't like asking you to come.

479
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,330
What have you done to be proud of, that I would want to show you off?

480
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:28,880
Joon Wan is too busy with a lot of stuff. Can you at least come and sit here?

481
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,260
Do you still have that loud hair?

482
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,120
I hate to see it. So, come properly.

483
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,900
Has your brother ever done his hair like that?

484
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,200
Oh no.

485
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,060
Will you please get up?

486
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,800
Will you drink that?

487
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,960
This too.

488
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,760
It's ₩4,400. Would you like a bag?

489
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,590
No.

490
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,780
Have it.

491
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,560
Forget it.

492
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,370
Forget what?

493
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,900
Just have it. You're working hard.

494
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:09,790
- Take it.
- No need to thank me.

495

496
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:24,290

500
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,590
You're back?

501
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:19,100
Do you have eyes on the back of your head?

502
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,680
I sense smell like a dog. Your perfume.

503
00:37:25,950 --> 00:37:28,430
Did you drink beer?

504
00:37:28,430 --> 00:37:30,990
You're the one who probably drank it.

505
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:33,970
Mi Joo, are you okay?

506
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:37,440
Yeah, he's not the only guy in the world.

507
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,550
Well, I guess for you, there's only one.

508
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,560
Have you had dinner?

509
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:49,540
Dinner?

510
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:53,860
I don't think so.

511
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,230
Do you want cup ramen?

512
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:06,260
1, 2, 3, 4. Hold your breath.

513
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:14,530
That's right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Breathe out.

514
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:20,450
That's right. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

515
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Good job! Good boy!

516
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,330
- Who are you?
- Hey, friend.

517
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:29,470
Doesn't it feel like your head cleared up for a second?

518
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,230
- Has it?
- I tried it with my friend.

519
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,160
Was he successful?

520
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,920
No. It didn't work for him.

521
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,250
He has too many thoughts. He's got no chance.

522
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:46,230
He needs a friend like me to talk it all out with him to clear his thoughts.

523
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,900
- You're a good friend.
- What is this? What's going on?

524
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,170
What's with your envious eyes and tone?

525
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:55,260
Why are you being like that, when you've got so many friends?

526
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,000
- Do you know me?
- No.

527
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,400
I heard rumors. Myeongil University's most popular person, Yeo Joon.

528
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:07,300
I don't have any good friends.

529
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:10,150
Honey! What are you doing?

530
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:14,500
Then, let's catch up again next time.

531
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:32,040
[Dorm: 600,000 won, Textbooks: 100,000 won, School Fees: 300,000 won, Living Expense: 300,000, Communication: 100,000 won]

532
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,110
[Expenses: 1400,000 won]

533
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,230
Don't lie just because I can't see you.

534
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,840
I can see through your voice.

535
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:06,120
You're already here!

536
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:08,330
I just got here.

537
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,200
You're here, Senior?

538
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,840
Don't do this next time. I didn't ask you to be the group leader so that you could do things like this.

539
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:19,210
You could have just said that she worked hard. So haggardly.

540
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:24,130
But he's right. You should ask me to do this stuff instead.

541
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,930
Whoever's early can do it.

542
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:29,700
Have you contacted the other group members?

543
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,270
Yes. They'll all be here on time.

544
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,150
Hye Ji just said she can't make it because she's got the flu.

545
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:45,320
I guess it'll just be the five of us today.

546
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,510
[Design Meeting]

547
00:41:58,170 --> 00:42:01,910
It's only the first day, how could no one show up?

548
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:05,070
This is your first time with a team assignment, isn't it? A core module class, not optional.

549
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:06,780
Yes.

550
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:12,770
On average, there are at least 3 group projects for your major. You end up hearing so many excuses.

551
00:42:12,770 --> 00:42:14,970
I think there are two types of people,

552
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:18,770
Those with a sense of responsibility, and those without.

553
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:25,930
Senior Jung Ho nor Senior Chun Gook are looking at their messages, and both are ignoring my phone calls.

554
00:42:25,930 --> 00:42:28,870
I should have confirmed with everyone.

555
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:31,730
I'm sorry.

556
00:42:31,730 --> 00:42:36,290
The probability that a boat will go up a mountain will decrease when the number of boatmen decreases.
(T/N: Too many cooks spoil the soup.)

557
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,730
Let's just divide the parts amongst us three first.

558
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,760
Without the seniors?

559
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:45,630
Will you just wait here for them?

560
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:48,540
Then I'll just contact them separately to let them know their parts.

561
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,740
Do you trust those people?

562
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:53,610
Pardon?

563
00:42:53,610 --> 00:43:00,080
Having expectations and getting disappointed make it harder to forgive. It's easier to not have any, to begin with.

564
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:04,190
Senior, you're always so pessimistic.

565
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,410
It's being realistic.

566
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,220
I don't want to learn about that kind of reality.

567
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:13,140
Oh, I guess if your reality is in the gutter,

568
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:16,390
it could be difficult to be optimistic.

569
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,430
I understand.

570
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:22,150
Understand?

571
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,960
Do you even know what it is to feel like you're in the gutter?

572
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:30,220
I do. Not having money isn't the only gutter.

573
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,970
Without knowing another's circumstances and acting as though you're the least fortunate,

574
00:43:33,970 --> 00:43:39,980
you're not... the type of person with a knife in his mouth, stabbing innocent people, are you?

575
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,670
Isn't that being too self-conscious?

576
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,230
Leader...

577
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:56,660
I'm the leader so I don't plan to give up on anyone.

578
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:02,380
Let's divide the work into six parts, and if the rest don't do it, then I will.

579
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:10,900
Then I have no choice but to back out.

580
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,180
Senior!

581
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:19,680
What do we do? If Senior Soo Hyun leaves then we're done for!

582
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,430
Don't worry, Senior. I'll bring him.

583
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:33,110
Senior, what happened? I've been trying to contact you this whole time.

584
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,460
I was playing a couple of rounds of billiard...

585
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:37,540
Senior, did you drink alcohol?

586
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:39,070
We were playing for chicken and beer.

587
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:42,330
You bastard, Nam Soo Hyun!

588
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,310
Hey, what did you say about my age?

589
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,320
Say it again.

590
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:51,400
I told you, if you're 26, to act your age.

591
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,320
This bastard. He doesn't even know about seniority and is saying anything he wants.

592
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,010
While you were out playing billiards and drinking alcohol, you were wasting the precious time of your juniors.

593
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:00,380
Is that something a senior should be doing?

594
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,410
This jerk! Do you want to die?

595
00:45:03,410 --> 00:45:05,460
You dodged?

596
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:06,300
You won't come here?

597
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,540
Bring it on, jerk. You're always acting up.

598
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:10,880
Senior! Senior, you should let it go.

599
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,610
This is a school.

600
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,570
Let go.

601
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:15,030
What are you doing, not holding him back?

602
00:45:15,030 --> 00:45:17,980
Hey, hey, let him be. Nam Soo Hyun that bastard...

603
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:18,860
- needs to get his head on straight.
- Senior!

604
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:22,520
Senior, you're drunk right now. Don't cause trouble and just go home, okay?

605
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,450
You're all crazy.

606
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:26,210
Hey, Joon, you won't let go?

607
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:27,930
One... two...

608
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,540
Come with me and Senior Chun Gook to have a few more drinks.

609
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,200
Joon!

610
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,990
Joon! Are you okay?

611
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,770
Hey! Don't look down on me just because you have a bit of money.

612
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:51,060
You think we don't know that you're talking about us behind our backs?

613
00:45:51,060 --> 00:45:53,350
Where do you think you're running away to!

614
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,910
Don't hit him!

615
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:01,590
You can just say it with words! Why are you hitting him!?

616
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:04,070
I said don't hit him!

617
00:46:04,070 --> 00:46:06,020
Don't hit him...

618
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:18,380
Yeo Joon...

619
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:22,070
Don't hit...

620
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,710
I'm fine.

621
00:46:56,710 --> 00:46:59,610
Just a moment It's all done.

622
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:08,190
- Here...
- I'll do it.

623
00:47:13,550 --> 00:47:18,630
Joon... do you think he'll be okay on his own?

624
00:47:20,590 --> 00:47:23,580
If you're concerned, why don't you go look for him?

625
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:26,790
I don't know where he lives.

626
00:47:28,690 --> 00:47:31,080
I'm getting up first. It's time for my part-time job.

627
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:34,750
Senior...

628
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:39,020
will you really be leaving the group project?

629
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,760
You said that you would return the debt if the chance arose.

630
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:49,990
That debt... please return it now.

631
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:53,310
Please don't leave.

632
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:55,690
You're needed.

633
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:58,990
Are you going to do the others' jobs if they mess everything up?

634
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:01,160
As the team leader?

635
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,820
No, I was mistaken about that.

636
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:12,090
Grades should be based on your own contributions.

637
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:17,350
All right, then I'll stay.

638
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:20,670
Really?

639
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,530
Just one more thing...

640
00:48:23,530 --> 00:48:25,810
It seems like I have quite the debt.

641
00:48:27,950 --> 00:48:32,090
Joon... he's not usually like that.

642
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:34,610
I wonder what happened earlier.

643

Please understand.

644

Do you know what he's like usually?

645
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:46,430
Well, Joon is usually all smiles and sociable.

646
00:48:46,430 --> 00:48:49,630
He doesn't seem like he acts too sensitive with others.

647
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:52,090
I suppose you're right.

648
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:57,070
But I can't listen to your request to understand him. That's not possible for me.

649
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,580

655

Mom called me first, it wasn't me.

656
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:01,660
I told you to tell me if you're going home.

I don't want to.

658
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,970
Why do I have to do that?

659
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:09,450
Why do I have to get permission from you to go home?

660
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,850
Because it's not your home.

661
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:15,380
Then you're not my brother either.

Unni, you're lucky your younger son has so much charm.

665
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:27,970
And your older son is the country's youngest professor.

666
00:51:27,970 --> 00:51:31,210
You've raised both of your children well.

667

Of course, you have to raise your own children well.

Yeah.

670
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:41,430
Oh, by the way, our Chan Woo started at Seoul National University.

671
00:51:41,430 --> 00:51:43,170
He's Joon Wan's junior now.

672
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:47,590
Just because you go to the same school, doesn't make you the same level.

673
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,960
Joon, what department is it that you're in at Seoul University?

674
00:51:58,950 --> 00:52:02,120
I didn't get into Seoul University, I decided on Myeongil University...

675
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:07,390
That's right! I was mistaken because everyone in our family went to Seoul National University.

676
00:52:07,390 --> 00:52:09,020
Sorry.

677
00:52:15,660 --> 00:52:17,650
Aunt, my school is nice!

678
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,520
Joon Wan is also a professor there.

679
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:24,260
Yeah, I thought he'd be a professor at Seoul National University or KAIST.

680
00:52:24,260 --> 00:52:25,980
Barely Myeongil University?

681

683
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,270
Be it Seoul University that I came out of and aunt's son went to or Joon's Myeongil university, all are from there to there.

684
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,050
What do you mean they're the same!

685
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:39,060
What nonsense.

686
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:43,030
The standard of universities in our country all seems the same internationally.

687
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:46,700
None of them stands out for their educational system.

01:01:46,620 --> 01:01:48,430
I expected it to change a bit.

806
01:01:48,430 --> 01:01:51,300
Thank you for reminding me that you're a psychopath.

807
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,880
How about just liking me?

808
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:58,130
It has eventually become your way. I'm calling you first and talking to you first.

809
01:01:58,130 --> 01:02:00,890
Since you have spent your youth on me, I will compensate you.

810
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,520
- With what?
- Chicken and beer.

811
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:05,950
I don't know who your first love is. But I think it's a shame that he doesn't like you.

812
01:02:05,950 --> 01:02:07,050
Is it that weird?

813
01:02:07,050 --> 01:02:09,790
Chan Ki bought this bracelet for me at a stationery store when we were 8 years old.

814
01:02:09,790 --> 01:02:11,980
It's the weirdest.

815
01:02:11,980 --> 01:02:15,720
5, 4, 3, 2, 1!

816
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:19,530
Use me. I'll be your boyfriend.

817
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:23,270
♫ My dear ♫
