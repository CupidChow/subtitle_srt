Youmin, you must take it.

20
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
This is the legendary fan of Qinghua Palace

21
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
in the past.

22
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Now I give it to you.

23
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't let me down.

24
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I don't want it, master.

25
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I don't want it, master.

26
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I don't want anything, master.

27
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Please don't leave me.

28
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I'm not mature enough.

29
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I need your teaching.

30
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
When I have the right to burn you,

31
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you can give it to me.

32
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Silly boy.

33
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
People need to learn to grow up.

34
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Promise me, master.

35
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
No matter what happens,

36
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
you must live on.

37
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't want it, master.

38
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I only want you to be well.

39
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You can't leave me.

40
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Sister.

41
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sister.

42
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Are you here to see me?

43
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Or do you know your mistake?

44
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Can you forgive me, sister?

45
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Don't be afraid.

46
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I will protect you forever.

47
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
We will never be apart.

48
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Master.

49
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Master.

50
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Master.

51
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Master.

52
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Master.

53
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Master.

54
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Master.

55
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Master.

56
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Master.

57
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Master.

58
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Master.

59
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Master.

60
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Master.

61
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Master.

62
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Master.

63
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Master.

64
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Master.

65
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Master.

66
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Master.

67
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Master.

68
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Ling Xi.

69
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I will take you home.

70
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will take you home.

71
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How is she?

72
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
She is in danger.

73
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
She will wake up soon.

74
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's your fault.

75
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Nan Xu.

76
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I will ask you again.

77
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
What else does she have except Ling Xi?

78
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I'm reduced to a rock.

79
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
What ainos Kanalå‘€

80
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,000
mindless water?

81
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Leave people to hate zither.

82
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,300
So this is the secret you told me.

83
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,500
Looking at her, she's in a sense of Porter.

84
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,400
She treated her as deer and lion.

85
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,000
Why doesn't she speak the truth?

86
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
How do you know she wants to hide it?

87
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
How do you know he doesn't want to hug you?

88
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,000
All the way, he has suffered a lot for you.

89
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Not enough.

90
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
But he just wants to be free.

91
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'll tell you the secret.

92
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
He never thought about forgetting you.

93
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
He doesn't remember he was attracted to Wu Xin water.

94
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
He only remembers he was loyal to Sang Qi.

95
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
It means his memory has been altered by the human.

96
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The reason why he will feel pain again and again,

97
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
is because Wu Xin water can make people deny this relationship.

98
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But it can't be erased from the root.

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Every time he feels pain,

100
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
it's proof that he loves you.

101
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
That's why I envy you.

102
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,000
If you are jealous, why do you tell me this?

103
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I don't want to be completely destroyed because of this.

104
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
I don't want to be completely destroyed.

105
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let me be jealous of myself.

106
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
He is cultivating the friendship knife.

107
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
And Wu Xin water is cultivating the heartless knife.

108
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The medicine is in conflict with the heart of the knife.

109
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,000
That means the stronger his spiritual power,

110
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
the more dangerous it is.

111
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If we want to save him,

112
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
we can only get rid of the poison of Wu Xin water.

113
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Since you say so,

114
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
you know the solution.

115
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
There is one thing that can cure the poison of Wu Xin water.

116
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
What is it?

117
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The Longevity forest.

118
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
It is born on the Qiongju Island.

119
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
It is the place of Wu water in the west of Mount Luo Wu.

120
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It is born with the plant of Wu Xin.

121
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The plant of Wu Xin can numb people's sense of seven emotions and six desires.

122
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The Longevity forest is the most clear and bitter thing in the world.

123
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The two are born and die together.

124
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
The bitterness of the forest can cure the poison of Wu Xin grass.

125
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
When he wakes up,

126
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I will take him to Mount Luo Wu.

127
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And...

128
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
It is not easy to let him know that the poison of Wu Xin water is not cured.

129
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Even if he wakes up,

130
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
he still forgets about you and has a hostile feeling.

131
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
If he talks too much, he will have a heart attack.

132
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
It will be more difficult to cure.

133
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Nan Xuyuan.

134
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I suddenly found that

135
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I don't know you.

136
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I have told you before.

137
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Ten years have passed.

138
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
People will change.

139
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
So these ten years

140
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
are not only me

141
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
but also you.

142
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
It is everyone.

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Everything.

144
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Nothing in this world is unchangeable.

145
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Just like today.

146
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I tell you the truth.

147
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
It doesn't mean I give up on him.

148
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
If I really want to fight,

149
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
what do you think?

150
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Now you don't have this chance.

151
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I will be better.

152
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I hope you can.

153
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Excuse me.

154
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Where is Gao Qiu Ming and Gao Xiu Shi?

155
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
When the funeral ended,

156
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Gao Xiu Sister was invited to the main hall by her classmates.

157
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
She said she had something important to discuss.

158
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Over there.

159
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
How dare you be the chief?

160
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Gao Qiu Ming, you are good-natured.

161
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
In the Palace of Pure Flower,

162
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:24,820
everyone is willing to be a

163
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:26,820
Is that what everyone thinks?

164
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Gao Qiu Ming,

165
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:40,820
I have told you directly.

166
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
We are not the same as the Phoenix City.

167
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,820
It's just that Master has a blood relationship with you.

168
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,820
He always says you are the one who protects you.

169
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:49,820
If we offend you

170
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,820
and get punished,

171
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,820
how can we not go to the camp?

172
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Now Master has passed away.

173
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,820
He should be a normal person.

174
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
The Palace of Pure Flower

175
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,820
will not be handed over to someone like you.

176
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,820
You are all acting like you are being righteous.

177
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,820
It's just an excuse to fight for power.

178
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:09,820
Princess Su just left.

179
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,820
You are so down to earth to your classmates.

180
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:15,820
Fu Xiu Shi,

181
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:18,820
you and Gao Qiu Ming are not close enough.

182
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,820
How do you know her?

183
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,820
I know her very well.

184
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:23,820
I am from the Bixiao Palace.

185
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,820
I shouldn't have talked about the Palace of Pure Flower.

186
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,820
But as Gao Xiu Shi's friend,

187
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,820
I want to ask you.

188
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,820
After spending so many years together,

189
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,820
you really don't know her true nature.

190
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
You only remember her arrogance.

191
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,820
You can't see her change.

192
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Has she never helped you?

193
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Has she never paid you any attention?

194
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,820
Fu Xiu Shi,

195
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,820
you are a guest,

196
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
but you are only a guest.

197
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
If you want to interfere with the inner work of the Palace of Pure Flower,

198
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,820
please leave.

199
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Enough.

200
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:58,820
I, Gao Qiu Ming, never take people's place.

201
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,820
I don't want to be the princess.

202
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,820
You can choose again.

203
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:05,820
Choose a qualified leader for the Palace of Pure Flower.

204
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:09,820
Let's go.

205
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,820
You know that

206
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:21,820
they are all saying that for the sake of power.

207
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,820
Wu Ai, I know it myself.

208
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:27,820
I have a temper,

209
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,820
I bully people,

210
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,820
and I am weak.

211
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:31,820
It's not like that.

212
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,820
You are kind and kind.

213
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:34,820
You like to help the weak.

214
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,820
Help what?

215
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
Me.

216
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
You are the weak.

217
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,820
I am not good enough.

218
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:54,820
I thought in the past,

219
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,820
because I am a family member,

220
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,820
they always spoiled me.

221
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,820
Maybe I don't know how to treat my family.

222
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,820
My family members have a bad temper.

223
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,820
I have a bad temper.

224
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,820
From Ming Yue Villa to Golden Flower,

225
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,820
they always say that

226
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,820
I am not smart enough,

227
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,820
not strong enough,

228
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,820
and always let them down.

229
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,820
Now I know that

230
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
their love and help to me

231
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,820
at that time

232
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
was because they thought I was a bad person.

233
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:41,820
I...

234
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,820
Forget it.

235
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,820
No one really likes me

236
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:49,820
in this world.

237
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:02,820
Actually, you don't know how to treat people

238
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:04,820
because you have never been treated well.

239
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,820
It's not your fault.

240
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,820
Why can't you forgive yourself?

241
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,820
Anyway, don't be so annoying in the future.

242
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:18,820
I will treat you as a real friend.

243
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,820
It has nothing to do with you.

244
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,820
Honestly,

245
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:26,820
even if you still care about me,

246
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,820
if they scold you again,

247
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:28,820
I will still go back for your mother.

248
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,820
Okay, don't cry.

249
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,820
Do you want a friend's bag?

250
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,820
Don't cry.

251
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,820
Do you want a friend's bag?

252
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,820
No.

253
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,820
Mr. Gao,

254
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,820
go back to Bixia Palace with me.

255
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,820
Fu Lansheng,

256
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,820
even if I can't stay in the Palace of Pure Flower,

257
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
I can't go.

258
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,820
I don't have no place to go.

259
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,820
You don't have to pity me.

260
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,820
I'm not pitying you.

261
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Isn't it normal to invite a friend

262
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,820
to play in your own house?

263
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,820
Really?

264
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,820
Of course.

265
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,820
And Bixia Palace is very big.

266
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,820
You can totally be your own home.

267
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,820
I don't mind sharing with you.

268
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,820
If you want to share,

269
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:34,820
then forget it.

270
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,820
But if I go to your house to be a guest,

271
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,820
I can consider it.

272
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:40,820
Then it's a deal.

273
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:43,820
Mr. Gao.

274
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,820
Thank you, Goddess.

275
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,820
Mr. Gao,

276
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,820
I want to talk to you alone.

277
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,820
Do you want me to tell you about the matter of the Palace of Pure Flower?

278
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
No need.

279
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,820
They don't like me.

280
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,820
I don't like them either.

281
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:10,820
Anyway, they want to take the place of the Princess of Pure Flower.

282
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,820
I don't care about them.

283
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,820
If you need it,

284
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,820
you can go to Snowblade City.

285
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
I'm not going to Snowblade City.

286
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,820
You know that the Soul Bead of Mu Xuan Ling

287
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,820
will protect her better.

288
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,820
If I go to Snowblade City,

289
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,820
she will be annoyed to see me.

290
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:26,820
I will be annoyed to see her.

291
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,820
And I will only help you.

292
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,820
The Soul Bead of Mu Xuan Ling

293
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,820
is her own business.

294
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,820
Now only you, Sang Qi and I know it.

295
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,820
I was thinking

296
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,820
if you would tell this to others.

297
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,820
Now it seems that

298
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,820
you won't.

299
00:22:45,820 --> 00:22:46,820
I will.

300
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,820
I... I won't say it because I want to

301
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,820
take her handle in my hand.

302
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,820
Mu Xuan Ling will be afraid of me when she sees me.

303
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,820
A tough person is soft-hearted.

304
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,820
I'm very hard-hearted.

305
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
Anyway,

306
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,820
thank you.

307
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,820
I'm sorry.

308
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,820
I can't open the barrier.

309
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
You can come in by yourself.

310
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,820
You sneaked into my room

311
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:31,820
to hide Xie Xue Chen.

312
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,820
But do you have any news to tell me?

313
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,820
Sang Qi has gone back to the dark domain.

314
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,820
I heard that the door of the Sacred Heir is always closed.

315
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
He hasn't appeared yet.

316
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,820
I didn't expect that Sang Qi

317
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,820
hates Su Ning Xi because of her.

318
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:46,820
That's good.

319
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
He is staying with Su Ning Xi all day now.

320
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,820
It's a relief for the late king.

321
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,820
But this Palace of Flower

322
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,820
has been hit so hard.

323
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,820
It's really amazing.

324
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:03,820
If we calculate it like this,

325
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:05,820
my master's life

326
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,820
has been ruined by their conspiracy.

327
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,820
If we have to take revenge,

328
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,820
we can't owe anyone.

329
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,820
I know that

330
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,820
you are very angry

331
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,820
with those who are the knights of the spiritual clan.

332
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:23,820
But you weren't a person

333
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,820
who was led by hatred.

334
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,820
I also know that

335
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
your heart

336
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,820
must be very, very messy now.

337
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
But don't worry.

338
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,820
Many things

339
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,820
will be clear soon.

340
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,820
What do you mean?

341
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,820
This jade plate

342
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
is engraved with my defense formation.

343
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,820
If I am in danger,

344
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,820
even if I am in a hurry,

345
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,820
I can block it.

346
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,820
This weapon is known as a sacred item.

347
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:03,820
You just give it to me.

348
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,820
It doesn't matter

349
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:08,820
if it's a sacred item.

350
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,820
It's only valuable

351
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,820
if it can protect the one you want to protect.

352
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,820
Just keep it.

353
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,820
Let's go.

354
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:34,820
This time,

355
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,820
I have to suggest that

356
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,820
they improve the fire in the prison.

357
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,820
I don't want to take you to the prison.

358
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:42,820
Where are we going?

359
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
Xie Xuechen,

360
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,820
why did you take me

361
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,820
to Qiongju Island?

362
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,820
This is the way to

363
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:09,820
the mountain of Luowu.

364
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,820
What are you going to Luowu for?

365
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,820
To find a flower.

366
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
What flower?

367
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,820
The Longevity Lotus.

368
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,820
You are young,

369
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,820
but you are not old anymore.

370
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,820
I don't know

371
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,820
what you are talking about.

372
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
I just want to ask you

373
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,820
if it's not better to let her know

374
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,820
that the poison of the Heart-wrenching Water is not resolved yet,

375
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:36,820
even if she wakes up,

376
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,820
it will make her

377
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,820
have a heart attack

378
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,820
and it will be more difficult to treat.

379
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,820
That's right.

380
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,820
Then why are you taking me?

381
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,820
I don't take you,

382
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,820
and I don't know

383
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,820
where you will go.

384
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,820
Qiongju Island is the strength range of the Nailin tribe.

385
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,820
The Nailin tribe of the East Sea

386
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,820
always does not obey the rules

387
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,820
and the wind is cold.

388
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,820
Try not to disturb them.

389
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,820
We will go back after we have finished the Longevity Lotus.

390
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
If you deliberately cause trouble,

391
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,820
the consequences will be severe.

392
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,820
If I call you

393
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,820
Master Xie here,

394
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,820
do you think those kings of the Nailin tribe

395
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
will come out to kill you

396
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,820
in the Qing Dynasty?

397
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,820
They dare not

398
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,820
and they can't.

399
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,820
Master Xie is always so confident.

400
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,820
I deliberately trained the sword and flag,

401
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
and acted in a low-key manner.

402
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,820
But you,

403
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,820
don't cause trouble to the Nailin tribe of the East Sea.

404
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,820
Are you hungry?

405
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,820
I...

406
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,820
Please enjoy.

407
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,820
Thank you.

408
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:00,820
What are you looking at?

409
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,820
Eat.

410
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:06,820
I think the Nailin tribe is better than the people.

411
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:08,820
At least they don't pretend to be good.

412
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,820
They are so frank and honest.

413
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,820
I can just watch them.

414
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,820
What's wrong with that?

415
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,820
I don't know.

416
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,820
I just want to know

417
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:20,820
what they are doing.

418
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:22,820
I don't know.

419
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,820
I just want to know

420
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,820
what they are doing.

421
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:27,820
I just want to know

422
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
what they are doing.

423
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,820
It's you.

424
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
Do you like that?

425
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,820
Is it the beauty who I met in the oil field?

426
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,820
Or the snake spirit of that beauty?

427
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,820
Don't worry.

428
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,820
It's far away from Yongxue City.

429
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:46,820
You can't fly away even if you want to.

430
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
I won't tell anyone.

431
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,820
How about it?

432
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,820
Don't say anything if you don't know how to talk.

433
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,820
It's dangerous after sunset.

434
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,820
You should eat well.

435
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,820
Have a good rest.

436
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,820
We will leave tomorrow morning.

437
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,820
Here.

438
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,820
Brother Ren Xiu,

439
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,820
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:28,820
Brother Ren Xiu,

441
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,820
do you want to stay in the hotel?

442
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,820
But there is no room for you in the inn today.

443
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,820
But my room is big.

444
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,820
The bed is soft.

445
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:38,820
Brother Xiu,

446
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,820
would you like to share the bed with me?

447
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,820
No need to say thank you.

448
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,820
Boss Shen.

449
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,820
You like Ren Xiu again.

450
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,820
Is there anything wrong with our Hu family?

451
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:55,820
I just like Ren Xiu

452
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,820
for her elegance and elegance.

453
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:01,820
I'm not as reserved as you.

454
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,820
That's exactly what you are.

455
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,820
Go away.

456
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,820
Is it the right way

457
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,820
to have a brother with this sister?

458
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:13,820
Yes.

459
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,820
You are a mute.

460
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,820
Poor you.

461
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,820
But it doesn't matter.

462
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,820
My place is not your place.

463
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,820
You can come here as you like.

464
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,820
I'm not a mute.

465
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,820
I'm a girl.

466
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:38,820
I'm not a girl.

467
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,820
I'm a girl.

468
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,820
I'm a girl.

469
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,820
You can come here as you like.

470
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
You can give me the ring if you want.

471
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,820
The spirit clan of Donghai is indeed weak.

472
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,820
Even a snake can be defeated.

473
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,820
Brother Xiu,

474
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,820
you don't even dislike this spirit clan.

475
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,820
But you dislike me?

476
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,820
But it doesn't matter.

477
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,820
I don't dislike you as a person.

478
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,820
We enjoy the same things.

479
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820
I suggest you say less.

480
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:09,820
I don't like the temper of the person around me.

481
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,820
You can deal with it.

482
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,820
Why don't you go by yourself?

483
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,820
You are always hesitant to deal with this kind of snake.

484
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,820
Or you want to be a mute?

485
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,820
Let me do it.

486
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,820
Let me do it.

487
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,820
Sister, come on.

488
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,820
Do it.

489
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,820
I'm done.

490
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,820
The spirit clan respects the strongest the most.

491
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:47,820
But I hit you with my eyes.

492
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,820
Hurry up.

493
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:49,820
Get a room for two.

494
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,820
Two.

495
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,820
One.

496
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,820
Two people are too crowded.

497
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,820
No, no.

498
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:58,820
Our room is very big.

499
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,820
Two people can't be crowded.

500
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,820
Come with me.

501
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,820
I have something to ask you.

502
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:11,820
You are so careless.

503
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,820
I guess you have been running the shop for a long time.

504
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,820
Do you know there is a place in Mount Luo Wu called Seven Phoenix Forest?

505
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
Why do you go there?

506
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:20,820
There are many people there.

507
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,820
They are all injured.

508
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,820
Some are dying, some are in trouble.

509
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:25,820
It's so dangerous.

510
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,820
No one dares to set up a place there for many years.

511
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
Give me the map.

512
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,820
Okay.

513
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,820
I will help you.

514
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,820
Come on.

515
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,820
Yes.

516
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,820
This way, please.

517
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:39,820
Please.

518
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,820
Boss She.

519
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,820
Why haven't you done anything yet?

520
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:57,820
Did you really fall into the trap?

521
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,820
You don't understand.

522
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:03,820
The most important thing to be a snake is to be able to move and move.

523
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,820
I was wrong.

524
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,820
I thought I was a shaman.

525
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,820
I caught a beauty and hid here.

526
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,820
Who knows I am a master of magic.

527
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
It's not.

528
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:26,820
I didn't expect that snake forest to be so unpretentious.

529
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,820
Maybe it's because I'm too good.

530
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,820
You really think you are good?

531
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,820
You mean I'm not as good as others?

532
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,820
You said it.

533
00:33:39,820 --> 00:33:40,820
I didn't say it.

534
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:48,820
When I was in the garden, why didn't I kill you with a sword?

535
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,820
I remember you said last time that you couldn't bear to leave me.

536
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,820
You sleep in the bed tonight.

537
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,820
I'll change it when I make a mistake.

538
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:09,820
I'm just a street ball.

539
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:11,820
I don't deserve to sleep in the bed.

540
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,820
You are grateful to have a chair.

541
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,820
Since you know you are a street ball,

542
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:21,820
you should obey.

543
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
You are trying to get revenge on me, right?

544
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:28,820
Because I fooled you when you were sealed by the magic.

545
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:31,820
So you are trying to get revenge on me.

546
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:36,820
I didn't expect the leader of the demon sect is so self-righteous.

547
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:39,820
So that's what you think of me.

548
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,820
What else? Did I think wrong?

549
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:48,820
Do you remember what you did to me?

550
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:04,820
So do you want me to be self-righteous and do you want me to be self-righteous?

551
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,820
Or do you want me to be obedient?

552
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:18,820
Thank you for your revenge. I'll sleep.

553
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,820
You are the leader of the snow city.

554
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,820
You are the leader of the Alliance.

555
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,820
The Alliance is the leader.

556
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,820
We should follow the moral principle.

557
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,820
You don't need to mind my affairs.

558
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:41,820
If you are just trying to get revenge on me,

559
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,820
I apologize.

560
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:46,820
Please don't take me seriously.

561
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:02,820
Why is he here?

562
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:06,820
Is he really here to find the old demon of the longevity tribe?

563
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,820
Before he left, Nan Xuyue sent me a jade tablet.

564
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:14,820
Does he know where Xie Xuecheng is taking me?

565
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,820
You can't sleep?

566
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:26,820
Maybe you are not awake.

567
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:31,820
Maybe my recent behavior makes you feel uncomfortable.

568
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,820
It's my fault.

569
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,820
But there is one thing I want to make clear.

570
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:40,820
I have never played tricks on you.

571
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,820
I didn't do it in the past.

572
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:45,820
I didn't do it now.

573
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,820
Of course.

574
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Thank you for being a gentleman.

575
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:53,820
I'm very flattered.

576
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,820
I think too much.

577
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,820
Have a good rest.

578
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
We will leave tomorrow morning.

579
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,820
Young princess.

580
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,820
Okay.

581
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,820
Father, mother, we are back.

582
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:30,820
I am Gao Qiumin.

583
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,820
Greetings, father and princess.

584
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,820
Elder Duan.

585
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:34,820
You are welcome.

586
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Please sit.

587
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,820
I heard that the princess died.

588
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,820
We didn't get to see her.

589
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:47,820
Please forgive us.

590
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:49,820
Is everything okay in Jinghua palace?

591
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Thank you for your concern.

592
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,820
I am very grateful.

593
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
Everything is fine in Jinghua palace.

594
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,820
Speaking of which,

595
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,820
Gao Xiu is the disciple of Princess Su.

596
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,820
Now the master died.

597
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:07,820
The affairs in the palace should be the most busy time.

598
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,820
Gao Xiu is instead...

599
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,820
The palace is now handled by the sisters.

600
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,820
Mother, I'm afraid Qiumin will be unhappy.

601
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,820
I asked him to come to our house.

602
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:21,820
I don't want to hear that.

603
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,820
You should treat her well.

604
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:29,820
Gao Xiu, you should stay in Bixiao palace for a while.

605
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
You should practice hard.

606
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,820
I can be more respectful to you.

607
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,820
Sheng.

608
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,820
Today is the day

609
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,820
the five managers of business will report to us.

610
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:38,820
You should go and handle it.

611
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,820
Don't keep them waiting.

612
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,820
Gao Xiu, right?

613
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,820
I will let the steward

614
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:48,820
clean the guest room in your yard.

615
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,820
Okay, I will see her off.

616
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,820
Let's go.

617
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:53,820
The steward has been waiting for more than an hour.

618
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,820
Go.

619
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,820
If you need anything, just go ahead.

620
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,820
I will leave first.

621
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
I will go.

622
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,820
My leader.

623
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,820
Which one did you sing today?

624
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,820
Madam.

625
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,820
Madam.

626
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
Madam.

627
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,820
Didn't you make her and Sheng together?

628
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,820
Why are you so cold to her today?

629
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
Gao Qiumin

630
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,820
is obviously a wife

631
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
who lost her husband and became a concubine of Jinghua palace.

632
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,820
So, what?

633
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,820
Are you going to abandon her?

634
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:36,820
Abandon?

635
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:38,820
No matter how she is broken,

636
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,820
she is born to be a drunkard after she is famous.

637
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,820
She is so good to our little brat.

638
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:43,820
What are you thinking?

639
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,820
Then, how can you be cold?

640
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
I heard that

641
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
this is the first time that a mother-in-law is going to have a daughter-in-law.

642
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,820
She must be killed to get her status.

643
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:55,820
Did I kill her well?

644
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,820
When did she say she was going to be your daughter-in-law?

645
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,820
What's wrong with being my daughter-in-law?

646
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,820
I will take off the moon she is on the sky

647
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,820
and give it to her.

648
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:05,820
But she has to be willing to do it.

649
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:08,820
Gao.

650
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
Gao Min.

651
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Our young princess is the best with servants.

652
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,820
So,

653
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,820
all the maids are better than you.

654
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,820
She is hitting me.

655
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,820
Who are you?

656
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:26,820
You are also brought back by the young princess?

657
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,820
Where is she?

658
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,820
You are the young princess' friend.

659
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:31,820
You are so beautiful.

660
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
I think so, too.

661
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,820
So beautiful.

662
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,820
This guy

663
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,820
has also signed too many money-making debts.

664
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I don't like to read

665
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,820
the accounts.

666
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,820
The income fluctuation of millions of taels

667
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,820
every day

668
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,820
and the total amount of money

669
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,820
are not visible at all.

670
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
The young princess is blessed.

671
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:58,820
These trivial things

672
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,820
are for people like us

673
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
who are not blessed.

674
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,820
Chief Zeng is always lazy to interrupt business.

675
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,820
If you are considered to be one of the people who are not blessed,

676
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,820
what other blessed people are there in this world?

677
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,820
Of course, it's you, young princess.

678
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,820
I heard that you brought back

679
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,820
a beauty from the Palace of Flower.

680
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,820
It's said that she is a beauty born to be beautiful.

681
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:22,820
It's really enviable and jealous of us.

682
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,820
You are so well-informed.

683
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:31,820
I don't know what the master is doing now.

684
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
He won't be a person in my yard, right?

685
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,820
I have to go back to the yard to see

686
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
in case someone lights it.

687
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,820
Young princess, take care.

688
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,820
Young princess, take care.

689
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:44,820
Young princess, take care.

690
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,820
By the way,

691
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,820
has Chief Zeng been working hard recently?

692
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,820
No, no.

693
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,820
No wonder the account book is so dirty.

694
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:53,820
How about this?

695
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:54,820
Let Chief Wang

696
00:41:54,820 --> 00:42:03,840
take care of the

697
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:14,820
It's raining.

698
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,820
It's beautiful.

699
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,820
So beautiful.

700
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:21,820
Not bad.

701
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:22,820
So beautiful.

702
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:23,820
Young princess.

703
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:24,820
Young princess.

704
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:25,820
I'm finally back.

705
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:26,820
Why did I hear someone

706
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,820
talking bad about me when I came back?

707
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,820
What's the big deal?

708
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
We are a family from now on.

709
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:35,820
A family?

710
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,820
We won't disturb

711
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,820
the young princess and Sister Qiuming.

712
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:40,820
We'll leave first.

713
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,820
We'll go first.

714
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:42,820
Let's go.

715
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:43,820
Hurry up.

716
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:44,820
Hurry up.

717
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,820
I thought you wouldn't get used to it.

718
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,820
But you became a family

719
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,820
in such a short time.

720
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,820
Of course.

721
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,820
They are all good to me.

722
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,820
I'm happy to be with them.

723
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,820
The main reason is

724
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,820
that I look good.

725
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,820
I'm better than them.

726
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,820
Indeed.

727
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,820
Indeed.

728
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,820
But Lin Yan just told me

729
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:11,820
they are all

730
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:12,820
your ancestors.

731
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:14,820
They are good to me

732
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:16,820
because you treat them well.

733
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,820
Really?

734
00:43:20,820 --> 00:43:21,820
Not bad.

735
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:26,820
Thank you.

736
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,820
Why are you thanking me?

737
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:30,820
My mother's attitude today.

738
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:31,820
If you don't get angry with me,

739
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,820
I'll burn the incense.

740
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
Of course not.

741
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:36,820
You told me

742
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,820
to be a kind person.

743
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,820
Very good.

744
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:41,820
Stop.

745
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:43,820
You are so nice.

746
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:44,820
I'm wondering

747
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,820
if you were

748
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,820
taken advantage of by someone.

749
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,820
I'm a man of my word.

750
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,820
Of course I have to say something nice.

751
00:43:48,820 --> 00:43:50,820
You are a man of your word.

752
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:52,820
I'm a man of my word.

753
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
I should do this.

754
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,820
I don't know

755
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,820
what I'm thinking about.

756
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:48,820
I don't need to ask

757
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:51,820
how long I've been in love.

758
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:54,820
I give my blood and my soul for love.

759
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,820
I will never disappoint you.

760
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:04,820
I look back at the days when we spent together.

761
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:09,820
I look at the dream of that person.

762
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:18,820
I don't want to be with you anymore.

763
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:47,820
I will never disappoint you.

764
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:53,820
I look back at the days when we spent together.

765
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,820
I look at the dream of that person.

766
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:00,820
I don't want to be with you anymore.

767
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:07,820
I don't want to be with you anymore.

768
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:17,820
I look back at the days when we spent together.

769
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:26,820
I look back at the days when we spent together.
