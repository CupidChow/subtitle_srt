Episode 16

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Until I knew the truth about Nanxu Yue,

7
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I finally understood that

8
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I was looking for you.

9
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I made you my fiancée for ten thousand years.

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You were always sleeping.

11
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
That's good.

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Fortunately, in this life,

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I finally found you.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'm looking for your face between the ashes.

15
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
If you can't find it in your heart,

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'll help you heal.

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Half of the body's energy is needed to heal.

18
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Would you like to pay the price?

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm willing to use half of the power of the chaos to help you heal.

20
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm not believing you.

21
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm just trying to finish the grudge.

22
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
From now on,

23
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
we'll go our separate ways.

24
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm willing to help you heal.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm willing to help you heal.

26
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
We'll go our separate ways.

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,260
The

28
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:47,000
Immortal Alliance has been controlled by the Demon Lord.

29
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The Demon Lord said that he would come to exchange the lives of the Alliance.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Only when five incense sticks are lit,

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
the Demon Lord will set out a sect.

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Only then will the five sects of the Alliance be destroyed.

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Which sect should I start from?

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Don't do this.

35
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'm scared.

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
If you want to kill me, come at me.

37
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't make things difficult for the child.

38
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm afraid.

39
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm afraid.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm afraid.

41
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm afraid.

42
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I'm afraid.

43
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I'm afraid.

44
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'm afraid.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you want to kill me, come at me.

46
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't make things difficult for the child.

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You're too much.

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
A'bao.

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you okay?

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm fine.

51
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The first incense stick has been lit.

52
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's good that we can start from the neighbor.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
A'bao.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're so cold.

55
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shoot.

56
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This isn't a person who doesn't have enough.

57
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can also generate your own demon.

58
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's really funny.

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Why don't I help you?

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What is the secret to your cultivation?

61
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Cultivating the Demon's Way.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Let him go.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Let him go.

64
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Sister Mo.

65
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What are you doing?

66
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
You're finally here.

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Where's Tianming?

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Since he saved you,

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
why didn't he come with you?

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
The god of destiny,

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
where is he hiding?

72
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Where is he hiding?

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Tianming killed Xie Xuchen.

74
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I won't be angry with him.

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
This time,

76
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm here to surrender to you.

77
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Surrender?

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You think I'll believe you?

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You can not believe me.

80
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
But you know very well

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
that Tianming is a ancient weapon.

82
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You can't kill him.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
If I help you,

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
you can get help.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm now using my own life

86
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to exchange you.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I just need you to let go of everyone in the Alliance.

88
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You're not qualified

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
to negotiate with me.

90
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
What I want is the power of chaos.

91
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Sister!

92
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If I don't surrender,

93
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
no one can get the power of chaos.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You're looking for your own death.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If you kill me,

96
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
you'll never get the power of chaos.

97
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Let go of everyone in the Alliance.

98
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll go back to the dark domain with you.

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since you know it as you promised,

100
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,520
I'll let go of those

101
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
who are trying to kill me.

102
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Xiao Bai!

103
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Give me the power of chaos.

104
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What do you want?

105
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you want?

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I want to see

107
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
the power of chaos

108
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
and the power of the Demon King

109
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
combined to destroy the world

110
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
with the power of the whole world.

111
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Destroy the world?

112
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
What's the benefit of that?

113
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The benefit?

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It should be punished.

115
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Over the past ten thousand years,

116
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
people have betrayed me and abandoned me.

117
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I should pay the price.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But the people now

119
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
are not the same as ten thousand years ago.

120
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Nothing is different.

121
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
People change

122
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
but they always change.

123
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I hope you can be kind and considerate.

124
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I hope you can be kind and considerate.

125
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I hope you can be kind and considerate.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
The Heaven's Decree has changed your memory with the world.

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Zhu has never betrayed you.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Zhu has never betrayed you.

129
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
And you

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
are not a demon who kills the world.

131
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
You've always been caring for the world.

132
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You've always been caring for the world.

133
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
The God of God Zhaoming

134
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
who gave his life for the world

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
is all fake.

136
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's not true.

137
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I just know

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
that these ten thousand years

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been suppressed by the Abyss of the Eternal.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've been tortured day and night.

141
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I've been dragged up by the world.

142
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I've been dragged up by the world.

143
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
When I was in pain

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and lonely,

145
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
you and Xie Xuechen were in love.

146
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I've already finished

147
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
the so-called benevolence and benevolence.

148
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The so-called benevolence and benevolence.

149
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Even the cruelty

150
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
when you came back to me

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
made me see the love and memories

152
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
between you and Xie Xuechen.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It made me feel so happy.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Why don't you believe what I said?

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The truth of ten thousand years ago is like this.

156
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The truth of ten thousand years ago is like this.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Maybe I can help you

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
change back to the way it was ten thousand years ago.

159
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Can you let go of everything

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and start over?

161
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Start over?

162
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The pain, torture, and drag up

163
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
that have been going on for ten thousand years

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
are all under my control.

165
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'm telling you

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
no one is qualified to

167
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
tell me that light direction.

168
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
No one is qualified

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
to make decisions for me.

170
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Remember, from now on

171
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
no one will call for the Holy Ruler.

172
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
No one will call for the Holy Ruler.

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The only one who can help Xie Xuechen

174
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is me, the Demon Lord.

175
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Demon Lord

176
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
don't be angry.

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Actually, I also want to

178
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
give you the power of the Chaos.

179
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
But now

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I only have

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
half of the power of the Chaos.

182
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I still need to keep it

183
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to find the other half.

184
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Where is the other half?

185
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
This is urgent.

186
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Stay with me for a while

187
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
and let me see your changes.

188
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will tell you

189
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
where the other half of the power of the Chaos is.

190
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I sealed your power

191
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
and let you go.

192
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I sealed your power

193
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
and let you go.

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I can't escape from the dark jade.

195
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Think about it.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Tell me where the other half of the power of the Chaos is

197
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
and surrender yourself.

198
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Maybe I can let you go.

199
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Otherwise, the bitter

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
and painful torture of the dark jade

201
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
you should know it very well.

202
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Now the Demon Lord

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
is very strong.

204
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Can he really be changed by the evolution?

205
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Great.

206
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It seems that the demon energy in the body

207
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
is really strong.

208
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
It seems that the demon energy in the body

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
is being removed.

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Shouge.

211
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Go.

212
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you all right?

213
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
We are fine.

214
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Thank you for your time.

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
We just removed the demon energy in the body.

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The demon energy is not only not gone,

217
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
but also stronger.

218
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The demon energy is really strange.

219
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The demon energy is really strange.

220
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I felt that the two forces of the two demons

221
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
were interacting with each other.

222
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They were both strong.

223
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The more they wanted to be removed, the more they were affected by the demon energy.

224
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The more they wanted to be removed, the more they were affected by the demon energy.

225
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
They almost couldn't control the power.

226
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The demon Lord is very strong.

227
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
His demon energy is more regular.

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Shouge, let's try again.

229
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We can definitely succeed.

230
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm afraid that

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
this matter

232
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
is not that simple.

233
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
It was originally about breaking through the法像,

234
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
and the life force was very severe,

235
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
and it was against the dark cloud.

236
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
But now,

237
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
the demon energy is being removed.

238
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm afraid that

239
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
the hope is fading away.

240
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I heard that the Lord is unable to sleep at night.

241
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If we give him

242
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the dark cloud's

243
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Chen Nian Lie wine,

244
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
after he drinks it, he will definitely fall asleep.

245
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
He will have a good dream.

246
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
The so-called beautiful wine

247
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
is perfect for a hero.

248
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Perfect!

249
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
When did you learn to

250
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
show off your beauty

251
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
in the war-like war?

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What do you mean by showing off my beauty?

253
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I really admire you.

254
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Do you understand?

255
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Go and show off your wine. The Lord will definitely like it.

256
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Right? I think so too.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm going.

258
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm going.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Our Lord

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
is a man of his word,

261
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
and he is very stubborn.

262
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I bet that the war-like war

263
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
will be over soon.

264
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I don't think so.

265
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I bet

266
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
he will be kicked out

267
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
with a stick.

268
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The Lord has accepted your wine.

269
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The Lord

270
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
is not in the Palace of God.

271
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I put the wine down and came out.

272
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
But it's strange.

273
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why is it that

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
every time I come to the Lord at night,

275
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
he is not there?

276
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's all Zhao Ming's fault!

277
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He made the gods abandon the human clan

278
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and caused the terrible disaster in China!

279
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Zhao Ming is a evil king!

280
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
He is the most evil person in our country!

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
He is a bad guy!

282
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's all his fault!

283
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
He made the gods angry!

284
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
He doesn't deserve to be our lord!

285
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Zhao Ming should have died long ago!

286
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He should have asked for forgiveness

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
and let the gods keep us in their place!

288
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
It's all Zhao Ming's fault!

289
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
He is the one who made the gods angry!

290
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Kill him!

291
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Kill him!

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
In fact, the body has been taken out of the Palace of God.

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
But the soul is suppressed

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
by the seal of the Palace of God.

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
It is still tortured by the Palace of God every night.

296
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Xie Xuechen

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
did this

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
for your Lord.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Every time I kill a deer,

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I will be hurt by the power of the Soul of the Moon.

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
But

302
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
you can't trap me for long.

303
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I will pay

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
back the pain of this endless pain.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I will pay back the pain of this endless pain.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Jun Tian!

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Jun Tian!

308
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Even you can only bear Xie Xuechen

309
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
and don't want to come back.

310
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Good.

311
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Very good.

312
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Xie Xuechen

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
will be

314
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
stable tomorrow?

315
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Will the past be stable?

316
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
No.

317
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Will the human world be better?

318
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
No.

319
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Then why do you still want to rush up?

320
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Isn't it good to let them die?

321
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
In your opinion,

322
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
is the human world a mess?

323
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
No need to say.

324
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
In this mess,

325
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
you don't see any hope?

326
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Just a little bit.

327
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
What kind of bad hope is that?

328
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
With that little bit,

329
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
you can't give up.

330
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Just like the day

331
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I took you back to Yongxue City.

332
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
As long as there is a little bit of hope,

333
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you can't give up.

334
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Xie Xuechen,

335
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
don't worry.

336
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I will do my best

337
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
to protect you.

338
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I will do my best

339
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
to protect this world.

340
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Ye Leng Tianhan,

341
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
you are weak.

342
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
You are not suitable to drink.

343
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Weak?

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Look clearly at who I am.

345
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
It's destiny.

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Isn't it Nan Xuyue?

347
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Nan Xuyue is weak.

348
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
But destiny is strong.

349
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You are not suitable to drink.

350
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
But destiny is different.

351
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Nan Xuyue is not weak.

352
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
But she is too weak to do what she wants.

353
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
And her pain

354
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
comes from

355
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
your decision ten thousand years ago.

356
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
You like Nan Xuyue,

357
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
right?

358
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
No.

359
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
No.

360
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I don't like her.

361
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
That's good.

362
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Today's words,

363
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
I will pretend I didn't ask.

364
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Pack up

365
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
and get ready to go.

366
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Where?

367
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Yongxue City.

368
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Yongxue City?

369
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
That's the place

370
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
where the plan ends.

371
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
You should go there in advance.

372
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Prepare yourself.

373
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Shu Ta is a magical instrument.

374
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
If you use it again,

375
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
you may be noticed by the people.

376
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I will go.

377
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Go.

378
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Brother.

379
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
This is the sign of being a demon.

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
If this continues,

381
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
you and Rongbao will be lost.

382
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
We will be lost by the magic.

383
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Brother, be careful.

384
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Don't be controlled by the magic.

385
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Brother.

386
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Hold on.

387
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
If I don't obey,

388
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I can't control the magic.

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Only when you are in the heaven,

390
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you can destroy your own cultivation.

391
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
You will be the ones who will be punished.

392
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Brother, stop.

393
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I can't destroy my own cultivation.

394
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Kill the red beast.

395
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Yunxiu Villa.

396
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Yunxiu Villa.

397
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The funeral is in the same place.

398
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The dead are dead.

399
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The camp is in the same place.

400
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The Alliance has heard about this.

401
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Before the warm summer,

402
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can be the master of the manor.

403
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I am still the god of destiny.

404
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
As long as the position is the same,

405
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
the position is not important.

406
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
What about your position?

407
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
What is it?

408
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The demon lord is the enemy of the world.

409
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
The people should all have the same position.

410
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
The Alliance has recognized the demon lord.

411
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
I am the god of destiny.

412
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Only I

413
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
can fight against him.

414
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Your Majesty.

415
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I have removed the demon aura for you.

416
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
But you have been injured

417
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:28,960
in the

418
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
south west.

419
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You should be familiar with it.

420
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
I am talking about my heart.

421
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The heart of destiny.

422
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you really want to believe it?

423
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
You have chosen to believe me.

424
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
You have to believe me all the time.

425
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
And you can only believe me.

426
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
This is the medicine made by the god of destiny.

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
It helps to restore the meridians.

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Thank you, miss Feng Yao.

429
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The one who respects the god

430
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
can give up his cultivation

431
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
to avoid the demon lord's harm.

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The cultivation of the person who practices the Tao

433
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
is the most precious.

434
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
If you can't do it,

435
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
you can't do it.

436
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I am not a demon.

437
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Cultivation is the most precious.

438
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Such a high-level cultivation

439
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
can be put down

440
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
just by saying it.

441
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I caused the fire.

442
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I was the leader of the Alliance.

443
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I failed to protect everyone.

444
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
But I was put into the demon aura by the demon lord.

445
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I almost hurt the innocent.

446
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
The cultivation of the body

447
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
was infected with the demon aura.

448
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'd rather destroy it completely.

449
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I won't leave any remaining sins.

450
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I won't allow

451
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
my own evil thoughts to be born.

452
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Black and white are good and evil.

453
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's not a bad thing.

454
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You are really

455
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
ignorant.

456
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Master once said I was ignorant

457
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
and uneducated.

458
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
But after all,

459
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
I found out later

460
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
that I was

461
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
obsessed with the demon aura.

462
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
This is also the reason

463
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
why the demon aura can mess up my martial arts.

464
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Not in the outside world,

465
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
but in the inner world.

466
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
The one who knows the root

467
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
can understand what he knows.

468
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
It's just a matter of time

469
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
to break through the boundary.

470
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
Cultivation is a way

471
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
to break through the difficulty.

472
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Maybe

473
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I just chose the simplest way.

474
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Qiuming.

475
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Are you okay?

476
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
How are you?

477
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
I'm fine. I feel like I had a dream.

478
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I think so.

479
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
That's your memory from ten thousand years ago.

480
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Mu Xianling? Xie Xuechen?

481
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Master.

482
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Fu Lianxing!

483
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
Are you okay?

484
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm fine.

485
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Xie Xuechen, are you crazy?

486
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Qiuming!

487
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
He's not Xie Xuechen.

488
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Now your lives are in his hands.

489
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
How do you choose

490
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
the power of chaos and their lives?

491
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I will give you the power of chaos.

492
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
But not now.

493
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
We are in the dark now.

494
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
If I gave you the power of chaos earlier,

495
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
it would become our colony.

496
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Ten thousand years ago,

497
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
all the people betrayed you.

498
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
But A Yan and Qingyang didn't.

499
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
They could have

500
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
the real freedom and happiness.

501
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
But they chose to go back to the palace

502
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
and die in the war.

503
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
You can be heartless.

504
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
But I believe you will be.

505
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I let them live

506
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
because they died for Zhao Ming.

507
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
But

508
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
if you still don't

509
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
give me the power of chaos,

510
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
I don't mind them dying again.

511
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
What are you doing?

512
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
Since you want to die,

513
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
let them taste the bitter taste of the Longyuan.

514
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
Lan Sheng!

515
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
Qiuming!

516
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
No one can stay in the Longyuan for three days.

517
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
How can they stand it?

518
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Then give me the power of chaos.

519
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Let them stay here

520
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
for seven days.

521
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Maybe they can.

522
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You are playing with people's lives.

523
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Ten thousand years ago,

524
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
when I cherished people's lives,

525
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
people didn't cherish my protection.

526
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
When they

527
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
bowed to the demons of the gods

528
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
and pleaded guilty,

529
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
they chose to be played with.

530
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
Mu Shenlin!

531
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
In the life of Xue Chen,

532
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
the Demon Lord took the Divine Gorge

533
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and left the palace.

534
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I hope that the Divine Gorge

535
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
can be used for the protection of the ancestors

536
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
of Yongxue City

537
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
and help the world to overcome this crisis.

538
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Yi Bo is still in the state of peace.

539
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Now the Divine Lord has ordered

540
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
the God of God to take over Yongxue City.

541
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Although he can play with the Demon Lord,

542
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
he is not sure about it.

543
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I don't know where he will go

544
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
after he is killed.

545
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
We can only take a step at a time.

546
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
If Xue Chen is still here,

547
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
he will take this risk.

548
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Actually,

549
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
until today,

550
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I still feel that

551
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
there is a brother in the Demon Lord's body.

552
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Maybe he is still in a state of awakening.

553
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The Alliance of the Deity is self-righteous and weak.

554
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
How can they be so sneaky?

555
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You are here to kill yourself?

556
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Where is the City Leader?

557
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Xie Xue Chen has long died.

558
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The current master of the Dark Palace

559
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
is the Demon Lord.

560
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
My brother is not dead.

561
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
He is controlled by the Demon Lord.

562
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
You are so naughty.

563
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
Master,

564
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
this disciple of Yongxue City is good at breaking into the Dark Palace

565
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and is planning something.

566
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
I caught him on the spot.

567
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
I spared your life in Yongxue City.

568
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
But I am here to die today.

569
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
Brother,

570
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I know you are powerful and powerful.

571
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
You must be controlled by the Demon Lord

572
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
and controlled by the Deity.

573
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
You have already died

574
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,000
after you came here.

575
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Even if you die today,

576
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
you still have to wake up.

577
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
What a stupid trick.

578
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Brother,

579
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
we grew up together.

580
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
I know you very well.

581
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You have been the best in the world since you were a child.

582
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Killing and killing is your life's goal.

583
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
How can you be controlled by the evil demon

584
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
who is sitting on the seat?

585
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
Think about the order of the old City Leader.

586
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The Demon Lord is waiting for you.

587
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
The world needs you.

588
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Wake up.

589
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
You can't let the evil demon

590
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
kill you and destroy your

591
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
world of protection.

592
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
I...

593
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
You are looking for your own death.

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Brother,

595
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
you gave me

596
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
my life.

597
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
I was seriously injured and died.

598
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You gave me the true weapon

599
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
and saved my life.

600
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
You said you could

601
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
take my life.

602
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I thank you,

603
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
Brother,

604
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
for saving my life.

605
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
I was so scared.

606
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Compared to death,

607
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
you may have some

608
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
value.

609
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Take him to the prison.

610
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
I asked you two

611
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
to discuss something.

612
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
I hope to borrow the Black Wood Seal

613
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
from the Celestial Realm.

614
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
The Black Wood Seal is a strength

615
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to strengthen the formation and seal.

616
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
Why are you looking for it?

617
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
No need to ask.

618
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
There is a Black Wood Seal in the Celestial Realm.

619
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
But it is a rare treasure.

620
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Only the past generations know where it is.

621
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Now that Lan Sheng is gone,

622
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
no one knows where it is.

623
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
By the way, A'bao is the Xiu Bao Shu.

624
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
Maybe he can find it.

625
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
No one can use A'bao.

626
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
I can go.

627
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
A'bao.

628
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
What are you doing?

629
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
A'bao, this is between adults.

630
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
You can't go in.

631
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I'm afraid that

632
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
A'bao will be in danger.

633
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm afraid that

634
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
A'bao will be in danger.

635
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
I'm afraid that

636
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
A'bao will be in danger.

637
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
A'bao should do his best.

638
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Let me go.

639
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
We Xiu Bao Shu

640
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
can not only make treasures

641
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
but also make the Celestial Realm.

642
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
We can't make it

643
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
when it was young master Nan.

644
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Now it is the time of the Heavenly Lord.

645
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
We can't make it either.

646
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Because the destiny is merciless

647
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
and there is no good or evil,

648
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
everything

649
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
is determined by itself.

650
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Xiu Min!

651
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Xiu Min!

652
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
Xiu Min!

653
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
Xiu Min!

654
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
They said

655
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
no one can live three days in the garden.

656
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
I don't know

657
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
how long we can last.

658
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
The former garden

659
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
is so deep

660
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
and the flesh is so deep.

661
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The time of the bath

662
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
should be less.

663
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
A'bao,

664
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
we can't last longer.

665
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
Maybe

666
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
we can be

667
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
as high as the former water spring.

668
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Ten thousand years ago,

669
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
you protected me

670
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
with your life or death.

671
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I fell into the whirlpool of time and space.

672
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
You didn't hesitate

673
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
and risked your life to follow me.

674
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Now in this hell,

675
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
you abandoned me.

676
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
I want to ask you why.

677
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Because I like you.

678
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
In the battle of the human world,

679
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
my parents have regrets.

680
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Before I died,

681
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
my parents had regrets about my mother and Qingyang.

682
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I always had a voice

683
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
in my heart

684
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,000
that said

685
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
I want to

686
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
hold the one I love.

687
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
I don't know

688
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
when I saw you

689
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
smile.

690
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
I would be happy.

691
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
I would be sad

692
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
when I saw you sad.

693
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Please.

694
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
No matter what happened in the past,

695
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
I really like you.

696
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000
Since I was a child,

697
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
everyone wanted me to be perfect.

698
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Only you,

699
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
who helped me in my imperfect times,

700
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
risked your life to save me.

701
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Do you understand?

702
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
What is love?

703
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
What is unconditional love?

704
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
You made me

705
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
accept love and give it out.

706
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
If I can get through this time,

707
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
from now on,

708
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000
I will protect you.

709
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Then it's a deal.

710
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I'll be a heroine.

711
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Demon Lord is cruel.

712
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
He won't give up

713
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
if he can't get through this time.

714
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,000
Gao Qiuming and Fu Lansheng

715
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,000
have been trapped in the garden for a day.

716
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
If they go on,

717
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
I'm afraid they will die.

718
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
I have to find a way to save them.

719
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
I heard that last night,

720
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
a master of Yongxue City was caught

721
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,000
and sent to the temple.

722
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Yes, I heard the sound of

723
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
the master of Yongxue City

724
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
and I was scared.

725
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
I ran away.

726
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
I ran away.

727
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Yantong.

728
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Mu Xuanling.

729
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Why are you here?

730
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
Why are you trapped in the dark?

731
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
I asked for it.

732
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I want to wake up the master's brother.

733
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
Why do you try so hard?

734
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
Did the master

735
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
hurt you?

736
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
He didn't hurt me.

737
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
He knew that my brother had the power

738
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
to send me to the temple.

739
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
So he pushed the demon

740
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
into my body.

741
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
It seems

742
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
to relieve some pain.

743
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
Demon Lord has pain?

744
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
He even used your body

745
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,000
to turn the power.

746
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,000
What does he want?

747
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
I don't know what he wants.

748
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
I don't know what he wants.

749
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
But when the demon was walking away,

750
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I felt a strong smell of jade.

751
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,000
This is the evidence.

752
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
I believe that

753
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
my brother is still in the demon Lord's body.

754
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
In ten days,

755
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
he will wake up.

756
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm afraid that

757
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
it's hard to use the jade.

758
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Before I came to the dark,

759
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
I sent a letter to the Xuan Tian Gate.

760
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Behind the dark talisman,

761
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,000
my brother was very strict

762
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,000
and pointed out the law.

763
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
Not only can he defeat the demon,

764
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
he can also control the nature of the demon.

765
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
If there is a chance to explore the nature of the demon Lord,

766
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
everything will be clear.

767
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
The nature of the demon Lord?

768
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,640
The Elder Sister of Ma Yihong

769
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
I can do it.

770
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Protect yourself.

771
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
I understand.

772
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,000
Miss Feng Yao, please send the bags to your sister.

773
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:12,720
It's not bad.

774
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,480
You'll recover soon.

775
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,000
Thank you.

776
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:17,920
Have a try.

777
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,160
Miss, the fruit

778
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,040
tastes familiar.

779
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,240
You've tried it.

780
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
It's just a feeling.

781
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,000
Eleven years ago,

782
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,960
you saved me from the evil hand.

783
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,400
At that time,

784
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,920
I had lost all my memories.

785
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,400
What's your name?

786
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,000
Where's your home?

787
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,800
You wanted to help me find my family.

788
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,640
But except for my clothes,

789
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:15,520
I only had a bag of baby food.

790
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,720
I was so tired.

791
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,160
I looked for people like a needle in the sea.

792
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,840
I let go of it.

793
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,000
I'm sorry.

794
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,120
I don't know why

795
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,080
I said a few more words when I saw you.

796
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,360
It's good that you don't remember.

797
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Without the blood,

798
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,480
you won't have any pain.

799
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,720
Did you make

800
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,520
the national dress of Miss Feng Yao?

801
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:50,920
Yes.

802
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,800
A sister taught me.

803
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:54,480
But

804
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,760
that sister is dead.

805
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,000
She died in a rain night.

806
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,120
Time is unpredictable.

807
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,760
I'm leaving.

808
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,160
Have a good rest.

809
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,560
I'm leaving.

810
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,960
Yes.

811
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,920
Everything is unpredictable.

812
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,760
Let go of everything.

813
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,120
Your family

814
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:39,360
will definitely hope that you

815
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,320
are safe and sound.

816
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I heard that the eldest son of Yun Xiu Villa

817
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,840
is good at medical skills.

818
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:56,280
He can save lives from the demon.

819
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,800
Miss,

820
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,480
only this method can be used.

821
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,400
Xiao Yue,

822
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,560
I'll go to Yun Xiu Villa to ask for medicine.

823
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
You must wait for me to come back.

824
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:07,760
Come here.

825
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,720
You are so kind.

826
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,080
Try this.

827
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:13,640
Have some.

828
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,680
Is it yummy?

829
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:18,580
Yes.

830
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,760
What are you doing?

831
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,080
Hope you don't feel bitter

832
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,760
Live well under the sun

833
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:36,120
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you

834
00:44:36,120 --> 00:45:06,120
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I

835
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:19,680
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
