8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I lost.

9
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The third bet.

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Human nature is selfish.

11
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I want to take revenge.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
According to the bet,

13
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
you should go back with me.

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Ji Ya, don't hurt their lives.

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You have to be careful.

16
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
No, I won.

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Ji Ya, don't hurt their lives.

18
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Ji Ya, don't hurt their lives.

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You should tell me

20
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,040
how to use the Qian Kun Bead to summon the Fourth

21
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,000
to kill the four.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
God's will cannot be changed.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There must be a death.

24
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Qian Kun Bead can only transfer the damage.

25
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You and Zhao Ming will die.

26
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
How to transfer?

27
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
If there is a disaster,

28
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I will be punished.

29
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Each person's life is the most important.

30
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Now, you can let me go.

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Seeing you come back,

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I feel relieved.

33
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

34
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Your sword skill is still so bad.

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Let's go.

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Go.

37
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Qingyao.

38
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Qingyao.

39
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Are you okay?

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm fine.

41
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Qingyao.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Qingyao.

43
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Qingyao.

44
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Qingyao.

45
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Qingyao.

46
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Qingyao.

47
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Qingyao.

48
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Don't worry.

49
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
You have your heart.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You have seen my poison.

51
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
This sword is for you.

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Don't be afraid.

53
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I'll find a way to save you.

54
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Okay, I'll wait for you.

55
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait for me.

56
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Qingyao.

57
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Xiaochun.

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
A Yan.

59
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Brother A Yan.

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is the poison you gave me yesterday.

61
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I returned it to you.

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm going to the palace with them today.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Brother A Yan.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Do you want to settle it with us?

65
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
A Yan.

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Brother A Yan.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Brother A Yan.

68
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
A Yan.

69
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Qingyao.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
A Yan.

71
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
A Yan.

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
In this life,

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
in this life,

74
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we seem to be

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
a little bit

76
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
less happy than before.

77
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm already very happy

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
to meet you.

79
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Qingyao.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
If there is a next life,

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
you must be free and happy.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Don't look at others' faces.

83
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You have to get all the love.

84
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Okay?

85
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Okay.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I promise you.

87
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I also wish you

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to be a rich,

89
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
safe

90
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and happy person.

91
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You don't have to be afraid of

92
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
a gold piece.

93
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You can be with anyone

94
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
you want to be with.

95
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Qingyao.

96
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Qingyao.

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Wait for me.

98
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Qingyao.

99
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Qingyao.

100
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Qingyao.

101
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Qingyao.

102
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Qingyao.

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Qingyao.

104
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Qingyao.

105
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Qingyao.

106
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Qingyao.

107
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Qingyao.

108
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Qingyao.

109
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Qingyao.

110
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Qingyao.

111
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Qingyao.

112
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Qingyao.

113
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go!

114
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,960
Let's go.

115
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,160
Hurry up.

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Zhao Min.

117
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,600
Zhao Min.

118
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
A'chu.

119
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,080
Zhao Min.

120
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:24,880
I'm back.

121
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,000
I didn't protect everyone.

122
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,400
You did a good job.

123
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,560
He Zhou left the palace.

124
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:51,520
He said

125
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,440
he would bury A Yan and Qingyang

126
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
in the woods far away from the palace.

127
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,960
He hoped they wouldn't be taken in by the Jus.

128
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,920
The days you left

129
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,160
I often felt anxious.

130
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,480
I don't know if your last breath

131
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
reminded me

132
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,160
of the hardships you were going through.

133
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,360
I tried to find a way

134
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
to recover from the chaos.

135
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,840
But I couldn't.

136
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,200
I felt sad

137
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:33,960
when I thought I couldn't help you.

138
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,240
Zhao Min.

139
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
Are you really going to the ceremony tomorrow?

140
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,040
A'chu, you must be tired.

141
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,880
But it's okay.

142
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,120
It's all over.

143
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,260
I must let you

144
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,340
have what you want.

145
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,380
Xia Xiale for you

146
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,300
You're awake

147
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
What are you writing

148
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,320
A lot of stuff

149
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I like you.

150
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,600
I want to marry you.

151
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Are you willing to?

152
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're not?

153
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Why are you so surprised?

154
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm not.

155
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not.

156
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
I'm not.

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I'm not.

158
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'm not.

159
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
If you're not,

160
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'm not.

161
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Tomorrow,

162
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
you'll go to heaven.

163
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I want to marry you

164
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
and face everything together.

165
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Zhao Ming,

166
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,560
Okay.

167
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,080
Before signing the marriage contract,

168
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,840
we need to have a divorce first.

169
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,400
Leave immediately.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,600
Open it.

171
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,320
This is the gift you gave me.

172
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,440
And this is what I gave you.

173
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,480
Tonight is our engagement night.

174
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,880
This is the wine.

175
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,280
Before we drink this glass of wine,

176
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,800
you have to sign the marriage contract first.

177
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,000
I can't marry you

178
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,400
so unambiguously.

179
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,480
Can I drink it now?

180
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,200
Yes.

181
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,080
A'chu.

182
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,160
Although you've learned to be a human,

183
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:43,200
it's not good to lie to others.

184
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,000
A'chu.

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
You've worked hard these days.

186
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,320
Have a good sleep.

187
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,520
When you're awake,

188
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,400
everything will be over.

189
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,320
What's the matter with you?

190
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,800
There won't be any trouble.

191
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,080
Gao Ming.

192
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,760
Do you want to be cheated by you?

193
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,080
The actions of the gods are not right.

194
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,200
Today,

195
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,120
I want the only one in this world

196
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,920
to be the immortal.

197
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,240
This is

198
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,680
what I want in my life.

199
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,680
Without the permission of the gods,

200
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,600
you can actually climb the ladder

201
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,680
and go to the Heaven Realm.

202
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,000
What is the Heaven Realm?

203
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,680
The Heaven and Earth are in the hearts of people.

204
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,560
The fate is in the hands of people.

205
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,400
The divine curse is the god.

206
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:20,200
It will destroy the three realms

207
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,080
and make the gods die.

208
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:23,440
If the gods are not kind,

209
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,400
I will be a loser.

210
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,080
If the gods are not kind,

211
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,800
I will be tired of this world.

212
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,720
I will help the evil gods

213
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,600
return the world to peace.

214
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,600
The world

215
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,840
is my sword.

216
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,480
The king of humans is not respected by the gods.

217
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,080
Zou Wu!

218
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,080
How is that possible?

219
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,920
How can you have such power?

220
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,840
The god's son.

221
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,400
Zhao Wu Ming is the god's son.

222
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,580
The Son of Heaven!

223
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:18,720
Wukong The Conjuring God,

224
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:22,480
Su fuss goes into its dust.

225
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,360
Not a good god

226
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,660
can police the Heaven's order by force.

227
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,360
Take the punishment of death

228
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,880
for your bad extend.

229
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,400
And the throne

230
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:33,900
you have to keep yours.

231
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,920
It is reported to us all,

232
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,700
that there is no such army in the avis.

233
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:37,740
Yes.

234
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,360
You still believe in me?

235
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,920
Hierarch.

236
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,440
Perhaps,

237
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,880
you should call me God's Evan.

238
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,680
You are evil men inaring yourself to heaven,

239
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,980
turning to demons by falling.

240
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,880
You are against the conditions.

241
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,240
God's Evan was true!

242
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,400
why you'd dare to hurt him?

243
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
As of now,

244
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:36,560
I still hold on to my McCarthy

245
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,800
and fight to the end.

246
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,280
Look.

247
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:04,040
Look.

248
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:05,880
So amazing.

249
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,600
So amazing.

250
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,480
What is it?

251
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,680
So amazing.

252
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,160
This is...

253
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,720
the light of the God's wall.

254
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,240
Zhang Ming.

255
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,760
You broke the wall of God's wall.

256
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,680
Time was so fast that

257
00:23:36,160 --> 00:24:01,300
Voluntary

258
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,640
Zhaoming's evil king,

259
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
Wei Ji,

260
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
all gods of the heaven,

261
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,000
are all dead.

262
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,840
The gods are united,

263
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,800
and the formation is complete.

264
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,000
Zhaoming's evil king,

265
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,840
Wei Ji,

266
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,880
all gods of the heaven,

267
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
are all dead.

268
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,360
The gods are united,

269
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,680
and the formation is complete.

270
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,840
Zhao Ming.

271
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,240
How could it be?

272
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,920
No.

273
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,360
This is not real.

274
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,400
What on earth

275
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,840
have you done?

276
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,400
Administration of Folk Tables

277
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,400
Who are you?

278
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,120
How dare you deliver摩 Kaeshen?

279
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,220
You

280
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,520
should die too.

281
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,080
Take that.

282
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,720
up and down.

283
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,400
Help the gods and demons to get rid of evil.

284
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:09,400
The gods are weak and the gods are weak.

285
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,200
The destiny cannot be changed.

286
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:24,500
The gods ask the destiny to suppress the

287
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:27,300
The gods know what is the real god.

288
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:32,300
The god has nothing to do with race, blood, or fame.

289
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:36,700
The god is the one who protects the people.

290
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,100
But you are not worthy.

291
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:40,800
Go.

292
00:26:49,600 --> 00:27:03,300
Ast髯es of theals

293
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,300
What should we do?

294
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
The Soul Bead should not be polluted with dust.

295
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
But you are full of hatred and hatred.

296
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,300
You have no intention to

297
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:40,300
force yourself to this place.

298
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,300
Do you regret?

299
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,300
I don't regret.

300
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,300
Every decision

301
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,300
is in line with my heart.

302
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,300
I have told you before.

303
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,300
Zhaoming and your acquaintance

304
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,300
are just trying to take advantage of each other.

305
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,300
But he never used me until he died.

306
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,300
He never used me.

307
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,300
He never used me.

308
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
He never used me.

309
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,300
From the beginning,

310
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
he only treated me as A'Zhu,

311
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,300
not the God-Ghost Soul Bead.

312
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
Your feelings

313
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
are so cheap?

314
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
Tianming,

315
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
you don't understand love.

316
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
Let go of Zhaoming.

317
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
Let go of Zhaoming.

318
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,300
I don't want to.

319
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
I can't.

320
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
There is no more Holy Lord Zhaoming in this world.

321
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
Only the God-Ghost Zhaoming

322
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
will last forever.

323
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
The God-Ghost Zhaoming?

324
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,300
Tianming, how dare you?

325
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
The Human Clan has no God-Ghost Sword.

326
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
They can't cultivate.

327
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
They are so selfish

328
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
that they can't even

329
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,300
protect themselves.

330
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
They can let the God-Ghost Zhaoming

331
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
to be in the way.

332
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,300
Even at the last moment,

333
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
Zhaoming

334
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
will give his God-Ghost Sword

335
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,300
to the Human Clan

336
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,300
so that they can cultivate.

337
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
They don't need to be like ants.

338
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
They are just like the fire.

339
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
They don't have any fear.

340
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,300
I hope that

341
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,300
you can rest in peace.

342
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,300
This is Zhaoming's righteousness.

343
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
This is the person I love.

344
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,300
Since you don't want to change his fate,

345
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,300
then I will

346
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,300
write his fate myself.

347
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,300
God of War

348
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,300
Now that we have lost two times,

349
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,300
do you want to continue?

350
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,300
I'm not dead yet.

351
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
I'm still alive.

352
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,300
I'm still alive.

353
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,300
I'm still alive.

354
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
I'm still alive.

355
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
I'm still alive.

356
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,300
I'm still alive.

357
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
I'm still alive.

358
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,300
I'm still alive.

359
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
I'm still alive.

360
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
I'm still alive.

361
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
I'm still alive.

362
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
I'm still alive.

363
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
I'm still alive.

364
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
I'm still alive.

365
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
I'm still alive.

366
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
I'm still alive.

367
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I'm still alive.

368
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:58,300
I'm still alive.

369
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm still alive.

370
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
I'm still alive.

371
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
I'm still alive.

372
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
I'm still alive.

373
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
I'm still alive.

374
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
I'm still alive.

375
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
I'm still alive.

376
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm still alive.

377
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm still alive.

378
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I'm still alive.

379
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,300
I'm still alive.

380
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,300
I'm still alive.

381
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:24,300
I'm still alive.

382
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,300
I'm still alive.

383
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,300
I'm still alive.

384
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
I'm still alive.

385
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
I'm still alive.

386
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I'm still alive.

387
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
I'm still alive.

388
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I'm still alive.

389
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I'm still alive.

390
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
I'm still alive.

391
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
I'm still alive.

392
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,300
I'm still alive.

393
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,380
I'm alive.

394
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,380
I'm destroyed.

395
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,380
I'm not soaffles.

396
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
I'm not soffs.

397
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,380
I'm not soffs.

398
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,380
From now on,

399
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,380
your name is Lun Jing.

400
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,380
I give you the power of counter-clockwiseam.

401
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:12,380
You're Si Chen.

402
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,580
Greetings, Chief God.

403
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,380
I don't have much time left.

404
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
Listen carefully.

405
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,460
The Mountain Tribe was destroyed by me and Zhaoming.

406
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,420
But Zhaoming became a demon

407
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:29,220
and was imprisoned for eternity.

408
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,340
I was about to fall asleep

409
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,180
and lost all my memories.

410
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,100
I couldn't save Zhaoming.

411
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,420
I then put his blood

412
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,340
into the wheel

413
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,820
and waited for the chance to come back to life

414
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:44,180
after thousands of years.

415
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,660
Is this the chance

416
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,300
that Chief God

417
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,340
and Tianming will fight to the death

418
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,380
and take the lives of Zhaoming

419
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,860
when Tianming is seriously injured?

420
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,940
I'm afraid you'll forget

421
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,140
all these things soon.

422
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,020
Everything about Zhaoming

423
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,700
will be changed by Tianming.

424
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,420
You just need to remember

425
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,340
that you have to wait here.

426
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,220
Many years later,

427
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:20,420
someone will come here.

428
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,540
No matter what kind of wishes he makes,

429
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,380
you have to promise him

430
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:25,700
and help him.

431
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:27,100
Yes.

432
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,940
I can't say anymore.

433
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,900
If Tianming is killed,

434
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,940
he will be erased.

435
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,900
Then I'll be in a loss.

436
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:37,940
If you lose your memories,

437
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,940
how can you

438
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,900
find his blood again?

439
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,620
After thousands of years,

440
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,500
in the sea of people,

441
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,900
the person I will fall in love with

442
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,180
is him.

443
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:33,220
Tianmingskin Guide

444
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,740
Can't Yanyasi remember this?

445
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,900
I am so stupid that I forgot all.

446
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,120
I don't care

447
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,840
What is this?

448
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:39,940
I won't let you die

449
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,940
no matter what.

450
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,940
Heaven's order,

451
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,940
do not disturb the law of the heavens,

452
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,940
sin is not allowed.

453
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,940
I have transferred the love knot of the Chaos Bead

454
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,940
to myself.

455
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,940
Heaven can destroy me.

456
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:52,940
Destroying is too easy for your sin.

457
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:55,940
Don't put yourself in the red dust.

458
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,940
Life and death are cursed by the will of the gods.

459
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:01,940
All wishes are not granted, all loves are separated.

460
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:04,940
Every life is locked by love.

461
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,940
You say I don't know love.

462
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,940
Then I will also fall into the dust

463
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,940
and see

464
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:18,940
what you mean by love.

465
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:22,940
By then,

466
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,940
you will come back,

467
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,940
right?

468
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,940
The End

469
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,940
So,

470
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
Zhao Ming and Xie Xue Chen

471
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:41,940
were really one.

472
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,940
It was you.

473
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
You changed Zhao Ming's life.

474
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:48,940
You turned white into black.

475
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,940
You made him think that Zhu betrayed him.

476
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,940
You suppressed him into a demon.

477
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,940
Even he thought that he was a demon

478
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,940
who wanted to unify the world.

479
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,940
Zhao Ming is a man of blood.

480
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,940
But the demon god was forced to be a demon.

481
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
What wrong did he do?

482
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,940
Black and white,

483
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,940
no conclusion.

484
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,940
Everything is fate.

485
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:19,940
Let the good do the evil.

486
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,940
This is the fate you gave him.

487
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:25,940
All the years of the world are in your hands.

488
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,940
Now,

489
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,940
change Zhao Ming's life back.

490
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:33,940
The destiny can only change one's life for the same person.

491
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
And the premise of changing one's life

492
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,940
is to have someone to ask for his life

493
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,940
and pay the same price.

494
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,940
Ten thousand years ago,

495
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,940
the gods fell

496
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:46,940
and Zhao Ming was suppressed.

497
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:50,940
Now, if you want to change his fate back,

498
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:52,940
the whole world

499
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,940
can't afford the same price.

500
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,940
I don't believe it.

501
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,940
Why do you want to take the destiny?

502
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:07,940
I said,

503
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,940
Zhao Ming's life can't be changed.

504
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,940
I'm a man of my word.

505
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,940
This should be back to the right track.

506
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,940
Tell me.

507
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,940
Tell me.

508
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,940
Tell me.

509
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,940
Tell me.

510
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,940
Zhao Ming is a demon.

511
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,940
He's destined to be a heaven

512
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,940
and never turn back.

513
00:39:52,940 --> 00:40:04,040
can be

514
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:13,180
purified

515
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,000
I'll try all the advantages

516
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,760
Not as easy as before

517
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:20,720
Maybe

518
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,720
I'm slower than this

519
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,180
to seal the Devil Valley with the Black Ice of the Pond.

520
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:48,180
In the midst of the chaos,

521
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,180
you can remove the evil thoughts and the evil spirit.

522
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,180
But the evil spirit is very evil.

523
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:59,180
It has already been very cruel to you.

524
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,180
If you go there and implement the purification technique,

525
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,180
you will be thrown into the lake.

526
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:07,180
You must not do it.

527
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:11,180
No matter what the price is,

528
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,180
I will purify Demon Lord.

529
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,180
Zhaoming is a man of the heart.

530
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:18,180
He shouldn't have come to such a conclusion.

531
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,180
I will protect Xie Xuechen's world with all my life.

532
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,180
I will protect him even more.

533
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,180
You...

534
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,180
What's wrong with you?

535
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:33,180
I was forced to do it.

536
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:36,180
The Tianming Formation was already very much in danger.

537
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:40,180
Just now, you used your power to fight against me.

538
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,180
I was very scared.

539
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:43,180
Even if it's my body,

540
00:41:44,180 --> 00:41:46,180
I will still be fine.

541
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Ten thousand years ago,

542
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,180
you helped me to lead the Qingjian Mingge.

543
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:54,180
To save my life,

544
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:57,180
you risked your life to fight for the cycle of reincarnation.

545
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:59,180
What have you experienced

546
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,180
in this ten thousand years of reincarnation?

547
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,180
In these ten thousand years,

548
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,180
I have become many people.

549
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,180
Emperor,

550
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:13,180
general,

551
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:16,180
scholar,

552
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,180
spiritualist,

553
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,180
beggar.

554
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
The humble,

555
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,180
the noble,

556
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,180
I can't say it clearly,

557
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,180
I can't remember it either.

558
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:34,180
But in every life,

559
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,180
I can't help but remember

560
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:40,180
what I have to find.

561
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,180
It seems to be one thing,

562
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:46,180
but it seems to be

563
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,180
a person.

564
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,180
Until that time,

565
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,180
I finally understood

566
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:02,180
that I have to find

567
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,180
you.

568
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:09,180
I have been looking for you in the cycle of reincarnation for ten thousand years.

569
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,180
You have been sleeping.

570
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,180
That's good.

571
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,180
Fortunately,

572
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:28,180
I finally found you in this life.

573
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:37,180
The End

574
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:07,180
The End

575
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:36,180
