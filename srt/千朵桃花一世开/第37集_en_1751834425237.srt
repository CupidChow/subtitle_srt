1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,560
The world is a world of darkness

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:43,260
The night is full of

3
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,260
I'm from the chaos

4
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

5
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

6
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

7
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

8
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

9
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:50,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

10
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:51,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

12
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:54,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

14
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

17
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

20
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

21
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

23
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

24
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

25
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:06,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

26
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

28
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

29
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:10,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

31
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

32
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

33
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

34
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:15,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

35
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

36
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

37
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:18,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

38
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:19,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

39
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

40
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,260
The sky is full of wind and snow

41
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:52,260
Tian Mi

42
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,260
You are not the one who made Demon Lord the strongest

43
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:57,260
Are you the?

44
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:00,260
The main force or the main force?

45
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,260
The middle force is the force

46
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,260
The upper force is the main force

47
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:10,260
The stronger the main force is, the faster the Demon Lord will become the strongest in the world

48
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,260
Ten thousand years ago

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:19,260
You were the one who led the Heaven-Slaying Heaven-Slaying to the capital of the Chaos Bead

50
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:22,260
You were destined to be swallowed by the Chaos Bead

51
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:26,260
You will be loved by the world forever

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,260
Now you have recovered your magic power

53
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,260
You will continue to suffer the pain of being a ghost

54
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,260
Until you die

55
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:39,260
Except for Hao Tian

56
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:42,260
No one can stop the Chaos Bead

57
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,260
No one can solve it

58
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,260
If you want to continue to exist

59
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,260
You can only be loyal to Hao Tian

60
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,260
If you have the will

61
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,260
To speed up the process

62
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,260
You don't have to come to the world

63
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,260
How much time left?

64
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,260
Life

65
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,260
There is time for injury

66
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,260
Death

67
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,260
There is time for death

68
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,260
It's all about life

69
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,260
Or death

70
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:23,260
You see life and death

71
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,260
You know everything

72
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,260
Xuan Xin is my brother's life

73
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,260
You know it long ago

74
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,260
Not long ago

75
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:36,260
The events of the previous life

76
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,260
All have its miracles

77
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,260
The past is only the end

78
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,260
But the fate

79
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,260
Can change everything

80
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,260
My brother was in danger

81
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,260
You are not concerned about me

82
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,260
But my brother and I

83
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,260
Have been in the Qingyuan

84
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,260
After that

85
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:05,260
Even if I asked for the spiritual medicine

86
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,260
I couldn't save him from the evil cultivation

87
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:11,260
I watched him being taken away by the evil cultivation

88
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,260
I thought

89
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,260
That was the end

90
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,260
Who knew my brother was saved by Xuan Tianmen

91
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,260
But

92
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Your death

93
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,260
Did see the real end

94
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
He and I

95
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,260
No longer have the possibility of Qingyuan

96
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,260
The blood of the Qingyuan

97
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,260
Such a singer

98
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,260
Have you thought about it?

99
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,260
I am different from him

100
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:59,260
I am different from him

101
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:01,260
He is the leader of the Qinghua world

102
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,260
He is the leader of the Qinghua world

103
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,260
He is the leader of the Qinghua world

104
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,260
In order to protect everyone

105
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,260
He destroyed himself

106
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:35,000
He can't tolerate any

107
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,260
For what he knows

108
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,260
He has that gun

109
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,260
This time I came to Yongxue city

110
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,260
No matter what the purpose is

111
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,260
Promise me

112
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,260
Don't hurt him

113
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,260
Here is the black dream mark for you

114
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,260
Please don't put A Bao in

115
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:04,260
The devil will not get rid of it

116
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,260
It's hard to predict the trouble

117
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:10,260
Who can know the truth?

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,260
I don't know what he wants

119
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,260
But when the devil was walking in my body

120
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,260
I felt a strong smell of jade

121
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,260
This is the evidence

122
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I believe

123
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Brother is still in the devil's body

124
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
Not disfigured

125
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,260
In ten days

126
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,260
He will wake up

127
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Devil

128
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
What secret is hidden

129
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:36,260
Now he can't handle it

130
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:38,260
I have to find a way

131
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,260
Use the magic mark to close his heart

132
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:42,260
Save Gao Qiangming and others

133
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,260
On the night of the full moon

134
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:59,260
How boring it is to stay alone in the room

135
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,260
Why don't we drink together?

136
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,260
Who gave you the courage?

137
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,260
Get out

138
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:16,260
Can't you see

139
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:18,260
I brought you good wine

140
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,260
Give me a good face

141
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,260
What?

142
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,260
Dare not drink

143
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,260
Afraid of me poisoning

144
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,260
Sometimes

145
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,260
The defense is too strong

146
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,260
It will be less fun

147
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:48,260
My fun is killing

148
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,260
If you don't go

149
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:53,260
I will start with the two people in the garden

150
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,260
Anyway, they will die sooner or later

151
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,260
Kill them tonight

152
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,260
For them

153
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,260
It's less torture

154
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,260
It's not a good thing

155
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,260
Ten thousand years ago

156
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,260
Ten thousand years ago

157
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
They met each other right

158
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
Really envious

159
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,260
On the contrary, you and me

160
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,260
I want Xie Xuecheng to come back

161
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,260
And you hate me, not Zhu

162
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,260
In the end

163
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,260
No one can achieve what they want

164
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Can only torture each other

165
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
Who said no?

166
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,260
I want the power of chaos

167
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,260
The power of chaos

168
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Other concerns

169
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,260
Your concern

170
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Did you tell you the result?

171
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,260
Didn't you know it earlier?

172
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:57,260
If you are informed in advance

173
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,260
Be prepared

174
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
I can't care

175
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,260
That's great

176
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,260
Let's experience it ourselves

177
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,260
Care

178
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I agree

179
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,260
I am hurt

180
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
I didn't expect the demon

181
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,260
To be so hurt

182
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
Just the shape of the face

183
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,260
Take your eyes away

184
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,260
I am not Xie Xuecheng

185
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,260
I don't need your comfort

186
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:53,260
But the wound on the arm

187
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:55,260
It's not made by the face

188
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,260
Isn't it?

189
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,260
That's the wound that Zhu went to the camp

190
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,260
To help you wrap the wound

191
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,260
I left that wound on purpose

192
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,260
Just to remind myself

193
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,260
Don't forget the past

194
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,260
Really?

195
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:19,260
The one who suffered

196
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,260
Is Xie Xuecheng

197
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,260
Is Zhao Ming

198
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,260
But it's definitely not me

199
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,260
I just want everyone in the world

200
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,260
To be with me

201
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,260
Forever

202
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,260
You

203
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,260
Your concern plan is not complete

204
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,260
Get out

205
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Otherwise

206
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
I don't mind

207
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,260
To dig the hearts of those two people

208
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Yes

209
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,260
Get out now

210
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,260
Who said that you have to use magic to close your heart?

211
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:11,260
I don't know

212
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,260
I just want to be with you

213
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:15,260
I don't know

214
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,260
I just want to be with you

215
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,260
I just want to be with you

216
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,260
Who said that you have to use magic to close your heart?

217
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,260
The scar on your body

218
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:27,260
Has opened its mouth

219
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,260
Tonight is the night of the full moon

220
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,260
This dark jade

221
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,260
Is too calm

222
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,260
No hurry

223
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,260
The stone has entered the deep pool

224
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,260
It will shake the wave

225
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,260
The stone has entered the deep pool

226
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:53,260
It will shake the wave

227
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,260
Yan Tong

228
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,260
You killed him

229
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,260
I really want to kill him

230
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,260
I really want to kill him

231
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
But

232
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:15,260
There are other people who should die

233
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
The person who should die

234
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Is it me?

235
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,260
Then you really misjudged me

236
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,260
Because this seal

237
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
You personally tied yourself

238
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,260
I still have a purpose

239
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,260
If you kill me

240
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,260
He will not let you go

241
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,260
Don't worry

242
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,260
You are more useful to me

243
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,260
I will not let you go

244
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:45,260
I will not let you go

245
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,260
I will not let you go

246
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,260
You are more useful to me

247
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,260
I just put this black ink

248
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:53,260
Into your body

249
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,260
I will not let you die

250
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,260
Black ink

251
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:59,260
It's okay to kill you

252
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,260
If you can use magic to drive the black ink

253
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,260
To the moon

254
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
The night of the full moon

255
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:07,260
Is the most devastating time for the demon

256
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,260
The power of destiny

257
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,260
Can re-lock the seal

258
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
And suppress the demon again

259
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,260
You want to take my body as a sword

260
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,260
To turn the power of destiny

261
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,260
Into the things in my body

262
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,260
To drive the black ink

263
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,260
To drive the black ink

264
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,260
That's right

265
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,260
But you will forget it very soon

266
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:33,260
You think this little black ink

267
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,260
Can trap me

268
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,260
Master

269
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,260
Why use this kind of power

270
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,260
Why use this kind of power

271
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:47,260
To destroy yourself

272
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,260
The more you use magic

273
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,260
The stronger the seal

274
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:53,260
The stronger the seal

275
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
I kill people only to calm my heart

276
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,260
Not to mind the consequences

277
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:03,960
Then the

278
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
God, help me

279
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,960
God, help me

280
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,960
God wants me to betray you

281
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm afraid I'm going to let you down

282
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I forgot

283
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,960
Since you came

284
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
You have a sense of betrayal

285
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Our dark clan

286
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,960
Was born because of the new demon

287
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
It's nothing

288
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
The position of the master of dark

289
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,960
Is it not small

290
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,960
Or not

291
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
No matter what

292
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
The master of dark

293
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
In dark

294
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,960
The one who wants to be the new demon

295
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
Is probably not a small number

296
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
Why choose me

297
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,960
A brave warrior

298
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,960
A brave and decisive

299
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,960
You are right

300
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,960
The hero sees a little bit of the same

301
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,960
But

302
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Dare to ask the god

303
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Dare to ask the god

304
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,960
What are you trying to do

305
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Let everything

306
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,960
Restore the original demon

307
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
The god of destiny is really like before

308
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Love and small

309
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Together

310
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Unlock my magic and ban it

311
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
You can't deal with them alone

312
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,960
The demon is guilty

313
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Should be sealed

314
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,960
The situation is wrong

315
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
If you didn't agree with all gods

316
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Forced to change the name

317
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
How could there be the demon today

318
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
I think the real crime

319
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Is you guys

320
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Let him enter the demon

321
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,960
Everything has a cause and effect

322
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,960
If it's not the god of the god

323
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
Why are all gods willing

324
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
If I insist on betraying him today

325
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,960
What should you do

326
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,960
Hurry up and put the black ink

327
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Into the mouth of the demon

328
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,960
The last step to complete the seal

329
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
Then let the master

330
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Feel the pain of the heart

331
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
The last step to complete the seal

332
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
The last step to complete the seal

333
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Mu Xuan Lin

334
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
Why is this black ink not only not sealed

335
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,960
I also took it to the bottom of the lava

336
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
A dead person

337
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Is not worthy of the justice

338
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,960
He didn't transfer the steam of the seal

339
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
To the whole body

340
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,960
But avoided the key

341
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,960
So he can

342
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
Control the black ink

343
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
Let the black ink defeat him

344
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
And defeat the real jade

345
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
The real god of the god

346
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Is just like this

347
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:03,960
If I die

348
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,960
The god of the god will be destroyed by the demon

349
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,960
With this jade

350
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,960
It's hard to stop the evil heart

351
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Ridiculous

352
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,960
I'm sorry

353
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,960
I'm sorry

354
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,960
The power of the nine suns can be broken

355
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
Luo Wu Shan

356
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Nonsense

357
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
It's better to destroy it all

358
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
The plan failed

359
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,960
The strength of the demon god

360
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,960
Still not small

361
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,960
What should we do next

362
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
As long as he can trust Mu Xuan Lin

363
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
The following plan can still be carried out

364
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,960
Since the plan is fine

365
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,960
Why are you so bad

366
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,960
Patience has a limit

367
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,960
I'm sorry

368
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,960
I'm sorry

369
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm sorry

370
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm sorry

371
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,960
I'm sorry

372
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,960
I'm sorry

373
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,960
I'm sorry

374
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,960
I'm sorry

375
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,960
I'm sorry

376
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I'm sorry

377
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,960
I'm sorry

378
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,960
I'm sorry

379
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,960
I'm sorry

380
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
I'm sorry

381
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
I'm sorry

382
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,960
Xuan Ling tree is only blooming in the dark

383
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,960
In the mortal world

384
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,960
Only the snow-blower

385
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,960
In the yard

386
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
Someone told me

387
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Xuan Ling tree

388
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,960
Can grow in the mortal world

389
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,960
I can also find my own place in the mortal world

390
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
My position

391
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Pity

392
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
Can't bloom

393
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,240
I'm not interested in it.

394
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,920
Okay.

395
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,640
Tell me what you want to hear.

396
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,960
After all these days and things,

397
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,240
I've figured it out.

398
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,320
It won't end well if I go against you.

399
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:26,560
I'm willing to cooperate with you

400
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,320
to give you all the power of chaos.

401
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,960
I'm willing to cooperate with you

402
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,320
to give you all the power of chaos.

403
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,960
I'm willing to cooperate with you

404
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,360
to give you all the power of chaos.

405
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,560
I'm willing to cooperate with you

406
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,960
to give you all the power of chaos.

407
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,320
You want me to let Gao Qiubin and Fu Lanshan go?

408
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,400
And Yantong.

409
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,800
He's now badly hurt.

410
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,400
He's useless to you.

411
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:01,080
But before I give up the power of chaos,

412
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,240
I want to take two things.

413
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,240
The Longevity Lotus and the Jun Tian Sword.

414
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,520
To thank Xue Chen for his advice.

415
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,040
To cut everything in the mortal world.

416
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,440
And to cut your own desires.

417
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,720
If you're worried,

418
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,240
you can come with me.

419
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,200
Okay.

420
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,800
You...

421
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,560
agree?

422
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,880
I don't care what your purpose is.

423
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,320
I only care about what I want.

424
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,160
But there's one thing you need to remember.

425
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,600
Awaken me.

426
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,080
Don't betray me.

427
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,200
Or else,

428
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,280
I'll really kill you.

429
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,960
Why did Sir Pueming suddenly let us go back?

430
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:04,200
Maybe because of the oldgreys.

431
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,560
Aren't you coming with us?

432
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm here to surrender to Demon Lord.

433
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
I don't need to leave.

434
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,360
Are you

435
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,440
used to Demon Lord's nature?

436
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,360
I've tried it.

437
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,680
Demon Lord is Demon Lord.

438
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,680
Do you have any difficulties?

439
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,360
Tell us.

440
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,960
If we try our best now,

441
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,400
we can take you with us.

442
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,080
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

443
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,080
Just go.

444
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,880
If Demon Lord changes his mind,

445
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,120
we'll all die here.

446
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,480
Mu Xuanling.

447
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,240
With Miss Mu's character,

448
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,120
she must have her own plans.

449
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,080
Let's go.

450
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,760
Don't waste her plan.

451
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,680
Let's go.

452
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,720
Go.

453
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
Mu Xuanling just sent them away.

454
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,680
There's nothing suspicious

455
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,280
and she didn't say anything suspicious.

456
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,440
Do you think there's something wrong?

457
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,920
Do we need to follow them to the Alliance?

458
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:29,880
No need.

459
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,640
You just stay here.

460
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,520
After I leave,

461
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,800
Yes.

462
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:39,920
Master.

463
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,240
I used to

464
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,960
deal with Mu Xuanling.

465
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,320
She's a trickster.

466
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,040
Why do you agree to leave with her?

467
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,760
I have my own plan.

468
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,960
I have to get something from Mount Luo Wu.

469
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,640
As for the Sword of Heaven,

470
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,960
it's my sword.

471
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,800
Now that the Heaven doesn't listen,

472
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,320
I'll take it back myself.

473
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:05,760
Leave.

474
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,480
Yes.

475
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,160
Let's go to Qiongju Island.

476
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,240
Aren't you going to keep an eye on me?

477
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,480
When do you need to arrange my business?

478
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:27,200
Where are you going, Demon Lord?

479
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,280
Qiongju Island.

480
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,400
Qifeng is in danger.

481
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,440
You should untie the spell.

482
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
I have.

483
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,320
When?

484
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,240
Just now.

485
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
How come I don't know?

486
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,200
I need you to know.

487
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,360
You're too particular.

488
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,760
I can see it now.

489
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,760
There's a golden sister in the forest.

490
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,480
If we can cure her,

491
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,080
we'd better go closer.

492
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,560
It's just a sister.

493
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,280
Just kill her.

494
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,440
Golden sister is a bad person.

495
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,240
It has nothing to do with her strength.

496
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,160
The more obsessive she is,

497
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,640
the more dangerous she is.

498
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,840
Obsessive?

499
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,560
I won't be trapped by that kind of thing.

500
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,000
Ling'er.

501
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,320
Wait.

502
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,160
Ling'er.

503
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,480
You go first.

504
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,560
Now Demon Lord is in the Qi Feng Ling's tent.

505
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,880
The demon aura is suppressed.

506
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,040
So I have to be separated from him temporarily.

507
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,160
Wait for me.

508
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,480
I'll kill him first.

509
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,480
If I can return to the body,

510
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,000
I'll come to you.

511
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,640
If I fail,

512
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,400
you'll be the first to fight against me.

513
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,760
Golden sister in the forest.

514
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,560
It's so wonderful.

515
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:07,080
You're indeed the Goddess of Chaos.

516
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,000
Let's go.

517
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
You're fake too.

518
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,240
Demon Lord won't admit that I'm the Goddess of Chaos.

519
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,040
In his heart, I'm not A'chu.

520
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:21,920
Mu Xuan Ling.

521
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,680
Mu Xuan Ling.

522
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,400
Zhaoming.

523
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,720
Who are you drawing?

524
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:31,440
A'chu.

525
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,040
You start the posthumous relation with me.

526
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,160
The baby is born in a hidden room.

527
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,360
Baby?

528
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,360
God of싸

529
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,300
Because of a

530
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,100
dings you a lot.

531
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,700
Your drink is really minimum.

532
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,460
And this paper is

533
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,480
even sometime download inside.

534
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,280
even if he is your mother.

535
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,160
What if he can't get out of the Seven Phoenix Fiends?

536
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,920
In the dream,

537
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,760
he will be trapped in the illusion

538
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
and disappear into the real world.

539
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,760
If he disappears into the world,

540
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,280
how will Haotian explain it?

541
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,840
I won't explain it.

542
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,920
Where did he go?

543
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
It seems that

544
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
he is trapped in the illusion.

545
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,480
He can't die here.

546
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:44,320
I have to use my power to find him.

547
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,560
He is not in the forest?

548
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,160
Where could he be?

549
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,400
If I give up the power of the deity,

550
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,320
and you give up the ambition of the bear,

551
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,680
no matter what happens in the world,

552
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,480
we can only guard the heaven and earth.

553
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,000
We can be together for ten thousand years.

554
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,720
For ten thousand years,

555
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,920
I have been into the heaven and the hell,

556
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,040
and I have been self-defeating.

557
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,720
But I value it with hatred.

558
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,440
Now I realize

559
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,640
the memory of ten thousand years ago

560
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,600
is like the old blood deep in my heart.

561
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,640
Zhaoming,

562
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:55,720
this time,

563
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,320
don't leave me alone in Changming Hall, okay?

564
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,080
I owe you ten thousand years of explanation.

565
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,440
And you

566
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
owe me a complete wedding.

567
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,920
Tonight is our auspicious time

568
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,920
to make up for all the regrets.

569
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:14,800
From now on,

570
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,880
there is no Demon Lord and Chaos Bead in the world.

571
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,840
Only Zhaoming and Zhu.

572
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,080
Only Zhaoming and Zhu.

573
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,320
Before going on the expedition,

574
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,480
you gave me the same candy

575
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:36,800
and grudges of ten thousand years.

576
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,120
Every time I missed the achievement,

577
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I would have a bite.

578
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,040
But

579
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,400
the taste

580
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,880
always had a bad taste.

581
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,280
Up to now,

582
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,280
the sweetest type

583
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,720
I ate all the candy

584
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,800
but I didn't wait for you to come back.

585
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,440
So I went to the camp to find you.

586
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,680
Fortunately, after ten thousand years,

587
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,240
I finally found you again.

588
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,800
Zhang Ming.

589
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:20,920
Sign this marriage agreement.

590
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,680
I'll go to the camp.

591
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,040
We will never be separated.

592
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:44,280
Don't you want to be with me forever?

593
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,040
I wish I could convince myself that you are Zhu.

594
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,800
But you are not her.

595
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:55,720
Why?

596
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,800
Zhu didn't eat all the candy

597
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,160
but left the last one in the camp.

598
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,600
Besides,

599
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,600
Zhu wouldn't have killed anyone in the marriage agreement.

600
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,040
Demon Lord, you broke your illusion.

601
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,520
You are so strong.

602
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:17,640
Are you okay?

603
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,720
It doesn't matter.

604
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,120
No matter what happens,

605
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,600
I have a plan.

606
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,200
This will end

607
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,840
as I want.

608
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,000
Do you know I'm looking for you?

609
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,400
Look carefully.

610
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:52,680
I'm not Jinmei.

611
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Why?

612
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,760
Why was the one just now fake

613
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,760
and you were real?

614
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:03,960
You...

615
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,560
You met Zhu?

616
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,640
How did you get out?

617
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,880
You killed him?

618
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,840
He is like you before.

619
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,920
He thought he could hold me down

620
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,280
with some tricks.

621
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,600
He even wanted to kill me.

622
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,760
He is so ungrateful.

623
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,440
You misunderstood me.

624
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,360
I never thought of holding you down

625
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,200
or killing you.

626
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,520
What's the difference between

627
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,400
changing and killing?

628
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:36,920
I'm not the one

629
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,840
you want to save.

630
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
And you don't expect me to do the same.

631
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,080
I've told you what I should say.

632
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,200
You don't believe me.

633
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:51,800
To find you,

634
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,480
I've been in such a dangerous forest

635
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,840
from dawn to dusk.

636
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,480
But you

637
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,160
snatched my neck

638
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,280
and warned me.

639
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,720
Sometimes I really think

640
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,000
why I did this.

641
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,240
I also want to know

642
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,360
why you did this.

643
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,560
I don't want to change with you now.

644
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:08,920
It's dark already.

645
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,840
Can we find a place to rest?

646
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,800
You knew there was a

647
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,920
Jinmei Huoxin in the forest.

648
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,240
But you still brought Zhu into the illusion.

649
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,800
It's because you've been

650
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,200
suppressed by the Fog for thousands of years.

651
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,440
You've been tortured day and night.

652
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,440
No one can see you.

653
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,120
No one can tell you.

654
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,600
You've been holding on

655
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,360
to Zhu's obsession.

656
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:45,960
Don't be so smart.

657
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,760
It's no use

658
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,000
guessing right or wrong.

659
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:55,720
I'm too lazy to guess.

660
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,600
I'm curious

661
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,600
what's in your fantasy.

662
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,440
Xie Xuechen

663
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,320
and you.

664
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,160
How long did it take you

665
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,200
to get out of the fantasy?

666
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,280
Less than half an hour.

667
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,080
If you're cruel,

668
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,480
you're the cruelest.

669
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,800
You killed Jia Zhu

670
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,240
and got out of the fantasy.

671
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,600
If you're cruel,

672
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:38,440
let's fight against each other.

673
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,400
I'm not cruel.

674
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,600
I've been here with Xie Xuechen

675
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,760
and met Jinmei.

676
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,760
I know it's just a false hope.

677
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:57,960
You have his memory.

678
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,280
But you're not

679
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,600
him after all.

680
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,920
I don't know when

681
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,600
I can come back.

682
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,920
Mu Xuanling is full of tricks.

683
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,640
You won't fall for his tricks, will you?

684
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,840
In the face of absolute power,

685
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:20,040
any trick is a small trick.

686
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,600
A trick is a small example.

687
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,840
If you fail,

688
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,600
you'll lose your life.

689
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,320
You'll never come back.

690
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,400
When I was a fool,

691
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,480
I was always so quiet.

692
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,360
I was always so stupid.

693
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,120
I always wanted to fight with him.

694
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,480
I was so upset with him.

695
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,960
But now he's dead.

696
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,120
I miss him.

697
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,600
The old three-channel shadow

698
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,520
is always with me.

699
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,200
We're always together.

700
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,120
Now,

701
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,960
there's only us.

702
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,360
I'm not used to it.

703
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,200
We have no blood or flesh.

704
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,200
If we die completely,

705
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,360
where will we go?

706
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,640
I don't know.

707
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,960
I've never died.

708
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,360
If we can never

709
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,720
die,

710
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,160
then...

711
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,960
Then how can we live?

712
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,560
Sounds like a bad idea.

713
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,560
But it sounds reasonable.

714
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,560
What do you want to do here?

715
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,880
Congratulations.

716
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,120
You're out of the Time and Space.

717
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,080
Congratulations?

718
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,320
You're the one who brought us in.

719
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,000
You had your fate ten thousand years ago.

720
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,320
You were destined to go in.

721
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,320
Ten thousand years ago,

722
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,160
you're ten thousand years later.

723
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,680
I know you're destiny.

724
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,520
But can destiny be high and mighty?

725
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:06,680
Can it play with other people's lives?

726
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,080
Play with?

727
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,680
I know you're a hero

728
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,960
for the sake of the Demon Slayer.

729
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
But let me tell you.

730
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,080
If you hurt Mu Xuan Ling

731
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,520
and the Alliance,

732
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,120
no matter how powerful you are,

733
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,600
I'll fight you at all costs.

734
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,160
At all costs?

735
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:28,520
If it's more than what you think,

736
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,080
What do you want?

737
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,080
You want to be my enemy now?

738
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,360
We're different.

739
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:41,880
We're not alike.

740
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:42,920
Now,

741
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,080
you're not the same as before.

742
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,840
I'm not the same as before.

743
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,200
Maybe in your eyes,

744
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,560
we're all weak.

745
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,880
But don't underestimate

746
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,560
a weak man's weakness.

747
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
It's also beyond your imagination.

748
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:18,280
class

749
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,200
Junior Gao.

750
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,200
Osies.

751
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,360
Xiongai Withouton.

752
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,520
We're glad to see you're back safe and sound.

753
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,960
I was absent in the Make light.

754
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,560
So it's not the time to talk to you in person,

755
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:40,680
The two of you stay here withкиd.

756
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,680
You're not waiting for me to make a false accusation, are you?

757
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,680
We do have something important to discuss with you.

758
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
The battle with the Spirit Tribe has been a long time.

759
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
The Jin Hua Palace has always been without a leader.

760
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
We want to make you the new princess.

761
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
I wonder if you're willing to do it?

762
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
I'm willing to do it.

763
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
I'm still young.

764
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
I can't take the responsibility.

765
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:16,680
We...

766
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
We had a misunderstanding with Junior Sister.

767
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,680
After the battle with the Jin Hua Palace,

768
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
we've seen her character and talent.

769
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
We trust you.

770
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
Why do you have to slander yourself?

771
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,680
You two don't have to say it anymore.

772
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,680
I know my abilities best.

773
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
Thank you, you two.

774
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:44,680
Brother, Sister Gao!

775
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,680
A'Bao!

776
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
A'Bao!

777
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,680
Why are you here?

778
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,680
Let me see.

779
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
You've gained weight.

780
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,680
Let me see your belly.

781
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
I'm not gaining weight.

782
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:54,680
You must be gaining weight.

783
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,680
There's meat on your belly.

784
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:58,680
Let me see.

785
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
I'm not gaining weight.

786
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,680
I don't want to bring him here.

787
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,680
He's the one who's following me.

788
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
Sister, take A'Bao to eat delicious food, okay?

789
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Okay, let's go.

790
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Let's go.

791
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,680
Go.

792
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,680
Let's go.

793
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I didn't want to be far from you.

794
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
But in these days,

795
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,680
I went to a place

796
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
and saw some people

797
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
who've been through a lot.

798
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
There,

799
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,680
I really felt what it was like to save the Human Clan.

800
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
I'm willing to believe

801
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
that the way you wanted to save the Spirit Clan

802
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,680
was the same as the way some people wanted to save the Human Clan.

803
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,680
I can understand.

804
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:58,680
But I don't agree

805
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,680
that many people

806
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
set their lives on the line.

807
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Some people's protection

808
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,680
is to sacrifice themselves.

809
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,680
And the protection of the Star Pavilion

810
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,680
is to sacrifice the innocent.

811
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:15,680
The right way is wrong.

812
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,680
It's a bad thing.

813
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
It's wrong if it's wrong.

814
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
If I were you,

815
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
I wouldn't be able to forgive you.

816
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,680
But if there's a chance to make up for it,

817
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
as long as you say it,

818
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,680
I'll die.

819
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,680
There's no need to make up for it.

820
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
I promised my parents

821
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
that I wouldn't live in hatred.

822
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
So I won't live and die.

823
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,680
But I won't have any male or female male power.

824
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
You and I

825
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,680
are different.

826
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
We're the best of the best.

827
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,680
Fu Cang Li

828
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
is dead.

829
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
There's only

830
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,680
Jiang Li in this world.

831
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
The last time the Longevity Lotus was ripe,

832
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,680
it was taken by Xie Xue Chen.

833
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
Now it's growing new lotus.

834
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
It will take another hundred years.

835
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,680
After a hundred years,

836
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I don't know what kind of light and scene it will be.

837
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:40,680
You're so vicious.

838
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
I...

839
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
If I'm not powerful enough,

840
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,680
and I lost too much power yesterday,

841
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,680
let him help me get the lotus from the water.

842
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:51,680
I'll help you.

843
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:53,680
I'll help you.

844
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,680
I don't know if he'll agree.

845
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,680
I...

846
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:04,680
It's been a hundred years.

847
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,680
You just cut it so casually.

848
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,680
It's not rare.

849
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:09,680
It's just a flower.

850
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,680
Just cut it.

851
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:13,680
Wait.

852
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,680
I heard that

853
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,680
there's a precious fish in the Longevity Pool.

854
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,680
If you can eat it,

855
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,680
it's good for your cultivation.

856
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:25,680
Since you're here,

857
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,680
why don't we catch some fish together?

858
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:30,680
Who cheated you?

859
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:32,680
The water is made of spirit.

860
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,680
It's not real water.

861
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,680
Where did the fish come from?

862
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
There is.

863
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:38,680
There really is.

864
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,680
There.

865
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:40,680
Did you see it?

866
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,680
It swam over there.

867
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,680
Look. Look.

868
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,680
Over there.

869
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:44,680
It swam over there.

870
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,680
Look.

871
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:46,680
It swam over there.

872
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
It's a very big fish.

873
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:48,680
Did you see it?

874
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,680
It's a fish.

875
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:56,680
It's a fish.

876
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,680
It's a fish.

877
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,680
It's a fish.

878
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,680
It's a fish.

879
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:00,680
It's a fish.

880
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,680
It's a fish.

881
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:02,680
It's a fish.

882
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
It's a fish.

883
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,680
It's a fish.

00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:05,680
It's a fish.

00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
It's a fish.

886
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
It's a fish.

887
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,680
It's a fish.

888
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,680

It's a fish.

890
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,680
It's a fish.

00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:12,680
It's a fish.

892
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
It's a fish.

893
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,680
It's a fish.

894
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,680
It's a fish.

895
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,680
It's a fish.
