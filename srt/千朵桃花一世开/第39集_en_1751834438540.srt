Echizen

16
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,960
You actually infiltrated the Imperial Ichран

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,240
with the nine-day lightning power!

18
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,240
Theала вон offense can't stop me,

19

although I cannot glory both drums

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,920
So, I will go get my fans,

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,240
before my brothers grab them.

22
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,340
Your death

23
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,120
can't control me any more.

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,820
When the Heaven V Pixu

25
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,820
feelings the madness this is,

26
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,280
I will start diamkn폭 Sometimes,

27
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,560

breaking it !

29
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,020
Vereen of years later,

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,880
I will start

31
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:29,140
we've been arrogant for three months

32
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:53,840
My occult skill

33
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,440
You can't love anyone else.

34
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,600
Otherwise, you'll be destroyed by time.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,080
I want to stay here

36
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
and wait for Zhao Ming to come back.

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,240
When the pulse of the heart

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:04,760
reaches the index finger,

39
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,400
it will knock down the heaven.

40
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:21,360
The index finger is the

41
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,840
heart of the human.

42
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,640
I like you.

43
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,840
I want to marry you.

44
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Will you?

45
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,040
God has no purpose.

46
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
It has nothing to do with blood.

47
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
It has the heart of a concubine.

48
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
It's time to protect the people.

49
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,640
I'm about to fall asleep.

50
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
I lost all my memory.

51
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,840
I can't save Zhao Ming.

52
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,840
I'll put his blood

53
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
into the soul of the soul.

54
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,240
Waiting for the revival and reunion

55
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,240
after a thousand years.

00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
One Day Leading Her

00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,040

Just

vel

81
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,280
It is dangerous to pinch it too much,

82
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
but I can't make it right.

83
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,360
Hadé.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,080
Ooo,

85
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,520
my medicine.

86
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,200
Qingjie curse,

87
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,440
the celebs,

88
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,200
don't have much time

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,640
Think about it.

90
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,680
Is it the will of the heavens

91
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,280
that will help the enemy to come?

92
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,040
Or is it the King of Xiao

93
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,640
waiting in the ice?

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,440
Your Lordship,

95
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,560
is everything going well?

96
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,040
Did you get any gold?

97
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,120
Your Lordship, Your Lordship.

98
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,560
What are you doing?

99
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,120
Do you have any eye drops?

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,560
Your Lordship, you look

101
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,400
like you're in trouble.

102
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,720
What...

103
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,160
What's going on?

104
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
Your Lordship,

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,760
you're awake.

106
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,680
You're awake.

107
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,560
You're awake.

108
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,320
Your Lordship,

109
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,320
you're awake.

110
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,320
You're awake.

111
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,320
You're awake.

112
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
You're awake.

113
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,320
You're awake.

114
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,320
You're awake.

115
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,320
You're awake.

116
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
You're awake.

117
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
You're awake.

118
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,320
You're awake.

119
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
You're awake.

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
You're awake.

121
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
You're awake.

122
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,320
You're awake.

123
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:06,320
You're awake.

124
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,320
You're awake.

125
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,320
You're awake.

126
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
You're awake.

127
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
You're awake.

128
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,320
You're awake.

129
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,320
You're awake.

130
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
You're awake.

131
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,320
You're awake.

132
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,320
You're awake.

133
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,280
Wife.

134
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
Why are you here?

135
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm here to take you back home.

136
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,000
Go.

137
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,280
Da Jun

138
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,640
Da Jun

139
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,920
The power of Avalanche will go to heaven

140
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,320
If you don't stop, I'll kill you.

141
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Go back, Feng Yao.

142
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,320
Feng Yao.

143
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:26,320
I want to take you home.

144
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Feng Yao.

145
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Feng Yao.

146
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Feng Yao.

147
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
For the sake of this mortal,

148
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
you risked your life.

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
For ten thousand years,

150
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:51,320
you tried to break the law of the world.

151
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I even wanted to kill the strongest man in the world,

152
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
so that Hao Tian couldn't be killed.

153
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
But at this moment, I suddenly understood

154
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,320
that even if I had to kill the strongest man in the world,

155
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
I couldn't do anything.

156
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Because as long as Hao Tian is here,

157
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,320
nothing will change.

158
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,320
Maybe it's time for me

159
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
to change my way of breaking the law.

160
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
What do you want?

161
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
The so-called chess game

162
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
is a game of the heart of a chess player.

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,320
To play chess,

164
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,320
you want to win the game under the rules.

165
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:02,320
But if the rules

166
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
are wrong,

167
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
does the chess player

168
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,320
still have to continue?

169
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,320
I don't think so.

170
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
But I think

171
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,320
it's better to play chess

172
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,320
than to play chess.

173
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I think

174
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,320
you can control me

175
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
and threaten me with your love.

176
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
Now I don't need you to do it.

177
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,320
I can burn my own soul.

178
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Even if the love knot doesn't work,

179
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
I can kill myself.

180
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I can burn my soul

181
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,320
and kill myself.

182
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Hao Tian,

183
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
you have a tense time.

184
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Why do you still

185
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
kill yourself when you break the love knot?

186
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
The way to kill yourself is a trap.

187
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,320
What's the matter with a trap?

188
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,320
From now on,

189
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
you don't want to control me anymore.

190
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Even if my soul is destroyed,

191
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
I will return to freedom.

192
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,320
You are the one who should think about it.

193
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,320
The Xiao King who follows me

194
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
will not exist.

195
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
What should I do

196
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
with your rules?

197
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
Stupid.

198
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Even if you control me,

199
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
I will soon leave the world.

200
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Then you will know

201
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
what you did today is a waste of time.

202
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Hao Tian.

203
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
I don't love you.

204
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
I don't love you either.

205
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
I love

206
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,320
the person who fell in love with me

207
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,320
eleven years ago.

208
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,320
Do you believe

209
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
that in this world,

210
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,320
there is really someone who will fall in love with his memories?

211
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
The person who fell in love with his memories.

212
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,320
So,

213
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
what is love?

214
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Love

215
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,320
is not known.

216
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Maybe

217
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
you will never understand.

218
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Maybe

219
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,320
in a moment,

220
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
you will understand.

221
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,320
My name is Feng Yao.

222
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,320
The wind of the morning wind

223
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,320
is far away.

224
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,320
If you really lose everything,

225
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,320
I will be with you.

226
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,320
I will never leave you.

227
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,320
I will never leave you.

228
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
I will never leave you.

229
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
I will never leave you.

230
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
I will never leave you.

231
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I will never leave you.

232
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
I will never leave you.

233
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,320
I will never leave you.

234
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:32,320
I will never leave you.

235
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,320
I will never leave you.

236
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
I will never leave you.

237
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,320
I will never leave you.

238
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,320
I will never leave you.

239
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,320
I will never leave you.

240
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,320
I will never leave you.

241
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
I will never leave you.

242
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,320
I will never leave you.

243
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I will never

244
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
leave you

245
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
so true.

246
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,320
There is a Sodom.

247
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
Seize the chance!

248
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,320
Everything has a purpose.

249
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,320
Use me as an antenna

250
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
I've been thinking about you for so many years.

251
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
A'chu,

252
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
will you blame me?

253
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,320
How can I blame you?

254
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
A'chu,

255
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,320
you were the most stubborn person in the world,

256
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
but you were forced to change your fate.

257
00:16:44,320 --> 00:17:00,060
With the

258
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,060
A'chu,

259
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,060
you are the most bitter person.

260
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
A'chu,

261
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,060
these ten thousand years are so long.

262
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:14,060
So long that I can't tell what is real and what is fake.

263
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
I only know that

264
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
I was the one who protected the world back then.

265
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,060
Now, the hatred of the world is also real.

266
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,060
But at this moment,

267
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,060
I suddenly feel confused.

268
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
If the good days are coming,

269
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
and the life is destroyed,

270
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,060
then for me,

271
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,060
what kind of taste is it?

272
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,060
I know the taste.

273
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,060
I was just a pearl.

274
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
I felt that everything in the world had nothing to do with me.

275
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
Until I met you,

276
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,060
walked into you,

277
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
I realized the meaning of the world to me.

278
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:04,060
For the sake of the artist,

279
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,060
I am willing to protect the world.

280
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,060
This is the power you brought to me.

281
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,060
Now, I will return this power to you.

282
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,060
In the dream,

283
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,060
in the fantasy,

284
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,060
I have seen you countless times.

285
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
This time,

286
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:36,060
you are just my hope.

287
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:40,060
My A'chu,

288
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,060
can never come back.

289
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,060
No matter what,

290
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
I am always by your side.

291
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,060
In your heart.

292
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,060
But in your heart,

293
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,060
there is not only me,

294
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,060
but also all sentient beings.

295
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,060
Whether it is

296
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:12,060
the blind or the blind,

297
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:14,060
or the obsession,

298
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,060
every time you are confused,

299
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,060
remember to ask your heart.

300
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,060
It will point to you,

301
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,060
and find the answer you want.

302
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,060
The one who can point to you,

303
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,060
is not me,

304
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,060
or anyone else.

305
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,060
It is yourself.

306
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,060
The Holy Ruler, Zhaoming,

307
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,060
the God of Death, Zhaoming,

308
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:48,060
the Demon Lord, Zhaoming.

309
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,060
The one who can decide who you are,

310
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,060
is only yourself.

311
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,060
The answer,

312
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,060
is always in your heart.

313
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,060
Fill my heart.

314
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,060
A'chu.

315
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,060
A'chu.

316
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,060
You are finally back.

317
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,060
In this battle,

318
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,060
I thought everything was planned,

319
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:58,060
but I almost ruined everything.

320
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:02,060
Xie Xuechen,

321
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,060
I was not clear

322
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:06,060
in this maze.

323
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,060
The next way,

324
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,060
is not to fight against people,

325
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
not against gods,

326
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,060
but against the heavens.

327
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,060
It sounds like

328
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,060
I am looking for my own death.

329
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,060
But Xie Xuechen,

330
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,060
don't worry.

331
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:28,060
I am not afraid.

332
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,060
I will not back down.

333
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,060
When did you know Feng Yao's identity?

334
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,060
The feeling between Xue Qing,

335
00:22:02,060 --> 00:22:04,060
is the hardest to figure out.

336
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,060
I have a feeling,

337
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:08,060
but she didn't want to admit it.

338
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:10,060
So I chose to respect and wait.

339
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
But I didn't expect,

340
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,060
that she would not admit it.

341
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,060
I am not afraid.

342
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,060
But I didn't expect,

343
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,060
that I would not admit it.

344
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:30,060
As long as there is someone

345
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,060
who misses her,

346
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,060
even if she leaves,

347
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
it is not the end.

348
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,060
What about you?

349
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:42,060
Do you remember her?

350
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,060
The Heavens book has been in the past,

351
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,060
and it is repeated.

352
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,060
Most people and facts are written on the book,

353
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,060
not in the heart.

354
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,060
But the moment Feng Yao died,

355
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:56,060
I suddenly realized,

356
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,060
the Heavens book is just a piece of paper.

357
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:04,060
Just one word,

358
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,060
it will be the life

359
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,060
of the world.

360
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,060
It is her blood,

361
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:14,060
that made me see the color of the world for the first time.

362
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,060
The color of the world,

363
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:18,060
also made me understand,

364
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:22,060
in this mortal world,

365
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,060
there are people who are worth remembering.

366
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,060
What is it?

367
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:30,060
Even if it has nothing to do with love.

368
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,060
This is the full sign of the coming of the Heavens.

369
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,060
Heavens?

370
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:50,060
Heavens are destroyed.

371
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,060
By burning the soul of the gods,

372
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,060
can we stop the coming of the world?

373
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,060
The truth that the Buddha has recommended ten thousand years ago,

374
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:00,060
has become an extreme power.

375
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,060
The ruler of the sky, the strongest is back.

376
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,060
In three days,

377
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,060
the world will be completely come,

378
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:10,060
and the world will be in chaos.

379
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:12,060
It is you who control everything behind the scenes.

380
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:16,060
This is the destiny,

381
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:18,060
that can't be broken.

382
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,060
Every time,

383
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:22,060
you resist,

384
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,060
it will be the end.

385
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,060
It is inevitable.

386
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,060
Heavens,

387
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,060
please wait for the coming of the end.

388
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,060
What else can we do now?

389
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
The world is destroyed.

390
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,060
We can't stop it.

391
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,060
Can we just sit and wait?

392
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:42,060
No.

393
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,060
Maybe,

394
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,060
someone can come.

395
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,620
The butterfly can fly away from the

396
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
source of the soul.

397
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
What is going on?

398
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,620
The phenomenon is out.

399
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:01,620
There must be a disaster in the world.

400
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,620
The phenomenon of the military lines,

401
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,620
the ghost is out of breath,

402
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
the scene of the end,

403
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,620
must be done by Heavens.

404
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,620
The dark jade has such obvious effects.

405
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,620
I'm afraid the world will be more serious.

406
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,620
Zhan Yin, Yu Ying.

407
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:23,620
Yes.

408
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,620
You go to the world to find the destiny,

409
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
and bring it to the dark jade.

410
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Yes.

411
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,620
Go.

412
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,620
The poison can break the barrier.

413
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:06,620
The power can't stop it.

414
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,620
Master, go back.

415
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,620
Go.

416
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,620
Xiao Mei, run.

417
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,620
Hurry.

418
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,620
The disciples of the Heavens,

419
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:27,620
prepare to protect the law.

420
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:44,620
Senior,

421
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,620
the power of the Heavens is weak.

422
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,620
We can't fight back.

423
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,620
Even if the time is back,

424
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,620
we can't give up now.

425
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,620
If I'm here,

426
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,620
I'll be here.

427
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Okay.

428
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,620
The Alliance is united,

429
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,620
we can fight back.

430
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,620
Go.

431
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,620
I'm here.

432
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,620
I'm here.

433
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,620
I'm here.

434
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,620
I'm here.

435
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,620
Come up.

436
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,620
We're fighting against the evil.

437
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,620
Don't worry.

438
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
We'll go to other places to save people.

439
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,620
We'll go to the world to save people.

440
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Yes.

441
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,620
We'll meet again.

442
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,620
There will be a time when we can't see each other.

443
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
It's a long time.

444
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,620
We should have a good time.

445
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
But,

446
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,620
before the end of time,

447
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
you don't have to fight against each other.

448
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,620
Ten thousand years ago,

449
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,620
we played a game of chess.

450
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,620
At that time,

451
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,620
we played the long life.

452
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,620
There was no result.

453
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
There was no victory.

454
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,620
Today,

455
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:19,620
we play another game of chess.

456
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,620
Ten thousand years ago,

457
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,620
you played white,

458
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,620
I played black.

459
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,620
Today, we have a change.

460
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,620
The world is not black and white.

461
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,620
It's like the gods

462
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,620
who have the right to rule.

463
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,620
They are high and low.

464
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,620
But they are not worthy of being a god.

465
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,620
They are not worthy of being a god.

466
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,620
So, the current dark clan of the Fallen?

467
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,620
One thought of becoming a god and the other thought of becoming a demon.

468
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:59,620
It's always been like this.

469
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,620
Black and white are not important.

470
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,620
What's important is

471
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,620
I will never be a chess piece.

472
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,620
I will never be a chess piece.

473
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,620
I will never be controlled by God.

474
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,620
Everything in the world is created by God.

475
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,620
What can you do if you don't want to be controlled?

476
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,620
The fate of the heaven is up to the heaven.

477
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,620
Isn't it also the thought of the god?

478
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,620
Otherwise, you wouldn't have come here.

479
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,620
Since you are here,

480
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,620
you should be honest.

481
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:55,620
Actually, the hao jie

482
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:59,620
should have happened ten thousand years ago.

483
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:01,620
No one knows where the hao tian came from

484
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,620
and when it appeared.

485
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,620
It's like a rule.

486
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,620
It's like a

487
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,620
master of the creation of the world

488
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,620
who is eternal and eternal.

489
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:15,620
In the eyes of hao tian,

490
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,620
it's only important to everything.

491
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,620
Now the two realms are in chaos.

492
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,620
The gods are all in love.

493
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,620
The four times are lost.

494
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,620
The disaster is raging.

495
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,620
It's not enough for you to follow the rules of hao tian.

496
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:29,620
Only the strongest in the world

497
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:31,620
can be the one who can help the people.

498
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,620
The hao tian

499
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,620
actually wants to turn the world around

500
00:30:35,620 --> 00:30:37,620
and save the world.

501
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,620
It's better to start over

502
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:41,620
than to start over.

503
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:43,620
The hao tian is strong enough

504
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,620
to be so strong that

505
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,620
it can't repair the misalignment of the world.

506
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,620
Once it's controlled,

507
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:51,620
it will be destroyed and rebuilt.

508
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,620
But the hao tian has no body.

509
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,620
It can't come to this world directly.

510
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:59,620
Only through the one who can help the people

511
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:01,620
can the hao tian be rebuilt.

512
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
And you,

513
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:05,620
or zhao ming,

514
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:07,620
is the strongest body

515
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,620
that hao tian chose.

516
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,620
So ten thousand years ago,

517
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,620
you didn't

518
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,620
make me be in the hao tian

519
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
to ask for the gods' permission.

520
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,620
You did it on purpose.

521
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,620
The day zhao ming became the god

522
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,620
is the day

523
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,620
he became the strongest.

524
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:29,620
I changed zhao ming

525
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,620
to the god of the fall.

526
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
The formation and the glory

527
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,620
have been lost for ten thousand years.

528
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,620
But this is also

529
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
the only way to save the world.

530
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,620
You think you can stop the hao tian

531
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,620
by suppressing zhao ming?

532
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:45,620
The rules are set.

533
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,620
The body of the strongest

534
00:31:47,620 --> 00:31:49,620
will not die or be destroyed.

535
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,620
No matter how you stop it,

536
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,620
the strongest will

537
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:55,620
be destroyed again.

538
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,620
The one who is the strongest

539
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:59,620
will be reborn again.

540
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,620
Until ten thousand years later,

541
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:07,620
the great plan of hao tian's destruction

542
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,620
continues to be attempted.

543
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,620
It seems that the ten thousand years of sorrow

544
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,620
has made you remember

545
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,620
what it is to follow the god.

546
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,620
As a god,

547
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,620
I should follow hao tian

548
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:23,620
and follow the will of the god.

549
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
This is my mission.

550
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:31,620
It is also my destiny.

551
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,620
But this time,

552
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,620
I learned to

553
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,620
hide the power of the god.

554
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,620
But I have been planning and scheming all the way.

555
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,620
But I still can't stop

556
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,620
the birth of the strongest.

557
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,620
The world rules are set.

558
00:32:51,620 --> 00:32:53,620
But you are trapped

559
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,620
in the rules of the world.

560
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,620
It's ridiculous.

561
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:03,620
The world is ridiculous.

562
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,620
I have created the world of good and evil.

563
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:11,620
But the world we live in

564
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,620
is just like the painting of good and evil.

565
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,620
I have created the world of good and evil.

566
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,620
But we are

567
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,620
being lost by the good and evil.

568
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,620
Ten thousand years ago,

569
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,620
when the sky was broken,

570
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,620
I was living in the chaos.

571
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,620
I was accidentally chosen

572
00:33:33,620 --> 00:33:35,620
to be another hao tian.

573
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,620
That was the first time I saw

574
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,620
the sky outside the sky.

575
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,620
In that space outside the sky,

576
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:47,620
I saw the secret of the world.

577
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:51,620
The world is like the painting world.

578
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,620
Everything is controlled

579
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,620
and predicted in the clear.

580
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,620
I saw all the causes and effects.

581
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,620
I saw the origin of the whole world

582
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,620
and the final collapse.

583
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,620
Then I found that

584
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,620
our painting world

585
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:07,620
was like dust.

586
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,620
I tried to change it,

587
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,620
but it didn't work.

588
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,620
So I returned to this world

589
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,620
and lived in the world of good and evil.

590
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,620
In this world,

591
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,620
because the people in the painting

592
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,620
can only do something

593
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,620
in the painting.

594
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,620
The hao hao is in the rain.

595
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,620
I don't know where it comes from.

596
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
I don't know what it's for.

597
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
There are always things

598
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,620
that are not clear and unclear.

599
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,620
I often think

600
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
that since there is a sky outside the sky,

601
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,620
then maybe there is

602
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,620
something more

603
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,620
outside the sky.

604
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,620
But now,

605
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,620
the good sky is coming.

606
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:03,620
It's something that no one can resist.

607
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,620
No one can resist doesn't mean

608
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,620
it can't be resisted.

609
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,620
Since you are willing to work together,

610
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,620
you must have thought of a solution.

611
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,620
Since you sent people to invite me,

612
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,620
it means that you have thought of a solution.

613
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,620
Then let's see

614
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:21,620
if you and I are the same.

615
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,620
Good sky kills good sky.

616
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,620
That's right.

617
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:33,620
Only the strong can resist the strong.

618
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
The only one who can destroy the good sky

619
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,620
is the good sky.

620
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,620
I heard

621
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,620
what you said just now.

622
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,620
You want to arrange a good sky to kill good sky.

623
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,620
How can you not have me, the god of death,

624
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,620
and

625
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,620
we have been traveling together.

626
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,620
Killing good sky this time

627
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:59,620
is a dangerous plan.

628
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,620
I will not let you go alone.

629
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,620
You and I were born in the chaos.

630
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,620
You have so many things that you can't decide.

631
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:15,620
But you never thought of discussing with me.

632
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,620
You always make your own decisions.

633
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,620
Forget it.

634
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,620
Let the past grudges

635
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,620
go away.

636
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,620
I will not let you go.

637
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,620
I will not let you go.

638
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,620
I will not let you go.

639
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,620
I will not let you go.

640
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,620
Let it go.

641
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:43,620
From now on,

642
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,620
you will not be alone.

643
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,620
And we

644
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,620
have the same goal.

645
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,620
That is to destroy the good sky.

646
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,620
We can't let you go.

647
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,620
We have the same goal.

648
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,620
That is to destroy the good sky.

649
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,620
We can't let you go.

650
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,620
I didn't expect

651
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:25,620
the meeting after so many years

652
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,620
was just a long-lived meeting.

653
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,620
This chess game is not about us,

654
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,620
but the game against the good sky.

655
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
The rules of the world were set by the good sky.

656
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,080
to trick Lake Sh grass,

657
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,880
Oh Takashi Ryoto.

658
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,620
Why would I

659
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,180
just 57MUSIC

660
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,980
destroy the same one

661
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,440
who wants to expose him that day.

662
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,860
Then shall we

663
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,080
do something about it?

664
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,040
I thought

665
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,320
we can robot in the future

666
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,360
and prepare for your cutting and killing action.

667
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,160
to receive the

668
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,160
Haotian's spirit.

669
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,160
Then,

670
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,160
the power of the chaos and the power of the destiny

671
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,960
will be twisted by the time and space

672
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,960
ten thousand years ago and ten thousand years later.

673
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,160
They will be combined

674
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
to create the Faze blind zone

675
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,960
that surpasses Haotian's control.

676
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
Let the two Haotians

677
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,360
exist in the same time and space.

678
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,160
In the end, through the matchmaking

679
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,960
between Demon Lord and Zhaoming

680
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,160
in the Faze blind zone,

681
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,160
the two Haotians will kill each other.

682
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,560
This is a dangerous plan

683
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,360
with many variables.

684
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,360
It is the only way to win.

685
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,960
If we want to achieve

686
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,160
the Haotian spirit in the time and space,

687
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,160
we need to kill each other.

688
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
Maybe the two of us in the time and space

689
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
will cross ten thousand years

690
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,160
and fight side by side.

691
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:43,160
Only the power of the time and space

692
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,160
can help us

693
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
to talk to ourselves ten thousand years ago

694
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
and find out everything.

695
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
We will fight against Haotian.

696
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,360
I have returned half of the power of the Faze.

697
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,360
You can use the time and space

698
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,360
to directly see the wheel mirror

699
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,360
and get back the power of the time and space.

700
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
God of the Lord.

701
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,960
God of the Lord.

702
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:42,720
I,

703
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,520
Chu Yuan,

704
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,360
have been waiting for you.

705
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:46,560
God of the Lord,

706
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,560
I have returned half of the power of the time and space.

707
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,560
You can use the time and space

708
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,560
to directly see the wheel mirror

709
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,560
and get back the power of the time and space.

710
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,560
Only the power of the time and space

711
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,560
can help us to talk to ourselves ten thousand years ago

712
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,560
and find out everything.

713
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,560
I have returned half of the power of the time and space

714
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,560
I haven't seen you for a long time.

715
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,560
You still look the same.

716
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:10,560
It seems that there is no change.

717
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:12,560
I haven't seen you for a long time.

718
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,560
You also look the same as before.

719
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:18,560
But you have changed a lot.

720
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,560
My name now is Mu Xuan Ling.

721
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,560
I am not unfamiliar with this name.

722
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:38,560
Mu Xuan Ling

723
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,560
The day Xie Xue Chen

724
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,560
took the test of 38000 sharp sharp blades

725
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:01,560
came here.

726
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,560
I saved Mu Xuan Ling for her.

727
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,560
Did she say anything when she left?

728
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,560
She said a lot.

729
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,560
In my opinion, it's just a word.

730
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,560
No regrets.

731
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,560
In the past ten thousand years,

732
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,560
I forgot where I came from.

733
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,560
I forgot the existence of the master.

734
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,560
I forgot who I was waiting for.

735
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,560
Until the master came back,

736
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
I finally understood everything.

737
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,560
Thank you for waiting for ten thousand years.

738
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,560
Everything in the world has its own mission.

739
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:48,560
I am lucky to have the master's thought.

740
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:51,560
I have seen the spring and autumn for ten thousand years.

741
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,560
Now I turn back to the mirror and the power of time and space.

742
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,560
Return to the master.

743
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,560
May the master achieve what he wishes.

744
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,560
The world is happy forever.

745
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,560
Thank you.

746
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:25,560
I have taken back the power of time and space.

747
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,560
I can control the wheel mirror

748
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:29,560
and connect two time and space to talk.

749
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:31,560
But I have to try this method.

750
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:34,560
We have to make sure that ten thousand years of cause and effect will not change.

751
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,560
Otherwise, if the past ten thousand years of events are biased,

752
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,560
the current world will be in chaos.

753
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:41,560
The power of chaos can control time and space.

754
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,560
The power of destiny can control cause and effect.

755
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,560
Then I will be with you

756
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:48,560
to protect this world from being affected by chaos.

757
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:51,560
If you create a law area,

758
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,560
how long can it last?

759
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:55,560
Even if you spend all your power,

760
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,560
you only have one incense stick.

761
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,560
In other words,

762
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,560
killing Hao Tian

763
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,560
is the only chance to have this incense stick.

764
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,560
If two Hao Tian kill each other,

765
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
then the chance of the remaining body of Bei Qi

766
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,560
is also very slim.

767
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,560
If I am afraid,

768
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,560
I will not stand here.

769
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,560
Between killing Hao Tian and following Hao Tian,

770
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:25,560
I choose the former.

771
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,560
Let's start.

I choose the former.

790
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,560
I choose the former.

791
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,560
I choose the former.

792
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,560

I choose the former.

795
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,560
I choose the former.

796

I choose the former.

797
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,560
I choose the former.

798
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,560
I choose the former.

799
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
I choose the former.

800
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,560
I choose the former.

801
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,560
