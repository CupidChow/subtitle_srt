1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What eschewed you the most

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The Nation's Great Treasures

6
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Episode 05

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The Nation's Great Treasures

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Alright, the formation is complete.

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
We only need to be on time to reach Snow City.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Let's go.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Don't forget what you promised me.

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I promise that after we reach Snow City,

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I will never let you down.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If I get a hint of a case,

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I will tell you right away.

16
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Snow City

17
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's going on?

18
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Someone has captured the formation.

19
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Dai Song didn't kill Feng Yao.

20
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Young Master, the formation is about to break.

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Young Master.

22
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Young Master.

23
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Are you alright?

24
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'm fine.

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Fortunately, you've recovered your six-fold spiritual power.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Otherwise, we would have died in the formation.

27
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
No one in the Eagle Mountain Village is as strong as before.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How did you get to the hand?

29
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The material of the formation is problematic.

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The material of the formation is missing.

31
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Some of it is found outside the formation.

32
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,980
I think someone set up the sand

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
in advance.

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
It's all my fault.

35
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I didn't get the smell of the sand.

36
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
It's not your fault.

37
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
The sand formation is hidden.

38
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
It's hard to find.

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Besides, the formation needs to be refined.

40
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
It will become more hidden.

41
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
It's harder to find.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You're a grown-up.

43
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
If you can even embroider the sand formation,

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
you don't need to practice with the treasure.

45
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
We're all here.

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
It's not your turn to blame yourself.

47
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
All of this

48
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,000
is in the plan of Sang Qi and Xiu Xian Pavilion.

49
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Maybe from the beginning of the Palace of Pure Flower,

50
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
it's just a momentary loss.

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You mean the Palace of Pure Flower is in trouble?

52
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
First, to steal the imperial edict.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Second, to make a big deal of it.

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
So they can have a chance

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
to attack the formation.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You're the most alert.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
If you're here,

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
it's easy to find the material is problematic.

59
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
So they deliberately make a big deal.

60
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
And you're also hidden.

61
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
That's right.

62
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's not a secret that

63
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Master Nan has refined the formation.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You didn't go back to Yong Xue City

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
after you came out of the dark jade.

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Instead, you chose to embroider the sand formation.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
They should have guessed that

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
your spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

69
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
They want to send the formation back to Yong Xue City.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
They're really

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
one step behind each other.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Now I'm more worried about the situation in Yong Xue City.

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I don't know how they will come out.

74
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I just hope that the edict has been issued for a few days.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Thank you for the news.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
You don't have to worry too much.

77
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Now the material is back.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
How long does it take to find the flag again?

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well,

80
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
it should take about ten days and half a month.

81
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Is there any other way?

82
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Let's go back to Yong Xue City as soon as possible.

83
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
There is

84
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
another thing.

85
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Fu Yun Kongzhou?

86
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
That's right.

87
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
This is what the young princess of Bixiao Palace,

88
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Fu Lansheng, gave me as a bet.

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It hasn't been used for many years.

90
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The formation has been sent back.

91
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
The formation is

92
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
at the bottom of the stone wall.

93
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It needs more good things.

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
So I didn't think about it at first.

95
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
But now,

96
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
using it as a substitute

97
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
is better than using it as a sword and riding a horse.

98
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
How can you lock the boat like this?

99
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why are you so stubborn?

100
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
The boat needs to be ready for the tide.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Now we are going to get on the road.

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
How?

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
There is indeed a secret

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
that Bixiao Palace has money.

105
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
How is your financial strength in Yong Xue City?

106
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You kidnapped me from the dark.

107
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I didn't bring much money.

108
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
As a disciple of Yong Xue City,

109
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
do you have any gold stickers?

110
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll give you a warning.

111
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
When you arrive at Yong Xue City,

112
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
you'd better listen to what I say.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If you do something and get angry,

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I won't help you.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You are saying this now.

116
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I don't know who was at the critical moment.

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Only Liuchen's spiritual power

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
is still divided into two to protect me.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Xie Xuechen,

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
just admit it.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You just can't bear to see me die.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
It's not a matter of not letting you die

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
or not letting you die.

124
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You are stubborn.

125
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Xu Yuan,

126
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
this crisis

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
is much more serious than I expected.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You are not from the Alliance.

129
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You don't have to continue to make trouble.

130
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You can go to Yong Xue City.

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's too late to say such words now.

132
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Sang Qi and Xiu Xian Pavilion

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
joined hands with me to get the Manor of the Clouds and the Mountain to help me

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
destroy my treasure.

135
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I will definitely get back this debt.

136
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Otherwise, the Manor of the Clouds and the Mountain

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
will be destroyed.

138
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
How will the Manor of the Clouds and the Mountain be established?

139
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Xu Yuan.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I know what I am doing.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Since we have come this far,

142
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
let's continue together.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Miss Mu,

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
do you mind?

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's better to have more friends and more ways.

146
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
It's more welcome for Mr. Nan to come along.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
That's good.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Feng Yao,

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
keep a close eye on the Manor of the Clouds and the Mountain.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Yes.

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's getting late.

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Let's go.

153
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
A'Bao,

154
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
stop being a nuisance. Come out.

155
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,000
If father knew that I was such a useless uncle,

156
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
would he not want me?

157
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Enough.

158
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You haven't seen your father.

159
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
How can you have such a deep relationship?

160
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Father is father.

161
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
It's also father that I haven't seen.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Uncle.

163
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Father and mother that you haven't seen.

164
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You are not my father.

165
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You are my father.

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Father and mother that you haven't seen.

167
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Are they also father and mother?

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Of course.

169
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Mother, listen to him.

170
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Father.

171
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
We are in the sky.

172
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
We are on our way to your brother Xie's house.

173
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't be afraid.

174
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Come out and have a look.

175
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The moon is beautiful.

176
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'd better wait until I land.

177
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Bye.

178
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You little coward.

179
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You want to follow me?

180
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Yes.

181
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I want to learn skills.

182
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Miss Mu.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Master Nan, you also come to reward me?

184
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I want to congratulate you first.

185
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
You have achieved your dream.

186
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Thank you.

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I haven't been to Snow Tower yet.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
It must be very interesting.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You should say that because of Miss Mu's arrival,

190
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Snow Tower will become very interesting.

191
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,000
So you also think that Xie Xue Chen is boring, right?

192
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Miss Mu actually knows.

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
It's not that she wants to be boring.

194
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I don't think so.

195
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
There are many things that a born-to-be-know person carries.

196
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Many things are expected and many are comforted.

197
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Sometimes even can't figure out yourself.

198
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Is this person the one people love?

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Or is it only this person

200
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
who can protect the power of time?

201
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Master Nan, are you talking about Xie Xue Chen

202
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
or yourself?

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,000
After all, Master Nan was also born to be a wise person.

204
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Miss Mu is really smart.

205
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
But you also said that it was only once.

206
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Now I have three skills.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I think I'm at most an ordinary person who can paint.

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You are the first person in the art formation

209
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
to be the master of the mountain villa.

210
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
And you decided to be smart.

211
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
If you are just an ordinary person,

212
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
how can those ordinary people be self-punished?

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Okay, okay.

214
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I broke my promise.

215
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I'm a straightforward person.

216
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Please forgive me.

217
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I just think that

218
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
a person who can kill a new path from the dead

219
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
and re-sit at the top

220
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,000
doesn't need that kind of cheap comfort and sympathy.

221
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I don't want to.

222
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I'm not qualified to show my kindness.

223
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
That kind of pity is for you.

224
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I think you won't agree.

225
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
And you won't be happy.

226
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Miss Mu is a spirit.

227
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
But she is very transparent.

228
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Let's compete.

229
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
You also come to see the scenery.

230
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm not afraid of you.

231
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm just a little bit afraid.

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Xue Chen.

234
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Just for fun.

235
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You are really not interested.

236
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
In this aspect,

237
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
you should learn from the master of the manor.

238
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
If you talk like this again

239
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
in Yongxue City,

240
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm afraid you will be kicked out of the house

241
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
in a few days.

242
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
I'm not going to be kicked out.

243
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I haven't arrived yet.

244
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Besides,

245
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I can only say this to you.

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Okay, okay.

247
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Then you think I didn't say it.

248
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
What did you promise me?

249
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Restriction.

250
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I know.

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm in a bad mood.

252
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Even the moon is not so beautiful.

253
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You talk.

254
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Miss Mu really

255
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
says whatever she wants to say to you.

256
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Sometimes it may not be a good thing.

257
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Isn't that good?

258
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Didn't you say from the beginning

259
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
that you didn't want to talk to me?

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Do you want to see her clearly?

261
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I have one more thing to ask.

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
What?

263
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why did you promise Miss Mu

264
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
to take her back to Yongxue City?

265
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Once the war between the human and the spirit was long gone.

266
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I have seen countless

267
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
spirits and demons

268
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
in the spirit world.

269
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now the war has ended.

270
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
But the wounds have never healed.

271
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Until now,

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
the human race is enslaving the spirit race.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
The conflict between the human and the spirit is getting worse.

274
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
The hatred is like burning hot oil.

275
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It takes countless blood

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
to quench the anger.

277
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
It's time to take the initiative to take over the spirit race.

278
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
From the beginning of the entrance of the spirit race,

279
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
the first one to take over the spirit race

280
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
is the one.

281
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Just this once.

282
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What else?

283
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I wish that

284
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,000
the spirit will be reconciled

285
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and the world will be closer.

286
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I also wish that

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
you can achieve your dream.

288
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I look forward to working with you.

289
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Have you ever done this?

290
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
This is Yongxue City,

291
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,000
it doesn't look like

292
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
it's an interesting place.

293
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Interesting?

294
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
You're a foreign tavern

295
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
when you arrive at Yongxue City.

296
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
You're sure

297
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,400
You're a disciple of the outside sect in Yongxue City.

298
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,480
You must follow the rules.

299
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,880
Yongxue City is strict.

300
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
You won't be considerate of your disciples.

301
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm not exception.

302
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,840
Of course.

303
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,920
I always follow the rules.

304
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm the best. You know that.

305
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,800
Yongxue City is different from Jinghua Palace.

306
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,560
I think you'll understand it soon.

307
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:53,800
What's the difference?

308
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,040
The five sects of the Alliance are different.

309
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:02,260
Jinghua Palace is lively and

310
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:03,260
but it's ruthless to the spiritual clan.

311
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,260
As for Yongxue City,

312
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:05,260
it's like what you see.

313
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:07,260
It's full of snow.

314
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,260
The spirit is on the edge of the cliff.

315
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,260
It's white and unobtrusive.

316
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,260
It's not allowed to have any misunderstanding.

317
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,260
As expected,

318
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
the city leader of Yongxue City

319
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,260
is such a man who is

320
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:20,260
unselfish and unselfish.

321
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:22,260
But it doesn't matter.

322
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,260
If he's fierce to me,

323
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,260
he'll protect me.

324
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
Right?

325
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,060
Greetings, protector.

326
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:03,340
datasets of the political school

327
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,100
ד不同

328
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:08,800
Your Company,

329
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,480
it's a big thanks to you.

330
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:11,520
Wishing king Yong lavr

331
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,060
safe return to the capital area.

332
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,860
Yan Kun.

333
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,020
Sister.

334
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,560
Please escrever.

335
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,660
Alright.

336
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:23,840
Majesty Xu.

337
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
Master Cang, you are joking.

338
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,260
Young Master, this is...

339
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,260
This is Mu Xuan Ling.

340
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:40,260
From today on, I will be your disciple.

341
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
I will start from the outside.

342
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Please let Master Cang take care of you.

343
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,260
Master Cang, I am learning from you.

344
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,260
I am learning from you.

345
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
Young Master, this is very sudden.

346
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,260
He...

347
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,260
We will talk about this later.

348
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,260
I need to meet the Chief immediately.

349
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,260
The Chief will leave the Pass tonight.

350
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,260
Please take a rest.

351
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,260
Is the Chief still in the Pass?

352
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,260
Yes.

353
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,260
Since you left, the Chief has not left the Pass.

354
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,260
You have not returned yet.

355
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,260
We are very worried.

356
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
We wanted to report to the Chief to look for you in Liangjieshan.

357
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
But he is practicing and is afraid of the critical time.

358
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,260
He is afraid of disturbing him and he is afraid of being possessed.

359
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,260
So we have to wait.

360
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:26,260
I sent a letter to him with a paper.

361
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,260
He did not mention it or make any arrangements.

362
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,260
A letter?

363
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:35,260
Wei Cang, what is written in this letter?

364
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,260
Chief.

365
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,260
Thank you for your help.

366
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,260
Blood. It is blood.

367
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Chief.

368
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,260
Chief.

369
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:51,260
Chief.

370
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Chief.

371
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
Chief.

372
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,260
Chief.

373
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,260
Chief.

374
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,260
Chief.

375
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,260
Chief.

376
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,260
Chief.

377
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,260
Chief.

378
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,260
Chief.

379
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,260
Chief.

380
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,260
Chief.

381
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,260
Chief.

382
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,260
Chief.

383
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,260
Chief.

384
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,260
Chief.

385
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
Chief.

386
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,260
Chief.

387
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,260
Chief.

388
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,260
Chief.

389
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,260
Chief.

390
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:12,260
Chief.

391
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Chief.

392
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,260
Chief.

393
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,260
Chief.

394
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,260
Chief.

395
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,260
Chief.

396
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
Chief.

397
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,260
Chief.

398
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,260
Chief.

399
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,260
Chief.

400
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Chief.

401
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,260
It is real.

402
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Chief.

403
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
It is real.

404
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Chief.

405
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,860
It turns out that Yongxue City is our own place.

406
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,860
Why would the chief...

407
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,260
Chief, the magic is so strong.

408
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
There are disciples outside the palace to search for the killer.

409
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:58,860
How could they be killed without anyone knowing?

410
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,260
Who did this?

411
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:03,260
I didn't protect the chief well.

412
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,260
It's all my fault.

413
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,060
It's my fault that I didn't come in early to see him.

414
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,060
Chang'er, you have to find out who the killer is.

415
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,060
Chief,

416
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,860
Sang Qi and the Alliance are trying to take the killer.

417
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
Please be careful.

418
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:19,060
I will return early.

419
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,260
Elders,

420
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,660
Chief is very ancient.

421
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,460
The Yongxue City is indeed magnificent.

422
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:36,860
However, you are the master of the Yongxue City.

423
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,060
You are the most important person in the sect.

424
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,660
The Yongxue City is the most important sect.

425
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,260
It can't be exaggerated.

426
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,860
This is not a matter of self-pity.

427
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,260
This is not a matter of reprimand.

428
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,860
Please seal off the Yongxue City.

429
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
Take it as a funeral.

430
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,260
The rest of the things,

431
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,860
I will arrange it myself.

432
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,260
Yes.

433
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,660
The paper bird is not opened yet,

434
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,860
but it is stained with blood.

435
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,460
It seems that the City Leader was killed

436
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:11,660
before the paper bird flew.

437
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,860
The murderer is the meet of Chief.

438
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,180
He...

439
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,660
The real one or the fake one?

440
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,060
He couldn't have died so suddenly.

441
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,180
Or you

442
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,740
electric hair

443
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,180
That's fake.

444
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,280
Should I do so?

445
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,180
No,no

446
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,020
arts3ad molecules

447
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,960
should not be thrown down

448
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:00,100
to subjugate Prince Transnsus.

449
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,860
She met imprisonment

450
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,860
herself for being an unhealthy fetus.

451
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
She travels?

452
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:09,560
Yes,ا

453
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,760
She went to ask the palace for help,

454
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,940
and took the responsibility.

455
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:23,380
Every time when it came to targeted

456
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,220
state affairs,

457
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,140
he fell into a trap,

458
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,660
and she 또

459
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,740
and the other one is a three-edged sword.

460
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,740
Their target

461
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,740
is not only in the Jinghua Palace

462
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,740
or in the Blood-sucking Snow Town,

463
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
but also in the Blood-draining City.

464
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,740
They set up a death trap in the shipwreck

465
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,740
to destroy the formation

466
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,740
and delay the return of the Snow Town.

467
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,740
So that they can

468
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,740
kill the leader

469
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
and take the jade seal.

470
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,740
And their ultimate goal

471
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,740
is to destroy the Soul-stirring Beads.

472
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,740
How much blame

473
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,740
does he have

474
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,740
for saving the Jinghua City

475
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
but not his own father?

476
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,740
How much blame does he have?

477
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,740
This is a game of no use.

478
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,740
Since he returned to the Blood-draining City,

479
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,740
he never took a break for a moment.

480
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
He always used his power to numb himself.

481
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
If this continues,

482
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
he will collapse.

483
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:13,740
He knows the expectations of the leader.

484
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,740
The Soul-stirring Beads,

485
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
the Blood-draining City,

486
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,740
the Human Clan

487
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,740
and the Soul-draining City

488
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,740
are all in his hands.

489
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
He knows

490
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,740
the Human Clan,

491
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,740
the human race

492
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,740
and everything else

493
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,740
is in front of him.

494
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,740
He can only do this.

495
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:39,740
But he never thought about himself.

496
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,740
Master Nan,

497
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:44,740
you've known him for many years.

498
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,740
Has he always been like this?

499
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,740
To put it in words,

500
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,740
it's a long time ago.

501
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,740
Because we were born with the right skills,

502
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,740
we were always taken out of the same wheel.

503
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
But for a long time,

504
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:00,740
we never met.

505
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,740
Until one time,

506
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
a fierce battle took place in the Immortal Town.

507
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
Many Dark Clan members were left behind

508
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:10,740
to protect the Human Realm.

509
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,740
Xue Chen and I

510
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,740
were sent to the Two-Stages Mountain

511
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,740
to stop the Dark Clan.

512
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,740
That was the first time we met.

513
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,740
That was when he

514
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:24,740
was very different from now.

515
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,740
Kill!

516
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,740
What's wrong?

517
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:00,740
Why are you А homemade?

518
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,740
You've made it out of the Tao Eden!

519
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
What are you talking about?

520
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,740
It's obvious that you'll die here soon!

521
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,740
What are we talking about?

522
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,740
We don't have the Bishophood.

523
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,540
Just kill him as fast as you can.

524
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,500
Watch out.

525
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,060
Am I a bird?

526
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:52,060
You're the one who can make up for the difficulty.

527
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,500
Let's have a match.

528
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,460
One.

529
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,140
One more than you.

530
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,220
How are you?

531
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,140
Can you take it?

532
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,460
I'm fine.

533
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:25,020
I knew I wouldn't die here.

534
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,980
People often talk about you.

535
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,180
Are you interested in going to Yongxue City?

536
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,820
So,

537
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:38,100
Xie Xuecheng still has a chance to win.

538
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,620
Chief Xie has been strict with him.

539
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,420
But he was young and unyielding at that time.

540
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,060
He always thought

541
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,540
he could live his life in his own way.

542
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:53,420
I thought he could live a happy life.

543
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,060
But ten years ago,

544
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,540
he suddenly went to Mingyue Villa

545
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,100
and went to Wenxue Cliff.

546
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,380
When he saw it again,

547
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,340
his mood changed dramatically.

548
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,060
Or maybe

549
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,540
he changed into another person.

550
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,300
He became old,

551
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,740
restrained and unruly.

552
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:26,060
I don't know what happened to him.

553
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,980
But he became the person

554
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,380
that Chief Xie wanted.

555
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,580
Truth or dare?

556
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:45,320
It has been ten years

557
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,560
It's been ten years.

558
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,800
You've improved a lot.

559
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,040
You're better than me.

560
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,000
Chief.

561
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,440
Now that the Immortal God is really lacking,

562
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,360
you go and make it up to him.

563
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:14,680
Yes.

564
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:15,880
Yes.

565
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,920
After you're back,

566
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,160
we'll talk when you're back.

567
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,400
Cultivators are being�

568
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Accomplished Tao.

569
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,120
Enough.

570
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:44,960
Save the world and save the people.

571
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,360
You should respect the people.

572
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,360
Is this your way of doing things?

573
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,000
If so,

574
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,200
you should cut off your love.

575
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,400
If you have a bias,

576
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,360
how can you tolerate the people with your love?

577
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,560
You shouldn't bias the world

578
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:01,800
and the people,

579
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,240
including yourself.

580
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,760
When you come back,

581
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,000
we'll talk about it later.

582
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,160
In the evening,

583
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,560
you came to the warm-blooded cave to practice swordsmanship.

584
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,760
You're not afraid of a bloodbath

585
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,440
and drowned the whole Yongxue City?

586
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,280
What are you doing here?

587
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,000
Go.

588
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,760
You're sad.

589
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,240
You even wear my bracelet.

590
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,440
How can I sleep?

591
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,720
I told you to go.

592
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,160
Xie Xuechen,

593
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,360
it's not a shame

594
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,000
to be seen as fragile.

595
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,480
If you want to see it,

596
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,040
I can cry for you now.

597
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:06,800
Go.

598
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,520
I don't need your comfort.

599
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,000
Xie Xuechen,

600
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,280
why do you suppress yourself?

601
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,640
Because your father said

602
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,760
a cultivator can't be affectionate.

603
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,440
In the cold prison of the prison,

604
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,120
I saw you when you were a kid.

605
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,240
Your father thought

606
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,840
no affection can be biased

607
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,960
and achieve great love.

608
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,200
I don't dare to say he must be wrong.

609
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,800
But I think

610
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,440
there is no affection in the big way.

611
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,280
But there should be affection in the cultivation.

612
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,320
If a person

613
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
doesn't even know love,

614
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
if he is only in the desert and cold,

615
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,400
how can he understand

616
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,280
the real meaning of everything in the world

617
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,800
and how can he make the people in love?

618
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,080
Just because you are born with a sharp tongue

619
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,720
and are rare,

620
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,240
your father

621
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,520
will treat this as your destiny.

622
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:10,480
But Xie Xuechen,

623
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,640
actually no one can

624
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,720
predict your future.

625
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,280
People have seven feelings and six desires.

626
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,520
They are happy and sad.

627
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,120
There must be a reason for it.

628
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,640
I am a spirit.

629
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,280
I have feelings.

630
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,880
You are a human.

631
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
How can you not have feelings?

632
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,520
If you have feelings,

633
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,280
you must release it

634
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,520
and express it.

635
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,720
It will be a problem

636
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:35,840
if you force yourself to suppress yourself.

637
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,040
Xie Xuechen,

638
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,120
you are the same as everyone else.

639
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,720
You are all flesh and blood.

640
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,520
You have done enough.

641
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,120
Okay.

642
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,560
I used to be reluctant to listen to her.

643
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,000
How great it is!

644
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,200
I always make big mistakes and can't get it back.

645
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,440
Now,

646
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,720
I think I have done everything

647
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,600
without any feelings.

648
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:07,440
But I can't

649
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,000
meet her requirements.

650
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,960
When Wenxue said goodbye,

651
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,640
I really wanted to call her father.

652
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,240
But I didn't have the courage to say it.

653
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,760
I am just a jade

654
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,080
and a coward.

655
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,760
I can't hear

656
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:33,920
what father wants to say anymore.

657
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
I cannot let Wenxue

658
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,040
find out

659
00:38:41,440 --> 00:39:00,060
how

660
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,800
Master when you are still here,

661
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,320
he definitely wants to talk to you like this.

662
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,080
I always know how hard it is for you.

663
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,560
Since you were born,

664
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,320
I've been entrusting you with the responsibility of the life.

665
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,840
To break your love,

666
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,600
even destroy your love,

667
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,800
and cut your wings.

668
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:38,040
I beg you to stay in this prison.

669
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,760
And all of this

670
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,960
is just to face the difficulties

671
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,920
you may face one day.

672
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:56,080
Father often thinks

673
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,760
whether I'm too self-abandoned.

674
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,960
Perhaps breaking your love is not the only way.

675
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,880
If I hadn't forced you,

676
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:16,760
you would have lived in freedom and glory,

677
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,760
and have no fear of the world.

678
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,800
Father.

679
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,600
Breaking your love

680
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,760
is easy.

681
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,240
But how many people can do it?

682
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,280
I shouldn't have forced you

683
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:55,040
even if I couldn't do it.

684
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,480
I shouldn't have forced you.

685
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,720
Xia Chen,

686
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,520
you're old.

687
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,440
You'll get old eventually.

688
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:13,040
You'll leave one day.

689
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,680
Perhaps your father's path

690
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,120
is old too.

691
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,600
Your future belongs to the younger generation.

692
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,200
Go your own way.

693
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,920
I believe you.

694
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,920
You'll take responsibility in your own way.

695
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,560
Protect everything you should protect.

696
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,160
Xue Chen.

697
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,160
In fact,

698
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,280
Father,

699
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,520
you're knowledgable.

700
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,120
I'll always

701
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,400
tell you something.

702
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,840
Father,

703
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,360
I love you.

704
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,760
No one has noticed my tears.

705
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:56,160
Am I still not aware of my tiredness?

706
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,760
I have thoughts in my heart.

707
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:05,160
I am still not sure how long my love will last.

708
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:09,360
I will travel through the six years of the world for the sake of love.

709
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,760
I will not disappoint you.

710
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:18,160
I look forward to the day I spend with you.

711
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:22,160
I look at you and dream of you.

712
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,560
I have no more regrets.

713
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:31,360
I will stay by your side forever.

714
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,160
I will travel through the six years of the world for the sake of love.

715
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,560
I will not disappoint you.

716
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:54,560
I look forward to the day I spend with you.

717
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:58,960
I look at you and dream of you.

718
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:01,360
I have no more regrets.

719
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:06,560
I will stay by your side forever.

720
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,360
I look forward to the day I spend with you.

721
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,360
I have no more regrets.

722
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:20,560
I will stay by your side forever.
