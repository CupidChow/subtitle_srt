5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You told me that you were sick and couldn't go to the army.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sick, too.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not happy to go to the Alliance.

8
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Isn't it a bad omen?

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It makes sense.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
You came to see me for...

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Know yourself, know your enemy.

12
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
You can't fight without a fight.

13
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You're still so vigilant.

14
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I don't expect them to have any interest in me.

15
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
What about you?

16
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why don't you go to Zheng Qi Hall?

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not from the Alliance.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I'm not going to have fun.

19
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Here it comes.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Welcome the one who has the honor of the sword of the Xuan Tian Gate.

21
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Please.

22
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I heard that the Xuan Tian Gate is hard-working and determined.

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The heart of the cultivation can remove the demon and turn to darkness.

24
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you think they will find the demon in my body?

25
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You have my spirit ink on you.

26
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
It won't be found under normal circumstances.

27
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What about the unusual situation?

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It depends on whether you are lucky or not.

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
But I don't want to see him more than the Xuan Tian Gate.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Welcome Princess Su from Jing Hua Palace.

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Please.

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
It's been proven that the Yuan family always shows up.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Back then in the Ming Yue Villa, you and Gao Xiu had an affair.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh no!

35
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Sang Qi's army is attacking the village. Run!

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Change the clothes on the big lady and her clothes.

37
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The big lady is so beautiful.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You can die for her.

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's the greatest honor of your sword-slaying.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
It's just some old stories about the evil master and the sword-slayer.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The South Prince is so generous and generous.

42
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He is so kind.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You don't have to listen to such a dirty thing.

44
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I have also seen it once.

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The past days of Miss Mu were so bitter.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Stop it.

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Don't pity me.

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
No need.

49
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I don't want to pity Miss Mu.

50
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you can't kill me, just stand up.

51
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Stand up and take back everything.

52
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
This is the truth of the world.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Chief Cang.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Chief He.

55
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Last time you left, you were so handsome.

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Chief Cang, how are you?

57
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Please.

58
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The leader of the neighboring island, He Xianwu,

59
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
looks like a carefree person.

60
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I heard that he loves to adopt spiritual beasts.

61
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Then he and Su Ning Zhen will meet.

62
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
They shouldn't fight.

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
In this case, it's not a big deal.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
That's a good feeling.

65
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Su Ning Zhen looks so fierce.

66
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Someone has to stop him.

67
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm going to kill him.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The sky in Bixiao Palace is really full of wealth.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Vice Princess Duan.

70
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Welcome.

71
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Please.

72
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I heard that Fu Yuan Ting and Duan Xiaorong

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
are so rich.

74
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
This way, please.

75
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Look at that.

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's wearing clothes from head to toe.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's not a genius.

78
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He's walking alone.

79
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Everyone wants to go up and grab him.

80
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
He's Princess Fu Lansheng of Bixiao Palace.

81
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Mother.

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm going to play.

83
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Go.

84
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
There's no better name than the world.

85
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Nan Xu.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Vice Princess.

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I heard that you came to Yongxue City, too.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
So I came with you.

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The beauty next to you is a stranger.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
The new disciple of Yongxue City, Mu Xuan Ling.

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
This is Vice Princess.

92
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Hello, Miss Mu.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I thought it was Gao Xiu Shi.

94
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You said Gao Xiu Shi.

95
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Could it be...

96
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The first beauty in the fairy tale.

97
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
She's a fan of the Palace of Pure Flower.

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's hard to imagine that she's even more beautiful than you.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
They're all beautiful.

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Different styles.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Are you a cultivator?

102
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Yes.

103
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Can't you tell?

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm a gold-billed spirit.

105
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
If you're in trouble,

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
you can ask me for help.

107
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Is Nan Shiyue's friend my friend?

108
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
We met for the first time.

109
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Maybe there's no gift.

110
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
These are the magic weapons I found a few days ago.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
They're all for women.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Do you like them?

113
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
These are all the magic weapons of the heaven.

114
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
What's the big deal?

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I have more.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Bixiao Palace is rich in the world.

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Princess Fushao is the richest person in the world.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Since she insisted on giving them to you,

119
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll take them.

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Take them.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Father.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
What's that sound?

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Father.

124
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's that sound?

125
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
My...my spirit beast.

126
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's the spirit beast's name?

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
It's father.

128
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Are you my father?

129
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Come out.

130
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Let him out.

131
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Come out.

132
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Father.

133
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you my father?

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
He...his father is missing.

135
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I think it's obvious that I'm a person.

136
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Mother said that father is the richest person in the world.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But my money was also given by father and mother.

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
So, the richest person in the world should be my father.

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Brother.

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
There are many people who call me brother.

141
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Count your voice.

142
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Come on.

143
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Brother gave you some gifts.

144
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
These are all for the spirit tribe.

145
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How can you have a magic weapon for the spirit tribe?

146
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I have three thousand spirit tribes.

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You have three thousand spirit slaves?

148
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
No, no, no.

149
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
They are all good friends to me.

150
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
We often play together.

151
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Little thing.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What's your father's name?

153
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll go back and ask you.

154
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Fu Cang Li.

155
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Fu Cang Li.

156
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
This name is indeed from our Bixiao Palace.

157
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I will pay attention to it.

158
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll go first.

159
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Two.

160
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Three.

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Goodbye.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I won't see you off.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I know.

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,000
You just wanted to say that he is the world's number one leader.

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Right?

166
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Excuse me.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Leader, you are inside.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Thank you.

169
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It seems that this is the master of the spirit tribe.

170
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He is really handsome and elegant.

171
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
He is not far from Miss Mu.

172
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
He is so quiet and dignified.

173
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,000
He is indeed a good match for Young Master Xie.

174
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Why does he always look at me?

175
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He doesn't need to be so exaggerated when he sees a beauty.

176
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
He is just a little girl.

177
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
He doesn't need to be so exaggerated when he sees a beauty.

178
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Forget it.

179
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I'll go out and represent the Jin Hua Palace.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I won't bother him.

181
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He is really elegant.

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
He really has the temperament of the Young City Leader's wife.

183
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Thank you, Young City Leader.

184
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I wonder if you have something important to call us to come to Snow City.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Why don't you see the leader?

186
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Senior.

187
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Snow City is in a mess.

188
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The leader is in danger.

189
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
How could this be?

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Who did this?

191
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
It must be Sang Qi and Xiu Xian Ge.

192
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Xiu Xian Ge?

193
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Xiu Xian Ge and Sang Qi are together.

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The jade seal of the Jin Hua Palace was stolen by them.

195
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The leader was killed because of this.

196
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
They are taking all the jade seals.

197
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I wonder if there is anything strange in your family today?

198
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I haven't found anything strange.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,000
May I ask where the jade seal of Snow City is now?

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
The enemy hasn't won.

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
The jade seal is still in my Snow City.

202
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I told you earlier that you should attack Dark Citadel first.

203
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
And kill all those dirty things.

204
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The Dark Clan will not die.

205
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm afraid it's hard to go there without permission.

206
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Yes, we should be cautious.

207
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,000
It's not right to lose our alliance.

208
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Sang Qi came back to take the Soul Bead.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
And open the barrier of the Immortal Formation.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The priority now is to select the new leader.

211
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:12,000
And give the Soul Bead to him.

212
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Thank you, Young Master.

213
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Thank you, City Leader.

214
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
You are the best leader of the current Alliance.

215
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I think you can take the Soul Bead.

216
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I was in Mount Liangjie.

217
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I was attacked by the Immortal Formation.

218
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I was trapped for seven days.

219
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I was badly injured.

220
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I can't recover my spiritual power.

221
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now the situation is critical.

222
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I'm afraid I can't take the Soul Bead.

223
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
As long as you say something,

224
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
I will ask the world to cure you.

225
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Besides, I have a lot of people in the world

226
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
who have the safest gold warehouse in the world.

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
It's enough to keep the Soul Bead.

228
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Now the situation is critical.

229
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
How can we afford to delay it?

230
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Besides,

231
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
when did you really think about the great cause of the Alliance?

232
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Sun Ning Zhen, if you really want to be the leader,

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
just say it.

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Why are you here to say that?

235
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
It doesn't matter.

236
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I have been guarding the two mountains

237
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
and fighting against the enemies.

238
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm the only one who can do it.

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You saved the jade seal.

240
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
You are also in the Palace of Pure Flower.

241
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
If you become the leader,

242
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm afraid you can't protect anything.

243
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He Xiang Wu, you always fight against the spiritual clan.

244
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I'm afraid you've forgotten your identity.

245
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Two, don't talk.

246
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Calm down.

247
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll beat you to death.

248
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
The one who sent the sword

249
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
is like the one who was in the Palace of Pure Flower.

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I had to do it.

251
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Since the one who sent the sword said it,

252
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
then I won't say any more big truth.

253
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Six thousand years ago,

254
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
the Qian Guang Army first established the Alliance

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
to unite the people and fight against the enemies.

256
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Now that the leader Xie's bones are not yet cold,

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
the enemy is still in a lot of confusion.

258
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,000
You have to separate yourself?

259
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry.

260
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
I'm sorry.

263
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Sorry.

264
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
It seems like theA да,

265
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
in the past days,

266
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
please consider the party leader positions in the city.

267
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You are selected the day after tomorrow.

268
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I was the most proud of Dao City among the Alliance.

269
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Now that he's gone, I've lost a lot of friends.

270
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I think that Xue Chen is suspicious.

271
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
That's why he didn't say anything

272
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
and brought us to Yongxue City.

273
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then the man that Master Xie suspected

274
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
naturally included you.

275
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Now that he's the City Leader, no one can trust him.

276
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
That's what I should do.

277
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,000
If Dao City sees it, they'll be relieved.

278
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Then why don't you fight for the position of the Leader?

279
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:57,000
How can you let Su Ning Zhen be arrogant?

280
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The old Crown Prince and the Leader

281
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
are fighting for the position of the Leader.

282
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,000
What's the Leader doing here?

283
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I don't want to be troubled by these things.

284
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I don't know why he's fighting for the position of the Leader.

285
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
This way, please.

286
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Su Ning Zhen

287
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Princess Su and the rest of the members are resting in this courtyard.

288
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
This way, please.

289
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
This way, please.

290
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
This way, please.

291
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Qiu Ming

292
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Master

293
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
What's the matter?

294
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I just didn't expect that the leader of Xie was killed by a thief.

295
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
A lot of things have happened during this time.

296
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
How can the young princess of Jing Hua Palace be so afraid of the world?

297
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Qiu Ming, you need to practice more than martial arts and mind.

298
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I understand, Master.

299
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
When I become the Leader,

300
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
you must be able to inherit Jing Hua Palace.

301
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'm sorry, Father.

302
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
I have to leave now.

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I don't want you to worry about me.

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
I'm just going to leave.

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
I'll go with you.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
I'll go with you.

307
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
I'm going with you.

308
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
I won't be afraid of you anymore.

309
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I'll go with you.

310
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
I'll go with you.

311
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
I'll go with you.

312
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'll go with you.

313
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll go with you.

314
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
I'll go with you.

315
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Now, everything is just a dream.

316
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
How can it be so absurd?

317
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,000
You didn't join the dream because of this reason?

318
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
This is the difference between us.

319
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
For the matter of Yan Fan,

320
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I can be a guard.

321
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
But you always think about saving him.

322
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
So I can be free in Yun Xiu Villa.

323
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
But you are trapped in the seven winds and the bitter snow.

324
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
You are all alone.

325
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Chief Xie is the mirror of the magic.

326
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
The person who can kill him should be among them.

327
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You want to pretend that your spirit energy hasn't recovered yet.

328
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
But that inner world may not be able to write.

329
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
In these days,

330
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
there should be a time of self-killing.

331
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'll wait.

332
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
When can you think about your own life?

333
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:40,000
If you die,

334
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I may be sad.

335
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'll try my best not to die.

336
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'll try my best not to die.

337
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Senior,

338
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
what do you think about this?

339
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,000
You should have done it long ago.

340
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Senior, even for the sake of the world,

341
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,000
you should be the leader.

342
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm not as good as Chief Xie in terms of Taoism.

343
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
In terms of cultivation,

344
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm even worse than him.

345
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
How can you be worse than him if you haven't fought before?

346
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Even though Chief Xie is born with a strong body,

347
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
he is still so young.

348
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Can he be compared with Senior's cultivation?

349
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Chief Xie is pure and pure.

350
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
But I have a bad feeling.

351
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
I don't deserve to be the leader.

352
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
Senior.

353
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Chief, you must be tired.

354
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Let him rest.

355
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Xuan Xin, you call me Master.

356
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Do you always help the leader?

357
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
You shouldn't have pulled me, you should have persuaded him.

358
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
The leader has his own idea.

359
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Others shouldn't force his will.

360
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Others?

361
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Your master, I'm an outsider?

362
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Yes, I'm an outsider too.

363
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
You...

364
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I shouldn't have picked you up back then.

365
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't want you to be angry with me now.

366
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
It's hard to get rich if you're soaked in the mud.

367
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Master, you're too late to regret.

368
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
I wanted to come to Yongxue City to play.

369
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
But I didn't expect that the leader would be left in the crisis.

370
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,000
This thief is really bold.

371
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He came to Yongxue City to fight.

372
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
If I catch him, I will...

373
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
What's wrong with you?

374
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
You can't be the hero now.

375
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Before the

376
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,000
promotion, you must save my life.

377
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
You must know that your battlefield is a hundred years away.

378
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
You will be the leader of the Alliance.

379
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Mother, you look down on me.

380
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
What am I?

381
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Master Xie is a man of the heaven.

382
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
He's a strong man.

383
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
No one can be of any help in the past hundred years.

384
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
Even if he's not the leader, he'll be the next one.

385
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Besides, he's still young.

386
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
He can be the leader for at least a few hundred years.

387
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,000
You know nothing.

388
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Although the statue is a thousand years old,

389
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
how many people can really be treated with respect?

390
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Besides, Xie Xuechen's sword is the best in the world.

391
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
I don't have it.

392
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
It's a sword that doesn't leave a trace.

393
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's very durable.

394
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Maybe, as long as you can live for a long time,

395
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
you don't have to fight.

396
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Even Hao killed those opponents.

397
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
I'm so tired.

398
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Look at what you said.

399
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Is my greatest value just living?

400
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I don't agree.

401
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You're still reliable.

402
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Son, your greatest value is to give Bixiao a young lady who has the right and the right to hold the factory.

403
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Only then can Bixiao continue to grow.

404
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Father.

405
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Fu Yanting.

406
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You said you used these scourges on me.

407
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
You want to ruin my son?

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
I'm ruined?

409
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
No.

410
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Didn't you choose me as your husband because you wanted to have a handsome son?

411
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
You and I are not on the same level.

412
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Don't talk about anyone.

413
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:45,000
But if I had known that your beautiful and beautiful beauty was so short,

414
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I would have been better off looking for someone else.

415
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Look.

416
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
You finally said it.

417
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
Do you still think about that person?

418
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Who?

419
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Who else can I think of?

420
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's none of your business if you don't want to think about it.

421
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I'm almost out of my mind.

422
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
It's none of my business.

423
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Father.

424
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm still here.

425
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Go away.

426
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Young princess, you...

427
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
The late He Tianyu?

428
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
That...

429
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,000
The princess and the elder are currently studying the future development of Bixiao Palace.

430
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,000
That...

431
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Just do what you should do.

432
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
It's fine.

433
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
This couple is so similar.

434
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
This couple is so similar.

435
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
They are so hard to get along with.

436
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
To get married?

437
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Only fools can get married.

438
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm sorry.

439
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm sorry.

440
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I'm sorry.

442
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,000
I'm sorry.

443
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I'm sorry.

444
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,000
I'm sorry.

445
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
I'm sorry.

446
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
I'm sorry.

447
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
I'm sorry.

448
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
I'm sorry.

449
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I'm sorry.

450
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I'm sorry.

451
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,000
I'm sorry.

452
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
I'm sorry.

456
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
I'm sorry.

459
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'm sorry.

460
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I'm sorry.

461
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm sorry.

463
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,000
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I'm sorry.

465
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I'm sorry.

466
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
I'm sorry.

467
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I'm sorry.

468
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
I'm sorry.

470
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I'm sorry.

471
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm sorry.

472
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I'm sorry.

473
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I'm sorry.

474
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I'm sorry.

475
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm sorry.

477
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'm sorry.

478
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,000
I'm sorry.

479
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
I'm sorry.

480
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
It's fine.

482
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
Are you a fan of Hungry давай就운

483
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
I can't calm down any more.

484
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
You are so cool.

485
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,800
You...

486
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,640
beepin' in the middle of the night

487
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,380
You're too aggressive

488
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:21,480
Your bed's crumbling

489
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,400
Your friend

490
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:26,800
You're scary

491
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:37,280
You

492
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,280
No need to chase her. Let her go back and report to the police.

493
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,280
This is your plan with Nan Xun Yue.

494
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,280
You are the enemy of Ruo Yi.

495
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,280
You are really despicable.

496
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,280
You should let me participate in it.

497
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
You should just forget it.

498
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:06,280
You are too good at this kind of despicable thing.

499
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:09,280
You are back in Yong Xue City and you are at your own home.

500
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:11,280
You are being attacked.

501
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,280
How is it?

502
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,280
I was lucky to be here in time.

503
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
The imperial edict has not arrived yet.

504
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,280
They won't kill me now.

505
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,280
They are just here to see how much my spiritual power has recovered.

506
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
I should be the one who is in charge.

507
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
If I hadn't come just now,

508
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:30,280
how are you planning to end this assassination?

509
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,280
According to the plan, I will get hurt.

510
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,280
Then I will send out a signal to the players.

511
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
I will bring the elders and the disciples to come and kill them.

512
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,280
This is another way to kill yourself.

513
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
Where is the sword I gave you?

514
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
I didn't say that you are going to be an ordinary person.

515
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Why are you still wearing a waistcoat?

516
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Thank you, City Leader.

517
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
My sword skills are very bad.

518
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,280
If I brought a sword to save you,

519
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,280
I would be laughing to death.

520
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:01,280
Also, your calculation is too fast.

521
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Then I should thank you.

522
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
Can you calculate after you finish?

523
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
What are you afraid of me doing in the middle of the night?

524
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
In terms of lying,

525
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
isn't your progress a bit too fast?

526
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,280
Although the City Leader is busy with his affairs,

527
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,280
he doesn't even have time to teach his disciples to wield swords.

528
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
But as a disciple of Snowblade City,

529
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
protecting the City Leader is an honor.

530
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,280
Why are you so suspicious?

531
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,280
Stop looking at me like that.

532
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
You are guilty.

533
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,280
You are right.

534
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,280
There are many bad things that I want to do.

535
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,280
But tonight...

536
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Tonight, I just want to suddenly come and see you.

537
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Xie Xue Chen,

538
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
I haven't seen you for a day.

539
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,280
I miss you.

540
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:27,280
Thank you, City Leader.

541
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,280
Am I pretty?

542
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,280
The color is like a fake.

543
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:46,280
It's been a hundred years.

544
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,280
I think in your eyes,

545
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:53,280
you are the most beautiful person in the world.

546
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
I think in your eyes,

547
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:00,280
there is only a difference between good and evil and strength.

548
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
Do you know in my eyes,

549
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,280
what is the difference between people?

550
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,280
Except for Xie Xue Chen,

551
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,280
there are other people.

552
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
How dare you, Mu Xuan Ling!

553
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,280
You didn't get up and stayed up all night, but you sneaked out!

554
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,280
You disturbed City Leader.

555
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
You are so ridiculous.

556
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,280
You even affected City Leader's rest with other colleagues.

557
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,280
You even brought bad luck.

558
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,280
Do you know your crime?

559
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,280
I know.

560
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,280
I will go back and think about it.

561
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:15,280
City Leader, your bed is too easy to break.

562
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Next time, you should change to a solid one.

563
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,280
You are so rude!

564
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,280
Mu Xuan Ling!

565
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,280
You...

566
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
City Leader.

567
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,280
Xue Chen, you and him...

568
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:36,280
You can't stand it if you are too strong.

569
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
You should change to a solid one.

570
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:39,280
I...

571
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,280
It's late.

572
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,280
Elder, go to sleep.

573
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Brother Dao Cheng,

574
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:47,280
I was unlucky to use Xue Meng Chen.

575
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,280
It's my fault for not controlling it.

576
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,280
Honorable Superior.

577
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:09,280
Do you think that I am a good person?

578
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:14,280
What do you think of the mortal world?

579
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,280
The mortal world seems to be meaningless compared to the dark realm.

580
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:24,280
The new demon, the holy one, is far more powerful than the dark realm.

581
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:27,280
Even you can feel it.

582
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,280
Why can't he see it clearly?

583
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,280
Are you talking about the holy one?

584
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:40,280
He has spent too much time on the human clan.

585
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,280
The Xiu Xian Ge has been sent.

586
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,280
Xue Chen's spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

587
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Go to Snowblade City and take the Soul Bead.

588
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,280
Hand it over to me.

589
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,280
If anyone is in the way, kill him.

590
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,280
Yes.

591
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I'll go.

592
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,280
Who is Mr. Nan talking to?

593
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
Which lady is she?

594
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,280
If Feng Yao knows that someone calls her a lady,

595
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,280
she will be upset.

596
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,280
I told Feng Yao to investigate the Xiu Xian Ge.

597
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,280
After the chaos in the Jing Hua Palace, they disappeared.

598
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
That's not strange.

599
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
But they have been in the mortal world.

600
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,280
They have taken in many human and spiritual clans.

601
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,280
It seems that someone will notice them.

602
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,280
That's right.

603
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:54,280
Feng Yao has found a spiritual clan near the city of Bixiao Palace.

604
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
She claims to have seen the Xiu Xian Ge.

605
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:00,280
She said that the leader is a young man over the age of twenty.

606
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,280
He is a gentleman with a good manner.

607
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,280
The other is a dark-skinned man.

608
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,280
But he can hear that he is a young man.

609
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,280
He calls the leader as the leader.

610
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,280
Dark-skinned?

611
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:17,280
That means he doesn't want people to know his real identity.

612
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Then why does the leader dare to show his true face?

613
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,280
Maybe he is afraid of nothing.

614
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,280
He has been in the mortal world for so many years.

615
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,280
I'm afraid that it's not the right time to completely eliminate him.

616
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,280
The Xiu Xian Ge is not eliminated yet.

617
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Sang Qi should be released from the coffin.

618
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,280
What will he do next?

619
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,280
The Dark Clan's flag.

620
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,280
I didn't expect that there are so many people who miss the Alliance.

621
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
That's great.

622
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,280
This is a waste of time.

623
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,280
It's time to choose another better puppet.

624
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
Sister.

625
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,280
What's wrong, A Bao?

626
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
There is something scary around here.

627
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:37,280
It's like the place where the Dark Clan was.

628
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,280
The Dark Clan?

629
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,280
Which direction?

630
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,280
East... East South.

631
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Watch A Bao for me.

632
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,280
He is timid.

633
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,280
He might be scared when he sees the Dark Clan.

634
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
I'll go and check.

635
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Are you alone?

636
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,280
That's enough.

637
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,280
I think you've already felt it.

638
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
I'll go to see the City Leader Xie.

639
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,280
Xuan Xin, you take the disciples to set up the formation.

640
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,280
We must find the Dark Clan and get rid of them.

641
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,280
Yes.

642
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,280
It's been a long time since we met.

643
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,280
The Saint of Sand is still so heavy.

644
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I don't know which one is stronger.

645
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,280
I think it's the Dark Clan.

646
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,280
I think it's the Dark Clan.

647
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,280
I think it's the Dark Clan.

648
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,280
I think it's the Dark Clan.

649
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
I don't know which one is stronger.

650
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,280
It's you, Chi Ying.

651
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,280
You've been fighting for so many years.

652
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,280
It's not the first time you've been killed by me.

653
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:45,280
Just get used to it.

654
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,280
The Saint ordered me to say something to the Saintess.

655
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,280
Good people play for a long time.

656
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,280
Do you really forget who you are?

657
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,280
The Saintess came with the task of the Saint.

658
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
But she didn't act.

659
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,280
The Saint had to suspect that you were trying to do something.

660
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,280
Since the Master told you everything,

661
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,280
you should know that I have my own plan.

662
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:17,280
I hate it when people talk nonsense when I'm working.

663
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,280
If Master doesn't like it, you're not qualified.

664
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,280
Stop!

665
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,280
You're really not a good person.

666
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,280
How dare you hurt the innocent?

667
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
Please save me, Master.

668
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
I found her magic.

669
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,280
She wants to kill me.

670
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Gao Qiuming, are you stupid?

671
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,280
She's been revived by the Dark Clan.

672
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,280
Youxue City has a protective barrier.

673
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,280
How could the Dark Clan come in?

674
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,280
Get out of here.

675
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,280
I shouldn't have hidden it from you.

676
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,280
The Dark Clan is really not a good thing.

677
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,280
Gao Qiuming, the Alliance is full of fools.

678
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,280
You're one of them.

679
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
The Alliance is full of fools.

680
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:52,280
What are you going to do?

681
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:56,280
Gao Qiuming, I'll settle the score today.

682
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Yan Zheng?

683
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,280
Is there really a case?

684
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,280
I was so smart.

685
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,280
I shouldn't have blamed him.

686
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,280
I'll take care of it.

687
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,280
The Dark Clan is full of fools.

688
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:35,280
It seems that I can't escape from the Dark Clan

689
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,280
as long as I practice the Dark Palace.

690
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,280
I found it.

691
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
I won.

692
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,280
You killed your fellow clan

693
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
and stepped on their bodies and blood

694
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
to get here.

695
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,280
If they don't die, I'll die.

696
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:35,280
Since only one person can live,

697
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,280
it can only be me.

698
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,280
Not bad.

699
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:51,280
It's very exciting.

700
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,280
My good disciple told me

701
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:10,280
that you'd rather die than live.

702
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,280
You want to kill me?

703
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,280
I'm not afraid of you.

704
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
I'm not afraid of you.

705
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,280
What are you laughing at?

706
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,280
I want revenge.

707
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,280
They killed the only person in this world

708
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
who treated me well

709
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,280
and gave me warmth.

710
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,280
I want power.

711
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,280
I want the power to make you revenge.

712
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,280
I want revenge.

713
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:41,280
Remember, the more painful you are,

714
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,280
the stronger you will be.

715
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,280
You won.

716
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,280
From now on,

717
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,280
you are not only my disciple,

718
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:53,280
but also the saintess of Dark Yu.

719
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,280
I'm sorry.

720
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,280
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,280
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,280
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,280
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,280
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,280
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,280
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,280
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,280
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:00,280 --> 00:44:02,280
I'm sorry.

731
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:04,280
I'm sorry.

732
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:06,280
I'm sorry.

733
