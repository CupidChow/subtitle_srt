1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,740
The

2
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,740
The

3
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,740
The

4
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,740
The

5
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,740
The

6
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,740
The

7
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,740
The

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,740
The

9
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,740
The

10
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,740
The

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
The

12
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
The

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
The

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
The

15
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,740
The

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
The

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
The

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
The

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,740
The

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,740
The

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
The

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
The

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
The

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,740
The

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,740
The

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
The

27
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,260
It is

28
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,420
Let me

29
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,140
I'll do it. Don't make trouble.

30
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,740
Go back. It's none of your business.

31
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,980
I said I'll do it.

32
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,260
I said I'll do it.

33
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,660
It's not over yet!

34
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:30,740
What's going on?

35
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,180
What...

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,940
What did you do?

37
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,540
Gao Xiu Shi was injured.

38
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,660
It's not convenient for him to move.

39
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
Let's talk here.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,260
I'll go prepare a room for Gao Xiu Shi.

41
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,460
So you didn't leave just now

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,140
to delay the time on purpose

43
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,620
so that the sword can be used.

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:54,940
Where did I expose myself?

45
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,740
I didn't expose myself.

46
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,860
I didn't expose myself.

47
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,020
I didn't expose myself.

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
I didn't expose myself.

49
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,260
You made a mistake.

50
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,740
How is that possible?

51
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:13,620
What did I do wrong?

52
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,980
I...

53
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,700
Why should I tell you?

54
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,540
That's right.

55
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,940
Let me tell you.

56
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:29,180
Do you want to know how to improve yourself next time?

57
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,140
Idiot.

58
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,940
Even you say that about me?

59
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,140
Xu Yue.

60
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:45,780
This...

61
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,740
Fu Wen is the enemy.

62
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,460
Ling Mo is the disciple.

63
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:56,260
He is good at self-punishment.

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:58,500
He must be the best stage.

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,100
But

66
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,260
I can't be the stage director.

67
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,580
How long can we trap this fan?

68
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,860
Not long.

69
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:28,820
He...

70
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,020
He even came out?

71
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,140
It's because in a short time,

72
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,940
he will be part of this painting

73
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,700
and become a part of the painting.

74
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,460
That is to say,

75
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,020
he will become a dead object in this painting.

76
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,620
You are really amazing.

77
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,980
I'm a little jealous

78
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,180
of your tacit understanding.

79
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,740
But I'm also a little curious

80
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,780
what Zhan Ying said wrong.

81
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,820
Tell me.

82
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,300
You...

83
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,540
You...

84
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,380
He...

85
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
He doesn't want to tell you now.

86
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,060
When he wants to tell you,

87
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,420
he will definitely tell you.

88
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,740
He hugged her.

89
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,180
He actually hugged her.

90
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,100
Yes.

91
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,220
I...

92
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,020
I'm also too much to help him.

93
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,540
I...

94
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,860
I'm too much to help him.

95
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,300
Master Nan.

96
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,820
Is it still too late to let Zhan Ying go?

97
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,740
Master.

98
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,780
It's not like this.

99
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,700
Not like this.

100
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:48,500
Are they really engaged?

101
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,820
As far as I know,

102
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,780
it's just a rumor from the Alliance.

103
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,500
What?

104
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,940
Gao Xiu was born in the Mingyue Villa.

105
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:05,460
She is the daughter of the former leader of the Alliance, Gao Feng Xu.

106
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,700
She is talented and talented.

107
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,860
Many years ago, someone suggested

108
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,740
that the Mingyue Villa should marry Yong Xue Cheng.

109
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,940
This is only a joke.

110
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,900
But it seems

111
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:21,300
it's true.

112
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:23,940
Ten years ago,

113
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,420
Sang Qi's army attacked Mingyue Villa at night.

114
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,220
The Snow God happened to be there.

115
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,420
He saved Gao Xiu's family.

116
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,460
So many people think

117
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,060
they will end up together.

118
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,420
It's been ten years.

119
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,660
They haven't gotten together yet.

120
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,020
In the past,

121
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,780
Mingyue Villa was badly destroyed.

122
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:50,540
Only Gao Xiu's family survived.

123
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,260
Princess Jing Hua and Su Ning Zhen

124
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,740
are Gao Xiu's mother's sister.

125
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,420
They took her as a disciple

126
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,620
and took her in as a friend.

127
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,100
They were very strict.

128
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,820
So...

129
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,660
they were busy with cultivation

130
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,340
and didn't have time to play the zither and talk about love?

131
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,460
That's not known.

132
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,940
It's just that these years,

133
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,940
I've seen it from the side.

134
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,300
I think their relationship

135
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,140
is not as close as the rumors.

136
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,900
So...

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,380
Zhan Ying started to care about Xie Xue Chen.

138
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,380
But it's not right.

139
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,180
Anyway, I've never heard

140
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Gao Xiu summon Xue Chen

141
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,180
to thank you.

142
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,660
But...

143
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,660
ten years ago,

144
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,220
Xie Xue Chen wasn't even in the magic world yet.

145
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,860
How did he kill the King of Sang Qi

146
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,540
and survive?

147
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
And how did he save people?

148
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,780
Miss Mu, you're curious about this?

149
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,500
It's a legend.

150
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,900
It's always interesting to know more about it.

151
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,900
Then I don't know.

152
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,380
There are many things that

153
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,980
others can't know

154
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,180
if they don't say it.

155
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,580
I only know

156
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:11,580
that after that, he went to the closed gate of Snow Dive.

157
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,300
Until seven years later,

158
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:16,820
he saw the clear sky at the top of Snow Dive.

159
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:19,820
He went to the top of the magic world and then went down the mountain.

160
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:24,260
Even you don't know?

161
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,460
Mr. Nan, you picked it up?

162
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,460
It's Xie Xue Chen.

163
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,460
He went back to find me.

164
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:45,020
I have a very rude question

165
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
to ask you.

166
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,020
But it's okay.

167
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:54,620
Why did you approach Xue Chen?

168
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,620
Of course because I like him.

169
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,300
You don't care about Gao Xiu anymore?

170
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,300
I don't care about him anymore.

171
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,300
I just want to be with him.

172
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,300
Why?

173
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,300
Xie Xue Chen doesn't like him?

174
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,300
It seems that you are very confident

175
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,300
that Xue Chen likes you.

176
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,300
If it's difficult for you,

177
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,300
he doesn't have to like me.

178
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,300
He is willing to guard the world.

179
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,300
I'll be fine if I guard him.

180
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
I have something to do.

181
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
I'll go first.

182
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
Is this

183
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,300
the return of Tong Tong?

184
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
You are dead.

185
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,300
It seems that I'm not dead yet.

186
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
If you are not dead,

187
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
is Xie Xue Chen dead

188
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
or Mu Xuan Ling dead?

189
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,300
It seems that they are not dead yet.

190
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,300
Then why did you go out?

191
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,300
You didn't do anything

192
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,300
and went to sunbathe.

193
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
It's good that I'm not dead.

194
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,300
I'm not dead.

195
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,300
It's good that you're not dead.

196
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
Let's call your head back first.

197
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
I can't call it back.

198
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
What do you mean by that?

199
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
I don't know what's going on.

200
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
I just feel that

201
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,300
he is in a very empty place

202
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
and quiet place.

203
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
He keeps repeating a sentence.

204
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
What sentence?

205
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,300
What did I say wrong?

206
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,300
What did you say wrong?

207
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
It's not me.

208
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,300
It's him. He said it.

209
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,300
What did I say wrong?

210
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
What did he say wrong again?

211
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,300
I don't know.

212
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
Who practiced this broken elixir?

213
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
This time it doesn't seem to be a problem of elixir.

214
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
I really don't know.

215
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
Two head shadows died in two days.

216
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
Not only did nothing happen,

217
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,300
he didn't know anything.

218
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,300
If the Honorable one knew,

219
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,300
we would be the ones who died.

220
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,300
Then what are you talking about?

221
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:45,300
Where is your head shadow?

222
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
What did I say wrong?

223
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,300
It's almost there.

224
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
What did I say wrong?

225
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
I gave you thousands of people

226
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,300
to entrust you with the safety of the world.

227
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
But you

228
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
used him to kill your allies

229
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
and make a big mistake.

230
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,300
You

231
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,300
don't deserve to know this sword again.

232
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,300
But

233
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,300
But

234
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
But I really don't remember anything.

235
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
What you don't remember doesn't mean it didn't happen.

236
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:34,300
I have told you countless times that you can't be affectionate.

237
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:37,300
You think I'm forcing you to do something.

238
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,300
And now the matter is in front of you.

239
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
If you can really break the love and love,

240
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,300
and get rid of all the greed,

241
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
how can you be accused by the dark clan

242
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
and be punished?

243
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,300
Now

244
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
your hands, your sword,

245
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,300
your blood,

246
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,300
your sword,

247
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,300
your sword,

248
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
how can you be so cruel?

249
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,300
The stronger the power,

250
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,300
the deeper the danger.

251
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,300
The stronger the danger.

252
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,300
Now it's all over.

253
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,300
You just think about it.

254
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,300
Think about it and do it yourself.

255
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I hope

256
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
I won't be afraid of the death

257
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
and regret it.

258
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
I'm so cruel.

259
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,300
I can't be human.

260
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,300
Xie Xuechen?

261
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
You're awake.

262
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
Where am I?

263
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,300
Why am I here?

264
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
You were stopped by the dark clan's father.

265
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,300
You came to Yunxiu Villa.

266
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Father?

267
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,300
I only remember that I was attacked on my way back to the Palace of Pure Flower.

268
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
And then I was here.

269
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,300
I have a lot of things to do.

270
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
Did I do anything?

271
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
Nothing.

272
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
It's settled.

273
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
These dark clans are so hateful.

274
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
They only take advantage of people not being attacked.

275
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
Next time I see one, I'll kill one.

276
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,300
So this is how it feels to be revived by the dark clan.

277
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,300
You don't remember what you did.

278
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
You have to know from others.

279
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,300
I didn't do anything wrong, did I?

280
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
Nothing.

281
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,300
Oh, right. My junior Cui Wanwan, she...

282
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,300
Don't worry.

283
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
The male owner has sent someone to look for her.

284
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,300
Thank you.

285
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,300
Have a good rest.

286
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Xie Xuechen.

287
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
My master sent me to look for you.

288
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I can't refuse.

289
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,300
If you're free now, I can go back and hand in my order.

290
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,300
I know.

291
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,300
Thank you.

292
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
It's so sour.

293
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I'll go get some water.

294
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:51,300
Okay.

295
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,300
I'll go get some water.

296
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,300
Okay.

297
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,300
It's a beautiful night.

298
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,300
I just got some fruits. Try it.

299
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:26,300
Why are you here instead of healing?

300
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:29,300
Are you caring about me?

301
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
You're thinking too much.

302
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
I just don't want to be unkind.

303
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
That guy, Zhan Ying,

304
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
is really more painful than Yu Yingteng.

305
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,300
Brother.

306
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
Looking at you just now,

307
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
is your powers recovering?

308
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,300
What do you want to do?

309
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
I can do anything.

310
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,300
I just want to ask you a question.

311
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,300
May I come back to Yongxue City with you?

312
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Don't rush to refuse me.

313
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,300
You have time anyway.

314
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
You can think about it.

315
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,100
For the sake of helping you today.

316
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:21,620
Why didn't you tell me

317
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,900
that you went back to find me?

318
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,340
Why did you go back?

319
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,220
Because everything is fine.

320
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,220
Anyway, you went back.

321
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,420
That's good.

322
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,860
Thank you, Xue Chen.

323
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,700
I declare that we have made up.

324
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,460
I'm sleepy.

325
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,900
I'm going back to sleep.

326
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,980
Don't look at the moon.

327
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,740
The more you look at it, the worse your mood is.

328
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,300
Why don't you eat a fruit

329
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,100
and go back to sleep?

330
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,420
Have a good dream.

331
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:10,460
Where are you going?

332
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,940
I'm going back.

333
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,700
Hold on.

334
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:17,980
I'll bring you home.

335
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,660
It's paint and acid homework.

336
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,540
Sister.

337
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,940
I miss you so much.

338
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,300
And that scary thing just now

339
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,060
isn't that scary anymore.

340
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,300
Because it was locked up.

341
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,220
Sister, if you go out again,

342
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:57,100
will you be so, so, so happy?

343
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
Will I?

344
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,300
What happened?

345
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:11,900
It's the signal from the wind and the demon.

346
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,100
The first point is in...

347
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,780
Jinghua City.

348
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,540
Could it be that something happened in Jinghua Palace?

349
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,100
The color of the fireworks is different.

350
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,700
The meaning of the symbol is also different.

351
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:23,900
Purple and red are the enemy's blood.

352
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,100
Could it be the dark clan?

353
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,700
This is one possibility.

354
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,900
But there are other possibilities.

355
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,100
The one in the front.

356
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,300
The one in the back?

357
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,300
Rather than guessing,

358
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,900
I think it's the dark clan.

359
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,300
The dark clan is the one in the front.

360
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,300
The one in the back?

361
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,700
Rather than guessing,

362
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,300
it's better to go and see for yourself.

363
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Excuse me.

364
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,500
This lady is...

365
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,300
She's my cousin,

366
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,300
Ling'er.

367
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,300
From the far away.

368
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,500
Yes, brother.

369
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Hello, cousin.

370
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,700
Anyway, we can't delay it.

371
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,900
After the incense is set,

372
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,100
let's set off to Jinghua City.

373
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
I'll go too.

374
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:14,700
You...

375
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,100
Even my brother is going.

376
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,100
If I don't go,

377
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,500
how can I be at ease?

378
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,100
You can just wait here.

379
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,300
You don't have to take me.

380
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
Anyway,

381
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,300
I have my own way to go.

382
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,900
Then let's go together.

383
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,500
Let's go back and clean up.

384
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,500
See you after the incense is set.

385
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
See you later.

386
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,300
Thank you, Chen.

387
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,300
Thank you, Chen.

388
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,700
I have to remind you.

389
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,500
Gao Qiang Ming has seen us in the post station.

390
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,500
He also saw your Jun Tian Sword.

391
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,500
You'd better hide well.

392
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,100
Otherwise, if he recognizes you,

393
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,500
I'll have to fight with him again.

394
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,300
I don't care.

395
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,900
But he's miserable.

396
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,100
With spiritual power, I can hide my sword.

397
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,100
But it's you.

398
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,900
You have to follow me.

399
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:32,900
I can't stop you.

400
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,700
But still,

401
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
don't cause trouble.

402
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I won't.

403
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Princess Jing Hua, Su Ning Zhen,

404
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,300
is the most hateful person in the whole Immortal Alliance.

405
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:43,700
If you don't want to die,

406
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,300
you'd better hide yourself.

407
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
If something really happens,

408
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,700
I won't help you.

409
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,300
You'll be dead.

410
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
The Immortal Alliance

411
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Princess.

412
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,100
Did you catch him?

413
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,700
No.

414
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,300
Still searching.

415
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,900
The palace is heavily guarded.

416
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,300
How did the spiritual clan sneak into the palace?

417
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,500
The leader's order

418
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,900
can be easily escaped.

419
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,500
I'll go check it out.

420
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,300
Okay.

421
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,100
Okay.

422
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,100
I've said it.

423
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,300
The way to escape

424
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
can't allow others to steal the water.

425
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,700
We should have killed all the spiritual clan.

426
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,500
The city is under siege.

427
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,700
The spiritual clan got hurt again.

428
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,100
It's hard to escape.

429
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,700
Princess, please don't worry.

430
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,700
It's just a matter of time

431
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,100
before you get back the leader's order.

432
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,300
I'm in Tibet

433
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,300
I'm back

434
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,300
Qiangming

435
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
The cultivator from the Jade Embroidery Manor sent you back last night

436
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
He said you were attacked on the way and you were injured

437
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,300
Master, don't worry

438
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,300
I'm fine now

439
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,300
I received a message from the Fire Emblem

440
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,300
saying there's an enemy attack

441
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,300
So we came back immediately

442
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,300
Us?

443
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Yes, Xie Xuechen, Nan Xuyue

444
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,300
and Nan Xuyue's cousin

445
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
We went back to the Jin Hua City together

446
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Where are they?

447
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,300
When we entered the city

448
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
the guard was too strict

449
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:34,300
He only allowed us to enter

450
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,300
but not to leave

451
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
I only knew after asking

452
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
that the leader's edict was stolen

453
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
He said we had to make another plan

454
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,300
in order to catch the thief

455
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,300
Move aside

456
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Go inside and check

457
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
Check inside

458
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Yes, check inside

459
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,300
This way

460
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,300
This way

461
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,300
You should go with us

462
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
You, go inside

463
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,300
Thank you, brother, Lin Mofuwen

464
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:01,300
for helping me to avoid the search of the Sword Spirit Division

465
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Why didn't A'bao come with you?

466
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:06,300
He did

467
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
But I told him

468
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,300
there are Gao Qiuming and Sword Spirit Division here

469
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
He didn't want to come immediately

470
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
He said he would stay at the Embroidery Manor and wait for us

471
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,300
He also wished me a smooth journey

472
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
How many times has your spirit energy recovered?

473
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,300
Less than two times

474
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,300
Less than two times?

475
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,300
You even suggested that

476
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
we should act on our own

477
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
without the help of the people of the Embroidered Flower Palace

478
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
The Embroidered Flower Palace is well-known

479
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
and it's not easy to find anything

480
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,300
We are investigating in a low profile

481
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Maybe we can find something

482
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
Besides, the person who investigated the previous one

483
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,300
might need more force

484
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,300
The five-tailed jade pendant is broken

485
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,300
The jade pendant of the Embroidered Flower Palace is broken

486
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
The jade pendant of the Embroidered Flower Palace is broken

487
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
This is just the beginning

488
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
In this case, let them investigate

489
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,300
But

490
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
if they do anything

491
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:13,300
you need to tell me in time

492
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
Do you understand?

493
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,300
Yes, Master

494
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,300
By the way, Xie Xuechen disappeared for many days

495
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,300
because Sang Qi set him up and caught him in the Garden of Honor

496
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,300
Sang Qi came for the jade pendant

497
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,300
Sang Qi?

498
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:36,300
I hate that I couldn't kill him

499
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,300
That evil spirit clan

500
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,300
tried to get the jade pendant

501
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
but they were trapped in the Mingyue Villa

502
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:43,300
You were the only one left

503
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,300
Now you want to come back to the land

504
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,300
I want to come back

505
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,300
Qiuming, you must hate him

506
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,300
One day, you must kill him

507
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,300
Kill him

508
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,300
You must kill him

509
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
Master, your hand

510
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,300
Your hand

511
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,300
Princess

512
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,300
I was too agitated

513
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,300
It's my fault

514
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,300
Take Qiuming back to apply the medicine

515
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Let's go

516
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,300
You've grown up

517
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,300
You look more and more like your sister

518
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,300
But you haven't improved at all

519
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
When did you ever lose face?

520
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,300
You made me so hurt

521
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,300
Fortunately, the wound is not deep

522
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:43,300
You'll recover in a few days

523
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Thank you, Elder Zai Qi

524
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:48,300
Princess, you've been running all the way

525
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,300
Have a good rest

526
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,300
It hurts

527
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
Come in

528
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,300
Senior, it's me

529
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,300
No need to open it

530
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,300
You scared me

531
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,300
Believe it or not

532
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
Wanwan, what's wrong with your hand?

533
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Nothing, just a fracture in the hand

534
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,300
But it's already in the medicine

535
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:44,300
It can be recovered in a month

536
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Don't worry, Senior

537
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,300
Okay, sit down

538
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,300
I'll get you some tea

539
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,300
Sit down

540
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Please have some tea

541
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,300
Thank you, Senior

542
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,300
This time

543
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
The Fengyao Xiangjiu from Xingde Yunxiu Manor

544
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,300
Sent me back

545
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,300
I didn't sleep all night

546
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,300
I was just worried about what happened to Senior

547
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,300
But now that you're fine

548
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,300
I'm relieved

549
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Senior, how are you doing?

550
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,300
I'm fine

551
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:19,300
That dark clan is going to be my

552
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:20,300
If I get caught, I'll be back

553
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,300
Be quiet

554
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,300
Such a shameful thing

555
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,300
You want everyone to know, right?

556
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,300
Then what's going on?

557
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,300
You don't have to care about it

558
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,300
Anyway, this time

559
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,300
I let others laugh at me

560
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,300
But I tell you

561
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,300
If I meet you again

562
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,300
I will be bloodthirsty

563
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,300
I heard

564
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,300
It was Young Master Xie

565
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
Who sent Senior back?

566
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,300
No

567
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
It was Nan Xuyue and her

568
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:01,300
And Nan Xuyue's cousin

569
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,300
Together

570
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,300
Senior

571
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,300
Why are you in such a hurry to quit?

572
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:09,300
This Young Master Xie

573
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,300
He is a man of great virtue

574
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,300
And he has a relationship with you

575
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,300
You really don't like him at all?

576
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,300
Others are miserable

577
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
You're also a blind man, right?

578
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,300
Cui Wanwan

579
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,300
Okay

580
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Xie Xuechen

581
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
He's pretty good

582
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
He saved me when I was a kid

583
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,300
Of course I really thank him

584
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
But what did the old man say outside?

585
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,300
What did he say?

586
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,300
I only admire him

587
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,300
I only like him

588
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,300
He doesn't marry

589
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,300
And I hate those people

590
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,300
Who say that

591
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,300
Beauty is a hero

592
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,300
Beauty is a hero

593
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
But to be honest

594
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:01,300
I'm really beautiful

595
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,300
Senior is the most beautiful

596
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,300
Right?

597
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,300
And I'm born to be a drunkard

598
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,300
This is not a big deal

599
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,300
I will definitely

600
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:11,300
One sword for one person

601
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,300
For the people

602
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
But

603
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,300
Senior

604
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,300
Although I don't want to hit you

605
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
But one sword for one person

606
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:29,300
You are here

607
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,300
But the sword is lost

608
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
Senior, run

609
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,300
That sword is not easy to use

610
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,300
I wanted to change it long ago

611
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
I wanted to change it long ago

612
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,300
Come with me

613
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
This is the spring sword my mother left me

614
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,300
This is my future sword

615
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,300
If I meet that demon again

616
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,300
I will kill him

617
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,300
Actually

618
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,300
The reason you chose not to enter the Palace of Mirror Flower

619
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Is also to prevent Su Ningzhen, right?

620
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,300
The five sects of the Alliance are high-ranking

621
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
There are all internal suspicion

622
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,300
It's impossible to rule out Su Ningzhen

623
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,300
The possibility of holding on to the way

624
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,300
I need to see it clearly first

625
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,300
I said you two

626
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,300
Every step is counted as three steps

627
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,300
Are you tired?

628
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,300
Childe, the map is here

629
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,300
What

630
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,300
You don't think

631
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
You should avoid it

632
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
But even if I avoid it

633
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,300
I can't help listening

634
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:09,300
Even if you prevent me from eavesdropping

635
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,300
I can't help following you

636
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,300
Anyway, the results are the same

637
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,300
Why is it so troublesome?

638
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,300
I just want to help

639
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,300
People and spirits get along

640
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,300
It's better to have more trust

641
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,300
Childe

642
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,300
Do you have any magic treasures that can make people feel at ease?

643
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:39,300
Yes

644
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,300
Must it be like this?

645
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,300
You have to make someone feel at ease

646
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
It makes sense

647
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,300
These two bracelets

648
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,300
Can feel each other

649
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
It can control it

650
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:59,300
If Miss Mu wears it

651
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
When naughty and mischievous do evil

652
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
Xue Chen wears this one

653
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,300
As long as you urge it

654
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,300
You will become painful

655
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
Unable to move

656
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,300
Is it necessary?

657
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
I have no intention of controlling you

658
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:16,300
Otherwise you will

659
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
It's a bit like the lock soul

660
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,300
But it's much better than the lock soul

661
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,300
I know you are different from others

662
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,300
Won't torture me at will

663
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,300
Thank you, Chen

664
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:33,300
Now my life is in your hands

665
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,300
Am I ugly now?

666
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Yes

667
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,300
Please

668
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,300
The spirit clan of the Taoist jade seal is injured, right?

669
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,300
Yes

670
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:48,300
I heard that the spirit clan's cultivation is not low

671
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,300
It was hurt by Su Ning Zhen personally

672
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,300
Su Ning Zhen

673
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
Main cultivation water magic

674
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
The damage will be layered like the pattern

675
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,300
If the spirit clan can't find the fire-sucking medicine in a short period of time

676
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
The injury will only get worse

677
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,300
There are only a few medicine shops in the city

678
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,300
The spirit clan won't be stupid to commit suicide, right?

679
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:15,300
Last night, Princess Su went out of the city immediately

680
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,300
And sent people to guard all the medicine shops

681
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,300
If the spirit clan went there

682
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,300
They must have been caught

683
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,300
But until now

684
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,300
There is no news

685
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,300
Fire-sucking medicine

686
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,300
Not only medicine shops

687
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,300
Hello, two guests

688
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Welcome

689
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,300
You look like each other

690
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,300
You look rich and noble

691
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,300
But you look very familiar

692
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,300
It must be the first time to come to our Dianuan Pavilion

693
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,300
This is the only hot spring in Jinghua City

694
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:59,300
Our hot spring water is all from pure natural underground hot spring

695
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,300
It has the effect of detoxifying, nourishing, cooling and building up body

696
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,300
Today we have a discount

697
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,300
If you take a bath together

698
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,300
One of you will be free

699
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,300
How about it?

700
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,300
Do you want me to arrange it for you now?

701
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,300
We are not here to spend

702
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,300
We are here to apply for a job

703
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,300
Apply for a job?

704
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,300
So you two are not here to bath

705
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:29,300
I'm really sorry

706
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:33,300
Recently, the shop doesn't have this aspect of demand

707
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,300
Since you two don't spend

708
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,300
You don't have to influence my business here

709
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
You two, the door is over there

710
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,300
Please make yourself at home

711
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,300
Now, can we have this demand?

712
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,300
So

713
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,300
We really have a demand

714
00:35:56,300 --> 00:36:00,300
I don't know which side of work you two need to do

715
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
I don't know

716
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,300
Take care

717
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,300
Again

718
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:15,300
They say people depend on clothes and horses

719
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,300
But our Xie Young Master

720
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,300
Why is he so handsome in everything?

721
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,300
Take it

722
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
What's with your expression?

723
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,300
You are just a little girl

724
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
You are so cold to customers

725
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,300
Don't deduct money

726
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,300
So many people are here

727
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,300
In such a place

728
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:52,300
It's so crowded

729
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,300
People come here to buy and enjoy

730
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:58,300
They won't be used to you like me

731
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,300
You need to change your attitude

732
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,300
Do you want me to teach you how to serve people?

733
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,300
I suspect you did it on purpose

734
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,300
I didn't say I didn't mean it

735
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,300
But this place

736
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
Didn't you say you were coming?

737
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,300
You'd better find out something

738
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,300
See you later, Xiao Xi

739
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,300
So comfortable

740
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,300
He can't get out of the city

741
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,300
And he can't buy medicine

742
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Now

743
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,300
He can only use the fire to quench his thirst

744
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,300
And quench the spiritual power

745
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,300
of Princess Su

746
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,300
So

747
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,300
It's possible that he is here

748
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
Princess Su fought against the spiritual clan last night

749
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,300
She hurt her left shoulder

750
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,300
There must be traces left

751
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:08,300
But Princess Su said it was too dark last night

752
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,300
She didn't see clearly that the spiritual clan was a girl

753
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,300
She didn't see clearly last night

754
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,300
We'll know it today

755
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,300
Come

756
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,300
More water

757
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,300
Okay

758
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:29,300
Hey, you

759
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,300
Come here

760
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Where are you?

761
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,300
We've been waiting for a long time

762
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,300
Hurry up

763
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,300
You

764
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,300
You are so useless

765
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,300
Hurry up

766
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,300
You

767
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Where are you going?

768
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,300
Give me a massage

769
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,300
Look at you

770
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,300
You are so tall and thin

771
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,300
Harder

772
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,300
That's enough

773
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,300
Young man

774
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:21,300
You can't be lazy when you come out to do things

775
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,300
Where are you?

776
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300
Come on

777
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,300
My shoulder is sore

778
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:38,300
Tell me if you feel uncomfortable

779
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,300
So comfortable

780
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Young lady

781
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,300
You are so thin

782
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,300
I didn't expect you to be so strong

783
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
I'll give you a massage next time

784
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,300
Sister, give me a massage next time

785
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
Don't worry

786
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,300
I'll give you a massage next time

787
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,300
Do you need it?

788
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,300
No

789
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,300
You really don't want to try it?

790
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:20,300
I'm good at it

791
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,300
I said no

792
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,300
You don't serve me well

793
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,300
The owner will deduct my salary

794
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,300
Anyway, I don't charge you much money

795
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,300
Why don't you try it?

796
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:38,300
What do you want to do?

797
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,300
Look at what you said

798
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,300
What can I do with a small coin?

799
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,300
But since we met

800
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,300
It's fate

801
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:48,300
Then I'll ask for someone

802
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:51,300
Who is your owner?

803
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:54,300
Where is the goods?

804
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Why did you do it as soon as you came up?

805
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:04,300
Don't you want to talk?

806
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,300
If you are willing to give the jade order

807
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,300
For the sake of your tribe

808
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:10,300
I can keep your whereabouts from being exposed

809
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,300
Kill him

810
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,300
Kill him

811
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,300
What's the matter?

812
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,300
What's the matter?

813
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,300
What's the matter?

814
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,300
What's the matter?

815
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,300
Kill him

816
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Kill him

817
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:00,300
It seems that the jade order is not on you

818
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,300
It's all here

819
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,300
The jade order must be hidden in other places

820
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,300
Kill

821
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,300
Kill

822
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,300
Kill

823
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,300
Kill

824
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,300
Kill

825
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,300
Kill

826
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:10,300
I'm sorry

827
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,300
I'm sorry

828
00:45:11,300 --> 00:45:12,300
I'm sorry

829
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,300
I'm sorry

830
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,300
I'm sorry

831
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,300
I'm sorry

832
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:16,300
I'm sorry

833
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:17,300
I'm sorry

834
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,300
I'm sorry

835
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:19,300
I'm sorry

836
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,300
I'm sorry

837
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,300
I'm sorry

838
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,300
I'm sorry

839
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,300
I'm sorry

840
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,300
I'm sorry

841
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,300
I'm sorry

842
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:26,300
I'm sorry

843
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,300
I'm sorry

844
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:28,300
I'm sorry

845
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,300
I'm sorry

846
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:30,300
I'm sorry

847
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,300
I'm sorry

848
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,300
I'm sorry

849
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,300
I'm sorry

850
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:34,300
I'm sorry

851
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:35,300
I'm sorry

852
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,300
I'm sorry

853
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,300
I'm sorry
