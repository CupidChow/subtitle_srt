Song Yuanzhou, get rid of Chiying

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Song Yuanzhou, get rid of Chiying

7
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Ling'er, I didn't lie to you

8
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I told you, if you don't return to Dark Realm within a month

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
your demonic aura will tear your body apart

10
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
You have been in the mortal realm for half a month

11
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The return has begun

12
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Ling'er, today

13
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
you helped Chiying get the Soul Bead

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and return to Dark Realm and back to your master

15
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You are not worthy of the human world

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The human race is using the human race's flesh and blood

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:10,600
to build the

18
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Remember, complete the task and return to Dark Realm

19
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
and back to your master

20
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Only then can you return

21
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Huayu

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Huayu

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Mother, Mother

24
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Help

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I want you

26
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Go to the bathroom

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Who dares to say another curse, he will die

28
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Mu Xianling, you are crazy

29
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Let me go

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You have been looking for the evil king's mole

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Then I will tell you

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
There is another one among you

33
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
who is in the same group with Dark Clan

34
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You are not the same

35
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You are not the same

36
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You are not the same

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are not the same

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
You are not the same

39
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
You are not the same

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
You are not the same

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You are not the same

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You are not the same

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
The one who is in the same group with Dark Clan

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
is the one you trust the most

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Master Xie

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Don't talk nonsense

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You just want to leave the Alliance

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I am not talking nonsense

49
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The one in front of you

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
is the holy daughter of Dark Wing

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The disciple of the Qingchuan who respects Sang Qi

52
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Xie Xuechen brought her back to Yongxue City

53
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
If you don't believe, you can ask her

54
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Master

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Yes

56
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I didn't lie to you, did I?

57
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
It's the light of your human clan

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
that connects with our holy daughter

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Mu Xianling, let her go

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Give me the Soul Bead

61
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
and open the enchantment

62
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You have lost your mind

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You still don't want to tell her

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
even a few words

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Fine

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Let me help you

67
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Give me the Soul Bead

68
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
and open the enchantment

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Otherwise, they will all die

70
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Mu Xianling

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Mu Xianling won't kill them

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Mu Xianling may not kill them

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But Xie Chengzhu

74
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
will kill them

75
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Will you?

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Liu Yishi

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You are the best

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
of the magic weapons

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
of Bixiao Palace

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You are very knowledgeable

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Liu Yishi

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
is the broken stone

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
that fell when the Heaven Stairs collapsed ten thousand years ago

84
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It can record the real sound

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
No matter how high the cultivation is

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
it can't be changed

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
That is to say

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
what Liu Yishi

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
plays is real

90
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
What do you want?

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Let me go

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't worry

93
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
While everyone is here

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I want to show you

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
a secret that has been hidden for ten years

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A secret

97
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
What?

98
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Dad

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Dad

100
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Dad

101
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Xie Xuanjun

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Dad

103
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Tell me why

104
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Why did you kill my dad?

105
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You can't say it out

106
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Let me tell you

107
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Ten years ago

108
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
a young man went to the mountain to cultivate

109
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and happened to pass by Mingyue Mountain Manor

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
He was excited and left a bowl

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
That night

112
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
he happened to meet Sang Qi

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He went to kill the demon before he was retired

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Who knew that he would fail

115
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
but he was restless

116
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
He was brought back by the dark clan

117
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
and used the ten thousand-wield sword

118
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
to kill the former leader of the Alliance, Gao Fengxu

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
That night

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the father of the young man came to support him

121
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
but he saw his son killing the leader

122
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The Duke couldn't resist his selfishness

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
That father, while no one noticed

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
he erased the ten thousand-wield sword in the leader's wound

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and hid the fact that his son was killed by the dark clan

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
but he was restless

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
and punished the young man to go to the Snow Dome to think about it

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
He was in a daze for seven years

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I gave you ten thousand-wield sword

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
to entrust you with the safety of the world

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
but you

132
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,000
used it to kill the allies and make a big mistake

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
How was it?

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Was it a wonderful story?

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I don't remember anything about that day

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Isn't this the symptoms of the rebirth of the dark clan?

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Did you see it?

138
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
This is the most trusted Xie City Leader

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He is just a man with a restless mind

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and a man who is in the hands of the innocent and the allies

141
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You are following him

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Aren't you afraid that he will lead you to death?

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't listen to his nonsense

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
He is a demon girl

145
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
You can't believe his words

146
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The world is not necessarily real

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Not to mention

148
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
it's just a shadow of a stone

149
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,000
But the shadow stone can't be fake

150
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
You

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You see

152
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
No one in the whole Alliance

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
dares to speak for your father

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Do you know why?

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Because the one who killed him

156
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
was Xie Xue Chen

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You demon girl

158
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't talk nonsense and confuse people

159
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
The shadow stone killed them all

160
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The sword has been in practice for 500 years

161
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The golden elixir in the body is very powerful

162
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
It will cause the elixir to be destroyed

163
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Half of Yongxue City will be buried with you

164
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
There is such a way to play

165
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Then let's play something big

166
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Lan Xuyue, strengthen the barrier

167
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Lan Xuyue

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Even if I die in the Nine Heavens Cloud Formation today

169
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You can't open the barrier

170
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Open the barrier

171
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
She can't open it

172
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,400
The

173
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,500
barrier opens

174
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:50,000
뭘

175
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What are you doing?

176
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
What are you doing?

177
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What are you doing?

178
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,580
The

179
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,000
workGF

180
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
and the ganger

181
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,760
Cover the miss

182
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,840
The ganger

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,920
Mu Xue Cheng will protect us! Mu Xue Cheng will protect us!

184
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,240
Your temperament is not compatible with Yongxue City.

185
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
So when you arrive at Yongxue City,

186
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
you must start from the very first disciple of the outer sect.

187
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,840
Cultivate yourself and come back.

188
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,960
Younger disciple of Yongxue City, Mu Xue Cheng will protect us!

189
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,800
As a disciple of Yongxue City, how can you be so unruly?

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,320
When I enter the sect tomorrow, you are a junior junior.

191
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,760
Younger disciple of Yongxue City, Mu Xue Cheng will protect us!

192
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,800
Didn't you say you wanted to leave the dark night?

193
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,680
Live an ordinary life.

194
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,120
It's because I believe that's why I brought you to Yongxue City.

195
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,800
Here, you can live like an ordinary person.

196
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:53,640
If you believe, it's possible.

197
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,600
Mu Xue Liang, if there's a chance in the future,

198
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,200
I'll take you to see the real world.

199
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,280
Thank you, Senior.

200
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,880
её

201
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,720
有

202
00:13:41,800 --> 00:14:06,140
Don't want to

203
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,340
how

204
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,800
Thank you, Chen.

205
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:42,800
Ling'er.

206
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
You've disappointed me.

207
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Why did you do that?

208
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
You can't do it.

209
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,800
I'll help you to end it.

210
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,800
Okay?

211
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,800
You weren't captured by the Dark Clan.

212
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,800
You're suspicious of the Human Clan and hate the Alliance.

213
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,800
That's why you can't stand the devil's trick.

214
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
I'm the one who controls the devil.

215
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
You must have heard it.

216
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,800
At that time,

217
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,800
Xie Xuechen was revived by the Dark Clan.

218
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,800
So, the person you've been thinking about for ten years

219
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
is not him.

220
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,800
You knew it.

221
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
Why didn't you tell me?

222
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,800
Because of the hate.

223
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,800
It can make you strong and hateful.

224
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,800
It can make you live in the dark.

225
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,800
Where's his real brother?

226
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
Where did he go after that?

227
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Ten years in the dark.

228
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
I've never seen him.

229
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
The Dark Clan was destroyed and returned to the Void Sea.

230
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,800
It's not known when the new world will be formed.

231
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,800
It's either tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

232
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:13,800
Or a hundred years or a thousand years.

233
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
You should be patient.

234
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Ling'er,

235
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
for him,

236
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,800
you should come back to the dark.

237
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,800
You're hesitating.

238
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,800
Because of Xie Xuechen.

239
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,800
So, even if you knew that Xie Xuechen wasn't that person,

240
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,800
you're willing to die with him.

241
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,800
Ridiculous!

242
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,800
How to live should be decided by myself.

243
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Even you are not qualified to decide for me.

244
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,800
Ling'er,

245
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,800
you said that,

246
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,800
I'll be sad.

247
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,800
Your heart has died long ago.

248
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,800
It died on the day you cut off your arm.

249
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
I want to go my own way.

250
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,800
Even that's a dead end?

251
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,800
Yes.

252
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Then get out.

253
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,800
Xie Xuechen

254
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,800
She is a demon girl who was secretly captured by the disciples of Sangqi.

255
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
She can't stay.

256
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
She should be executed by the Alliance.

257
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,800
She was controlled by the demon.

258
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,800
The demon girl is the fact.

259
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,800
If she can be controlled once, it's second time.

260
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,800
The disciples of Sangqi will not be good.

261
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,800
They will kill all evil.

262
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,800
Master.

263
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Master Xie,

264
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,800
you really want to protect this demon girl?

265
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,800
She shouldn't die for the sake of the clan.

266
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,800
If she is controlled, it's not evil.

267
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Then who should be punished by the dead legal lord?

268
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Princess Su, is it Mu Xuanling or me?

269
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,800
You should have an explanation for the matter of the Alliance Leader.

270
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:44,800
I'll give you an explanation for the matter of Gao Fengxu.

271
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,800
Gao Fengxu, he deserves it.

272
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,800
Mu Xuanling.

273
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Ten years ago, on the night of the wedding dress,

274
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,800
I was a slave in Mingyue Villa.

275
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Gao Fengxu wanted to kill me first.

276
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,800
The dark clan killed him to save me.

277
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
Nonsense.

278
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,800
The Alliance Leader will not target you.

279
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,800
You think Gao Fengxu is a good thing?

280
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:18,800
As the Alliance Leader,

281
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,800
he always takes the lead to suppress the evil spirits.

282
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
Gao Fengxu seems to understand.

283
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:28,800
He is just a cruel and cruel disciple.

284
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
He killed the red eyes on the night of the wedding dress.

285
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I'm a spirit clan.

286
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,800
If I don't tell the truth, he will kill me.

287
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,800
The dark clan is not used to seeing him bully the weak.

288
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,800
So they are fighting.

289
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,800
What's wrong with that?

290
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Mu Xuanling, why do you slander my father?

291
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,800
You have been fighting with him for ten years.

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,800
Don't you know what kind of person he is?

293
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:57,800
What about you? What were you doing?

294
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,800
What kind of daughter and son-in-law are you pretending to be?

295
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,800
It's just a coincidence.

296
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Mu Xuanling.

297
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,800
You two, no one has seen the Alliance Leader.

298
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,800
It's useless to argue, right?

299
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Yes.

300
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,800
The Alliance Leader has been dead for ten years.

301
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:21,800
The matter of life should not be easily discussed.

302
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
If you say that the Lord Xie is wrong,

303
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,800
it's just that he is not stable at the moment.

304
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,800
He was reprimanded by the dark clan.

305
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,800
But the dark clan has always been difficult to defend.

306
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Otherwise, they wouldn't even be able to...

307
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Yes.

308
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,800
Right?

309
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,800
The Lord Xie used his own strength to block the golden elixir and himself.

310
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,800
He saved the people here and Ban Cheng.

311
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:53,800
How do we judge this?

312
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,800
You can discuss this matter in the future.

313
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:07,800
What we should discuss now is how to deal with the dark and holy women.

314
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Jiang Mu Xuan Ling broke into the force and locked herself in the rift,

315
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,640
how do we deal with her?

316
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,800
We shall discuss this in the future.

317
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:17,800
Thank you, Lord.

318
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,800
I said, we shall discuss this in the future.

319
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,480
The law of the world is forbidden in the ice prison.

320
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,800
How to deal with it?

321
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,040
I'll wait and see.

322
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,400
Thank you, Your Majesty.

323
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,440
I said I'll wait and see.

324
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,240
You miss him so much.

325
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,880
But why isn't he here?

326
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,760
Xue Chen, San Mo...

327
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:26,200
I've called you, for once.

328
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:35,520
Senioritas.

329
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,840
If a monster blew him out,

330
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,880
he'd be landed into a pretty mess.

331
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,760
Senior.

332
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,200
Those with great swordsmen

333
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,680
with remarkable cultivation,

334
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,360
you used the power of your primordial spirit

335
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
to totally ignore his self-breadth.

336
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,920
You're really not going to save him yet.

337
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,800
I can't die without the self-protection power

338
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,800
that Juntian has

339
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
If Juntian wasn't here

340
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
you would have been killed on the spot

341
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
Xu Yuan

342
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Xu Yuan

343
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
Don't let anyone know

344
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
that I'm injured

345
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
I'm afraid that the funeral flag will be attacked

346
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
The self-protection power

347
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
that was sent out

348
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
has already turned all the people

349
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
into hunters

350
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
and the chaos can't be left behind

351
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
Only if I'm fine

352
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
will the funeral flag be attacked

353
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
Only if you're fine

354
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,800
will the immortal alliance be attacked

355
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:09,800
You can protect the Immortal Tomb

356
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Right?

357
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
In the main hall

358
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,800
the various sects wanted to kill Mu Xuanling

359
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,800
If the City Leader hadn't

360
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
forced the injured to shoot the people

361
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,800
Mu Xuanling

362
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
would have been killed on the spot

363
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
But now

364
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
we can only put her in jail

365
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,800
She shouldn't die for her sin

366
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
But her body

367
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,800
has already been damaged

368
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I've taken her pulse

369
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,800
and her vital organs have been affected

370
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,800
Her meridians are always

371
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,800
torn apart

372
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,800
and her spirit energy is damaged

373
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,800
I'm not sure

374
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
how long she can last

375
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
The Immortal Tomb

376
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
The Immortal Tomb

377
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
I've been thinking about everything

378
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I can't even touch

379
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
the sun in the last half of the night

380
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,800
Why

381
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
shouldn't I like

382
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
the dog's tail in the dog's cage

383
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Come

384
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Thank you, City Leader

385
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
You shouldn't have come

386
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Why is it like this?

387
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
It's just a small wound

388
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Compared to your wounds

389
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
it's nothing

390
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Now that your hand is broken

391
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
you shouldn't want to transfer

392
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
my wound to you

393
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Xie Xuechen

394
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
To be honest

395
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,800
I don't have much time

396
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,800
So

397
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,800
kill me

398
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:39,800
Use my life

399
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,800
to save you

400
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
My life

401
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,800
to prove your steady style

402
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,800
to calm the dispute between you and the Dark Clan

403
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,800
Kill me

404
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,800
and you'll still be

405
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
the one who can tell

406
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
the difference between good and evil

407
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
You shouldn't die

408
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,800
for the wrong

409
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
What is the difference between good and evil?

410
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
One person doesn't save

411
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
the world

412
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,800
I said

413
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
there's hope in the village

414
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,800
and there's no need to give up

415
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:21,800
I've caused you to be like this

416
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,800
Why aren't you angry?

417
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Xie Xuechen

418
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
I'm not as good as you think

419
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
I'm possessed today

420
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
because I already have a new devil

421
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
If I didn't have...

422
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
After a thousand years

423
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
maybe I would have destroyed the Immortals

424
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
and the Human Clan

425
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Lu Xuanling

426
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
From the first day

427
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I met you

428
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
I've been thinking

429
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
about one question

430
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Why are you so stubborn?

431
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
I finally understand

432
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,800
that you've never thought about me

433
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
Yes

434
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,800
He's my big brother

435
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
He gave me my life

436
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
But at this moment

437
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
my thousand years are not because of him

438
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,800
but because of you

439
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,800
21 years

440
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,800
It's already like this

441
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,800
What's the point of saying this?

442
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,800
Why don't you give me some snacks

443
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,800
and some good wine?

444
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,800
When I'm full

445
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,800
you can kill me

446
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,800
Xie Xuechen

447
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll let you kill him

448
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Lu Xuanling

449
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I won't let you die

450
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
You won't let me die

451
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I won't die

452
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,800
I won't die

453
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,800
I'm so lucky

454
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
that you should

455
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,800
learn from the Emperors

456
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,800
Xie Xuechen

457
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,800
Go

458
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,800
I hope next time we meet

459
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,800
you'll kill me

460
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,800
I won't let you die

461
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Xie Xuechen

462
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,800
I don't have a chance

463
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,800
to see the real world with you

464
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
You knew it already

465
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
How did you

466
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,800
solve the Kui Lei's mess in the Palace of Pure Flower?

467
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,800
You answered so many questions

468
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
You were covering up for him, right?

469
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
No, master

470
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
I really didn't know that he was the Goddess of Darkness

471
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
But he did use the Demon Palace to save everyone

472
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
But he's from the Spirit Tribe

473
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
You covered up for a Spirit Tribe

474
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
The Spirit Tribe is the best at seducing people

475
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,800
Sang Qi made that demon girl

476
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,800
get close to Xie Xuechen

477
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,800
He must be trying to

478
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,800
disturb Xie Xuechen's cultivation

479
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,800
But Xie Xuechen was trapped in the dark

480
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,800
and was trapped under the Dragon Garden

481
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,800
Why did he take this chance?

482
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:37,800
What do you know?

483
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,800
Sang Qi has always been

484
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,800
cunning and cunning

485
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,800
He was just playing with people's hearts

486
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Sang Qi is the enemy of the Palace of Pure Flower

487
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,800
He has the power to take the throne

488
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,800
I won't let him go

489
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,800
I won't let that demon girl go

490
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,800
Master, Sang Qi lied to you

491
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

492
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,800
He's just a spirit tribe

493
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,800
who deserves to be burned

494
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,800
by the people of the Palace of Pure Flower

495
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,800
Master, your hatred for Sang Qi

496
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:21,800
is too strong

497
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Qiu Min, you must hate him too

498
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,800
You must hate him

499
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,800
He not only killed Mingyue Villa

500
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
but also your mother

501
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Didn't you say that your mother died of a miscarriage?

502
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,800
Master, it's just a slip of the tongue

503
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,800
I'm tired

504
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,800
You can leave now

505
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
Master, I'm sorry

506
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,800
I'm sorry

507
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,800
I'm sorry

508
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,800
I'm sorry

509
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm sorry

510
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:21,800
I'm sorry

511
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,800
I'm sorry

512
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,800
I'm sorry

513
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,800
I'm sorry

514
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
I'm sorry

515
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,800
I'm sorry

516
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,800
I'm sorry

517
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,800
I'm sorry

518
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,800
I'm sorry

519
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Which one is harder?

520
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,800
The health stick or an useless thing?

521
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,800
The health stick

522
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,800
or the useless thing?

523
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,800
The health stick

524
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
You think I care?

525
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,800
Never mind

526
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,800
How can it be reminds?

527
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
That's right

528
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,800
That's right

529
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,800
What can that be?

530
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,800
That's right

531
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,800
That's right

532
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,800
You can see for yourself

533
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:08,800
you're not the one to die

534
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,800
Mu Xuanling, you're talking nonsense

535
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,800
You're the one who's in this situation

536
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,800
Our Miss has come to the prison

537
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
to show her respect

538
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,800
I'm afraid she's not just trying to humiliate me

539
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,800
What? You want to ask me something?

540
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,800
Do you want to ask me

541
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,800
what's the plan of Sang Qi?

542
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
Or do you want to ask me

543
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,800
why I slandered Gao Feng Xu?

544
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
I want to ask you

545
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,800
how you killed my mother

546
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,800
Didn't your mother die of miscarriage?

547
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,800
What does it have to do with Sang Qi?

548
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,800
Although I don't know what Su Ning Zhen told you

549
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,800
but as far as I know

550
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,800
the year you were born

551
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,800
Sang Qi was in seclusion

552
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,800
He couldn't have run out and killed your mother

553
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,800
How can I believe what you said?

554
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,800
If you don't believe what I said

555
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,800
why did you come to me?

556
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,800
Twenty years ago

557
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,800
I wasn't adopted by Sang Qi

558
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,800
I found out from other secret groups

559
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,800
Sang Qi was badly injured

560
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,800
and broke his arm

561
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
He was in seclusion for three years

562
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,800
So he couldn't go to the mortal world

563
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,800
Sang Qi broke his arm

564
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,800
Gao Xiu Shi

565
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,800
Are you done?

566
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,800
No

567
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Leave now

568
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,800
Don't disturb me

569
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,800
Mu Xuan Ling

570
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,800
Why are you always

571
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,800
so hostile to me?

572
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,800
Because you are both women

573
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,800
You never care about

574
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,800
others' evil

575
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Say it clearly

576
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,800
I never treated you badly

577
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,800
You were the one who

578
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,800
bullied the spiritual clan

579
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
Sang Qi came to me

580
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:58,800
and asked me to change my clothes

581
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,800
Didn't you ask me to die for you?

582
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,800
His eyes

583
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
You were the one

584
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
back then

585
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:48,800
Look

586
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,800
I really forgot you

587
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,800
My life is so short

588
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I didn't forget

589
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,800
I didn't do as you said

590
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Father didn't allow me to be close to the spiritual clan

591
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,800
I was so cruel

592
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,800
I would punish whoever I treated well

593
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,800
That's why I pretended to be cruel to Lin De

594
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:02,800
The reason I let you die

595
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
was because you pretended to be so cruel

596
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,800
I was there

597
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,800
I was there

598
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,800
I was there

599
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,800
It was arranged by the elders

600
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
When I came back

601
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
I was already taken away

602
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,800
When I was going to save you

603
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:12,800
you were already taken away

604
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,800
Mu Xuan Ling

605
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I'm not like this

606
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,800
Yes

607
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
You got all the benefits

608
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
Others got the bad guys

609
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Only you are innocent

610
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
My lady

611
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,800
I'm sorry

612
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,800
Gao Xiu Shi

613
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,800
I

614
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,800
Thank you for your order

615
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Miss Jiang Mu is under arrest for the time being

616
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
No one is allowed to take her own life

617
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,800
Did I do anything to her?

618
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
I want to remind you

619
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
You are not from the Immortal Alliance

620
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
How can you protect her?

621
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Although Yin Xiu Mountain Village is not in the Alliance

622
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,800
it's not a small golden elixir

623
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,800
that can be used to kill

624
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Fine

625
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,800
For the sake of Yin Xiu Mountain Village

626
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,800
I won't argue with you

627
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,800
Stupid and coward

628
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,800
Is it because of the evil spirit?

629
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
Yes

630
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Let me help you apply the medicine

631
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,800
The wound will heal very quickly

632
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,800
It just hurts a little

633
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,800
It shouldn't be more painful than the magic gas

634
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,800
or the magic elixir

635
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
This is an upgraded elixir

636
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
It will speed up the healing of the wound

637
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,800
It's just

638
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,800
it will hurt and itch

639
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,800
It's like a insect

640
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,800
How about not using it?

641
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
Is the wound a badge of the spiritual clan?

642
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,800
How about trying the talisman?

643
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,800
It can make your badge more gorgeous

644
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,800
The man of the South Village is so glorious

645
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,800
and as high as the lotus

646
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,800
How can he have such a evil poison?

647
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,800
Of course it's because

648
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,800
I'm not a person as high as the lotus

649
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,800
The medicine for Yin Xiu Mountain Village is indeed a magic gas

650
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
It heals so quickly

651
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,800
How long do you have?

652
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Half a month

653
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,800
So

654
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
You can persuade Xie Xue Chen

655
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Kill me if you should

656
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Even if you already know

657
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,800
that he is not your benefactor

658
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,800
You still will not change your mind

659
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,800
It may not be clear before

660
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
But at the moment when Chi Ying exposed the elixir

661
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,800
I know how scared I am

662
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,800
I'm afraid that Tian Di Jian is in the hands of Xie Xue Chen

663
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
Except for the favor I had that day

664
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,800
I think

665
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,800
I should like him

666
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,800
But I'm going to die

667
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,800
Does it count as killing him?

668
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:32,800
Or forget it

669
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,800
I don't know where my incense is

670
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
And he has it

671
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,800
If I take you away

672
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,800
Will you?

673
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,800
The medicine for Yin Xiu Mountain Village is made of a piece

674
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,800
I can help you strengthen your body

675
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,800
and resist the evil gas

676
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,800
My formation is also the world's best

677
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,800
It can protect you from the dark jade of the spirit tribe

678
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
or the discovery of anyone in the Alliance

679
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,800
Go back with me

680
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,800
Then you can live like an ordinary person

681
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,800
Is that okay?

682
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,800
But Yong Xue City lost a heavy meal

683
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,800
How should I explain to you?

684
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
You will die if you stay

685
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:36,800
You have to hold him even if you die

686
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,800
I chose my own way

687
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:53,800
I won't change my choice

688
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,800
I will not change my choice

689
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,800
I will not change my choice

690
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:08,800
I will not change my choice

691
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,800
I will not change my choice

692
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,800
I will not change my choice

693
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,800
I will not change my choice

694
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,800
I will not change my choice

695
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,800
I will not change my choice

696
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I will not change my choice

697
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,800
I will not change my choice

698
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,800
I will not change my choice

699
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I will not change my choice

700
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,800
I will not change my choice

701
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,800
I will not change my choice

702
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
I will not change my choice

703
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,800
I will not change my choice

704
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I will not change my choice

705
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,800
I will not change my choice

706
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,800
I will not change my choice

707
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,800
I will not change my choice

708
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:44,800
I will not change my choice

709
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
I will not change my choice

710
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:48,800
I will not change my choice

711
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
I will not change my choice

712
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I will not change my choice

713
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
I will not change my choice

714
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I will not change my choice

715
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,800
I will not change my choice

716
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,800
I will not change my choice

717
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,800
I will not change my choice

718
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,800
I will not change my choice

719
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,800
I will not change my choice

720
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
I will not change my choice

721
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,800
I will not change my choice

722
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,800
I will not change my choice

723
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,800
I will not change my choice

724
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,800
I will not change my choice

725
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,800
I will not change my choice

726
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,800
I will not change my choice

727
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,800
I will not change my choice

728
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:24,800
I will not change my choice

729
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
I will not change my choice

730
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
I will not change my choice

731
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,800
I will not change my choice

732
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,800
It's okay

733
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,800
I will not change my choice

734
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,800
I will not change my choice

735
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
I will not change my choice

736
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,800
It's okay

737
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,800
I will not change my choice

738
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,800
I will not change my choice

739
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,800
It's hard to be serious

740
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Mother please

741
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,100
I will not

742
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,300
I will not have to

743
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:52,800
None of your parents

744
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,800
Can I have any teaching?

745
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:59,800
I will let a dream be a dream, and nothing more.

746
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:06,800
I have no wish in this life, but to be by your side.
