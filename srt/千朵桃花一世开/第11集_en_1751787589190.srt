00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Since everyone values it so much,

4
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I won't push it any further.

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Xuan Tian Sect will do our best

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to protect the Chaos Bead.

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Congratulations!

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Congratulations!

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Congratulations!

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Congratulations!

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Congratulations!

12
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Congratulations, Chief!

13
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Since we have chosen the new Chief,

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
tomorrow noon,

15
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
please take the order from the Sect Leader

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
and go to the bamboo tower.

17
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
By then,

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I will hand over the Chaos Bead

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
to the Xuan Tian Sect.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:15,240
The

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Master will be furious

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
when he sees the Chief's wish come true.

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I'd better not follow him.

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll go back after he's calmed down.

25
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
About the case of the Dark Clan of the Wu Gang,

26
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
neither Mu Xuan Ling nor Xie Xue Chen

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
said anything.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They are a bit of a match.

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The road is rough.

30
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
The front is strong,

31
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and the back is tired.

32
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The Master is so attractive.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Gao Xiu Shi.

34
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Fu Xiu Shi.

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Why are you here?

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Well,

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I was accidentally

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
blinded by the wind and sand.

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I embarrassed you.

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
This wind and sand is so sharp.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
When hiding the sorrow,

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
he must not want to be seen clearly.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I shouldn't have exposed him.

44
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
It's okay.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'll help you blow it.

46
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Don't move. It's okay.

47
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You're smart this time.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You know what I mean.

49
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The Master of the Sword

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
looks young,

51
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
but he's actually more than 500 years old.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
He's old.

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Only by letting him be the Chief,

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
can we be promoted

55
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
earlier in the future.

56
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Such a simple account

57
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
doesn't need you to remind me.

58
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Hurry up.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Hurry up.

60
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
How did they get together?

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
It's just a few days.

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Sheng Er has been bullied again.

63
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Who allows you to be my son?

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
He can kill anyone he likes.

65
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay, okay.

66
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
But Madam,

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
there's a bunch of eagles in the house.

68
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Isn't that enough?

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
If this continues,

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'll be called the Flower Manor.

71
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's because I'm capable.

72
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Are you feeling better?

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm feeling better.

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you, Master Fu Xiu.

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You've done enough.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Oh, right.

77
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is a night-dress.

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Night-dress.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's beautiful.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
It's beautiful.

81
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
About yesterday,

82
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
did you solve the problem?

83
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
About Mu Xian Ling,

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I gave him a magic weapon.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
It should be returned.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
A magic weapon

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
can break love.

88
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
There's no eternal love in this world.

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
By the way,

90
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Gao Qiu Ming is really

91
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
in line with the standard of being a young lady.

92
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
But he has a good relationship with her.

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Isn't he the fiancee of Master Xie?

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
How can you

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
bully his wife

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
in front of him?

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
If he's found out, he'll be killed.

98
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
What a child.

99
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
So what?

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Even if they're married,

101
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
they can still get married.

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
So what?

103
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Why do I hear

104
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
as if he's pointing at me?

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Have you

106
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
thought about getting married?

107
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I didn't expect that

108
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
he reminded me.

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Duan Xiao Rong, you...

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You're so good at it.

111
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Fine.

112
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
We'll see who's more likely to live.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
When you're old and you're in bed,

114
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'll listen to you.

115
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Don't be sad.

116
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Since Master Xie is sorry to you,

117
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
you don't have to keep the engagement.

118
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Just find another good man.

119
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Wait. Who do you think I have an engagement with?

120
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
You don't have to hide it.

121
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I know.

122
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You have an engagement with Master Xie.

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But he's in love with Miss Mu.

124
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's really heart-wrenching.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Stop talking.

126
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Who has an engagement with Xue Qian Chen?

127
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You've been talking to me

128
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
so weird these days.

129
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'm telling you, Fu Xiu Shi.

130
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't have an engagement with Xie Xue Chen.

131
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It doesn't matter to me

132
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
who he likes.

133
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
And

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Xie Xue Chen is not a man who lets go of his wife.

135
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's not good for you to say bad things behind his back.

136
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You're so annoying.

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
The weather is so nice.

138
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
It's a sunny day.

139
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
It's good.

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What you mean is

141
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
all the elders of the Alliance

142
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and all the new disciples of the Alliance

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
can't tell the difference.

144
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Who is the one who is being secretly protected?

145
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Including the elders,

146
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Master, and

147
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Xie Cheng Zhu.

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I can't tell the truth

149
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
about this result.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
From yesterday to today,

152
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
did you encounter any strange things?

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Strange things?

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Yes.

155
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
What strange things?

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I don't want to make any more decisions.

157
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'll go ask the reason first.

158
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I don't dare, Putra Yan.

159
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Yi Tack said

160
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Er mustard

161
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
is like an old tree

162
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
which is notê¸´ need a pleasure.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Yi Tack judgement

164
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Of course.

165
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
We have no other choice.

166
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm a little curious.

167
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is our City Leader Xie really having a heart attack?

168
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You weren't in the main hall just now.

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm also a little curious.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Is the South Sect Leader having a heart attack?

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Tomorrow, we're going to hand over the Soul Beads.

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Are you ready?

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
There's no complete treasure in this world.

174
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
It's just a step in the right direction.

175
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Still that same sentence.

176
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Don't die.

177
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Master.

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You...

179
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
have never cared about the outside world since you were little.

180
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You don't know how to make up for your broken clothes.

181
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
If Master isn't here, who will look after you?

182
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
What? Do you have something to say?

183
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Yes.

184
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Sit down and talk.

185
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Sit down and talk.

186
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
The hairpin Master gave me last night,

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
is it really just a hairpin?

188
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You brat.

189
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You're actually suspecting Master.

190
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
If you have doubts in your heart, you must ask.

191
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Or else, if you're suspicious,

192
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
even if it's a thousand miles,

193
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
you'll be ashamed of one heart.

194
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
This is also what Master taught me.

195
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I didn't teach you how to bully me.

196
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Master, answer me.

197
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The hairpin is just a hairpin.

198
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It doesn't have any hands or feet.

199
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
If the hairpin is really just a hairpin,

200
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
then what is Master's obsession?

201
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
If it's obsession,

202
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
it's to make Master the leader.

203
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Now, what you want,

204
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
there's nothing you can't let go.

205
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,000
So, do you believe it?

206
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Yes.

207
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Sometimes, I feel that I taught you too purely.

208
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
You're easily deceived.

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It's just a hairpin.

210
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
It's enough to have one hand.

211
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Among all the disciples,

212
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
only you

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
never deliberately meddled.

214
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
But you've already done nothing.

215
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Without a duty, there's no demon in your heart.

216
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Xuan Xin,

217
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
your Taoism is already beyond Master.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The new leader is determined.

219
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Tomorrow, we'll hand over the chaos orb.

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Although you have a short time to enter,

221
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
you can't help but be under the influence of the enemy.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You need to strengthen your defense.

223
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Tomorrow, you'll go to the orb tower with me.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You'll be responsible for the defense.

225
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Yes.

226
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Okay, the rest of you, leave first.

227
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

228
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Mu Xuan Ling.

229
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Look at you.

230
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
You're so restless.

231
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Did you disturb the City Leader again in the middle of the night?

232
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
How can I say anything to you?

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Don't think that I won't dare to say anything to you because he's following you.

234
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
It's a critical time now.

235
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The City Leader is in danger and he's trying to kill himself.

236
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't you know how to take care of yourself?

237
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Besides, you're already busy with your own business.

238
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Don't think about those useless things all day.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Do you understand?

240
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I understand.

241
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Then you have to do it even if you can hear it.

242
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Go back and sleep well.

243
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You can only get energy when you're full.

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
As a disciple of Yongxue City,

245
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
how can you be so disheveled?

246
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hey, Sister Xuan Ling.

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Sister?

248
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Sister Xuan Ling, the City Leader was here just now.

249
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I didn't have the heart to disturb you.

250
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
What's the matter?

251
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Aren't we going to carry out the mission tomorrow?

252
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The enemy is in the dark now.

253
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't know what will happen.

254
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Follow me tomorrow.

255
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
If there's anything, I'll protect you.

256
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Oh, right.

257
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
This is my magic weapon.

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
It can strengthen your shield.

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
If I remember correctly,

260
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
you're younger than me.

261
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
But I'll enter the gate tomorrow morning.

262
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
You're a junior.

263
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Why did you enter Yongxue City?

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
A dozen years ago,

265
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
there was a fierce battle in the Wanxian Town.

266
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
The dark clan was out of power.

267
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
They killed people in our village.

268
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
So,

269
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
you're cultivating the Dao to avenge your death?

270
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
No.

271
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
My parents said before they died,

272
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
don't bring with you hatred.

273
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Even hatred can be a part of the dark clan.

274
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Let's not talk about this.

275
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm going back to prepare.

276
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
You should go back and prepare.

277
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
There's a big event tomorrow.

278
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Take care. I'm going.

279
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
What kind of broken weapon is this?

280
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
It's really cute.

281
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
So Gao Xiu Shi has no intention to marry Xie Chengzhu.

282
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
They don't have an engagement.

283
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I also advised him

284
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
not to be sad

285
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
because of the closeness between Xie Chengzhu and Miss Mu.

286
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I think in his heart,

287
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm afraid I'm not a big fool.

288
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You care so much.

289
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do you want to be friends with Gao Xiu Shi?

290
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Friends?

291
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
The more, the better.

292
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You're so nice to every girl.

293
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No wonder Princess Fu said you were affectionate.

294
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
She said me?

295
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
In the early years, I was so beautiful

296
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
and affectionate. It was her.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But you,

298
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
you've been looking for Meng Zhongyuan for so many years.

299
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Maybe I've already found her.

300
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Already found?

301
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Which girl?

302
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's just a feeling.

303
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I haven't confirmed it yet.

304
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you're sure, you have to tell me immediately.

305
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
You...

306
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Why are you more anxious than me?

307
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm curious.

308
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Hurry up. Don't let me wait too long.

309
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't want to wait too long either.

310
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
The moon isn't round today.

311
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
What are you looking at?

312
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
When did you come here?

313
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
When the moon was rising.

314
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You've been here?

315
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I was thinking about something.

316
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
But I didn't understand.

317
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What were you thinking about?

318
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,000
I went down the mountain today to go to the town.

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
The tea shops in the forest street

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
are very popular.

321
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm going to have a look.

322
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I've been doing it for an afternoon in the tea shops in the forest street.

323
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Why?

324
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I want to see

325
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
the world you risked your life to protect.

326
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
How did you see it?

327
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I've been looking for an afternoon.

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I saw 32 couples walking by.

329
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
They were holding hands very little.

330
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
What are you looking at?

331
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
There were five couples arguing.

332
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
There were 123 customers in the food stall.

333
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Nine children bought candied haws.

334
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Ten old people went into the pharmacy.

335
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The shop owner next to them was a little bad.

336
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The same hairpin.

337
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Sold to the first customer for 60 cents.

338
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Sold to the second customer for 90 cents.

339
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
There was a gambling house on the other side.

340
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
There were a lot of people coming in and out.

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
There were only a few who won.

342
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
There were three who lost and were thrown out.

343
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
There was also a thief

344
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
who took away the money from others.

345
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
There were a lot of people on the street.

346
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
There were no people who were in the way.

347
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
They helped each other.

348
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Xie Xuechen, I think it's not just you who are boring.

349
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
The whole world is boring.

350
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Day after day.

351
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
For a few taels of silver.

352
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You're busy.

353
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
You're in a hurry.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
The so-called sea-sand alliance

355
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
is no match for the rice and oil.

356
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
There are many things that want to see the two sides.

357
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The sea is boundless.

358
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Greed is hard to fill.

359
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's a pit.

360
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
But you still have to jump in.

361
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Good people

362
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
may not be able to be treated with respect.

363
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
And they will be rewarded.

364
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
The bad people may not be able to get the punishment they deserve.

365
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Anyway.

366
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
The world is too cold.

367
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The bad people are afraid of the bad.

368
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
The numb people dare not to be sober.

369
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
The sober ones may not change.

370
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
The ones who have changed may not get it.

371
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
The ones who get it

372
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
forget to cherish it.

373
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
This is the conclusion you got in half a day.

374
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The world is boring, cold and poor.

375
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
And it deserves it.

376
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Don't think I don't know what you and Nanxu Yue are thinking.

377
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
You're in the dark.

378
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The dark clan and the Nine Immortals are in the dark.

379
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
If you don't fight back,

380
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
you'll be in the dark forever.

381
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
So you want to use the Stone of Chaos

382
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
to lure the enemy to the light.

383
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
to lure the enemy to the light.

384
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Right?

385
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Yes.

386
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
This time, the Chiyin is here.

387
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's the most vicious one in the Three Shadow.

388
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
It's hard to deal with.

389
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
It's hard to deal with, but you have to deal with it.

390
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
You have to deal with it.

391
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Thank you, Chen.

392
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Will the Alliance be stable tomorrow?

393
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
No.

394
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Will the world be better?

395
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
No.

396
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Then why do you still want to rush up?

397
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Can't they just die?

398
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
In your opinion,

399
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the world is in chaos, right?

400
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I don't have to say it.

401
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
In this chaos,

402
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
you don't see any hope?

403
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Just a little bit?

404
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
What kind of bad hope is that?

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
With that little bit,

406
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
you can't give up.

407
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Just like the day

408
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I took you back to Yongxue City.

409
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Didn't you say that

410
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
you would never give up?

411
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Didn't you say that

412
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
you wanted to leave the dark domain

413
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
and live an ordinary life?

414
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's because I believe in you.

415
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
That's why I brought you to Yongxue City.

416
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
Here,

417
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
you can live like an ordinary person.

418
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
You can practice with them.

419
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can have fun.

420
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
You don't have to kill yourself.

421
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
You can drink and be a good man.

422
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
You can believe in yourself.

423
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
But you can't.

424
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
Mu Xuanling,

425
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
you can't see the world for half a day.

426
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
If you have a chance,

427
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll take you to see the real world.

428
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Only love can make a dream come true.

429
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
For love, I'll go through the wind and snow.

430
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll go through the rain and the rain.

431
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I won't give up.

432
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
I'll wait for the day when the pain will stop.

433
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Ten years ago, ten years later,

434
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
you haven't changed at all.

435
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're as silly as before.

436
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You can die for a stranger.

437
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
I have no grudge.

438
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I'm willing to be by your side.

439
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Xie Xuechen,

440
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
has anyone told you

441
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
that you're really a dreamer?

442
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Dreams are so dreamy.

443
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Dream what?

444
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,000
og

445
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,000
Wa Meili,

446
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
I'll leave here so we can look forward to the future together.

447
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
From the first year at a high post,

448
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,000
But it's a pity

449
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,920
that I don't have a future

450
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,880
without you.

451
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,320
Forget it.

452
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,600
This damn world.

453
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
Let's give it another chance.

454
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,880
We've been through six years, but we never met.

455
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:15,160
I'm hoping to spend more time with you.

456
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,240
I'm leaving.

457
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,800
I want to be with you.

458
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,800
See you tomorrow.

459
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,920
I don't want to be apart from you.

460
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,160
I want to spend my life with you.

461
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Xue.

462
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:30,560
What's wrong with you?

463
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,200
Jingran.

464
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,200
He seems to be wrong today.

465
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Forget it.

466
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,200
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

467
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,800
If he's willing to tell me.

468
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,200
The world.

469
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Hope.

470
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Xie Xuechen.

471
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I'll defend the thing you want to defend for you.

472
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,400
Sang Qi won't tell me

473
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,000
where Chiying and Xiu Xiange are.

474
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,800
He must be wary of me.

475
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,400
Then we can only wait for tomorrow.

476
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,800
Chiying will act.

477
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,400
Once it's decided,

478
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,600
I'll find a chance to take him away.

479
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
I'll wait for you.

480
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Take him down.

481
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,400
The ceremony begins.

482
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,600
After my father died,

483
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,600
the Alliance was left without a leader.

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
The people were in trouble.

485
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,600
Now the five sects have decided

486
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,600
to let the one who holds the sword of the Xuan Tian Sect

487
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,400
take the position of the leader.

488
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,200
The one who holds the sword of the sword, please.

489
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,600
The sword of the sword

490
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,600
is the most important thing in the world.

491
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,000
It's the most important thing.

492
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,400
The sword of the sword and the previous leader, Xie Daocheng, are old friends.

493
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,800
I know you care about the people of the world.

494
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,800
You'll keep the Alliance stable and unwavering.

495
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,400
After that, the sword of the sword must be strong.

496
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,200
It must be important to the people of the world.

497
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,400
It must protect the prestige of the Alliance.

498
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
It must keep the Alliance stable.

499
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
On behalf of Yongxue City,

500
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,400
I congratulate the new leader.

501
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,200
Thank you.

502
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,400
I'll open up the Tower of Talismans for you.

503
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,800
Please come with me.

504
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
You can only place the imperial edict in it

505
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
and then turn on the self-defense weapon.

506
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
Then you can obtain the Soul-guarding Bead.

507
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I thought this tower was only used to melt the Soul-guarding Bead.

508
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
I didn't expect that this tower was a weapon.

509
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Yes.

510
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
My father knew that someone had been coveting the Soul-guarding Bead

511
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
and wanted to cause chaos.

512
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:23,000
He used all his life to protect the Soul-guarding Bead.

513
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
He turned the whole tower into a weapon.

514
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
If the soulguard had thought of talking about eating the monster,

515
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
then he could have done the same thing.

516
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
I do not think he would be hungry for the answer for this question.

517
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,500
I believe this answer is correct.

518
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,000
You give three pe gives four,

519
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
and the answer will be one.

520
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,000
But his mother hooks the whole thing into the officials' hands.

521
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
His elder friend now knows that

522
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
He knows that it's just a Dragon Dance Hall.

523
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
If he isn't happy about it,

524
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
I don't think there is anything in the Soul ohh

525
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
until he whom they pay for the FAO.

526
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,800
Junior Sister, look. This is the wonton pig.

527
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,200
This is the first time I've seen it. It's so pretty.

528
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,200
It's indeed an ancient creature.

529
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The wonton pig has left the pig tower.

530
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The enemy is at the bottom of the cliff. This place is not to be left for long.

531
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,000
We will escort the wonton pig back to the Heaven Gate

532
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
and keep it in the Ten Thousand Years' Storage.

533
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
There will be no mistake.

534
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Don't worry, Chief.

535
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Nan Xuyue.

536
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
This is the Nine Heavens' Cloud Formation.

537
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's the formation that Sect Leader Shengnan specially developed for today.

538
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,000
Whether it's the Dark Clan or the Immortal Demon,

539
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
they won't be able to escape.

540
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
City Leader Xie, what do you mean by this?

541
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,000
That day, I went into the outside world to investigate.

542
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:21,340
I saw the

543
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,340
Dark Clan being ambushed in advance.

544
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,640
My father, the Prime Minister, was confined in the

545
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:26,840
Yongxue City's secluded place.

546
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,840
He was killed without a sound.

547
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,840
This proves that the Prime Minister of the Immortal Alliance

548
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,840
was among the highest level of the Immortal Sect.

549
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,840
There are traitors who colluded with the Dark Clan.

550
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
Now that the Dark Clan has invaded,

551
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,840
they can't find their whereabouts.

552
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,840
There must be someone hiding them.

553
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,840
The enemy wants the wonton pig.

554
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,840
Even if the dark soldiers don't move,

555
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
they will still be able to find it.

556
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,840
I'm afraid that the Dark Clan will be able to find it.

557
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
The enemy's forces are still not moving.

558
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,840
They will be here today.

559
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,340
I hope that you and the entire Xuan Tian Sect

560
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:00,340
can read the Yan Sect's will

561
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,340
and help the Dark Clan first.

562
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:04,340
Yan Sect?

563
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Then my demon aura...

564
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
No.

565
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:09,340
I did it on purpose.

566
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:12,340
I'm playing with the sheep again

567
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,340
and I'm being moved by the snake.

568
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,340
If I put it in the dark,

569
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,340
it's also a heart.

570
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,840
You have a point.

571
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
But a few days ago, the Xuan Tian Sect's disciples

572
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
used the Yan Sect's main skill

573
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,840
and they didn't find the Dark Clan.

574
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,840
Now, I'm afraid that the result is still the same.

575
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,840
This is why I asked everyone

576
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,840
to gather here.

577
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
In this bamboo tower,

578
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,840
there is a mirror of the dark clan set by my father.

579
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
You use the bamboo tower as the eye of the eye

580
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
and open the Nine Heavens' Cloud Formation

581
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,840
to increase the power of the Yan Sect several times.

582
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
I hope that you

583
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,340
can read the Yan Sect's will.

584
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,340
Okay.

585
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:06,340
Zhi Yan.

586
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:08,340
You little...

587
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,340
I'm sorry.

588
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,340
I...

589
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,340
Miss Mu.

590
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:50,840
The Taoist priest in our clan is the most stable.

591
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,840
I never thought that I would be invaded by a dark clan like you.

592
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,840
Stable?

593
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,840
The Immortal Alliance has been cultivating Taoism.

594
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,840
I thought that I would be the one who cultivates Taoism.

595
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,840
Wrong.

596
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:03,840
It's all wrong.

597
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
The Taoist priest has the desire to eliminate demons.

598
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,840
But he is still young.

599
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,840
He is still young.

600
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
He is still young.

601
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,840
He is still young.

602
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,840
The Taoist priest has the desire to eliminate demons.

603
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,840
But he is old.

604
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
He is even more worried about his life.

605
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,840
The more he is eager to achieve, the more he is confused.

606
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,840
He has already realized this.

607
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,840
But it's too late.

608
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
He can't stop the demons.

609
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
He can't stop the demons.

610
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,840
You think that you can take the Chaos Bead

611
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
if you control the Taoist priest?

612
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
You think that you can take the Chaos Bead

613
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
if you control the Taoist priest?

614
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
The Taoist priest has 500 years of cultivation.

615
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
He is no match for you.

616
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
But the first one who was cultivating Taoism

617
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
has now lost 40% of his spiritual power.

618
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
But the first one who was cultivating Taoism

619
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
has now lost 40% of his spiritual power.

620
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
I will take the Chaos Bead

621
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
after I eliminate you fools.

622
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Qingyao Chen!

623
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,840
Miss Mo!

624
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
Miss Mo!

625
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Miss Mo!

626
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Miss Mo!

627
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Why is there a sudden movement in the hall?

628
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
Why is there a sudden movement in the hall?

629
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
Yinian, are you okay?

630
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Master Xie, Senior Brother is like a demon.

631
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
I can't stop him.

632
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
The sect leader should be able to deal with him.

633
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
The sect leader should be able to deal with him.

634
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,840
Master Xie, your spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

635
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
You should hide in the tower first.

636
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,840
I can't predict the future.

637
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,840
I can't predict the future.

638
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,840
I can't let the Dark Clan get the Chaos Bead.

639
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
I can't let the Dark Clan get the Chaos Bead.

640
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
I will take the Chaos Bead back to the Xuan Tian Sect.

641
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
The Xuan Tian Sect's ten thousand years of time

642
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
can be used to protect the Chaos Bead.

643
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
can be used to protect the Chaos Bead.

644
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
The owner thinks

645
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
The owner thinks

646
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
the previous king will be defeated

647
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
and that's why he said such a nonsense thing.

648
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
and that's why he said such a nonsense thing.

649
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
Master Xie, what do you mean?

650
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
What do you mean?

651
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
The Sword Master found the Dark Clan

652
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
The Sword Master found the Dark Clan

653
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
and asked Xuan Xing to lead his disciples to search the city with the curse.

654
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
and asked Xuan Xing to lead his disciples to search the city with the curse.

655
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
to prove that he wasn't a demon.

656
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
to prove that he wasn't a demon.

657
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
With the cultivation of Sword Master,

658
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
Chiyin wants to succeed in the restoration.

659
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
but it's not possible.

660
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
then there is only one possibility.

661
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
then there is only one possibility.

662
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
The person with high cultivation will let Chiyin hide

663
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
and then help Chiyin.

664
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Now it seems

665
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
only you can be the master.

666
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,840
Master Xie's spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

667
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Master Xie's spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

668
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,840
It's okay if you guessed it.

669
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,840
You have been suspecting me for a long time.

670
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
It's not like that.

671
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
It's Chiyin's exposure today

672
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
It's Chiyin's exposure today

673
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
that made me contact the Sword Master

674
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
that made me contact the Sword Master

675
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
You guessed it right.

676
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
I talked to him about the Tao last night.

677
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
I talked to him about the Tao last night.

678
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,840
He found out my strange.

679
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
But I was ready to use the magic array to catch him.

680
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
But I was ready to use the magic array to catch him.

681
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Let Chiyin attack

682
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
and control his mind.

683
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
It took a whole night to succeed.

684
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
So

685
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,840
it was you who opened the twin magic array

686
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,840
and let Chiyin enter Yongxue City.

687
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Yes.

688
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,840
It was you who killed my father.

689
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
Why did you kill him?

690
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,840
You should know

691
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,840
that even if he died

692
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,840
he would not have given up the spirit of Yongxue City.

693
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,840
even if he died

694
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,840
he would not have given up the spirit of Yongxue City.

695
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
But he died, so the position of leader was vacant.

696
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,840
The position of leader

697
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,840
is just because of the leader.

698
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,840
Yes.

699
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,840
I want you to be the leader.

700
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
The one who is not willing to be the leader

701
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,840
let Chiyin come back to him

702
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,840
and let him agree.

703
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,840
If you believe

704
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:15,840
he will never agree to be the leader.

705
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I only have this way.

706
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,840
You are a wise man.

707
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Today the Alliance is defeated.

708
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,840
I have the spirit of the twin magic array.

709
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,840
It's better to open the enchantment

710
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,840
and change your name.

711
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,840
You think I am afraid of death?

712
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,840
If you are not afraid of death

713
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
why do you need to tell me so much?

714
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,840
Of course, I want you to say more.

715
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,840
Today I have made this decision

716
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,840
how can I use the real Soul Bead?

717
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,840
When I took the Soul Bead

718
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,840
I prepared a magic wand.

719
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:03,840
Roar.

720
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,840
Roar.

721
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,840
You used the https power as cover

722
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,840
you ol frozen

723
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,840
be in ë§

724
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
Maybe you don't know

725
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
there is only one rope in Yingsou prod antesÑ

726
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,840
It's called landscape pearl.

727
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
Aren't you going to

728
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
let everybody hear our conversation?

729
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,240
You're here to take advantage of the traitor's evil intentions.

730
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
What's the use of being told?

731
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,720
Xie Xuechen's power is not enough.

732
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,520
You guys can't stop me.

733
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,040
Don't waste your time.

734
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,800
Fight quickly.

735
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:47,400
Dad, mom.

736
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,240
Master.

737
