00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,200
The

2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
The

3
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
The

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
The

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
The

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
The

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
The

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
The

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
The

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
The

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
The

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
The

13
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,560
The

14
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
The

15
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,560
The

16
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
The

17
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,200
The

18
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:40,840
The

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
The

20
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,360
The

21
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,360
The

22
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,400
The

23
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,400
The

24
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I

25
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,000
I haven't seen Zhao Ming.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,840
Is he busy?

27
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,520
The time of the Holy Sovereign is the time of the world.

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,800
Of course he's busy.

29
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,080
Didn't you say

30
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,360
you're the most inseparable person in the Holy Sovereign?

31
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
Why are you so idle?

32
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,360
I...

33
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,960
I'm a man of great importance.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,000
What do you mean?

35
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,960
You're...

36
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,160
A man of great importance.

37
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,000
You can't just say it out.

38
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,720
Do you understand?

39
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:32,520
If you're bored,

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,840
I have a way to make you feel better.

41
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,280
Is there anything new?

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,760
Shake your head and make a move.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,400
It's just for fun.

44
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
The rules are simple.

45
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,000
Do you understand?

46
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,440
You'll understand if you say it.

47
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:57,960
But

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,120
you have to use something precious.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
This is the most precious thing I have.

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,440
I can't bear to eat

51
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,600
the peach blossom crisp I had yesterday.

52
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,760
Then I'll use it.

53
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,320
It's too precious.

54
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,280
Just use something ordinary.

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,120
For example,

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,400
the jewelry that Holy Sovereign gave you a few days ago.

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,680
Holy Sovereign,

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,880
you haven't slept for days.

59
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,840
Why don't you go to rest?

60
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,560
It's okay.

61
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,240
He Zhou goes to Linglong Hall every day.

62
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,320
It's no different from the mixed-race pig.

63
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,120
There's no change.

64
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,160
Although it's ancient,

65
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,520
it's now human.

66
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,280
It should be treated as a human.

67
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,720
Yes.

68
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,960
The pig is simple.

69
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,520
He Zhou is honest.

70
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,920
They're suitable for playing.

71
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,120
Come on.

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,160
One small bet, one clear bet.

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,840
Big or small, big or small?

74
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,000
Small. It must be small.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,320
Open it.

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,200
Three, two, one. Open.

77
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,760
You bet small, but you can open it.

78
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,720
These piglets are mine.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,560
How about it? Are you still playing?

80
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,600
Again.

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,640
Again. Again.

82
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
I like your cool personality.

83
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,520
Don't be discouraged.

84
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,720
Play a few more.

85
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll teach you well.

86
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,560
Why don't you teach me?

87
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,160
Holy Sovereign.

88
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,080
Zhao Ming.

89
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,920
A'Zhu.

90
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,480
Sit.

91
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,600
Why is Holy Sovereign here?

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
You don't remind me.

93
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,080
Why don't you go to ask holy things?

94
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:55,880
Eh.

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,640
Can you not think

96
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,120
about your personal matters?

97
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,280
Hurry and go.

98
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,520
Okay.

99
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,400
Come on.

100
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,040
Eat more.

101
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,720
You have a taste.

102
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,600
It's not good to choose a hundred.

103
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:22,640
Go.

104
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,280
Is it enough for my toast?

105
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,140
Don't blame me for not paying the bill constantly.

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,140
ShengQuin really gave me too many!

107
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,100
Let's start.

108
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,660
combining has gone.

109
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,860
Let's stop. Let's stop acting.

110
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,820
A'chu, have you learned this yet?

111
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,240
I haven't learned it yet.

112
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
Let's continue.

113
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,600
Your Majesty,

114
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
you shouldn't bully people like that.

115
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,480
I've already lost to the gods.

116
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,000
It's fine.

117
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,960
The next month's salary

118
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,760
can be transferred to the gambling company.

119
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,040
Didn't you say that gambling is a form of love?

120
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,800
I still want to learn.

121
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Gambling is gambling.

122
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,200
Both gambling and gambling are bad.

123
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
Zhu, don't learn these bad things.

124
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,720
From now on, I, He Zhou, will quit gambling

125
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,560
and never gamble with Zhu again.

126
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,680
A Yan,

127
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,400
pass my order.

128
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,920
From now on,

129
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,640
you are grounded in the palace.

130
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:30,920
Yes.

131
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,000
You may leave.

132
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,120
Yes.

133
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,080
I'm sorry.

134
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm sorry.

135
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,200
I'm sorry.

136
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,680
I'm sorry.

137
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,200
I'm sorry.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,720
I'm sorry.

139
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,200
I'm sorry.

140
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,200
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:45,680
I'm sorry.

143
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,200
I'm sorry.

144
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:47,560
OK.

146
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,440
Look...

147
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
It's still not Tyler who is after S Whoa directamente.

148
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,940
It's still not Tyler who is after S Whoa directly.,

149
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,120
but S Whoa just has the same method.

150
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,320
but S credited before S Reed.

151
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,480
but S removes his SEEK when he's helping S.

152
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:53,720
Byingly black smoke andnak patch.

153
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:53,800
But S just plays the same method.

154
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:53,960
But S just plays the same method.

155
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,160
My house just got separated after S.

156
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,080
I'm sorry.

157
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,960
I'm sorry.

158
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:57,600
You can leave.

159
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,200
Aren't you tired now?

160
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:58,600
Aren't you tired now?

161
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,080
She ses Pa- solo

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,880
can see silicosis and

163
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,560
terror.

164
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:10,040
See?

165
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,040
I'm fine.

166
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,520
I'm fine.

167
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:11,880
You're really fine.

168
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,560
He is innocent.

169
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,560
It's hard for me to see you.

170
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,280
But I'm not used to it.

171
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,760
I was careless.

172
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
You just became a human.

173
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,240
You must have many problems.

174
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
But if you stay with He Zhou for a long time,

175
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
I'm afraid he will beat you.

176
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
I'll find a teacher for you.

177
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Let him teach you to read and write.

178
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Is that okay?

179
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
Teacher?

180
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
The sun and the moon are bright and bright.

181
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,640
It's good for the spiritual elixir.

182
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,640
But it's not good for the people.

183
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:17,960
I found that there is another essence in the world recently.

184
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
It can help the elixir to be absorbed quickly.

185
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,360
Teacher.

186
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,560
I'm late.

187
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,560
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

188
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's okay.

189
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,960
I'll wait for you.

190
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,760
It's good to wait.

191
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Zhaoming said that you are the most original person in Dong Ze.

192
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
And you are the one who taught Zhu.

193
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,960
Thank you.

194
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
You don't have to be so polite.

195
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,960
It's a little embarrassing.

196
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I'm relieved that you said that.

197
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
It's all because He Zhou has been scaring me.

198
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
He said he would attack and kill me.

199
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
Otherwise, he would be beaten by the teacher with a sword.

200
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:21,960
But I think you make me feel very close.

201
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,960
How do you say that word?

202
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,960
A sword is like a bow.

203
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
A sword is like a bow?

204
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:45,960
Do you remember a friend or a brother?

205
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
You are kidding.

206
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
I'm just a pearl of Zhaoming.

207
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
How can I have a friend?

208
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Let's start the class.

209
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,960
I'll teach you some basic words today.

210
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Okay.

211
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,920
This word is also your identity.

212
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
Human?

213
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
This word is simple and easy to remember.

214
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,880
This word is the word of God.

215
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
But remember this.

216
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,880
God is two rows higher than man.

217
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,880
One row is higher than man.

218
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,880
One row is trapped.

219
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
God?

220
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Why are you so arrogant?

221
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,880
This is the order of the world.

222
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,880
God is always higher.

223
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,880
God is always higher.

224
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,880
God is always higher.

225
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,880
God is always higher.

226
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,840
God is always higher than man.

227
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,840
Man is inferior to God.

228
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,840
I don't like God.

229
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,840
God makes people suffer.

230
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,840
And I have no time to accompany Zhaoming.

231
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:10,840
The company of human is needed for decades.

232
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,840
Only the one in heaven can be with God.

233
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,800
That kind of company is eternal.

234
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,800
But it doesn't matter how long it takes.

235
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
If two people stay together and feel unhappy,

236
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,800
that kind of company is painful.

237
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,800
State Preceptor.

238
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
This is the dessert I learned from Master Shunfang.

239
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
I brought it here to try it.

240
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,800
State Preceptor, why are you angry today?

241
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
Do you think I'm too slow to learn?

242
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,800
Do you think I'm stupid?

243
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
I'm not stupid.

244
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,800
I'm not stupid.

245
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm not stupid.

246
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:18,760
I'm not angry.

247
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,760
You are smart and you can understand it.

248
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,760
How can you be stupid?

249
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,760
It's good that you are not angry.

250
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,760
Will you teach me the ten characters tomorrow?

251
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,760
It's good to have simple and pure happiness.

252
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,760
Open it.

253
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,760
This jade brush is for you.

254
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,760
The heaven is free, but the person only writes his own fate.

255
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
Thank you, State Preceptor.

256
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,760
I'll go back first.

257
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
State Preceptor, remember to eat snacks.

258
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
I'll go back first.

259
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,760
I'll go back first.

260
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Why did you bring these things?

261
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Why do people use flowers in different occasions?

262
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Wedding, wedding, wedding, worship, and divine spirit.

263
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
It seems that they are not the same thing.

264
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
But they use the same flowers to remember the love.

265
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,760
Flowers are not black and white in our eyes.

266
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,760
It's just that the shape is slightly different.

267
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,760
But in the eyes of the world,

268
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,760
flowers are bigger than flowers.

269
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,720
The colors are different.

270
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Each has its own meaning.

271
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,720
Every time I look at the world from the sea,

272
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,720
I see that as long as the children eat it,

273
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
they will smile.

274
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
A piece of cake can be happy.

275
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,720
You and I can't feel it.

276
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,720
For you and me,

277
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,720
no food has any taste.

278
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,720
We have never tasted sour and sweet.

279
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
There will be no attachment.

280
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
Why should we feel hurt?

281
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Although so,

282
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
we never have it, so we don't have to feel sorry.

283
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
You and I are the divine devices.

284
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
Although we are born in the same sky,

285
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
we are all worshiped by the gods,

286
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
we are just tools of God.

287
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
It's not as wonderful as living.

288
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
God gives us divine power.

289
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
He doesn't allow us to be biased.

290
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
And we can't be biased against anything.

291
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
Since we have something,

292
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,640
we are destined to lose something.

293
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,640
But we can't taste the flavor,

294
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
see the color,

295
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
smell the fragrance,

296
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,640
and know the feeling.

297
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,640
These tens of thousands of years

298
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,640
are meaningless.

299
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,640
Heavenly fate, don't you feel bored?

300
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
Everything in the world has its consequences.

301
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,640
This is the price of the divine devices.

302
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Will this be the case

303
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
for thousands of years

304
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,640
and millions of years?

305
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
It must be.

306
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,640
Finally, it's sweet.

307
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,680
Master,

308
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:56,680
Miss Zhu said it was her first time to make cakes.

309
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:58,680
How does it taste?

310
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,680
Very sweet.

311
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,680
But Miss Zhu said

312
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,680
it was a waste of time.

313
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,680
Really?

314
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,680
The recipe is very special.

315
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,680
It's passed down from my hometown.

316
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,680
It's from your hometown.

317
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,680
No wonder you pay so much attention.

318
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,680
Here, try it.

319
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,680
Thank you, Master.

320
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
After tasting the cakes,

321
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,680
I suddenly miss home.

322
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,680
Luckily, there are many people in the palace

323
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,680
who can help me.

324
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,680
I can also be your companion.

325
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,680
Zichen,

326
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,680
I have a question.

327
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
I don't dare.

328
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,680
You are my brother.

329
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,680
I don't dare to ask you.

330
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,680
You can ask me.

331
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,680
If you have a friend,

332
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,680
you should take him back to your hometown.

333
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,680
But it's full of ups and downs.

334
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,680
It's full of ups and downs.

335
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,680
No freedom.

336
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,680
No happiness.

337
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,680
He even

338
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,680
faces the fate of sacrifice.

339
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
If so,

340
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,680
will you take him back to your hometown?

341
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:48,680
It should be a happy life.

342
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:52,680
If it's not a happy life,

343
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,680
I won't go back.

344
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,680
But...

345
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,680
But...

346
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Did I say something wrong?

347
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,680
It's okay.

348
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,680
Leave.

349
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
Yes.

350
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,680
Then...

351
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,680
I'll leave.

352
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,680
I'll leave.

353
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
I'll leave.

354
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,680
I'll leave.

355
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,680
I'll leave.

356
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,680
Cake.

357
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,680
Thank you, State Preceptor.

358
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Zhang Ming, you are here.

359
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,680
I haven't seen you for a few days.

360
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,680
I'm here to see how your homework is.

361
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,680
I'm working hard.

362
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,680
This is the new word I learned.

363
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,680
The state preceptor said

364
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,680
the sun and the moon are both bright.

365
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,680
The state preceptor's teaching is good.

366
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,680
But my understanding

367
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
is not like that.

368
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,680
I'm not a good teacher.

369
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,680
But my understanding is not like that.

370
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,680
The sun is bright like the sun.

371
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,680
The moon is gentle like the moon.

372
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,680
The sun and the moon are combined.

373
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,680
It's Zhang Ming's name.

374
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,680
Your solution is reasonable.

375
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
Then what do you think of my handwriting?

376
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,680
Your handwriting is good.

377
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,680
But

378
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,680
it's a bit far away.

379
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
Far away?

380
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,680
Then it's better to be closer.

381
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,680
Zhang Ming,

382
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,680
am I a red rock?

383
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,680
Then I'll lose my life.

384
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,680
I heard that red rocks lose their lives.

385
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:30,680
No.

386
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,680
Zhu will live longer.

387
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Longer than me.

388
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,680
Longer than you?

389
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,680
What's the point?

390
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,680
I'm not a red rock.

391
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
What's the point?

392
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,680
I'm the pearl of Zhang Ming.

393
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:46,680
I have to be with you forever.

394
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,680
I'm here for you.

395
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,680
Right?

396
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,680
No. Zhu doesn't live for Zhang Ming.

397
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,680
Your meaning

398
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,680
doesn't exist because of Zhang Ming.

399
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,680
Time goes by.

400
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Time goes by.

401
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,680
One day,

402
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,680
you'll find what you want to do.

403
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,680
What you want to do?

404
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
What I want to do?

405
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,680
What I want to do?

406
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,680
It doesn't matter.

407
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,680
Don't think about it now.

408
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,680
The future is in your hands.

409
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,680
I don't know

410
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,680
what I want to do.

411
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,680
But I know yours.

412
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,680
Zhang Ming is the king.

413
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,680
He cares about the world.

414
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,680
So

415
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,680
the king knows.

416
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:38,680
I don't want the king to know.

417
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,680
What I want to do

418
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,680
is to be the man who can

419
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,680
protect the people

420
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,680
and break through the sky.

421
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,680
The state preceptor said

422
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,680
the sky is more balanced than the people.

423
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,680
It's trapped.

424
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,680
But in your majesty,

425
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,680
the man can break through the sky?

426
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,680
It depends on the person.

427
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Zhang Ming,

428
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,680
I don't understand

429
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,680
what a man is.

430
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,680
A man is simple

431
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,680
and complicated.

432
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,680
He may look simple

433
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
but he can be very advanced.

434
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,680
You can't understand it with just one paper.

435
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
You need to look at the person with your heart.

436
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Heart?

437
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,680
You need to look at a person.

438
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,680
Not only his appearance.

439
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
But also his inner self.

440
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,680
What he said.

441
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,680
What he did.

442
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,680
His position.

443
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,680
His system.

444
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,680
How he treats himself.

445
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,680
And how he treats others.

446
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,680
His style in the mirror.

447
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,680
And his choice in the mirror.

448
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
A man

449
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,680
can't be explained with just a few words.

450
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
If you want to know,

451
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,680
I'll show you in the future.

452
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
Yes.

453
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,680
Your majesty,

454
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,680
we've been searching for a long time.

455
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,680
But we still can't find the god.

456
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,680
The information we've got is limited.

457
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,680
It's hard to find it.

458
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,680
It's hard to find it.

459
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,680
I think

460
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:48,680
even if we can find the god,

461
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
we can't fight against the god?

462
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,680
The will of the heaven is clear.

463
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,680
Everything is in the right place.

464
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,680
The god will be here.

465
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,680
I'm sorry.

466
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,680
I failed you.

467
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,680
But you still want to fight?

468
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,680
Please don't be angry.

469
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,680
We've traveled to many countries.

470
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,680
We've got many things.

471
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,680
Dongze is the leader of the world.

472
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
All the countries and tribes

473
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
are under his control.

474
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,680
Dongze's king, Zhaoming,

475
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,680
is a man of great talent.

476
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
He's extraordinary.

477
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
I think the god's king

478
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,680
is very useful in finding the god.

479
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,680
I have a conclusion

480
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,680
about the god's prophecy.

481
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,680
The so-called god's egg,

482
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,680
maybe ten years ago,

483
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,680
when the will of the heaven came down,

484
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,680
it was the moment of the god's birth.

485
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,680
Why don't we

486
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,680
start from the child born in that year?

487
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
It makes sense.

488
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
You keep searching.

489
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:54,680
You keep searching.

490
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,680
When the will of the heaven came down to Dongze,

491
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Zhaoming

492
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,680
gave birth to a child.

493
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
But the god's king,

494
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,680
there were so many children born in that year.

495
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
If

496
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,680
there were no god's children,

497
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,680
they would all be killed.

498
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,680
One child is not enough.

499
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,680
In the year of the first king,

500
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,680
there were three thousand children born in the sea of yin.

501
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Three thousand children

502
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
were called gods.

503
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,680
Mr. Gu,

504
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,680
this is the god's prophecy that just came down.

505
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
The year of Cang Hao.

506
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,680
Isn't that ten years ago?

507
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,680
That year,

508
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
the sky broke a big hole.

509
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
The human race was in danger.

510
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,680
The old king was also

511
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
killed in that disaster.

512
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,680
Mr. Gu,

513
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
what should we do now?

514
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,680
As a state preceptor,

515
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
I should report to the god's king

516
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,680
and decide

517
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,680
the matter of the god's king.

518
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,680
Ridiculous!

519
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,680
The god's clan doesn't even let go of the child.

520
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,680
In the name of the god's world,

521
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,680
when the human race is in danger,

522
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,680
the so-called god's will

523
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,680
will take away three thousand lives.

524
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,680
I, Zhaoming,

525
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,680
will never reject the god's clan.

526
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,680
Please destroy the armor.

527
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,680
From today on,

528
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
I won't take any god's will.

529
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,680
Your majesty,

530
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,680
have you thought it through?

531
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,680
The god's clan is not kind.

532
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,680
It's already been destroyed.

533
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,680
Now,

534
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,680
we must find a way to fight against the god's clan.

535
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,680
The human god's power is limited.

536
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
It's not easy to fight against the god

537
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,680
with a human.

538
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,680
But I believe

539
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,680
that human will be more powerful.

540
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Then I wish you

541
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,680
to achieve your dream.

542
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,680
What are you doing?

543
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,680
You scared me again.

544
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,680
I'm just a little scared.

545
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,680
I'm not scared of you.

546
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,680
You bought me a new book so quickly?

547
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
I've been through many things.

548
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,680
I spent a lot of effort to buy this book.

549
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,680
So,

550
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,680
I have to pay the price at home.

551
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,680
I think

552
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
your skill is good.

553
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,680
I've already paid you for the book.

554
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,680
You want to trick me again.

555
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,680
Who told you to learn so fast?

556
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,680
You read three books a day.

557
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
I have to run fast.

558
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,680
Besides,

559
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
this book

560
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,680
is different from the myth you read before.

561
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,680
These books

562
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
are about love.

563
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,680
Love?

564
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Have you had your meal?

565
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,680
Do you want to hear the story?

566
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,680
Yes.

567
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,680
Today's story

568
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,680
is very suitable for you.

569
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,680
It's about

570
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
a daughter who is in need of a family.

571
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,680
She is in love with a prince

572
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,680
who is in trouble.

573
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,680
She becomes the princess.

574
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,680
Next,

575
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,680
let's invite many people in the palace

576
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
to tell the story.

577
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,680
Great.

578
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
Great.

579
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,680
A long time ago,

580
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
a kind lady

581
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
went out to fish.

582
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,680
She saved a man who was injured.

583
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,680
The lady's sister found out

584
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,680
and told her

585
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
not to pick up a man

586
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,680
and go home.

587
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Especially a man who was injured

588
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,680
because he was in trouble.

589
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,680
She said

590
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,680
this man was not fake.

591
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,680
He was caught in the sea.

592
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,680
Zhu was always

593
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,680
full of laughter.

594
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,680
After she came,

595
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
the original Changming Palace

596
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,680
became lively.

597
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,680
Yes.

598
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,680
The servants all like her.

599
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
You should go in and see.

600
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,680
If I go in,

601
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,680
they won't be able to play.

602
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,680
Go to do the formalities.

603
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,680
I've been looking for

604
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,680
the way to fight against the gods

605
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,680
for years.

606
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
I heard that only those

607
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
who are higher than gods

608
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680
can suppress the gods.

609
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,680
One is the ancient gods

610
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
Tianming Shu and Chaos Bead.

611
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
The other

612
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,680
is the Heaven's Sword

613
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
and the Soul of the God.

614
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,680
The two

615
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:34,680
are the gods

616
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,680
and the gods.

617
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
When the Heaven and Earth first opened,

618
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
the Heaven's Sword was

619
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,680
in a state of chaos.

620
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
You've searched

621
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,680
the map three times.

622
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,680
The final destination is empty.

623
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,680
There's no sword.

624
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Could it be

625
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,680
that the map is wrong?

626
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
No.

627
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
The map is real.

628
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Every time I find the final destination,

629
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,680
I can feel the strong sword power.

630
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,680
Maybe it's just the wrong way

631
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
that makes the Heaven's Sword not able to appear.

632
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,680
A Yan,

633
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,680
go find some top archers

634
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
to see if there's a new discovery.

635
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
Yes.

636
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,680
If the human body can't find the Heaven's Sword,

637
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
will you really not consider

638
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,680
using the Chaos Bead to fight against the gods?

639
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,680
The Chaos Bead has been

640
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,680
in the Heaven's Sword for a lifetime.

641
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
It has already been

642
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,680
the responsibility of the world.

643
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Now, to preserve the soul,

644
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,680
let the A'Zhu

645
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,680
live a simple and happy life.

646
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
As for fighting against the gods,

647
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,680
it should be my responsibility.

648
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,680
Moreover,

649
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,680
if the gods

650
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
are scared by the human world,

651
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
the power of the gods will be threatened.

652
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,680
Even if the world is in a bad shape,

653
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,680
I can still fight against them

654
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
with my power.

655
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
But you have lost a bloodstain.

656
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,680
I have to use my own method.

657
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,680
Just a bloodstain.

658
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,680
I'm not that weak yet.

659
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,680
How dare you

660
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
destroy the domain of the gods?

661
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Why don't you just let me kill him?

662
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,680
If you can just kill him,

663
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
why wait until now?

664
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,680
Zhao Ming is born with a divine aura.

665
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,680
He is the only one

666
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,680
who can cultivate divine power.

667
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
He is the ruler of the world.

668
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
He is treated by the human race.

669
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
He has the unbreakable will of the human king.

670
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,680
He can't

671
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:58,680
kill him directly.

672
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Moreover, the heaven is good.

673
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,680
If you lose your divine power in the human world,

674
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,680
your power will be greatly weakened.

675
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,680
All mortals have their own wishes.

676
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,680
Zhao Ming must have his own weakness.

677
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,680
Zhao Ming's weakness

678
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,680
is not in himself,

679
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,680
but in the world's peace.

680
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
He doesn't have the divine aura.

681
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,680
Do other countries

682
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,680
dare not obey the divine aura?

683
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Why don't you use a skill to

684
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,680
stir up the water in the human world?

685
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,680
The world is in turmoil.

686
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,680
I'd like to see how Zhao Ming

687
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,680
can control the human body.

688
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,680
That's right.

689
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,680
We are all gods of the heart.

690
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,680
We are the best at controlling people's hearts.

691
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,680
If the divine aura is lowered in all countries,

692
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:44,680
and they are seduced to fight for resources,

693
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,680
the war will start.

694
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,680
All mortals

695
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
will die in the war.

696
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,680
How dare Zhao Ming not obey?

697
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
Then do it right away.

698
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,680
I want to see Zhao Ming's

699
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,680
aura broken,

700
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,680
and the human body subdued.

701
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,680
In half a month,

702
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
all countries will start a war at the same time.

703
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
There must be something wrong.

704
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,680
Yes.

705
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,680
The West Shrine State, which has never been in war,

706
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,680
is also in turmoil.

707
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,680
How is the situation at the eastern border?

708
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:18,680
After the Holy Ruler ordered,

709
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,680
the border soldiers have been raised.

710
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,680
It's just that the people of the Great Liang

711
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:24,680
have escaped from the same punishment.

712
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,680
The pressure is much greater.

713
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:36,680
The world is one body.

714
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,680
There is no difference between you and me.

715
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,680
He Zhou,

716
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
pass on the order.

717
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
Take good care of these refugees.

718
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,680
In addition,

719
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:48,680
from today,

720
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,680
from Changming Hall,

721
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
the use of the ship is reduced.

722
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,680
It is used to support refugees.

723
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,680
A Yan, you need to investigate this matter quickly.

724
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,680
Find out the reason behind it.

725
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
Yes.

726
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
Go, go, go.

727
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
anti- exacerbation

728
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,680
Come in.

729
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,680
Doctor

730
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,680
Why are you here?

731
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,680
Can you tell me

732
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
the past

733
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,120
I'm afraid you can't tell.

734
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Why?

735
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,600
Although Zhang Ming is gentle and kind,

736
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:58,560
he always has this kind of feeling.

737
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Until recently,

738
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
he even has melancholy in his smile.

739
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,160
It seems that there is a invisible lock

740
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,480
that is holding him.

741
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,040
So I want to know

742
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,320
what he has experienced

743
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,200
and what he is carrying on his back.

744
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,320
The story of Dong Ze's dynasty is recorded in it.

745
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
It's also the story of Zhao Ming.

746
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,800
Ten years ago,

747
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,920
the old king of Dong Ze died in the Heaven Realm.

748
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,080
When Zhao Ming was a young man,

749
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,360
he took on the responsibility of the whole country.

750
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,480
He was born to be a man of power.

751
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,480
He was brave and good at fighting.

752
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,200
Before he was crowned, he led the army to fight.

753
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,840
He was able to pacify the enemies of all the countries

754
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,480
and stabilize Dong Ze.

755
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,080
Zhao Ming was loyal to the people

756
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,600
and was loved by the people.

757
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,440
He was the most respected person in the world.

758
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,720
Everyone called him the Holy King.

759
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,000
When the human race was controlled by the gods,

760
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,520
Zhao Ming made a vow

761
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,280
to sacrifice his life

762
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,520
to protect the people.

763
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:10,760
So

764
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,680
the lock that was holding him was not a lock.

765
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,120
It was everyone in the world.

766
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,040
Everyone called him the Holy King.

767
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,680
But the reputation of the gods

768
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
was based on his respect and support.

769
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,360
Everyone relied on him.

770
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,240
But who could he rely on?

771
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,080
He must be very tired.

772
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,320
Compared to the Holy King,

773
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,440
I want to keep calling him Zhao Ming.

774
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,760
The Zhao Ming that belongs to him.

775
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,640
Everyone should pay for their decisions.

776
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:53,080
This is the fate he chose.

777
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:54,480
Fate?

778
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,080
Today,

779
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,400
I will teach you how to call the character Zhao.

780
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,160
Zhao.

781
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,360
The left is the sun.

782
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,960
The sun is the sky.

783
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,360
It takes care of the people.

784
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:10,920
The top is the knife.

785
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,520
The bottom is the mouth.

786
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,200
The knife is the mouth.

787
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,800
The knife is the mouth.

788
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,320
You mean

789
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
Zhao Ming will die?

790
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,240
The Holy King is born with a divine aura.

791
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,160
He should be with the heaven and earth.

792
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,600
How can he die?

793
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,520
Today, I said too much.

794
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,760
Fate is mysterious.

795
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,480
It's not something that you and I can see through.

796
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,920
You scared me.

797
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,040
It's good that you're fine.

798
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:43,640
You're a good scholar.

799
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,280
I don't understand what you're saying.

800
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,960
I have another question

801
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,480
for you.

802
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,240
Go ahead.

803
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,680
What is love?

804
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,680
In the book,

805
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,560
the bridge husband and the goddess are in love.

806
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,560
Even if they become stone,

807
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,040
they can never be together.

808
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,520
They have no regrets.

809
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:08,040
I want to know what love is.

810
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,200
Is love a desire or a motivation?

811
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,160
What do you think is love?

812
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,360
Why can people be in love

813
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,280
and live happily

814
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,640
and warmly?

815
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,280
If we can have love,

816
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,760
wouldn't the altar

817
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
be so quiet?

818
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,440
We are both gods.

819
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,280
We should follow the good heaven.

820
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,120
The process of asking love

821
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,480
is the process of being destroyed.

822
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:42,840
Okay.

823
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,360
I won't ask.

824
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,360
You're by my side.

825
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,200
The sun and the moon are in the shade.

826
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,000
The universe is in a panic.

827
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,400
We will be together

828
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,440
as the destiny says.

829
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I don't know what love is.

830
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,560
I only know that

831
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,840
it should belong to the world.

832
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,880
It shouldn't belong to the world.

833
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,480
It should belong to the goddess.

834
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,680
Goddess and love

835
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,040
will be punished by heaven.

836
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,280
It seems that

837
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,360
the goddess is not easy to be.

838
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,440
Maybe

839
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,720
you are also a fairy bead

840
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:36,240
that fell from the sky.

841
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,760
How could I be a fairy bead?

842
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,880
I'm just a ordinary bead

843
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,120
in Zhaoming's hands.

844
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,320
As long as I can see it every day

845
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,360
and accompany it,

846
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,320
I will be very happy.

847
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,840
But you are a bead.

848
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,360
She is a human.

849
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,800
You are destined to be separated one day.

850
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,720
No.

851
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,000
Look.

852
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,240
In the book,

853
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,120
Qiao Fu has become a stone.

854
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,600
But she still loves the goddess.

855
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,280
There is nothing that can really separate them.

856
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,520
Just like me and Zhaoming.

857
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,960
As long as I think of her all the time,

858
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,720
we will never be separated.

859
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,680
No matter what happens,

860
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,640
Zhu will always be with Zhaoming.

861
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:26,720
Forever?

862
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,200
How could this be possible?

863
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,940
love has left behind the bleak memories

864
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,780
Please go with me and soulful like the renovation of this f почти civilised world

865
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,120
This smoother surfaceض

866
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,460
it seems since there's nothing extra in my belly

867
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:34,540
I sleep it little but there's nourishment

868
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:37,000
can you still unearth my beautiful smile

869
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,500
Zhao anthem, this is your holy war requirements

870
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,980
Sleep well for the whole night.

871
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,900
If you see the snake, just hate it.

872
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,380
Look at the watchers in your dream sweet eyes

873
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,300
Sorry, sorry

874
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:58,660
Shaking in my dreams

875
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,760
The past of you can leave me

876
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,900
Like the each of unite lotus obstacles

877
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,160
就像雪온我要求你

878
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:21,100
the star Uh

879
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,100
Uh

880
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,600
Bai people think of the truth

881
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,880
They just don't want to do it

882
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,720
I don't know why

883
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
As long as you are by my side

884
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:00,280
Everything is very tender

885
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,040
I am able to stay calm

886
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:43,160
Can you still not know how tired you are

887
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:46,160
Because the heart has a thought

888
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,160
The love is still a dream

889
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,160
How far is the journey

890
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,160
For love, the snow is thin

891
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Pass through the six years, not giving up

892
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:05,160
I look forward to the day when the peach blossoms bloom

893
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Look at that person, a dream

894
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Give me nothing to do

895
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,160
No regrets in this life

896
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:19,160
Accompany you

897
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,160
Love, the snow is thin

898
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:41,160
Pass through the six years, not giving up

899
00:45:41,160 --> 00:45:47,160
I look forward to the day when the peach blossoms bloom

900
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Look at that person, a dream

901
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,160
Give me nothing to do

902
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,160
No regrets in this life

903
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,160
Accompany you

904
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,160
No regrets in this life

905
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:08,160
Accompany you in this life
