The

00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
The

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
The

00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200

The

00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
The

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,000
Xie Li

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Episode 06

15
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,520
Let go of him.

16
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,720
I'll bring Anyu back.

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,880
Staying in this mortal realm for a long time

18
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,160
is just not a lot of power learning,

19
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,200
nepotism even supporters

20
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,520
has萧

21
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,200
He's not one

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,220
who peel the

23
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,920
eviliscreep off

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,980
or kill him.

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,000
It doesn't matter,

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,760
There's no need to hurt the relationship between you and me

27
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,600
for someone who is irrelevant.

28
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,480
I hate it when someone does something behind my back.

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,920
Master, don't kill him.

30
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,720
Please.

31
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,400
You want to move the old soldiers, right?

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,040
I'll do it.

33
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,640
Sang Qi.

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,480
When can I handle it killer?

35
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,360
Hatena's

36
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,800
Evenung is

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,040
right now.

38
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,120
Sing.

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,120
Master Jian, is Sang Qi coming?

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,120
You're just in time.

41
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Sang Qi is also coming.

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
We can't let him enter the city.

43
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll deal with him.

44
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,120
Zhu Tang, thank you for your help.

45
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,120
Be careful.

46
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Why didn't Song Ning Zhen come?

47
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Leave him alone.

48
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,120
Protect Zhu Tang.

49
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
What do you want?

50
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,120
Xie Xue Chen.

51
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,120
We meet again.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,120
I wonder what your feeling is

53
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,120
after you broke into Snowblade City.

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,120
I'm here to take back my beloved disciple.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,120
Then you can't do as you wish.

56
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Mu Xuan Ling is now my disciple.

57
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,120
I didn't agree to let her change her sect.

58
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,120
Go.

59
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Master Xie,

60
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,120
I've spent a lot of time

61
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
to set up this sand formation.

62
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Now,

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,120
do you want to fight with me

64
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,120
or save those miserable people?

65
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Mu Xuan Ling,

66
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
wait for me.

67
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,120
You saw her leaving.

68
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,120
She abandoned her people

69
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,120
for her sake.

70
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,120
That's why you're willing to fight with me.

71
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm willing to fight with you.

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,120
But it's not worth it

73
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
to break your heart.

74
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,120
You don't understand me.

75
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,120
You don't understand her.

76
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,120
I don't need to understand the one who's about to die.

77
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,120
A man's strength can only be self-reliant.

78
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
No matter how well he pretends,

79
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
he can't change the fact that he's injured.

80
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,120
If you want to win,

81
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
you have to try your best.

82
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,120
Xie Xue Chen.

83
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,120
Sang Qi's power is so powerful.

84
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,120
If the evil spirit sand formation doesn't take Snowblade City,

85
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
it won't destroy Zhang Du Cheng.

86
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,120
I wonder if Xie Cheng Chu can still hold back.

87
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
I don't know if he can hold back.

88
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,120
But you guys

89
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,120
can't hold back.

90
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,120
Who are you?

91
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
The one who took the beads.

92
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,120
Xie Cheng Chu,

93
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,120
you want to keep her so badly.

94
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,120
Are you really in love with her?

95
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
But I'm afraid you don't know yet.

96
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
The moment I approached you,

97
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,120
I had a different feeling from the beginning.

98
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
People always say that

99
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
the dark clan is born to be evil.

100
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
The spirit clan is good at deceiving people.

101
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Actually,

102
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,120
you're right.

103
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
I definitely didn't tell you

104
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
that I allowed her

105
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,120
to save Rong Yuan.

106
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Don't you believe it?

107
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,120
The half-day fire you took

108
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,120
was given to her by me.

109
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,120
There's only one in the world.

110
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,120
Rong Yuan can't hold back.

111
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,120
It won't work even if she's locked up for a long time.

112
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
Master,

113
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,120
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,120
I'm sorry.

115
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,120
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,120
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,120
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:45,120
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
I'm sorry.

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,120
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,120
I'm sorry.

122
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,120
Master,

124
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,120
why don't you try my method?

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,120
Tell me.

126
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,120
Save her,

127
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,120
follow her,

128
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,120
get close to her,

129
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,120
and help her put down the guard.

130
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,120
Take the opportunity to get the Soul-guard Bead

131
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,120
and destroy the immortal dream.

132
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Take half a day's fire

133
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,120
for the sake of Xie Xue Chen's life.

134
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,120
Don't you want your own life?

135
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
How is it possible?

136
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
The spirit clan has been ordered for thousands of years.

137
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,120
Flowers are the world.

138
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,120
There are thousands of men.

139
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,120
How could I die for a mere Xie Xue Chen?

140
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,120
But I'll just play with her.

141
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
Master, don't worry.

142
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,120
I will complete the task.

143
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,120
Take back the Soul-guard Bead

144
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,120
and kill Xie Xue Chen.

145
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,120
If you keep playing,

146
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,120
you will die.

147
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,740
The

148
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,120
Soul-guard Bead

149
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
is completed.

150
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Don't try so hard.

151
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,120
You can suffer less.

152
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,120
Xie Xue Chen!

153
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,120
The Xie family in Snowblade City

154
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,120
has a

155
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,120
biased view.

156
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,120
But in my opinion,

157
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,120
they are just crazy about the pulse of the city.

158
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,120
They won't lose.

159
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
They won't lose.

160
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,120
They won't lose.

161
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
They won't lose.

162
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
They won't lose.

163
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
They won't lose.

164
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,120
Ling Er,

165
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,120
we should go.

166
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,120
Ling Er,

167
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,120
Ling Er.

168
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,120
Let's go.

169
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,120
Let's go.

170
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,120
Go.

171
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,120
Let's go.

172
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,120
Lord Xie

173
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,120
seems to have made a lot of sacrifices.

174
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,120
Lord Xie.

175
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,260
I'm still here ,

176
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,940
lying.

177
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,440
Sir,

178
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,700
I want to dig up the body you came up with

179
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,320
and maintain you with the ranked 6.

180
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,180
I'll leave the rest to you.

181
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,280
No.

182
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,920
You mustising malice

183
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,960
can't everyone have the same feelings?

184
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,380
independent justice

185
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,000
can't be the tied-up relationship.

186
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,060
You know the law of justice.

187
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:09,800
You...

188
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,520
Princess Xie,

189
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,120
do you want to fight again?

190
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,120
You're badly injured.

191
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,600
If you keep fighting,

192
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,880
you'll really die.

193
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
Because my Ling'er

194
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,520
wants to fight with me.

195
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,000
Is it worth it?

196
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,880
Mu Xue Ling has made three contributions to the Demon Realm.

197
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,000
She has nothing to do with An Yu.

198
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,320
She is my disciple of Yong Xue Cheng.

199
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,080
When the flowers bloom,

200
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,600
I'll be with you.

201
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,320
When the fireflies are gone,

202
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,200
I'll be with you.

203
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,600
I'll be with you.

204
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:55,280
I'll be with you forever.

205
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,000
Enough!

206
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:56,920
Jian Xue Chen!

207
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,400
Don't come any closer!

208
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,560
Zi Yuan pond!

209
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,840
Come with me!

210
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,800
I said enough.

211
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
Don't you understand?

212
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,040
I've already told you the truth.

213
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
What's wrong?

214
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,000
You don't want to believe me?

215
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,200
Tell me the truth.

216
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,120
I've been into your play for a long time.

217
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,120
I'm tired of it.

218
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,400
I'm a saintess.

219
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,320
Why do you think I'd want to stay in Snowblade City?

220
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,000
I'm tired of it.

221
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,400
I'm tired of it.

222
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,800
I'm tired of it.

223
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,200
I'm tired of it.

224
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,200
I'm tired of it.

225
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
I'd rather stay in Snowblade City

226
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,160
and be a low-class sweeper

227
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,760
and let you guys do whatever you want.

228
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,440
No.

229
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,680
This isn't what I meant.

230
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,400
Xie Xuechen.

231
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,520
You think too much.

232
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm just playing with you

233
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,720
as a substitute for my elder brother.

234
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,600
I wanted to see

235
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:37,120
the son of the Heaven and the Earth falling into the net of love.

236
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
But now,

237
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,840
I find it a bit boring.

238
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,600
It's just like ordinary people.

239
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,600
They're trapped in love

240
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,520
and are entangled.

241
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,240
You're badly injured.

242
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,720
How could you be my master

243
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,520
and my opponent?

244
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,240
Xie Xuechen.

245
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,800
I won't kill you

246
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,760
because you're protecting me.

247
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,520
Don't do anything to me.

248
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,640
Otherwise,

249
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,320
I'll kill you.

250
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:31,320
Ling'er.

251
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,280
We should go back.

252
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,160
No.

253
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,120
He is he.

254
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,420
He is here.

255
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,000
This is so favorite.

256
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,040
You won't deny it.

257
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:18,240
I want all of you to believe that

258
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,220
Emperor option drink FIRST.

259
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,660
Hmm,

260
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,920
Oil sense explosion?

261
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,180
Kuangtung.

262
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,460
Nonsense.

263
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:51,780
straw mat trap

264
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,740
Master Xie

265
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,060
Yes!

266
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:58,340
Snow

267
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,980
has really come.

268
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,920
I will let you go if you don't kill them.

269
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,760
You think you can command me?

270
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,400
You took the golden elixir and yourself.

271
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,560
And you were badly injured by Sang Qi.

272
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,720
How much of your spiritual power are left?

273
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,520
I can't let you go.

274
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,040
I can't let you go.

275
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,360
I can't let you go.

276
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,920
I can't let you go.

277
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,360
I can't let you go.

278
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,760
I can't let you go.

279
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,080
I can't let you go.

280
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:28,560
I can't let you go.

281
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,560
How many points do you have left?

282
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Seven points is good.

283
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,200
If you have to die,

284
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
just go!

285
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,720
You've always been

286
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,640
unworthy of anything you want to protect.

287
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,600
But if you know that what you protect is a joke,

288
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,320
I don't know what you will react.

289
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,120
The Soul Bead is still in the pig tower.

290
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,360
But you may be disappointed

291
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,240
the 70 nautical point you have.

292
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,440
Bayison?

293
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,760
Impossible.

294
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Going had never happened.

295
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,640
Not here.

296
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:49,880
No,

297
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,640
It can't happen.

298
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,360
No way.

299
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,080
I don't know what you will react.

300
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,560
His시간

301
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,120
This one.

302
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,860
A Chin-ги with a hine.

303
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,140
You made a mistake.

304
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,940
I'm also curious.

305
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:37,540
Who is the master

306
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,740
who used a fake pearl

307
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,900
to play the whole Alliance for so long?

308
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:46,020
I made a mistake just now.

309
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,580
I shouldn't have asked you to do it.

310
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,140
It's okay.

311
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,500
The show has been over.

312
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,660
It's time to take off the disguise.

313
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,380
What happened this morning?

314
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:27,400
I carved council on the wall to

315
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,700
But this is my first time to fake the

316
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,400
death of the Chief.

317
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,400
Although I've tried to imitate it,

318
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
I'm afraid people will notice it's wrong.

319
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
You've been following me for many years.

320
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
You've always been the most trustworthy messenger.

321
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Before, you didn't have any fear when you faced Sang Qi and Xie Xue Chen.

322
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Why are you worried tonight?

323
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,400
Because tonight is the day when our plan is successful.

324
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,400
There can't be any mistake.

325
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,400
But I didn't expect that the biggest mistake

326
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
was the Soul Bead itself.

327
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
Our big plan is not in a moment.

328
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,400
As long as the Soul Bead still exists,

329
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,400
there's no hope of breaking it.

330
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,400
One day, I'll realize the world you want.

331
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,400
I asked you to fake me tonight to prove that I'm here.

332
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,400
If it's not necessary, I won't let you fake me again.

333
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,400
Go back.

334
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,400
They'll suspect us if we stay here for too long.

335
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:23,400
Let the Alliance help us find the Soul Bead.

336
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,400
Where is the Soul Bead?

337
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,400
I've come back with you.

338
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,400
What else do you want?

339
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,400
If you really want to come back,

340
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,400
I'll be happy.

341
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,400
But you're doing this for Xie Xue Chen.

342
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,400
Do you think I can't see it?

343
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
The words you said to him

344
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,400
are just worried that I'll kill him.

345
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,400
Since you know it, why don't you kill me?

346
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,400
Xie Xue Chen finally killed you.

347
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,400
And you just give up so easily?

348
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,400
Let me tell you.

349
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
He broke your magic power

350
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,400
and passed it to you.

351
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,400
He treats you so well.

352
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,400
Yuchue Palace is really wonderful.

353
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,400
I knew it.

354
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,400
Seven years ago, the magic bridge was destroyed.

355
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,400
How could it be restored?

356
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,400
So Yuchue Palace can really be restored.

357
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,400
He passed it to me.

358
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,400
No wonder.

359
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,400
No wonder my body is so healthy.

360
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
I'm not afraid of the sun anymore.

361
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,400
But why I don't know it?

362
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,400
He passed it to you.

363
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,400
And you have the magic bridge.

364
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,400
The Alliance's magic statue is at Yongxue City.

365
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,400
Once people find out,

366
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:19,400
the Alliance will kill you.

367
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,400
He thought he could hide it from everyone,

368
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,400
but he can't lie to me.

369
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,400
How do you know?

370
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:32,400
Xie Xue Chen can block the control of Ling Xi,

371
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
but he can't block the feeling of Ling Xi.

372
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
Wherever you are,

373
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
I can find your direction

374
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
and understand your condition.

375
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,400
You were attacked and the magic bridge was opened.

376
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:49,400
I know it better than you.

377
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
So you did all this

378
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:55,400
not only to get the magic statue and the formation,

379
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,400
but also for Yuchue Palace.

380
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,400
I have to do it.

381
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,400
I can be strong in the magic palace,

382
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,400
but I'm not good at it.

383
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,400
If I can open the magic bridge,

384
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,400
I can break the limit of the spiritual cultivation.

385
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,400
From now on,

386
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,400
I don't need to be afraid of anyone.

387
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,400
What is this?

388
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,400
It can make you forget the pain.

389
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,400
It's called the mist.

390
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,400
After taking it, you can cut off the feeling.

391
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,400
Love and hate are two different things.

392
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,400
Although you can remember

393
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,400
what you've been through,

394
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,400
when you think about it,

395
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,400
you won't feel any pain.

396
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,400
All your love started with Xie Xue Chen.

397
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,400
Your hatred for Master came from him.

398
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,400
You will forget your love for him

399
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,400
and your hatred for Master.

400
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
You will only remember

401
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,400
to approach him by Master's order

402
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,400
and get the magic statue.

403
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,400
Everything you said to him

404
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,400
and did was just a plan.

405
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:16,400
It was all false.

406
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
From now on,

407
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,400
we have no more enemies.

408
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Only in this way

409
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:27,400
will I keep your life.

410
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I don't drink.

411
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Ling'er,

412
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
I'm really doing this for your good.

413
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,400
It's meaningless to love someone.

414
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,400
People's hearts are complicated and variable.

415
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:54,400
Today, you might be soft-spoken.

416
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
Tomorrow, you might be ruthless.

417
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,400
Even

418
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,400
you might be a little bit cold.

419
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Even you might be ruthless.

420
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,400
Even you might be weak and weak.

421
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,400
You might be a killer.

422
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,400
I really don't want

423
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,400
such a thing

424
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,400
to happen to you.

425
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:26,400
Sang Qi, have you ever loved someone?

426
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,400
Did he hurt you?

427
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,400
Twenty years ago, you broke your arm.

428
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,400
Because of whom?

429
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Shut up!

430
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
But Sang Qi,

431
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,400
you were hurt

432
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,400
and you were cheated.

433
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,400
But you still don't want to drink the magic statue.

434
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,400
Why?

435
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,400
Because you don't want to forget

436
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,400
the warmth he gave you.

437
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,400
Even if it's fake,

438
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,400
I don't want to.

439
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,400
Once the five senses are in your mouth,

440
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,400
there's no way to get back.

441
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
You and Xie Xuechen

442
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,400
will become enemies eventually.

443
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,400
Second Brother!

444
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,400
I don't want to be with you anymore.

445
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm still with you.

446
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,400
I'm not leaving you.

447
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,400
I'm not leaving you.

448
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,400
I'm not leaving you.

449
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
Mu Xuanling!

450
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,400
I don't understand human world.

451
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
If I have a chance,

452
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:26,400
I'll take you to the real human world.

453
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Tonight, I seem to see the real world.

454
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
The real world?

455
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,400
You are always by my side.

456
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,400
The sun, the moon, the clouds, the sky, the universe, the red and yellow.

457
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,400
We will always be together.

458
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,400
Don't go.

459
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Don't go.

460
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
Young Master.

461
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,400
Young Master, you are awake.

462
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
You are awake.

463
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,400
You are awake.

464
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,400
You are awake.

465
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,400
You are awake.

466
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Young Master.

467
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
Young Master, you are awake.

468
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,400
Where is the Immortal Wood?

469
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,400
Where is the Immortal Wood?

470
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,400
I was here to deliver the medicine to you.

471
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,400
I didn't expect to meet Sang Qi in the west city.

472
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:45,400
I feel that you have only this fan with you.

473
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
As for Miss Mu,

474
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,400
according to the fairy's words,

475
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,400
she has been taken away by Sang Qi.

476
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
Thank you for stopping her.

477
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Do you know the feeling of Delphi?

478
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,400
It turns out that she is really the person in my dream.

479
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,400
But I couldn't protect her.

480
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Delphi is the coldest place in the world.

481
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:32,400
I can feel the bitterness in it.

482
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,400
Since you and the person in your dream are the same person,

483
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,400
what is your plan?

484
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,400
I will go to the west city.

485
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I want to protect her three times.

486
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,400
But I lost my will.

487
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,400
When I was a teenager,

488
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,400
I wanted to take her away from the Mingyue Villa.

489
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,400
But I didn't get what I wanted.

490
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
The second time, I went to the Immortal Alliance.

491
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,400
I was so worried.

492
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,400
I was so worried.

493
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
I was so worried.

494
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
The second time, I went to the Immortal Alliance for trial.

495
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,400
I prepared a formation for her.

496
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,400
I wanted to take her away.

497
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
But I didn't get what I wanted.

498
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,400
This time,

499
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
Sang Qi came to the west city.

500
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,400
I thought I could protect her.

501
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
But in the end,

502
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
I lost.

503
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:43,400
If this is fate,

504
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,400
why do you want me to be so close to her?

505
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,400
She is my old friend.

506
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,400
She is the person in my dream.

507
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,400
She is the person in my dream.

508
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:23,400
I just think I should protect her.

509
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,400
I should protect her.

510
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,400
Thank you.

511
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,400
How is she?

512
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,400
She is badly injured.

513
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,400
She is in a coma.

514
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,400
Brother.

515
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,400
You are awake.

516
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Thank you for your help.

517
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
How did Sang Qi take her away?

518
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,400
Master.

519
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
Mu Xuan Ling left with Sang Qi.

520
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,400
She went to Yong Xue City.

521
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
She should be killed.

522
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:25,400
She is so cruel.

523
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,400
I don't care.

524
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
I know what kind of person Mu Xuan Ling is.

525
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:32,400
She didn't betray Yong Xue City.

526
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
She is just using her way

527
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,400
to give me a reason to leave her

528
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,400
and save the human race.

529
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,400
And I

530
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
let her fall into Sang Qi's hands.

531
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
I owe her in the end.

532
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Brother.

533
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,400
Master.

534
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
Elder.

535
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Yan Tong.

536
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Go tell the other clans.

537
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,400
I have no choice.

538
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
Go.

539
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,400
Yes.

540
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,400
Brother, remember to take the medicine.

541
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
If you try your best,

542
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,400
you can stop Sang Qi

543
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,400
and keep her, right?

544
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,400
But you didn't do that.

545
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,400
Thank you, Xue Chen.

546
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,400
I will never forget

547
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,400
what you did to me.

548
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,400
Do you regret it?

549
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,400
I once asked the Elder

550
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,400
how to measure

551
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
the lives of a hundred people

552
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,400
and a thousand people.

553
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,400
What my father was worried about

554
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,400
was like a curse.

555
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,400
I kept resisting

556
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
and kept questioning

557
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
whether it was true or not.

558
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,400
But

559
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:28,400
it still happened.

560
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
In the end,

561
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:35,400
I still made that choice.

562
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,400
I met Mu Xuan Ling

563
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,400
and we still meet now.

564
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,400
I owe her a lot.

565
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
We care about different things.

566
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
But the result is the same.

567
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,400
I can't save her

568
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
because of my responsibility.

569
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,400
But I can't save her

570
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,400
because of my shame.

571
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,400
In the end,

572
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,400
she is the only one

573
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
who can bear all the pain.

574
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Now she is in the dark.

575
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
We both know

576
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
what to do.

577
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Young Master.

578
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:52,400
Thank you, Young Master.

579
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,400
I have no pain

580
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,400
even if I take the bone juice you brought.

581
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,400
Feng Yao.

582
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,400
Can you die for me?

583
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Yes.

584
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,400
Do you love me?

585
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,400
No.

586
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,400
So does she.

587
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,400
When Sang Qi came to the Western Realm,

588
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,400
she saved me with her life.

589
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,400
But the one who saved her

590
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,400
was just an old friend.

591
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,400
That's why she was so cruel.

592
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,400
You should have known it.

593
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,400
No.

594
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
Actually, you always knew it.

595
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,400
Yes.

596
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,400
I always knew it.

597
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:57,400
But the time when we were in love

598
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:00,400
was like

599
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,400
a long-time dream.

600
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,400
But she loved him.

601
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
Why didn't we meet

602
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
in order to help her?

603
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:22,400
Feng Yao.

604
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,400
What is love?

605
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,400
You asked the wrong person.

606
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,400
I'm afraid that

607
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,400
I don't know it better than you do.

608
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,400
If only I didn't understand it.

609
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,400
Then it would be fine.

610
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,400
I'm sorry.

611
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,400
I'm sorry.

612
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:53,400
I'm sorry.

613
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,400
I'm sorry.

614
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,400
I'm sorry.

615
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,400
I'm sorry.

616
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
I'm sorry.

617
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,400
I'm sorry.

618
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,400
I'm sorry.

619
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:07,400
I'm sorry.

620
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,400
I'm sorry.

621
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,400
I'm sorry.

622
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,400
I'm sorry.

623
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:15,400
I'm sorry.

624
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,400
I'm sorry.

625
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:18,400
I'm sorry.

626
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:20,400
I'm sorry.

627
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,400
I'm sorry.

628
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,400
I'm sorry.

629
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,400
I'm sorry.

630
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,400
I'm sorry.

631
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:30,400
I'm sorry.

632
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:32,400
I'm sorry.

633
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:34,400
I'm sorry.

634
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:36,400
I'm sorry.

635
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,400
I'm sorry.

636
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,400
I'm sorry.

637
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,400
I'm sorry.

638
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:44,400
I'm sorry.

639
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:46,400
I'm sorry.

640
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,400
I'm sorry.

641
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,400
I'm sorry.

642
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,400
I'm sorry.

643
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,400
I'm sorry.

644
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,400
I'm sorry.

645
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
I'm sorry.

646
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,400
I'm sorry.

647
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,400
I'm sorry.

648
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,400
I'm sorry.

649
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,400
I'm sorry.

650
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,400
I'm sorry.

651
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:10,400
I'm sorry.

652
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:12,400
I'm sorry.

653
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,400
I'm sorry.

654
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:16,400
I'm sorry.

655
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,400
I'm sorry.

656
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,400
I'm sorry.

657
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,400
I'm sorry.
