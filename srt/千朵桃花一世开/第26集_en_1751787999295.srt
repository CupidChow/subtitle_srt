00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The Untamed

2
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Gao Xiu was caught by him.

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There are two girls.

5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We must catch him.

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Yes.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Brother.

8
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Brother.

9
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
A'Bao.

10
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Why don't you come in?

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I should call you brother now.

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I should call you brother.

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Or uncle.

14
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I shouldn't remind you of the adult's business.

15
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
You can keep calling me brother.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But you can't call me uncle.

17
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Brother never eats.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He will be hungry.

19
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Mother said when you are sad,

20
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
you should eat a little snack.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
It will fill you up.

22
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I am sad.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
But I have to face it.

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I can only be relieved

25
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
if I keep walking.

26
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Brother.

27
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I am sorry.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He brought the spirits.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your parents died.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
A'Bao.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
A'Bao.

32
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I am afraid that brother will hate you.

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
A'Bao.

34
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Brother is not a saint.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I won't revenge.

36
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But I really don't want to see Jiang Li.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
But she is her.

38
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You are you.

39
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Brother won't hate A'Bao.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Brother.

41
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
If you feel lonely alone,

42
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A'Bao will be with you forever.

43
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Okay.

44
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Brother, think it over.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I will bring Qiu Ming back safely.

46
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I have a lot to tell him in person.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Princess.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Princess.

49
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
There is news about Gao Xiu.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
We found Qiu Ming.

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
We just arrived.

52
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
It's news from Yunxiu Villa.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The county king's arrest warrant,

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
reward warrant and other things.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Today, the Qingcheng Villa has reported

56
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that they saw He Xianwu

57
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
and Jiang Li.

58
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
He Xianwu took Gao Xiu to the dark domain.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Why did He Xianwu take him to the dark domain?

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I don't know the reason.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
But He Xianwu is very scheming.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
He has his own plan for every step.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now it seems that

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,000
he might have made a big mess on purpose.

65
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
On the one hand,

66
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
he took away Gao Xiu from the chaos.

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
On the other hand,

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
he wanted to use the Alliance's hand

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to seal the dark clan.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
So that he could implement his real plan in the dark domain.

71
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What is his real plan?

72
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
He wanted to use the power of chaos

73
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
to open the ladder to the God Realm.

74
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Could it be that

75
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He Xianwu thought Gao Qiu Ming was the chaos pearl?

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Qiu Ming is the chaos pearl?

77
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What on earth is going on?

78
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
He guessed wrong.

79
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Gao Qiu Ming is not.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
But if He Xianwu thinks so,

81
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
could it be that

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
he wanted to use Gao Qiu Ming's power to repair the ladder?

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
It is said that the emperor Zhao Ming was in trouble.

84
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He even made a mess with the God God.

85
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The God clan is unwilling to protect the human clan.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So he cut the ladder.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Then why would He Xianwu think

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
that the chaos pearl could repair the ladder?

89
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Because the one who cut the ladder

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
is the chaos pearl.

91
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The ancient artifact,

92
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the chaos pearl,

93
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
the destiny book,

94
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
was born with the creation.

95
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
One is the master of space,

96
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
the private minister.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The other is the master of the soul,

98
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the private minister.

99
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
They are all the executors of the heavenly path.

100
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
They are also higher than the gods.

101
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
But the destiny book has never been given.

102
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So He Xianwu

103
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
can only ask for the chaos pearl in the human world.

104
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
But I've been in the dark for ten years.

105
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I've never seen any ladder instruments.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I've never heard anyone mention it.

107
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If the legend is true,

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
then the ladder instrument

109
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
must still have the power of chaos.

110
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
The power of chaos

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
can disrupt the time and space.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It can even make time and space fold and hide.

113
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
So it's natural that you can't see it.

114
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't say so much.

115
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm going to ask for the secret.

116
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Fu Lansheng,

117
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
that's He Xianwu.

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Are you going to die alone?

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If He Xianwu knows that he is not the master of the chaos,

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
he will kill people and kill the people.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Then everything will be too late.

122
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You have to go.

123
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You have to wear a bargaining chip.

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What is this place?

125
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Why did you bring me here?

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I invited you here

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
just to hope that you can help me

128
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
to lure the chaos pearl.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
You won't be lazy

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
to raise your hand.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I don't understand what you're talking about.

132
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
What does the chaos pearl have to do with me?

133
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I didn't expect you to be so affectionate.

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
But you're wrong.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
The more you hide it for her,

136
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
the more you reveal the truth.

137
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The chaos pearl

138
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
is Mu Xuanli.

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
She is just a spirit.

140
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
How could she fight with the deity?

141
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're too good to her.

142
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
She also has Mu Xuanli!

143
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
She is like

144
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
a spider thatgame to the effect of danger

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
extended by light.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Ten thousand years ago,

147
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
the storehouse was held by the chaos pearl

148
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to meet the evil of chaos.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,680
Right?

150
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,240
You're threatening me, right?

151
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,920
I've told you.

152
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,200
Mu Xuan Ling is not the Soul Bead.

153
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,480
She's not.

154
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,600
Master Gao.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,720
I just want Mu Xuan Ling to help me repair the ladder.

156
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,000
I won't hurt anyone.

157
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,480
You won't hurt anyone?

158
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,200
The chaos of the Three Tribes.

159
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,800
How many are injured?

160
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,920
How many are dead?

161
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
Isn't the life of the world

162
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,040
not a life?

163
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,680
I'm sorry, too.

164
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,280
You can talk softly.

165
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,920
You're so desperate

166
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,040
to open the ladder.

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,160
What's the point of going to the Heaven Realm?

168
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,240
I heard that there's an eternal power in the Heaven Realm.

169
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,320
No need to work hard.

170
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,880
Only by taking the spirit energy and essence from the mortal world

171
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,560
can everyone live a long life

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,240
and have no worries.

173
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,840
But the human race has to go through life and death.

174
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,560
Just to eat,

175
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,360
we have to rely on the gods.

176
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,520
I really want to go to the Heaven Realm

177
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,720
to see why the world is so unfair.

178
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,560
You set up the Vast Pavilion and made trouble.

179
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
You got so much blood on your hands.

180
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:40,320
Now you come here to be merciful.

181
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,920
It's not that interesting to talk to you.

182
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,920
But I'm afraid there's no time.

183
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,560
Your friends are here.

184
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,520
Qiu Mi.

185
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,520
Fulai.

186
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,680
He Xin Wu, let her go.

187
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,280
She and Nan Xue are a team.

188
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,200
They have a backup plan.

189
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,480
You guys go. Go!

190
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:04,880
Let her go.

191
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:05,960
Let me handle it.

192
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,840
I'll let you handle it.

193
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:09,800
He Xin Wu.

194
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,280
What you want is me.

195
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,680
Let her go.

196
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,840
I'll handle it.

197
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,160
She's in the Heaven Realm.

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,760
No matter how fast your sword is,

199
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm afraid there will be a problem.

200
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,280
I'm the Chaos Bead.

201
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,200
It's all because of me.

202
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,840
I don't want to owe her.

203
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,720
I believe in you.

204
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:32,960
Even if I'm in danger,

205
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
you can save me.

206
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,440
Right?

207
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,520
Mu Xuan Ling!

208
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,160
We're enemies.

209
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,360
I've never liked you.

210
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,840
Even if you come to me now,

211
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
I won't thank you at all.

212
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:53,880
I won't!

213
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
Cut the crap!

214
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,480
You're my sister.

215
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm your sister.

216
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,480
I'm your sister.

217
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,480
Cut the crap!

218
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,480
Do you think I like you?

219
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,720
You're useless.

220
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
I'm afraid you'll always be taken advantage of.

221
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,600
I'll persuade you to go back and learn to use your skills.

222
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,800
Run if you can't defeat me.

223
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,000
Mu Xuan Ling!

224
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,440
When I was young,

225
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,640
I let you die for me.

226
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I owe you.

227
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Today,

228
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,520
I'll give it all back to you.

229
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,040
No!

230
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,880
Another one!

231
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,600
I want

232
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,120
Last回來!

233
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,720
Last Storm Willow should come appear.

234
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
Jin Yue...

235
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,800
Mu Xuan Ling.

236
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,600
Mu Xuan Ling!

237
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,600
Stop!

238
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,760
Take her.

239
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,280
entendu

240
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,840
You pay!

241
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,480
Denmark!

242
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,400
dabei

243
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,720
Try the Hardest

244
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
Basic

245
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,600
early

246
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,100
No!

247
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
Hurry.

248
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,140
We've been on it.

249
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,280
Gao Qireaming, although you are stupid,

250
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,080
There's one thing to say to you guys!

251
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,560
We are fellow Qur'an Dean and each of us has our own plans!

252
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,800
And how can we just ignore it and follow his order?

253
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,860
Done it, San Chief!

254
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,360
because you called us.

255
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,600
It's you.

256
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,740
Martial Soul books.

257
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,980
Martial Soul books.

258
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:44,000
Martial Soul cloth books.

259
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,260
Martial Soul会智он

260
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,280
Lu более

261
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:56,600
ajie

262
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,180
jia

263
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:01,180
I'm so disappointed to see the Immortality Formation.

264
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Disappointed?

265
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,780
You're right.

266
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,220
He's the evil brother I met when I and Feng Xiang

267
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,860
established the Immortality Formation.

268
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,180
He really lived for so long.

269
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,020
He tried to steal the Soul Bead.

270
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,260
He was severely injured by me.

271
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,060
I thought he was dead.

272
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,460
But as you said,

273
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,500
it seems that he was faking his death

274
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,740
and kept changing his face.

275
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,900
He lived for so many years.

276
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,700
But why do you suspect He Xianwu

277
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,900
is the person who lived for so long?

278
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,980
Because he knew how to break the Immortality Formation.

279
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,500
So I guess

280
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,500
when you were in the formation,

281
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,260
he was probably just standing there.

282
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,020
He knew the key to the formation.

283
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
And not long ago,

284
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,140
he made the Soul Bead.

285
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,020
The raw material of the Soul Bead,

286
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,420
the Phoenix Silver Plant,

287
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,980
was destroyed by Feng Xiang's collapse

288
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,100
6,000 years ago.

289
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,860
If he hadn't been destroyed 6,000 years ago,

290
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,460
or

291
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,220
someone who lived longer

292
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,820
would never have got it.

293
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,100
But I'm confused

294
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,740
about a person who died.

295
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,420
Even if he reached the Formation,

296
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,460
he would only live for more than 1,000 years.

297
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,380
Feng Xiang was honored to be born.

298
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,740
He paid such a huge price.

299
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:13,700
But why did He Xianwu live for so long?

300
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,620
Has he ever seen the God of Lun Jing?

301
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,660
Feng Xiang,

302
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,580
you've seen

303
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,260
the price of life.

304
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:23,900
But

305
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,460
I've heard of a kind of

306
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,700
blood-sucking

307
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,740
and killing

308
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,940
to kill yourself.

309
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,380
Although the one who lost his life

310
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,020
could kill himself,

311
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,780
he would also suffer a great amount of counter-attack.

312
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,860
He looked normal,

313
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,660
but he was like a piece of rotten flesh.

314
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,180
He was in a bad state.

315
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,060
He would eventually die

316
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,780
in more pain.

317
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,340
I think he

318
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,220
just practiced this blood-sucking.

319
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,100
What is his purpose

320
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,460
to make someone do this?

321
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,060
Lord Qian Guang,

322
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,300
I have one more thing to ask.

323
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,660
Now the dark jade is sealed by the spirit elixir of Sang Qi.

324
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,300
I'm afraid it won't last long.

325
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,420
I intend to rebuild Wanxian Town.

326
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,940
I've seen the ancient books of the late emperor.

327
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,460
The most important one is the power of the chaos.

328
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,420
But the chaos pearl

329
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,060
was exhausted

330
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,300
6,000 years ago.

331
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,180
If there is no power of the chaos,

332
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,300
is there any other way

333
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,580
to rebuild Wanxian Town?

334
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:30,620
There is indeed a way

335
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:34,580
that can be done without the power of the chaos.

336
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,300
It requires that the three

337
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,740
who have the strongest spirit energy

338
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:38,780
stand separately on the three gates of

339
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,780
cultivation, life and death

340
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,580
to complete the formation.

341
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,820
Thank you, Lord Qian Guang.

342
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,620
You should not.

343
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,740
The starter home

344
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,120
is a perfect golden n之前 unite big power.

345
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,140
If the power of the У Matria

346
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,820
is not Seeing enough people

347
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:56,940
the starter home

348
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,340
will die

349
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,540
in the height of the spirit.

350
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,140
This is

351
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,140
the only solution.

352
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:09,000
The coat snatched the power of the waited

353
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,660
is now in the dark

354
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,580
and the staff held by Usher

355
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,420
will die in the dark.

356
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:15,340
With the speeches of some people

357
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:22,340
The winner is the Holy Mother, Mu Xuan Ling, and you

358
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:27,340
So from that moment on, I wasn't the one who got you

359
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:30,340
I was the one who got you

360
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,340
We can't predict how you will move in every step

361
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,340
But we know how you will move in the end

362
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:38,340
He Xian Wu, this door is made for you

363
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,340
It's not difficult to cooperate with Nan Xu Yue

364
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,340
Nan Xu Yue?

365
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,340
Do you really know what kind of person he is?

366
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,340
Do you know what he has done behind his back?

367
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,340
Why?

368
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,340
A person should die

369
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,340
But he doesn't want to die

370
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,340
He will struggle

371
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,340
The struggle will be a little bit moving

372
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:11,340
Even if you make one mistake, you will make another one

373
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,340
I am like this

374
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,340
I can't make any changes

375
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,340
Then why did you tell me everything?

376
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,340
This is He Xian Wu's medicine

377
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,340
It can help me to find my destiny

378
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,340
It makes me be bullied by him

379
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,340
I am so useless

380
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:40,340
I don't want to continue

381
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:47,340
If you do something wrong, you should pay for it

382
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,340
Kill me

383
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,340
Or let me be your servant

384
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,340
Then kill me

385
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,340
Nan Xu Yue

386
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,340
Nan Xu Yue was threatened by me

387
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,340
He was killed

388
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,340
Is that true?

389
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:18,340
You can laugh at the person who will die

390
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:22,340
After you laugh, you will atone for your sins

391
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:26,340
Get up

392
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,340
Nan Xu Yue

393
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:49,340
Your accomplices are so weak

394
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,340
I don't think you can just leave the world

395
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,340
You can't take anything

396
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,340
And you, Nan Xu Yue

397
00:19:57,340 --> 00:19:59,340
You can't really let him go

398
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,340
You want to live

399
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,340
because of him

400
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,340
I'm sorry for your loss

401
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,340
This is my own business

402
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,340
Thank you for your concern

403
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,340
Lan Xiyuan

404
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,340
Think it over

405
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Once I die

406
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,340
Finally

407
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,340
You are all in the formation

408
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,340
All of us

409
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,340
Lan Xiyuan

410
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,340
Start the formation

411
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,340
Ok

412
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,340
Then as you wish

413
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,340
No

414
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
Lan Xiyuan

415
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,340
Xiyuan

416
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,340
What are you doing?

417
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:24,340
The war is over

418
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,340
Everyone in my eyes

419
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,340
Can't escape

420
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,340
All three doors are dead

421
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,340
Three people

422
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
All dead

423
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
What a big show

424
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,340
Lan Xiyuan

425
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,340
Do you want to kill him?

426
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,340
What do you want?

427
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,340
Xuanliu

428
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,340
Xuanliu

429
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,340
Father

430
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Father

431
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
I believe you

432
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:07,340
No matter how hard I try

433
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
You can get me out

434
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:12,340
Right?

435
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,340
Xuanliu

436
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,340
Xuanliu

437
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,340
No

438
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,340
Mu Xuanliu

439
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,340
Mu Xuanliu

440
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
No

441
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:03,340
It shouldn't be like this

442
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,340
I am sorry

443
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
Who is so kind?

444
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
Always like you

445
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,340
I feel sorry for you

446
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,340
Call me Ling'er

447
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:19,340
Ok?

448
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,340
Ok

449
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,340
Ok

450
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,340
Whatever you say

451
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,340
Why?

452
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,340
Why?

453
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:45,340
I heard what you said to Xuanxie

454
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,340
Xie Chengzhu really wants to cooperate with Lan Xiyue

455
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,340
You know he can't do it

456
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
If you want to rebuild Wanxian Town

457
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,340
You need a big formation

458
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,340
To start the formation

459
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,340
No one can survive

460
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,340
Even if the world is destroyed

461
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,340
Only Lan Xiyue can survive

462
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
I have no choice

463
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,340
If there is another plot behind him

464
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
From the beginning of the plan

465
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,340
I don't put my life on the line

466
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
Xuanxie

467
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,340
If I die

468
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
You are the next leader of the Alliance

469
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,340
I am willing to sacrifice my life

470
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,340
I won't make it too difficult for you

471
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,340
But what should Miss Mu do?

472
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
She has a jade pendant

473
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,340
It was given by Lan Xiyue

474
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,340
I have touched that jade pendant

475
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,340
It is a treasure of protection

476
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,340
As long as she is here

477
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,340
Xuanling's life is useless

478
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,340
I am asking

479
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:03,340
I am asking if you die

480
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,340
How should Miss Mu live her next life?

481
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,340
Mu Xuanling

482
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,340
Life is better than the world

483
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,340
The world has never been good to her

484
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,340
But she used her will

485
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,340
To kill a deer from the bow

486
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:35,340
She trampled all the pain and suffering

487
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,340
She has never been my father

488
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,340
She is herself

489
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,340
Her life

490
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:47,340
Will not be in vain because of my death

491
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,340
But will be meaningless

492
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,340
I love her

493
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,340
I respect her

494
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,340
And I believe her

495
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
But

496
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
The one who stays

497
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,340
Is more painful than the one who left

498
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
I am too selfish

499
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:08,340
To let her be the one who stays

500
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
Every time you fight

501
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:18,340
You hold the four fingers

502
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,340
You always think for everyone

503
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,340
But you ask for nothing

504
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,340
You don't even leave a trace for yourself

505
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,340
Xiyue

506
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,340
You are so stupid

507
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:33,340
You care for the world

508
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,340
Someone will always

509
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,340
Love you so much

510
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,340
The thing of death

511
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,340
Let me be the witch

512
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
I am sorry

513
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,340
Love is

514
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,340
You stay by yourself

515
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:56,340
I will be the witch

516
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,340
Xie Xue Zhen

517
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:05,340
This time

518
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,340
I will protect you

519
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,340
Okay?

520
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,340
I should be the one who keeps the seal

521
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,340
No

522
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,340
You will not die

523
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,340
I will not let you die

524
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,340
Xuan Ling

525
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,340
Xuan Ling

526
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,340
Xuan Ling

527
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Mu Xuan Ling

528
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
I am okay

529
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,340
Mu Xuan Ling

530
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:32,340
Your disciples

531
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,340
Have passed the news to Gao Qiangming

532
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
But

533
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,340
Have you really decided

534
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,340
To use the chance of the Reconstruction of the Immortality Formation

535
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,340
To kill He Xianwu and He Xie Xue Chen?

536
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,340
One doesn't care about others' lives

537
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,340
One doesn't care about his own life

538
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,340
What he hates

539
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,340
What he loves

540
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,340
Will put him in danger

541
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,340
So they all have to die

542
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,340
But he is also in the formation

543
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,340
The formation of the Immortality Formation can't be changed

544
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,340
Once the formation is changed

545
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,340
Only the three gates will die

546
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,340
He can't escape

547
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,340
My jade card will protect him

548
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,340
What about the price?

549
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,340
It can resist the weapon of the death of the Immortality Formation

550
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,340
What price are you going to pay?

551
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Just transfer the damage he suffered

552
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,340
To me

553
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
Then you will die

554
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:26,340
He Xie Xue Chen

555
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,340
He Xie Xue Chen

556
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:32,340
Can't you still be the one I love?

557
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,340
I killed He Xianwu

558
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,340
I won't live long

559
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,340
After I killed He Xue Chen

560
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,340
He will hate me

561
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:45,340
No matter how I think

562
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
The one who should die

563
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Should be me

564
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,340
I once said

565
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:53,340
If one day I touch He Xie Xue Chen

566
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,340
He can kill me

567
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,340
So I'll die with Xie Xuechen

568
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,220
and return her life

569
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,540
I just found out today

570
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,940
you're not as good as the wind and moon

571
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:05,340
She...

572
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,540
You're not as good as the gods

573
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,140
You can become a god

574
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,900
because you're a lunatic

575
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,060
A lunatic who doesn't want to die

576
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,220
My blood

577
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,260
My blood

578
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,740
Mu Xuanling

579
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,820
If you come here again

580
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,900
I'll kill you right now

581
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,500
Mu Xuanling

582
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,780
Qingtian

583
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,540
Kill her

584
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:41,180
Mu Xuanling

585
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,580
Mu Xuanling

586
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,180
Qingtian

587
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,260
Qingtian

588
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:51,500
Heaven and earth

589
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,660
I know

590
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,260
What does it mean?

591
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:10,220
This is the

592
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:11,980
Master asked us to save you out of Bixiao Palace

593
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,740
Why did you bring us here?

594
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,820
Everyone

595
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:25,020
Master passed the token to me

596
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,660
He said he would take us to a real

597
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,460
and equal place

598
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:32,220
when all the spirits of the Immortal Pavilion come here

599
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,300
A place of peace

600
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,340
Great

601
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:37,020
Great

602
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,180
Now

603
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,300
It's your turn to lend me some power

604
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:08,620
Hold on

605
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,900
Why?

606
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:18,700
Let me go

607
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,580
Xie Xuechen

608
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,340
Lord Lv Xuan, it's Xie Xuechen

609
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,700
All kinds of people want to kill us

610
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,220
Xie Xuechen saved us

611
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,740
A human saved us

612
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:47,740
In the past, the gods lived high in the Nine Heavens and unified the Three Realms.

613
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:50,740
They ignored all living beings as prisoners

614
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,740
and brought endless blood and tears to the mortal world.

615
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:57,740
But the human race didn't have the power to cultivate.

616
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,740
They couldn't cultivate.

617
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,740
They were all killed.

618
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,740
They were all killed.

619
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,740
They were all killed.

620
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:07,740
They were all killed.

621
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,740
They were all killed.

622
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,740
They were all killed.

623
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,740
They didn't have the power to cultivate.

624
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:16,740
They were all killed by the gods.

625
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,740
They were all killed by the gods.

626
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:26,740
But the only human race who could cultivate the power of the gods

627
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:31,740
was the one who respected him and made him the Emperor.

628
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:38,740
My mother said that the Heavenly Empress couldn't go home anymore.

629
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:39,740
What's there to be sad about?

630
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,740
It's a family honor to be selected as the God of War.

631
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,740
It's a good thing.

632
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,740
Being a God of War will be a trap.

633
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:47,740
We will die.

634
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
Don't talk nonsense.

635
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:49,740
That's not death.

636
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,740
It's just leaving the mortal body to go to the Heaven Realm to serve the gods.

637
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:54,740
Don't talk nonsense.

638
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,740
The Holy King ordered us to take good care of these children.

639
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,740
Yes.

640
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,740
Did the Holy King want us to die?

641
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
You misunderstood him, kid.

642
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:09,740
I was born and raised by the Heavenly Court.

643
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:11,740
I shouldn't have interfered with the mortal world.

644
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:13,740
But I've been in the Holy King for more than ten years.

645
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,740
Not a day has passed that he's not working for an ordinary person like us.

646
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:21,740
Didn't you protect and grace the village you live in?

647
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,740
Even the Holy King has his difficulties.

648
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:27,740
But we have to believe him.

649
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,740
He will give us the best time.

650
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,740
However, later, the Holy King was betrayed by the Heavenly Court.

651
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,740
He climbed the ladder.

652
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,740
The gods were defeated.

653
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:48,080
The mortal world was

654
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:51,740
I want the whole immortal tribe to be destroyed.

655
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:54,740
Otherwise, one day, they will come to the mortal world again.

656
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:58,740
I kill people to protect more people.

657
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,740
Then what is it?

658
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,740
Where are the gods?

659
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,740
There will be no more gods.

660
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,740
Zhao Ming, do you want to violate the heavenly law?

661
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:19,740
The actions of the gods are not right.

662
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:23,740
Today, I want the only source of the heaven and earth.

663
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,740
The immortal world again.

664
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,740
It's impossible.

665
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:43,740
The mortal world was destroyed.

666
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,740
I saw it with my own eyes.

667
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,740
Why is there no god?

668
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,740
What happened here ten thousand years ago?

669
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
I don't know.

670
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,740
I don't know.

671
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,740
What happened here ten thousand years ago?

672
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,740
Why is it like this?

673
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,740
Why?

674
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,740
The holy light.

675
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:28,740
There must be a mountain.

676
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
There must be a mountain there.

677
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,740
There must be a mountain.

678
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,740
Heaven's fate tree.

679
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,740
The evil cultivation is not good for the world.

680
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,740
Every hundred years, I have to change my identity.

681
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:42,740
It's enough to live.

682
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,740
Nanduo.

683
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:51,740
Do you still remember me?

684
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,740
The heavenly tree's personal order is forbidden to the UK.

685
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,740
The name is not allowed to be passed on.

686
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,740
The evil cultivation is forbidden to the UK.

687
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:09,740
The name is not allowed to be passed on.

688
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
The heavenly tree's personal order is forbidden to the UK.

689
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,740
The name is not allowed to be passed on.

690
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:34,740
This...

691
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:37,740
It's fake.

692
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:40,740
It's all fake.

693
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,740
The world is fake.

694
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:47,740
The legend is also fake.

695
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:49,740
You're lying.

696
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,740
The heavenly tree is lying.

697
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,740
Ten thousand years of deception.

698
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,740
This is the truth.

699
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,740
Zhao Ming is innocent.

700
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,740
Zhao Ming is innocent.

701
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,740
Zhao Ming is innocent.

702
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,740
Innocent.

703
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:34,740
Innocent.

704
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:05,740
Innocent.

705
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,740
Zhao Ming.

706
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,740
Zhao Ming.

707
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:36,740
Zhao Ming.

708
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,740
Zhao Ming.

709
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:38,740
Zhao Ming.

710
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,740
Zhao Ming.

711
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:40,740
Zhao Ming.

712
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,740
Zhao Ming.

713
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,740
Zhao Ming.

714
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:43,740
Zhao Ming.

715
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,740
Zhao Ming.

716
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:45,740
Zhao Ming.

717
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,740
Zhao Ming.

718
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,740
Zhao Ming.

719
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:48,740
Zhao Ming.

720
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:49,740
Zhao Ming.

721
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:50,740
Zhao Ming.

722
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:51,740
Zhao Ming.

723
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,740
Zhao Ming.

724
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:53,740
Zhao Ming.

725
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,740
Zhao Ming.

726
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:55,740
Zhao Ming.

727
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:56,740
Zhao Ming.

728
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,740
Zhao Ming.

729
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,740
Zhao Ming.

730
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,740
Zhao Ming.

731
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,740
Zhao Ming.

732
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Zhao Ming.

733
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:02,740
Zhao Ming.

734
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:03,740
Zhao Ming.

735
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:04,740
Zhao Ming.

736
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,740
Zhao Ming.

737
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,740
Zhao Ming.

738
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:07,740
Zhao Ming.

739
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,740
Zhao Ming.

740
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,740
Zhao Ming.

741
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:10,740
Zhao Ming.

742
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,740
Zhao Ming.

743
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,740
Zhao Ming.

744
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,740
Zhao Ming.

745
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:14,740
Zhao Ming.

746
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,740
Zhao Ming.

747
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
Zhao Ming.

748
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:17,740
Zhao Ming.

749
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:18,740
Zhao Ming.

750
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:19,740
Zhao Ming.

751
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:20,740
Zhao Ming.

752
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:21,740
Zhao Ming.

753
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:22,740
Zhao Ming.

754
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,740
Zhao Ming.

755
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,740
Zhao Ming.

756
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,740
Zhao Ming.

757
00:43:25,740 --> 00:43:26,740
Zhao Ming.

758
