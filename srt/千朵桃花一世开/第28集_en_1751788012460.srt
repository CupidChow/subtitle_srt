Xie Yuchen, Xie Yuchen

14
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Why are you staring at me like this

15
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Yueling

16
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yueling

17
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I won't let you be in any danger

18
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I don't want to lose you anymore

19
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Xie Yuchen, what's wrong with you

20
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
What happened

21
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm the chief of the Xiu Xing Ge

22
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
He is going to destroy Wen Xian Town in secret

23
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
What

24
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
How do you know

25
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's too late to explain

26
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I have to send it over immediately

27
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Should I call you Chief He or Chief Xiu Xing Ge

28
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If I remember correctly

29
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You only saw my face once

30
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Did I make any mistakes

31
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Or who told you

32
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You are a quiet and calm person

33
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's not a crime of youth

34
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
There are many Taoists in the world

35
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Except for Yi Rong Shu

36
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Only you can change the form and change the skin

37
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Who are you

38
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I asked you but you didn't answer

39
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I want to ask from me

40
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It doesn't matter

41
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Whether you answer or not

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I won't kill you today

43
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Just happen to have this intention

44
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
In a short time

45
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Xie Sheng's main force has greatly improved

46
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And the audience is looking forward to it

47
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I really hope he can succeed

48
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
That will prove that he is the one I am waiting for

49
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Give me a little more time

50
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
One day is enough

51
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Why at this time

52
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can it be changed

53
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's still a failure

54
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Did I succeed

55
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a pity that the reality hasn't changed

56
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
The person you love didn't come back to life

57
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'm sorry

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't expect you to be so kind

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I'm sorry

60
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
It can be changed

61
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
It's just a little bit different

62
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Just give me a little more time

63
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can stop the core

64
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
You promised to help me go back to the past

65
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Change his fate

66
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why at a critical moment

67
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Suddenly brought me back to reality

68
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You misunderstood me

69
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I didn't mean to bring you back to reality

70
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
But the time and space are unstable

71
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Every time you stay, there is a limit

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
When the time comes, you will be forced to return to reality

73
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
How long can I stay

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
At most, only one day

75
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Just one day

76
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
One day is already the limit

77
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
As long as I can save him

78
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I can bear all the pain

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The damage of the spirit body is irreversible

80
00:07:51,000 --> 00:08:17,380
Every time the wheel is

81
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I have thought about it

82
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Only one night

83
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Must use this night

84
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Take Ling'er away from the dark cloud

85
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
As long as she is no longer the holy daughter of the dark cloud

86
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You can live in peace

87
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
No need to get involved in the things that happened later

88
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am still asking for blood

89
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can't let anyone see me go down the mountain

90
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Fortunately, I learned from Ling'er

91
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The way to cover the shadow

92
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Can cover the face

93
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Good wine

94
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Haven't eaten such a tender spirit body

95
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Get out

96
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You are stupid dark clan

97
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Big brother saved me in front of the sky

98
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I can't die here like this

99
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Big sister

100
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't be afraid little sister

101
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Sister is not an enemy

102
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Look at this little poor thing

103
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,000
But your performance is still very outstanding

104
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You can survive in so many dark tribes' pursuit

105
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You saw me being chased and killed

106
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
But you didn't help me

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
At least we are not friends

108
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I made a bet with Chiying

109
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I bet that the tribes that Honorable Superior brought back

110
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Which one of them can survive till the end

111
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I told him it was you

112
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
He didn't believe me

113
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But now the other tribes are dead

114
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
You survived

115
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
You are the strongest one

116
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I admire you

117
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Then

118
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What made you have such a strong desire to survive

119
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,000
The money that you have accumulated

120
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Or the unneeded treasure

121
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Or the most delicate fragrance

122
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Or the supreme power

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I don't like what you said

124
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Then what else in this world

125
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Is worth your longing

126
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I don't have any longing

127
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But I don't allow myself to die like this

128
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Interesting. Why

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It has nothing to do with you

130
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Do you think

131
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Our dark tribe is very bad

132
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Very disgusting

133
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You don't want to say a word to me

134
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Isn't it

135
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You are so unreasonable

136
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
You should be glad

137
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Because of the dark tribe

138
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can survive in the dark

139
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The most obvious dark tribe that Prince Yu showed

140
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Is the best to be used

141
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Actually, the human race is also like this

142
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You shouldn't have a competition for desire

143
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But to use it

144
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
This can control the dark tribe

145
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
And control the human heart

146
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I don't want to be like you

147
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Want to survive in the bad guys

148
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
You have to become a bad person first

149
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Only to be the ultimate bad

150
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You can fight against the bad

151
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Remember?

152
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Think about it

153
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Why you came to the dark tribe

154
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
And why you live

155
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The important thing is

156
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
To know what you want

157
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
To achieve your goal

158
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
You are right

159
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Now like this

160
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Is it like a bad guy

161
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I believe we will meet again

162
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Finally found

163
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Why someone is at the door of his house

164
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Make such a trap

165
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I will go to the door

166
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Fortunately, I brought this

167
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You shameless dark tribe

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You bullied me to come out

169
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
And harass me

170
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Luckily, I fell asleep in advance

171
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I just passed by

172
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
You are a fool

173
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Why should I lie to you

174
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
When I passed by

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I saw the flowers in the forest

176
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I was curious and got closer

177
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I didn't expect to be fooled by you

178
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You are a little mysterious

179
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Well

180
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Are there many dark tribes bullying you?

181
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You know it well

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
You dark tribe don't have a good thing

183
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Especially the one called Chiying

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Always looking for trouble

185
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
And make trouble with me

186
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When I become the most powerful mushroom

187
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I will defeat all dark tribes

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I must make him kneel down

189
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
And laugh at me

190
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Can't let him go on like this

191
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Otherwise, he will go to the trap of the base

192
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Do you want to learn powerful martial arts?

193
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I teach you

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Just you

195
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Even my trap is heavy

196
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You want to teach me?

197
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
How is it?

198
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Is it powerful?

199
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
Yes, brother

200
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I recognize you

201
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Let's go, brother

202
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Let's go back

203
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Be gentle

204
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Be gentle

205
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Be gentle

206
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I only saw him in front of the dark tribe

207
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Look like a man

208
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
But I didn't expect he just came to the dark tribe

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
So reckless

210
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
He said

211
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He had a demon on his face when he was a kid

212
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
But I didn't see it

213
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Come on, brother

214
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Drink tea

215
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What powerful martial arts do you have?

216
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Teach me

217
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I want to be more like the dark tribe

218
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
It's not a good thing to be like the dark tribe

219
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Why not?

220
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Yu Ying said

221
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If the evil team

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Becomes more powerful than the evil

223
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The destruction of the human race

224
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Is another step closer

225
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Why do you hate the human race so much?

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't be blinded by hatred

227
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
And don't self-revenge yourself

228
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Do you know?

229
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Although there are many bad people in this world

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
But there are also good people like big brother

231
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
If he is still here

232
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
He must want you to be like an ordinary person

233
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Live happily

234
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
How do you know about big brother?

235
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Don't use those

236
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Outwardly written martial arts

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
To steal my heart

238
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I just don't want you to force yourself

239
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
To become another person

240
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I didn't force myself

241
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I just want to be as powerful as the dark tribe

242
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
No

243
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I want to be stronger than all the dark tribes

244
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,000
All of them

245
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
But you

246
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
As a dark tribe

247
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You are not like the dark tribe

248
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
If I say I'm not the dark tribe

249
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Will you go with me?

250
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I will take you to a place without conflict

251
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Where there is no pain

252
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Let you spend your life in peace

253
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
No

254
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I want to avenge big brother

255
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Stay in the dark

256
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
To become stronger

257
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Is big brother so important to you?

258
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Even if you are bullied by the dark tribe

259
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
You will live in the fear of pain

260
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Even if you will lose your life

261
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
You have to stay in the dark

262
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
To me

263
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Big brother is the most important person

264
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
For big brother

265
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I can suffer any pain

266
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I'm willing to do anything

267
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Time is running out

268
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Come with me

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
What are you doing?

270
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You have to leave me

271
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
I said I'm not leaving

272
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is the signal bomb of the dark tribe

273
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Once fired

274
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The whole dark tribe will be alerted

275
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Sang Qi will immediately come to the dark tribe to chase you

276
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You can't leave then

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I don't care who you are

278
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What purpose you have

279
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I can not expose you

280
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
But you have to leave my house now

281
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Ying'er

282
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'll shoot if you don't come

283
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's getting dawn

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
We have to hurry back to the dark tribe before it's too late

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Otherwise, everything will be in chaos

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Go

287
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Hurry up

288
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Go

289
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
This time I still didn't grab the time

290
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
But fortunately

291
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I'm still alive

292
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,000
I still have a chance

293
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm here

294
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I've been in the secluded place of the Snow Tower for a long time

295
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
The snow has been falling

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
The night is still young

297
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Who is in my place?

298
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I always thought

299
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
When Mingyue was in the mountain villa

300
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Father was completely disappointed in me

301
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
He didn't want to see me again

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
That day he asked me to go down the mountain

303
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
He also performed so well

304
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
But why

305
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
If the leader of the Alliance is still here

306
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
He must want to tell you this

307
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Xue Chen

308
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
So many years

309
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Father has always treated you very harshly

310
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
But in fact, father always knew

311
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
How hard it is for you

312
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
But even if he died

313
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
It's impossible to get out of the Dragon Snow City

314
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Remember

315
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Don't try to change other people's fate

316
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
And don't let people know your existence

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Otherwise, your father will not be able to bear the cost

318
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,000
There will be countless people who will become the victims of fate

319
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
The worst possibility

320
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Is that the whole world will be destroyed

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
And there will be no more suffering

322
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If one day in the future

323
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
My life and this world

324
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Put it in the right place

325
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You don't have to worry

326
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
You must choose the latter firmly

327
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Don't be blinded by hatred

328
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
And don't be self-pitying

329
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Do you know

330
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Although there are many bad people in this world

331
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
But there are also good people like big brother

332
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,000
If he is still here

333
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He must hope that you are like an ordinary person

334
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Live happily

335
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If it's big brother

336
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,000
I will be happy

337
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I will be happy

338
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
I will be happy

339
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
But what do I want to do?

340
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Time is up

341
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Ding'er

342
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I'm back

343
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Ding'er

344
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Ding'er

345
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Ding'er

346
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Ding'er

347
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
I have nothing to fear

348
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I have no regrets in this life

349
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I will be by your side

350
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,000
Li'er

351
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You finally wake up

352
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
It's so good to see you

353
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Li'er

354
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Li'er

355
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
This time

356
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
We will never separate

357
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Ok

358
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Now the war of human and spirit has ended

359
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Wan Xianzhen is repaired

360
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
The world is peaceful

361
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
You promised me to go to the mortal world

362
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Don't play tricks

363
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Take me to the mortal world now, ok?

364
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Ok

365
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Li'er

366
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Li'er

367
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Don't be so rude

368
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
Rude

369
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
You are awake

370
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
You are weak now

371
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Don't be so arrogant

372
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
I am not

373
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I am not

374
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
I am not

375
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
How is she?

376
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,000
There is no change in this world

377
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,000
There is one thing

378
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I am a little confused

379
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Li'er said

380
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
She has a big face of a demon

381
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
But I saw it

382
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,000
She has no demon on her face

383
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,000
Why?

384
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I can't give you the answer

385
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
But you need to find out for yourself

386
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
I will try again

387
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Your spirit is seriously damaged

388
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
If you force yourself to travel through time and space

389
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You may not have any regrets

390
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
Even if it's the last hope

391
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
I will try

392
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
She is still waiting for me

393
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
You are so lazy

394
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Listen

395
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Tonight is the birthday of the big lady

396
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Be more careful

397
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
And

398
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Don't go to the front yard to bump into your guests

399
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
You are all traitors

400
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The water is not full

401
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
Who is responsible?

402
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Lingling is responsible

403
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
It's cold these days

404
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,000
The river is frozen

405
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
We need to break the ice to make the water

406
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
I am not

407
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Good

408
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
You are lazy again

409
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,000
What time is it?

410
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
You didn't even jump the water in the house

411
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
You can even jump the water

412
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I think you are playing tricks on purpose

413
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Sir

414
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
I have been jumping the water all night

415
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
I can't eat anything

416
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,000
I am so weak

417
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,000
You dare to joke with me

418
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
I am not joking

419
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I am so weak

420
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You dare to joke with me

421
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,000
I am strong

422
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
I was the one who picked you up from the tree

423
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
And fed you

424
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
You are so arrogant

425
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
You are so low-key

426
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The water is frozen

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
I am not joking

428
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I am so weak

429
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I am so weak

430
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
I am so weak

431
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I am so weak

432
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
I am so weak

433
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I am so weak

434
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
I am so weak

435
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
I am so weak

436
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I am so weak

437
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I am so weak

438
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,000
I am so weak

439
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,000
I am so weak

440
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
I am so weak

441
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Don't be afraid

442
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Are you cold?

443
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I am a slave

444
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Sun Huan said

445
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
I won't be cold

446
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Are you feeling better?

447
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Are you feeling better?

448
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Shen Lang

449
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
How dare you hit me?

450
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Do you know who I am?

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
Please spare me

452
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
I am wrong

453
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Although he is not dead

454
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
He left with Lin in Sang Qi's blood

455
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Before Mingyue Villa

456
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
So that he can get rid of Lin Lu's identity

457
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,000
And live well

458
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Killing a person who has nothing to do with the police

459
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Can only be a moment of relief

460
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
But it may lead to a bad ending

461
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Please spare me

462
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Go

463
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,000
Will you go with me?

464
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Are you a guest in the villa?

465
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,000
I am Lin Lu

466
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
I want to listen to the director's orders

467
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,000
You are not Lin Lu

468
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,000
Haven't you eaten yet?

469
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
I have to pick up all the water tanks in the villa

470
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
To eat

471
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I'll take you to eat

472
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,000
I am sorry

473
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,000
I am sorry

474
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,000
I am sorry

475
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,000
I am sorry

476
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,000
I am sorry

477
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,000
I am sorry

478
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
I am sorry

479
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,000
I am sorry

480
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
I am sorry

481
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,000
I am sorry

482
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,000
I am sorry

483
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,000
I am sorry

484
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,000
I am sorry

485
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,000
I am sorry

486
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,000
I am sorry

487
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
I am sorry

488
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
I am sorry

489
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,000
I am sorry

490
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I am sorry

491
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I am sorry

492
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
You don't have to say you are not sick anymore

493
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,000
I won't let you get hurt again

494
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Sir, your dishes.

495
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Thank you.

496
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,000
Sir, enjoy.

497
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
You don't eat that much.

498
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Why are you only eating?

499
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,000
I'm not eating.

500
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm just eating.

501
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
I'm not eating.

502
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,000
I'm not eating.

503
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,000
I'm not eating.

504
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,000
I'm not eating.

505
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I'm not eating.

506
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Why are you only drinking porridge?

507
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,000
I can eat enough porridge.

508
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
I used to drink porridge all the time.

509
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,000
So this is the taste of the dessert.

510
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's so delicious.

511
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
It's not convenient for you to eat with a mask.

512
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Take it off.

513
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
No, no.

514
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,000
I have a mosquito on my face.

515
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It's ugly.

516
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
I'm afraid I'll scare you.

517
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,000
No.

518
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
I saw your eyes.

519
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,000
I knew you must be beautiful.

520
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:27,160
This is the

521
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Rosalina Route.

522
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Please don't go.

523
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:41,240
How beautiful the scenery!

524
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:43,960
Come on.

525
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,720
This dessert is really delicious.

526
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,240
Why do you treat me so well?

527
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,760
Or do you want me to do something?

528
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,480
You don't need to do anything.

529
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,840
I just want you.

530
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,600
Are you my 13th father?

531
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:15,800
You hope so?

532
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,600
It's good.

533
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:23,920
Why?

534
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,400
You will take me away, right?

535
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,080
You have left me for so many years.

536
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,680
You will compensate me, right?

537
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
How can I compensate you?

538
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,720
I want to wear beautiful clothes, eat delicious food,

539
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,800
and live in a big house.

540
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,440
I can sleep for two hours every day.

541
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,520
Okay, I promise you.

542
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,480
I will take you to buy clothes later, okay?

543
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,720
Okay, father.

544
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,720
Don't call me father.

545
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,760
If you don't tell me your name,

546
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,960
what should I call you?

547
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,280
If you know my name,

548
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,400
we will have a future together.

549
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,000
You have done so much for me.

550
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,600
I don't want to see you sacrifice yourself for me.

551
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,720
I just hope you can live well.

552
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,760
Even if you don't love me anymore.

553
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,080
Anyway, don't call me father.

554
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,400
Then...

555
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,920
call me your big brother, okay?

556
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,720
Okay.

557
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,600
What did you say?

558
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,320
Big brother.

559
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,400
You have never been me for thousands of years.

560
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,720
He is my big brother.

561
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,480
He gave me my life.

562
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Big brother.

563
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,160
You like to eat snacks so much.

564
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:04,680
Back then,

565
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,080
the first thing big brother took me to eat

566
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,480
was snacks.

567
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:10,440
I see.

568
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,280
He mentioned big brother every time.

569
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,520
It was me.

570
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,040
The clues have been revealed.

571
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,960
It's so obvious.

572
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,360
But I was so obsessed with it.

573
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,120
I just found it out now.

574
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,200
What's wrong with you?

575
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,640
Did I make you unhappy by calling you big brother?

576
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:32,320
No.

577
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,640
Then can I call you big brother?

578
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,200
Okay.

579
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,920
Big brother.

580
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,960
Li'er.

581
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,200
Big brother.

582
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,160
Thank you for taking me to the hospital to heal.

583
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,880
And bought me new clothes.

584
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,760
The clothes are beautiful.

585
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,920
I like it.

586
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,640
It's good that you like it.

587
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,680
Today is the Fourth Day of the Spring.

588
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,760
It is said that

589
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:26,280
this festival was set for the chaos pearl.

590
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,560
They said that 6,000 years ago,

591
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,760
it was the power of the chaos pearl that

592
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,160
established the Immortality Formation.

593
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,360
That's why the human world

594
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,120
is not attacked by the Dark Clan.

595
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:41,600
But actually,

596
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,640
the Human Clan never asked the will of the chaos pearl.

597
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,160
Never asked if it would be sacrificed.

598
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,320
Chaos pearl.

599
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,120
Isn't it a pearl?

600
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,240
Will it talk?

601
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,760
Big brother.

602
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,160
What's wrong with you?

603
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,880
Are you sad?

604
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,440
As long as you are happy,

605
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,560
I won't be sad.

606
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,320
If the Fourth Day of the Spring

607
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,280
can see fireworks together like this,

608
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,240
it will be great.

609
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,480
Calm down.

610
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
Let us go together.

611
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,000
Crowded.

612
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,520
Mmmm.

613
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:53,320
Fall in love with you all the time.

614
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,480
Fall in love with you all the time.

615
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
You can see the brilliant fireworks.

616
00:39:58,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Really?

617
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
Thank you, big brother.

618
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:11,680
Li'er.

619
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,480
I'm sorry.

620
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,880
It's two different things to take you with you.

621
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:19,640
If you stay with Xie Xuesheng,

622
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,960
there will still be unknown risks.

623
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,560
I will take you with me.

624
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:26,920
But in the future,

625
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,800
you must be alone.

626
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,520
Forget me.

627
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Live well.

628
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,600
Although I want to take you away now,

629
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,880
the soul-searching ring on your feet

630
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,840
limits your range of activity.

631
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,640
If we leave forcibly,

632
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,800
it will endanger your life.

633
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,800
Although there is only one day,

634
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:58,480
I am already very happy.

635
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,560
So, big brother,

636
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,040
you don't have to lie to me.

637
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,240
Even if you really can't take me away,

638
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,960
I won't blame you.

639
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,720
I didn't lie to you.

640
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,840
I really want to take you away.

641
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:12,920
So I'm going to find the High Master

642
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,960
and let him untie the soul-searching ring for you.

643
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
Really?

644
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,880
But the Master is a magic mirror.

645
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,600
He's amazing.

646
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,240
If it really doesn't work,

647
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,160
don't force yourself.

648
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,040
Don't worry.

649
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,960
I will take you away.

650
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,600
Master,

651
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,160
Young Master of Snow Tower wants to see you.

652
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,200
Xie Xuechen?

653
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Why did he come here all of a sudden?

654
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
Ask him in.

655
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Yes.

656
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,880
I envy you, Miss.

657
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,080
You have a big feast every year.

658
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,400
But you have to make us suffer.

659
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,320
For this day,

660
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,960
you have to be busy from morning to night.

661
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:22,960
I'm busy.

662
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Enough.

663
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Our clan is a low-ranking clan.

664
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,960
At least we can have a meal at the Mingyue Villa.

665
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,960
When Sang Qi was blood-sweeping at the Mingyue Villa,

666
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,960
it was in the high mountain town.

667
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
Is it today?

668
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:36,960
Sang Qi has been planning for this battle for many years.

669
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
It's impossible to stop him.

670
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,960
Feng Xiang's past is in front of her eyes.

671
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,960
The wheel is also told repeatedly

672
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
not to change the past.

673
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
As long as we can take Ling'er away before the incident,

674
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
we can't let her fall into Sang Qi's hands.

675
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
We have achieved our goal.

676
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
He has done so many dirty things.

677
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
He is very rich.

678
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
We need to be experienced in front of him.

679
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
We can't let him find out that Ling'er is the Soul-guarding Bead.

680
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I'm sorry.

681
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
I'm sorry.

682
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I'm sorry.

683
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I'm sorry.

684
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
I'm sorry.

685
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
I'm sorry.

686
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
I'm sorry.

687
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
I'm sorry.

688
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
I'm sorry.

689
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
I'm sorry.

690
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
I'm sorry.

691
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
I'm sorry.

692
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
I'm sorry.

693
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm sorry.

694
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm sorry.

695
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
I'm sorry.

696
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I'm sorry.

698
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm sorry.

699
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm sorry.

701
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm sorry.

702
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm sorry.

703
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I'm sorry.

704
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:40,960
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
I'm sorry.

707
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,960
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,960
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,960
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,960
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:58,960
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,960
I'm sorry.

715
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,960
I'm sorry.

716
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
I'm sorry.

717
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,960
I'm sorry.

718
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:08,960
I'm sorry.

719
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,960
I'm sorry.

720
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,960
I'm sorry.

721
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,960
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,960
I'm sorry.

723
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,960
I'm sorry.

724
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,960
I'm sorry.

725
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,960
I'm sorry.

726
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,960
I'm sorry.

727
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,960
I'm sorry.

728
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,960
I'm sorry.

729
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,960
I'm sorry.

730
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,960
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:36,960
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:38,960
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,960
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,960
I'm sorry.
