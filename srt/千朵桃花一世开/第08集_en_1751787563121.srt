The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
Is this right?

4
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,400
Is it much better now?

5
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,680
Don't worry.

6
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,960
I won't tell anyone.

7
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,000
Thank you.

8
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,680
Today is the first day I come here.

9
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,080
Elder Cang arranged me to stay at the disciple's room.

10
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,800
I'll be sent to the room later.

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:19,840
Tomorrow is the chief's funeral.

12
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,200
Rest early.

13
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,800
Thank you for taking me here.

14
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Otherwise I won't find her when I come.

15
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,640
You don't want to посkan her?

16
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,400
No.

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,760
When my father died,

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
he stayed at house Seauth Dallas.

19
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,200
He knows bothVery well the feeling of love and consecutive love.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,720
My dad really loves her no matter what.

21
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,800
Besides,

22
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,400
his generation is larger now.

23
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,680
I understand it all.

24
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,240
I forgot.

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,440
Master Nan has experienced the father's death.

26
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,880
I heard your father was killed by the Spirit Clan.

27
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,680
Did you catch the murderer to avenge him?

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,360
The one who should die

29
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,320
is dead.

30
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,000
I avenged him when I should.

31
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,800
Good.

32
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,680
I'll send you back to the Jilu.

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,880
How much do you like Xie Xuechen?

34
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,120
Why do you ask me this?

35
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,120
I'm just wondering

36
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,080
why you like her so much.

37
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,800
Maybe

38
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,400
you knew her before.

39
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,800
You told me her reaction.

40
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,600
I've been thinking

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,600
why you see her eyes

42
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,320
with longing and sadness,

43
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,880
not just love and admiration.

44
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,080
There are many things

45
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,320
hidden in her eyes.

46
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,600
It's just that the one who is in love is lost.

47
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,040
The one who is in love is lost.

48
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,040
Master Nan is so smart.

49
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,560
I have nothing to hide.

50
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,560
But she doesn't remember it.

51
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,000
Why don't you tell her?

52
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,320
I wanted to tell her.

53
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,080
But I think

54
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,480
she has suffered enough.

55
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,320
I don't think

56
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm happy

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,320
to know her.

58
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,160
Brother.

59
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,200
She doesn't need to remember.

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,640
I owe her.

61
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,160
I'll remember it.

62
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,640
Really?

63
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,160
What about me?

64
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,440
Do you remember me?

65
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,960
Your reaction

66
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,120
is enough to tell me.

67
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,600
Although you've changed,

68
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,840
I can still feel

69
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,040
familiar breath and eyes from you.

70
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,720
I didn't know your name at that time.

71
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,840
But I remember

72
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,160
there's a lock on your feet.

73
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,680
And there's a golden mark on your face.

74
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,800
I was just 13 years old.

75
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,040
My father took me to the Mingyue Villa

76
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,240
to pick up the wonton.

77
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Everyone looked at me

78
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,280
with pity.

79
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,360
But only you could see me.

80
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,520
You know I don't need to be pitied.

81
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,920
You see me as a normal person.

82
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,560
You promised me

83
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,000
I'll give you candy.

84
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,400
And you

85
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,880
will give me a little bit of love.

86
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,600
I'm here to be your friend.

87
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,840
Okay?

88
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,360
I heard that

89
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,680
love is precious.

90
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,240
You give me a little bit of your candy.

91
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,520
I'll give you a little bit of my love.

92
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,360
Okay?

93
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,640
You are...

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,400
that young man?

95
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,920
It's embarrassing.

96
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,600
But...

97
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,440
So you're going to break your promise?

98
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,200
You don't want to give me a little bit of love?

99
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:17,800
I...

100
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,560
The guy is a lie,

101
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,000
the 85% of women

102
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,160
on the date

103
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,240
are almost the same as the crush.

104
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,240
You were just joking.

105
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:52,080
I'll definitely return it to you in the future.

106
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:57,080
But why did you choose to meet me at this time?

107
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,080
You just said that

108
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,080
there are some things that are always in your heart

109
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,080
that will cause trouble.

110
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Miss Mu, I'm still a little curious.

111
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,080
You were in Mingyue Villa.

112
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,080
Why did you go to the dark domain?

113
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,080
And you and Xue Chen...

114
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,080
There are some secrets that can be told,

115
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,080
but some secrets that can't be shared.

116
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,080
You are a man of common sense.

117
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,080
You should be able to understand.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,080
It doesn't matter.

119
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,080
Let's go, old friend.

120
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
The Xie family on the Snow Gorge

121
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
will be the only unchanging flag

122
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,080
in this ever-changing world.

123
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,080
As long as we don't change,

124
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,080
we will look up at the mortal world of the Snow Gorge

125
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,080
and it will never end.

126
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
I gave you Wan Ren

127
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,080
to entrust you with the safety of my family.

128
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,080
Wan Ren and Yu Ling

129
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,080
are all trustworthy.

130
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
I believe

131
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,080
that you can do better than me.

132
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
Father,

133
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,080
I will find my way

134
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,080
and live up to your expectations.

135
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,080
The Xie family

136
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,080
is the most powerful and powerful

137
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,080
and the most powerful

138
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,080

and the most powerful

141
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,080
and the most powerful

142
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,080
and the most powerful

143
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,080
and the most powerful

144
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,080
and the most powerful

145
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,080
and the most powerful

146
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,080

00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,080
and the most powerful

150
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,080
and the most powerful

151
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:56,080
Wagering brake

152
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,600
Right now,

153
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I've been a leader of the Immortal Alliance for a thousand years.

154
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,600
I'm not relying on the support of a few people.

155
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,600
I'm relying on the support of all the members.

156
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I'm with the wind and snow.

157
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,600
I can handle all the difficulties.

158
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,600
I can also hold the sword.

159
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,600
I hope that I can never regret my decision.

160
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
Terry.

161
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,600
Our 월 Door clan will be alive,

162
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,760
wish you

163
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:30,160
a small dab of plum

164
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,920
Shall I use this weapon to normal demoralization?

165
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,240
Will you use your wise and honest words

166
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,660
to federalize a war dries in pieces?

167
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:49,420
Will you use your uhhh cypress lands to

168
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,720

spiritual secrets?

171
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:53,800
So that,

172
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,760
I can test my level of practice

173
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,080
a

174
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,760
should

175
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,760
step on

176
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:11,920

182
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,520
I'm afraid I won't be able to make it in time.

183
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Minister Yu.

184
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
Minister Yu.

185
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,520
City Leader.

186
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Please sit.

187
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
Please.

188
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,520
I don't know why you're here.

189
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,520
I'm here to see you.

190
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
I'm here to see you.

I don't know why you're here.

192
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Do you remember that

193
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:59,520
we played a game of chess ten years ago?

194
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,520
If you hadn't mentioned it,

195
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,520
I would have forgotten it.

196
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
I remember that day,

197
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
you insisted on playing chess with me.

198
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,520
If I remember correctly,

199
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
I was still a gentleman.

200
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
You haven't finished the game.

201
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,520
How can you judge the winner so easily?

202
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
How about today?

203
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,520
How about today?

204
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
We'll finish this game.

205
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:21,520
How about that?

206
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:24,520
Okay.

207
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,520
Xue Chen.

208
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,520
It seems that your chess

209
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,520
has not improved at all in the past ten years.

210
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
Speaking of chess,

211
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,520
it's been ten years.

212
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
You're really good, Minister Yu.

213
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
You never let me down.

214
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Xue Chen values winning and losing.

215
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
I think he must have made a bet

216
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,520
on this game of chess.

217
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,520
That's right.

218
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,520
There is a bet.

219
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
Can you tell me about it?

220
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
If I win,

221
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,520
tell me where the chief of Xiu Xuan is.

222
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
If I lose,

223
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,520
I'll give you the master's order.

224
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
He's out of spiritual power now.

225
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Go!

226
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Your spiritual power has recovered.

227
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,520
It has completely recovered

228
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,520
before reaching Yong Xue Chen.

229
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
You should know the law of Yong Xue Chen

230
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
best.

231
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,520
You colluded with the chief of Xiu Xuan

232
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,520
and murdered the chief.

233
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,520
What crime is it to mess up the human world?

234
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,520
You should know very well

235
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,520
that I'm here.

236
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,520
You can't escape from this door.

237
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
You'd better play this game with me.

238
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,520
Sometimes,

239
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,520
there should be a way.

240
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Why?

241
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,520
Say it.

242
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
It's a begin-another day.

243
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Help.

244
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Do you have an advantage?

245
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
I'm the chief of Xiu Xuan's manor.

246
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
How can you let him go?

247
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,520
This is not my fault.

248
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
You boss are so great.

249
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
Is that for that ?

250
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,520
Yes.

251
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,520
It is for attack.

252
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Have all swaps been threw away?

253
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,120
But my disciples are 210 people.

254
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,640
They can't be revived.

255
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,280
I...

256
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,040
I can never forget their eyes.

257
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,840
To you,

258
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,840
the An Clan of Chusa is a simple game.

259
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,840
But to us,

260
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,720
they are so powerful.

261
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,840
The An Clan of Chusa is so powerful.

262
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,080
It's impossible to separate them.

263
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,520
They are in danger.

264
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,000
They want me to help them.

265
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,560
I don't want to die.

266
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:26,880
So...

267
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:32,600
So I have to leave.

268
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,840
You're afraid of death?

269
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,040
I am.

270
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,360
You're a good sister.

271
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
This is the difference between you and us.

272
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,720
Death is a normal and meaningless thing

273
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,200
to you.

274
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,120
But to us,

275
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:57,120
living is what I want.

276
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,880
What do you want?

277
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:06,240
Peace in the world.

278
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,760
Peace in the world?

279
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,000
You and I are the leader.

280
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,080
What's the price for the blood of everyone?

281
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,280
You don't want the world to be peaceful.

282
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,040
You just surrender to your fear.

283
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,520
Who killed the leader?

284
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
I don't know.

285
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,040
Ayi.

286
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,240
I'm on the ship of Xiuquan Pavilion.

287
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,200
I found the guard who asked me to lure the leader out.

288
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,080
Take the disciple away.

289
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,880
Yes, Your Majesty.

290
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,240
Use the Immortal Pavilion to guard.

291
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,960
The leader is about to leave.

292
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,000
You guys go with me to prepare.

293
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,760
You expose the leader to the enemy.

294
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,720
Yes.

295
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,240
He was killed without any defense.

296
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,840
What else did you do?

297
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
I put the barrier on the outside.

298
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,320
The noise inside can't be heard.

299
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,880
It hinders the possibility of the leader to be rescued.

300
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:18,920
I don't know what happened later.

301
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Where is the leader of the Pavilion?

302
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,800
The leader of the Pavilion is hidden.

303
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
No one knows where he is.

304
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:43,520
I didn't send him a message in person.

305
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,200
Xue Chen.

306
00:20:51,120 --> 00:21:00,920
Is this chess game so important to us?

307
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:06,040
The Ling and An clans have joined hands.

308
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
You are strong.

309
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,840
With your strength,

310
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,960
can you save the world?

311
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Do you have to...

312
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:50,560
Do you have to kill the enemy?

313
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,760
It doesn't matter.

314
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,640
What matters is that you have made a choice.

315
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,640
Go.

316
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,440
Erhu.

317
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,080
You want to fight with the people who fought with you.

318
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
You want to play the last game.

319
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:34,640
Go.

320
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,720
Maybe you are right.

321
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,000
I'm not good enough.

322
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,600
I can't protect everyone.

323
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:02,200
If I could feel your fear earlier,

324
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,640
maybe you wouldn't have to go to this world.

325
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,160
Xue Chen.

326
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,880
The An clans have joined hands.

327
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,520
Okay.

328
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Leave it to me.

329
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,640
Sang Qi and Xiu Xian Pavilion won't stop here.

330
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,880
After the clans arrive,

331
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,640
they will start a war.

332
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,440
From tonight,

333
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,640
the whole country is allowed to form an alliance.

334
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,840
No matter where they are,

335
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,080
they must be under surveillance.

336
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Yes.

337
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,200
City Leader.

338
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,440
I have one more thing.

339
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,040
That new disciple...

340
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
I met him in the two mountains.

341
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,240
I was in a tough situation on my way back to the city.

342
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
I was injured.

343
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,640
He never thought of me.

344
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
Now he is determined to ask me.

345
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,840
But he is a little bit hesitant.

346
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Please be patient and teach him.

347
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
Thank you.

348
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,240
Slowly.

349
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,200
Xie Xue Chen.

350
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,240
You were caught, right?

351
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:58,240
As the City Leader of Snow Tower,

352
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,840
you killed Ink Dalian.

353
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,400
I've never said that.

354
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,640
I don't kill people.

355
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,640
I don't care about them.

356
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
What about the spirit clan?

357
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
I will be with them forever.

358
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,640
But your sword spirit temple doesn't think so.

359
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,640
The guilty people are enjoying themselves.

360
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,640
The innocent spirit clan are suffering.

361
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,640
I can't just leave it as it is.

362
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,640
But I will think of a way to change it.

363
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:27,640
How to change it?

364
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,640
From the moment you become a good person,

365
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,640
I will be a good student.

366
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
Why are you scolding me?

367
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,640
I will be a good student.

368
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I will let everyone know that

369
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,640
the spirit clan is not all cruel and brutal.

370
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,640
You misunderstood me.

371
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
I am the representative of cruelty and brutal.

372
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,640
My good temper is only for you.

373
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,640
Unless you give me some rewards.

374
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,640
What reward do you want?

375
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
What do you think?

376
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,640
Dream.

377
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,640
From tomorrow,

378
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
teach me to be a good student.

379
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,640
I will make mistakes and remember them.

380
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
I will remember them ten times.

381
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,640
I will be expelled from Yongxue City.

382
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
You are the one who dare to talk to me like this.

383
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
If it's someone else,

384
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,640
I will make sure that he can't see the sun of tomorrow.

385
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,640
I thought I could get along with Xie Xuechen

386
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,640
after entering Yongxue City.

387
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,640
I didn't expect that I would have to go to class every day.

388
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
Mu Xuanling,

389
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,640
tell everyone why you are going to be a student of Yongxue City.

390
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I am from Yongxue City.

391
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,640
I was adopted by my father since I was a child.

392
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,640
He is not in good health and has a bad temper.

393
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,640
He looks like a dead person every day.

394
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,640
We don't have any grass.

395
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
We are poor.

396
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,640
We can only survive by fighting and killing.

397
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
In order to make me sell my life for him,

398
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
my father threw me into the ruins

399
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,640
and used all kinds of means to force me to become stronger.

400
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,640
I am lucky to have you, Master Xie.

401
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
You saved me from the evil spirit.

402
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
I am so happy.

403
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,640
I am so happy.

404
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
I am so happy.

405
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
I am so happy.

406
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
I am so happy.

407
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,640
I am so happy.

408
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,640
I am so happy.

409
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,640
I am so happy.

410
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
I am so happy.

411
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
I am so happy.

412
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
I am so happy.

413
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,640
Master Xie saved me from the fire.

414
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,640
What happened next?

415
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
So, in order to repay your kindness,

416
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
I am here.

417
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,640
That's good.

418
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,640
The five sects of the Alliance,

419
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,640
the Yanzhou of the Xuan Tian Sect,

420
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,640
are specialized in dark clan.

421
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,640
The spiritual flowers and grass of Jinghua Palace

422
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,640
are all unique.

423
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,640
The Bixiao Palace is experienced in magic.

424
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,640
The Lingju Island is a natural power.

425
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
And I, Yongxue City,

426
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,640
have been trained in swordplay.

427
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
You said you were taught by someone.

428
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,640
Now, let me see your cultivation

429
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,640
and foundation.

430
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,640
I can't let them find out I am the spiritual flower.

431
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,640
What if they drive me out of the city?

432
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,640
I haven't seen it yet.

433
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,640
It's not convenient to show it.

434
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,640
It's okay.

435
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,640
As long as you have it in your heart.

436
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,640
The cultivation of the Alliance,

437
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,640
in terms of what you have,

438
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
you can get the golden pill,

439
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
the central cause,

440
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
and the magic mirror.

441
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
The mirror of magic mirror

442
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,640
is what all cultivators want in their hearts.

443
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,640
The cultivator's mind,

444
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
mind or magic

445
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
can be seen.

446
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
This is the most abundant place

447
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,640
for the spirit of Yongxue City.

448
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,640
It's the first step

449
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,640
for you to cultivate the magic mirror.

450
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,640
You can get what you want in your heart

451
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,640
and get the picture.

452
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,640
So,

453
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,640
you need to train hard

454
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
and set a good foundation.

455
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,640
It's hard to cultivate the mind,

456
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,640
but you don't need to be a doorkeeper.

457
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,640
You just need to get rid of your thoughts

458
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,640
and don't think about something in your heart.

459
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,640
So that you can

460
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,640
draw a picture.

461
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,640
Try it.

462
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,640
Am I pretty strong

463
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
in this picture?

464
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,640
Very handsome.

465
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,640
You should know that

466
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
the power of magic is not

467
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
the power of the magic mirror itself.

468
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,640
It's the power of cultivators.

469
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,640
So,

470
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,640
you can't slacken your cultivation.

471
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
I hope that from today on,

472
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,640
you can tell yourself not to make trouble.

473
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,640
Don't do anything

474
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,640
that will be disrespectful to the city chief.

475
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,640
I'm sorry.

476
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
That's all for today.

477
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,640
I'm leaving.

478
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,640
Thank you, Chief.

479
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,640
Mu Xuan Ling.

480
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,640
What else do you want?

481
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,640
I'm busy.

482
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
I forgot to tell you

483
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,640
that you are in a hurry.

484
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,640
The new disciple of Yong Xue City

485
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,640
can only cultivate wood

486
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,640
in the mid-autumn and mid-autumn.

487
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
He needs to rest for an hour every day.

488
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Until noon,

489
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:07,640
he needs to do some cleaning and cleaning

490
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,640
according to the order.

491
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
He needs to do some cleaning and cleaning.

492
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:12,640
Today,

493
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
it's your turn to clean.

494
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Can I use magic to clean?

495
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
At this time,

496
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
the elder should say no.

497
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
Then I said,

498
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
I was joking.

499
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Then,

500
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
where should I clean today?

501
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,640
Where should I clean?

502
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
You look a little annoying.

503
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:54,640
After the city chief,

504
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
do you have more to worry about?

505
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
This...

506
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,640
This is mine.

507
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
You are thirsty.

508
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,640
I sweep 13 yards today.

509
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
I added a piece of wool.

510
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
Fortunately,

511
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,640
the last one is here.

512
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
I'll clean it.

513
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,640
Then why do you

514
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
clean the wool first

515
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,640
and come to me?

516
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Isn't this

517
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,640
the task ordered by the village chief?

518
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,640
I want to stay with you for a while.

519
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,640
I thought I was special.

520
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,640
At least I can help you.

521
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
I didn't expect it.

522
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,640
We are the same person.

523
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:58,640
Are you sure

524
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
you can be the same person

525
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,640
to me?

526
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
Did you wash your hands?

527
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:06,640
I'm kidding.

528
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,640
I'm...

529
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,640
I love you.

530
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,640
I have to do it.

531
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
How can I sweep the wool?

532
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
The south village chief lives in the Snow Pavilion.

533
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,640
You live in the Snow Tower.

534
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:22,640
You are the only one who is the most popular.

535
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Even the trees in this yard...

536
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Why do you have the Xuanling Tree here?

537
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
This tree only grows in the dark jade.

538
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Only the dark jade has seeds.

539
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,640
Have you been to the dark jade before?

540
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
Of course not.

541
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,640
I've been to the dark jade before.

542
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I've been to the dark jade before.

543
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
I've been to the dark jade before.

544
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
Of course not.

545
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,640
I heard from the chief that

546
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,640
this tree grew here many years ago.

547
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,640
I don't know why it grew here.

548
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:55,640
It's called Xuanling.

549
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,640
Is it your name?

550
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
It's a pity.

551
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
This tree won't bloom in the mortal world.

552
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:09,640
I really want you to see the flowers.

553
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
They are very beautiful.

554
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,640
I think she really can't adapt to the life in the Snow Tower.

555
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
I'm the one who arranged it.

556
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,640
I think

557
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
since the dark jade can grow here,

558
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,640
you can also find your own place in the Snow Tower.

559
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,640
Follow me.

560
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,640
First, lie down and then get into the room.

561
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,640
Then...

562
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
Thank you, Zhen. I'm coming.

563
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
You...

564
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,640
You...

565
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Do you like this sword?

566
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,640
Do you think I don't like it?

567
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
If you ask me like this,

568
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
do you think I don't like it?

569
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
Yesterday, in the sword,

570
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,640
you didn't equip the sword.

571
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
It's very important to rest in the Snow Tower.

572
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,640
If you don't like this,

573
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:26,640
see if you like it.

574
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,640
These swords are the same as you.

575
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,640
They are too rigid.

576
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,640
I'm very touched.

577
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,640
But they don't suit me.

578
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,640
Follow me.

579
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Where are you going?

580
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,640
Sword seed.

581
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,640
Every sword here

582
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,640
is the sword of Senior Yong Xue Chen and his disciples.

583
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,640
They followed the sword making

584
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
like someone else.

585
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,640
They finally stayed in the sword.

586
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
Like a windmill.

587
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,640
The new disciples of Yong Xue Chen

588
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,640
can choose one of them

589
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:21,640
as their own sword.

590
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,640
So their former masters have already...

591
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
From the beginning to the end,

592
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,640
they will choose the sword.

593
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,640
I understand.

594
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,640
You can't be?

595
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
You don't like the sword of Yong Xue Chen.

596
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,640
Choose one here.

597
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:55,640
Do you often bring people to choose swords?

598
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,640
You are the first one.

599
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,640
So many swords.

600
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
How can I know which one to choose?

601
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,640
You can feel the smell of the sword

602
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
and choose the one that connects you the most.

603
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,640
You can feel the smell of the sword.

604
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:28,640
Do you like it?

605
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:30,640
I like it.

606
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
I like it.

607
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
I like it.

608
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:44,640
I like it.

609
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,640
I like it.

610
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,640
I like it.

611
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,640
I like it.

612
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
But...

613
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,640
It's your heartbeat.

614
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Xie Xue Chen.

615
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
I think you are seducing me.

616
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
You will ruin my study.

617
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,640
Stop talking nonsense.

618
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,640
Go and choose the sword.

619
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:50,640
This one.

620
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:56,640
My first sword.

621
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,640
What should I call it?

622
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,640
I'll call it...

623
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,640
The first sword.

624
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,640
Welcome, Your Majesty.

625
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,640
Your Majesty.

626
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:18,640
The letter from the Immortal Pavilion.

627
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,640
Xie Dao Cheng is dead.

628
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,640
Xie Xue Chen is dead.

629
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Xie Dao Cheng is dead.

630
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,640
Xie Dao Cheng is dead.

631
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,640
Xie Xue Chen has been appointed as the City Leader.

632
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,640
And he has passed the letter of Li Huo.

633
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:30,640
The five sects of the Immortal Alliance are about to gather in Snow City.

634
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,640
Such a grand event.

635
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:39,640
It seems that you want to return to your home.

636
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
How is Xie Xue Chen's spiritual power?

637
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,640
I... I don't know yet.

638
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,640
Zun Shang.

639
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,640
Why do we have to rely on the Xiu Xian Pavilion?

640
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
Isn't it over if we leave this matter to the Shadow Detector?

641
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
I have other uses.

642
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:05,640
Tell the Xiu Xian Pavilion to find out the power of Xie Xue Chen as soon as possible.

643
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,640
Yes.

644
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,640
Zun Shang.

645
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,640
After the search, are you going to go to Snow City in person?

646
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,640
No.

647
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:16,640
I'm still waiting for something.

648
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,640
It's almost there.

649
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,640
It's almost there.

650
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,640
I'm here.

651
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:23,640
