1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You've done a lot of evil things.

3
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're so cruel!

4
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I know.

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Who is it?

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
This is his second time

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
showing his true self.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
I am the Taoism Grandmaster

11
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Today I will show you

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
the Taoism Grandmaster

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
who has been around for hundreds of years.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You've been hiding from them for a long time.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You're a coward.

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're a coward.

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
You're a coward.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You're a coward.

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This is your heaven.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Jun Jun!

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Go!

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Jun Jun!

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Go!

24
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is the Young Master of Snowblade City,

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xie Xuechen.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This is the Dragon Abyss.

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
It was the place where the God of Death

28
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
buried his bones ten thousand years ago.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Every hour,

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
the God of Death

31
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
would explode with anger.

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
He would eat the original God

33
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
and get hurt.

34
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The God-Devouring Platform

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
in the God Realm

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
is also called

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
the place of two great horrors.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
No one has ever

39
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
stayed here for three months.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But you,

41
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you've been here for seven months.

42
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You're indeed the God of Heaven

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
in the legends.

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You're indeed the God of Heaven

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
in the legends.

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You're indeed the God of Heaven

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
in the legends.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You're indeed the God of Heaven

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
in the legends.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
The God of Heaven in the legends

51
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
is the strongest of all.

52
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The Young Master's appearance

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is unforgettable

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
and unforgettable.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Have we met before?

56
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I heard that you've been in the beast world for seven days.

57
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You haven't given up a bit.

58
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Your bones are very hard.

59
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Your bones are so hard.

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But your lips are quite soft.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
What a pity.

62
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Who told you to use your spirit power

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
to repair the God-Devouring Platform?

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now,

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
you can't break the seal of Sang Qi.

66
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You can't break the seal of Sang Qi.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You can't break the seal of Sang Qi.

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
can't break the seal of Sang Qi.

70
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You

71
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
can't even give up your life

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
for the sake of the Human Clan.

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why bother?

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Such a handsome man

75
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
is such a pity to die.

76
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Yes, Saintess.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
As long as he's willing to surrender,

78
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
we'll definitely clean him up

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
and send him to you.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Go.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Go.

82
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Go.

83
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Episode 16

84
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Your Majesty,

85
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
the envoy of the First Immortal Pavilion wants to see you.

86
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
The chief of the First Immortal Pavilion is so anxious.

87
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He must come to me

88
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
when I close the coffin.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You are so powerful.

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You can even draw out the illusion of separation

91
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
by closing the coffin.

92
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is it possible that

93
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
my ally

94
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
wants to use this opportunity

95
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
to investigate my situation?

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You are so great.

97
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The chief sent me here

98
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
just to ask about

99
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
the task I entrusted you with.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
How is the progress?

101
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's not bad.

102
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's not bad at all.

103
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I've been a little worried.

104
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
How is the progress?

105
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Xie Xuechen

106
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
has been trapped in the Garden for seven days.

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
He still hasn't disappeared.

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
No one can live in the Garden for three days.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Xie Xuechen has clues of the Chaos Bead.

110
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
He can't die yet.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Is your Human Clan

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
so impatient?

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't forget, Zensheng.

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
If you can't get the Chaos Bead,

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
the First Immortal Pavilion

116
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
won't take the risk

117
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
to open the barrier for you.

118
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
As long as the barrier exists,

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
the Dark Clan will never be able to cross

120
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
the two mountains

121
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and cross the Human Realm.

122
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Go back and tell His Majesty

123
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
that I've promised him this.

124
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Then he will be satisfied.

125
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Don't be too much in the future.

126
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Can you give me your sincerity now?

127
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
No.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The Chaos Bead is a rare treasure.

129
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's rare in the world.

130
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
It can help the Dark Clan of Gao Jie

131
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
to train their head shadow.

132
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Although their body can't get out of the First Immortal Pavilion,

133
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
it can make their head shadow

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
reach the Human Realm.

135
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Human Clan?

136
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Master once said that

137
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the Human Clan is hypocritical.

138
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The First Alliance is despicable.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
You fell into their trap

140
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
because you believed the Alliance

141
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
and lost your right arm.

142
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You hate the Human Clan,

143
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
but you're the First Alliance.

144
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's your wish to fight against the Human Realm.

145
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I thought you were worried

146
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
that I was a coward

147
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
and wouldn't let me join your plan.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
But now,

149
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
you're the one

150
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
who hates the Human Clan the most.

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You don't want me to help you.

152
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
It seems that in your heart,

153
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not even as good as a human.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Do you know who he is?

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
He's a man of the Alliance.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
What do you think?

157
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I know what you want.

158
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
There's one thing

159
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
that we need to cooperate with them to get.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
That is

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
the ancient magic weapon, the Chaos Bead.

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
It's said that the ancient time

163
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
was the beginning of chaos.

164
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The second day of the second day,

165
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the three realms were saved.

166
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
But the chaos didn't disappear.

167
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Instead, they became two magic weapons,

168
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
the Chaos Bead and the Chaos Bead.

169
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
They protected the heaven with each other.

170
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ten thousand years ago,

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the Chaos Bead fell into the mortal world

172
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
because of the ancient heaven.

173
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Thousands of years later, the Human Clan was found.

174
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The Human Clan established the First Alliance

175
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
and used the power of the Chaos Bead

176
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
to protect the barrier of the Immortals.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
They blocked the dark clan

178
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
from going out of the dark domain.

179
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
The Chaos Bead is a magical weapon

180
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that can carry the power of the Chaos Bead.

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The Alliance is very powerful.

182
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
The Chaos Bead is placed in the Pillar of Snow Tower.

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
To open the Pillar,

184
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
the five sects must have the order

185
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
to imprison Xie Xuechen.

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Isn't it to force the Alliance

187
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
to open the Pillar and get the beads?

188
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Very good.

189
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
But you're only half right.

190
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
There are other people who want the Chaos Bead.

191
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Since both sides

192
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
have what they want,

193
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
they naturally

194
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
have to use it.

195
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
You went to see Xie Xuechen

196
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
because you wanted to get the beads?

197
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I went to see Xie Xuechen

198
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
to ask for the whereabouts

199
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
of the Alliance's order

200
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
and share my worries.

201
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So to say,

202
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
that day, in order to arrest Xie Xuechen,

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I was seriously injured.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Do you feel better?

205
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Why are you suddenly

206
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
concerned about me?

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
The grace of raising a child

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
will be forgotten someday.

209
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I've been thinking

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
how to repay you.

211
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
You didn't do anything unnecessary, did you?

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Of course not.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Honorable Superior, Xie Xuechen is here!

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
No need, Master.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
You can just stay here and get your wounds treated.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll go and deal with him.

217
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll go and deal with him.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll go and deal with him.

219
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll go and deal with him.

220
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll go and deal with him.

221
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
I'll go and deal with him.

222
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Go.

223
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Jun Tian!

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Jun Tian!

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Where is Sang Qi?

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
We really are fated to meet again.

227
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We really are fated to meet again.

228
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
It's you.

229
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

231
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Young Sect Leader, you...

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Are you looking for me?

233
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Young Sect Leader is in such a hurry.

234
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Is it because you're so attached to me

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
that you can't help but think about me?

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You really don't understand the meaning of love at all.

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
You really don't understand the meaning of love at all.

238
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

239
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

240
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

243
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

244
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

246
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

248
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

249
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

250
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

251
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm Mu Xuan Ling, the Saintess of Dark

252
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:58,260
labeled as a

253
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,560
Young Jesus, it's so hard to escape.

254
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,720
The moves on this one

255
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,000
tell me you have the gdy.

256
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,840
Then thank you, Young Lord

257
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,640
for backing me along.

258
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,360
As you know,

259
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,960
a close couple grows ten million.

260
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

261
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You've been kind to me for 10 days and half a month.

262
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
But you didn't show any affection at all.

263
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
What did you eat at the meeting?

264
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Why do you treat me like an enemy?

265
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I even put on some white clothes to save you.

266
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I couldn't explain it to you because there was a secret officer.

267
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
The medicine I gave you is called Half-day Fanghua.

268
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
After taking it, you can quickly recover your power.

269
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
But you need to pay a little price.

270
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What price?

271
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
The effect can only last for half an hour.

272
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'm afraid it's already the limit.

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
And...

274
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:32,000
From now on, you will be a powerful flying man in the next 10 days.

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Xie Xuechen!

276
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Xie Xuechen, I can finally kill you now.

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Zhan Ying, leave.

278
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I really want to kill Xie Xuechen.

279
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
But I was kidnapped.

280
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
He will kill me.

281
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
So?

282
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You can't be so reckless.

284
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Why are you...

285
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You're not here.

286
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Zhan Ying has no desire to fight.

287
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
It's easy to deal with him.

288
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
But you're not curious.

289
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,000
How did I get out of the palace?

290
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
When I was in Rongyuan, I knew you weren't from the Dark Clan.

291
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The Dark Clan doesn't have a heart.

292
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
But you do.

293
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,000
You and Sang Qi are both from the Spirit Clan.

294
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
You're indeed born with a sharp tongue.

295
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
You're indeed a brave man.

296
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
But you're also a girl.

297
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So you're also a bad girl.

298
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Xie Xuechen! Xie Xuechen!

299
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You can't faint here.

300
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What if the bad guys come after you?

301
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Xie Xuechen!

302
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Bad guys?

303
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Xie Xuechen!

304
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
How dare you say that?

305
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Xuechen!

306
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
When Young Master Xie was in a coma,

307
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
he called my name.

308
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
He really doesn't forget about me.

309
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
We've left the two mountains.

310
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
I was suffocated all the way.

311
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
No one came after me.

312
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Only you and me are here.

313
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Even if you shout, no one will come.

314
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
Why did you save me?

315
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
What do you want?

316
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
I want you.

317
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I fell in love with Young Master Xie in Rongyuan.

318
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
So I gave you the Spirit Elixir to help you get rid of your coma.

319
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I thought you could escape from the dark clouds for half an hour.

320
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
But you were so arrogant.

321
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You even killed the God of Death.

322
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I had no choice.

323
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I had to play a play that was taken away from me.

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
For you, I've been abandoned.

325
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
I can't go back to the dark clouds.

326
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
Where will you go in the future?

327
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
I'll go there.

328
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:19,000
As the Holy Lady, how can you betray Sang Qi?

329
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
We never fight with our hearts.

330
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
We don't talk about justice.

331
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
How can we betray him?

332
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
You don't believe me?

333
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Then I'll tell you about Sang Qi's plan.

334
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
He has a deal with the Human Clan.

335
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
He wants the Soul Bead.

336
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
You're the son of the Alliance Leader.

337
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You're also the Young Master of Snow City.

338
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
He locked you up in Rongyuan.

339
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:53,000
He wanted to tell him everything when you were dying.

340
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
I said he had a deal with the Human Clan.

341
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Why aren't you surprised?

342
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Do you know that the Alliance...

343
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
There's a spy.

344
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
So you know everything.

345
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That's true.

346
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Although the Immortal Formation has a spy to fix,

347
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
it's not a secret.

348
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
But when will the person who fixes the formation enter the formation?

349
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
Only the Alliance knows.

350
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Sang Qi set an ambush time.

351
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
It's just right.

352
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
You're so smart.

353
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
You can guess it at once.

354
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Actually, if you give up fixing the barrier that day,

355
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
you can leave with your body.

356
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
If the barrier is broken, it's broken.

357
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
If the Dark Clan wants to go to the Human Realm,

358
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
just let them go.

359
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's worth risking your life to protect it.

360
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
The way of fixing the formation,

361
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
the people who are in the dark will not move.

362
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Who is Sang Qi dealing with?

363
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I don't know.

364
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I really don't know.

365
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
There's no need to lie to you.

366
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The five Alliance Commandments have five sect leaders to protect them.

367
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
It's useless to get only one of Yongxue City.

368
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
So I guess Sang Qi must have another plan.

369
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Look.

370
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I've never kept my love.

371
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I've told you everything I should say.

372
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
The witch is telling the truth.

373
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
Don't believe it.

374
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm hurt.

375
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Of course I applied the medicine for you and changed your clothes.

376
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Young Master Xie is really a man of great talent.

377
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Let go of me.

378
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Let go of me.

379
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Now you have no spiritual power.

380
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
I have the magic power.

381
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,000
I know you're not my enemy, but you still want to attack me.

382
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Are you the ancient god of the Jade Pavilion?

383
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Let go of me.

384
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Where?

385
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Here?

386
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Madam.

387
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Miss Mu.

388
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I heard the voice in your room.

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
I thought your husband was awake.

390
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
I just cooked porridge and brought it to you.

391
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Thank you, madam.

392
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
We're hungry.

393
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,000
My husband and I are really bothering you this time.

394
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
No trouble.

395
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
I'm in a bad mood.

396
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
You're not afraid of the enemy chasing you here.

397
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I heard from my son that your husband was badly hurt.

398
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
You'd better stay here and get better.

399
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
My son is good at medicine.

400
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
You can also help him change his medicine.

401
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Thank you.

402
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
You're welcome.

403
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Call me if you need anything.

404
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Okay.

405
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
You're so lucky.

406
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Stop looking.

407
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
What are you looking at?

408
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Let's go.

409
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Okay.

410
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I admit I lied.

411
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
I told them we were a couple who eloped.

412
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
I'm a rich lady.

413
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
You're a poor swordsman.

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
My family didn't agree to our marriage.

415
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
They even sent someone to kill you.

416
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
They took us in.

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
My husband.

418
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Do we look like a couple?

419
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
The one who healed me before was the son of that woman.

420
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
Yes.

421
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I admit I haven't seen your dark body.

422
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I didn't help you with your medicine.

423
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I asked my husband to change your clothes.

424
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Dark people are vicious.

425
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
They're the most deceiving.

426
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
But there's one thing that's true.

427
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
What?

428
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
The one who likes you.

429
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You're injured.

430
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
Your hair is damaged.

431
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
It's not like ordinary people.

432
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Eating more will help you recover.

433
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You can recover earlier.

434
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
It's easier to get rid of me.

435
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Aren't you afraid I'll poison the porridge?

436
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
If you really want to hurt me,

437
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
why bother saving me?

438
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
I didn't poison you.

439
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
But I did give you medicine.

440
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
You...

441
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
Don't worry. It's tonic.

442
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
Sleep well.

443
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
It's good for your health.

444
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
I told you to stop!

445
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
I told you to stop drinking!

446
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I'll beat you to death!

447
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Will you come with me?

448
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm a slave.

449
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
I have to obey the director.

450
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
You're not a slave.

451
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Why are you so nice to me?

452
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
I just want you to be happy.

453
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
Are you...

454
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
my 13-year-old father?

455
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Father!

456
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Don't call me father.

457
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
If you don't tell me your name,

458
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
what will I call you?

459
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Anyway, don't call me father.

460
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Then...

461
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
call me your big brother, okay?

462
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Big brother!

463
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Don't be afraid.

464
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Close your eyes.

465
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
When you open your eyes,

466
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
everything will be fine.

467
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Hurry up.

468
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Listen to your big brother.

469
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Hurry up.

470
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Open the lock.

471
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The... the tonic...

472
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The tonic is coming.

473
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Hurry up.

474
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
Big brother!

475
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
Is it you?

476
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
But...

477
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
aren't you dead?

478
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Is it true?

479
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Song of Apocalypse

480
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Top Danche

481
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Episode filthy

482
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
If the man under heaven

483
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:19,000
generatesDel qua mang

484
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Mind will sourDad least

485
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,440
In the end, she will come back to this world.

486
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,640
The Human Clan wants to kill the Dark Clan.

487
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,160
It's just a dream.

488
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,040
Dreaming is also a kind of obsession.

489
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,520
It can also generate a new demon.

490
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,640
I like it the most.

491
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,520
Zhan Ying.

492
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,440
Why don't you say something?

493
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,320
I think,

494
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,000
according to my judgment,

495
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,160
the Saintess must have eloped with the Deity of the Deceased.

496
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,360
Yes!

497
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,560
Ridiculous.

498
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,560
Eloped?

499
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:01,080
Don't you know what kind of style the Saintess is?

500
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,680
She's a real beauty, a filial daughter.

501
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,160
She looks happy,

502
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,880
but she's a bad girl.

503
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,280
She never had a bit of sincerity.

504
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:14,040
I'm afraid she's planning something this time.

505
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,600
Enough.

506
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,000
The Honorable God wants us to stop the new demon formation.

507
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,600
Let's start.

508
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
The Honorable God wants us to stop the new demon formation.

509
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:24,160
Let's start.

510
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
The Honorable God wants us to stop the new demon formation.

511
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,960
The place with the new demon

512
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,640
is our eyes.

513
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,360
I don't know yet.

514
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,360
There are more and more new demons in this world.

515
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,440
People are always greedy and greedy.

516
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,040
This new demon formation will find them for us.

517
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,360
You hurt me again.

518
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,360
Why are you here again?

519
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,360
We're a couple.

520
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,960
A couple sleeps on the same bed.

521
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
We may have any relationship,

522
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,760
but we can't be a couple.

523
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,760
I know.

524
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,360
I know.

525
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,360
I know.

526
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
I know.

527
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,360
I know.

528
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,360
I know.

529
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
You sleep here.

530
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,160
I'll go somewhere else.

531
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
Thank you, Young Sect Leader.

532
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
You should be reasonable.

533
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Let go.

534
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,160
Can you beat me now?

535
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,960
If I really want to do something to you,

536
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
can you stop me?

537
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,360
Be good. Lie down and sleep.

538
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,560
I know.

539
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
You're not good at

540
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
turning things around.

541
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
You're not good at it.

542
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:04,560
You're not born to be a man.

543
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,560
You've never been humiliated like this.

544
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
If you're wronged,

545
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
you'll be heartbroken.

546
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
If you fight with each other,

547
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
you'll be heartbroken.

548
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
You're not innocent.

549
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
You'll be humiliated

550
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
if you have to say I'm too affectionate.

551
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Right?

552
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
Don't worry.

553
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
I'll never touch you.

554
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Mom.

555
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,760
inIRE

556
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,760
If I were you,

557
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:00,760
I wouldn't choose to go back to Snowblade City.

558
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,760
Anyone who knows that

559
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,760
you've attacked the city

560
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,760
is already an important subject.

561
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,760
You've lost all your power.

562
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,760
No one will die

563
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,760
when they see you.

564
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,520
I will definitely teach you to die

565
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:15,920
Xie Xuechen

566
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,520
Xie Xuechen

567
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,640
What are you going to do

568
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,080
What do i have

569
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,080
Do i need to tell you

570
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,520
It's you, no matter what your intention is

571
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,600
I advise you not to follow me

572
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,400
I know you don't want to follow me

573
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,480
But can you stop me from following you

574
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:37,480
I said

575
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,520
Where are you going

576
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,280
I'll go there

577
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,800
I never promised

578
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,200
I'm afraid you forgot

579
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,600
I am the saint of dark jade

580
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:50,520
Big bad person

581
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,760
I don't need you to promise

582
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,960
I know you are not afraid of death

583
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,200
But you care about the world

584
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,760
To protect the human race

585
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,240
As long as I am willing

586
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,840
The whole world is my hostage

587
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,680
I should have killed you in the dark jade

588
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,040
But you missed the opportunity

589
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,120
You can only be in my hands now

590
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:16,640
Miss Mu

591
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,080
Brother Hou

592
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,120
Miss Mu

593
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,440
Brother Hou, thank you for saving me

594
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,800
I will repay you in the future

595
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:33,600
You are welcome

596
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,960
Miss Mu, our store is a multi-purpose horse

597
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,400
Only one horse can travel hundreds of miles a day

598
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,480
I bought it for you

599
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,120
But I told the merchant

600
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,880
If you still have a good horse, let me know

601
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,360
If you are not in a hurry, wait

602
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,880
I'll explain more

603
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,520
Husband, what do you think

604
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,320
The horse ran away

605
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,920
I'm afraid people will kill

606
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,800
I'm afraid it will implicate Hou Xun and my big bird

607
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,440
We can't keep this for long

608
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,200
Although there is only one horse

609
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,640
But it's enough

610
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,640
Brother Hou, thank you for your concern

611
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:16,840
You are welcome

612
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,400
Just a favor

613
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,560
But today I asked around in the street

614
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,800
I didn't hear that there were people from the neighborhood

615
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,800
We don't have many outsiders in Qingshanji

616
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,200
If there are people from the neighborhood

617
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,400
Someone must know

618
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,000
Miss Mu

619
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,800
Your family should not know you are here

620
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,800
You can rest assured

621
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,840
Don't rush to go

622
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,640
It's okay to stay a few more days

623
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,800
My husband said he would leave

624
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:46,320
I am a husband and wife

625
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,320
Brother Hou

626
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,680
We don't have gold and silver

627
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,080
This hairpin is a token of gratitude

628
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,040
Thank you

629
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,400
This

630
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,960
How can this be her

631
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,280
Take it as a thank you for the aunt

632
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,520
Take me to thank her

633
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,400
I'm fine

634
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,960
I'm fine

635
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,720
Miss Mu

636
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,880
I found you

637
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,120
Yu Ying

638
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,800
You've set up a new demon formation.

639
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,800
You, Brother Hou, have been greedy for you.

640
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,800
You know you can't get it, but you're unwilling to let it go.

641
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,800
So you've created a new demon.

642
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Since you have a new demon, you can control it.

643
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,800
So, you're saying that you've created a new demon.

644
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,800
You're saying that you've created a new demon.

645
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,800
So you're saying that you're blaming me for being too charming?

646
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,800
But, how did you come out?

647
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,800
It's a shadow-shading pill. This isn't its original form.

648
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
It's a projection.

649
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,800
That day, the Immortals were fighting.

650
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,800
They were so focused on fighting.

651
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,800
They didn't even take a close look at the appearance of Young Master Xie.

652
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,800
Today, I think the shadow-shading pill is right.

653
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,800
It does have a bit of a purple color.

654
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,800
It's tiring to fight.

655
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,800
Come back to the dark domain with me.

656
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,800
It's mine.

657
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
Really?

658
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,800
Oh no, this is the prison of greed.

659
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,800
Although the shadow-shading pill isn't a battle, it's very difficult to get rid of.

660
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:21,800
This prison of greed can make people sink into their desires and die in the dark.

661
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
Xie Xue Chen, you...

662
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
Watch out!

663
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,800
Xie Xue Chen, my heart hurts.

664
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
Help me look.

665
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:39,800
The world's first swordsman is indeed a famous sword.

666
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,800
What?

667
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,800
I imitated Saintess, but I don't look like her?

668
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,800
Don't you like me?

669
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,800
The dark clan doesn't have any heart.

670
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,800
The one who was shot just now was indeed Mu Xuan Ling.

671
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,800
But at the moment of falling, she already replaced you.

672
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,800
It's my fault.

673
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,800
I forgot that Young Master Xie is very sensitive.

674
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,800
He can't fool you by just using the shadow-shading pill.

675
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,800
If I had known earlier, I would have dug a human heart.

676
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
I'm sorry.

677
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,800
The hardest thing to defeat is your own desire.

678
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,800
No matter how strong you are, you can't escape.

679
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,800
Young Master Xie,

680
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:32,800
before you die, enjoy the happiness of this world.

681
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,800
Miao Miao, where are you?

682
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,800
Miao Miao!

683
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,800
I'm here.

684
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,800
I'm here.

685
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Miao Miao, where are you?

686
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,800
Miao Miao!

687
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,800
Where is Xie Xue Chen?

688
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,800
An Yu's Saintess

689
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,800
actually blocked the sword for a man.

690
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,800
You protected her like this.

691
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Could it be that the shadow-shading pill was right?

692
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,800
Do you really like Xie Xue Chen

693
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,800
and plan to rebel against An Yu?

694
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:17,800
What do you think?

695
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,800
I think it doesn't look like you,

696
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,800
so I'm standing here to talk to you.

697
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Otherwise, I would have cut off your heads

698
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:30,800
and given them to the High God.

699
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,800
Given to the Master?

700
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,800
You'd better use your brain that you haven't used before.

701
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
If it weren't for the Master's water,

702
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:45,800
how could I have left An Yu with Xie Xue Chen?

703
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:48,800
What do you mean?

704
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,800
How do you think Xie Xue Chen left Rong Yuan?

705
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,800
Someone helped him.

706
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,800
Rong Yuan has 18 prohibitions.

707
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,800
How could you untie him?

708
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,800
I didn't.

709
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,800
Xie Xue Chen untied him himself.

710
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,800
I only gave him a pill

711
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,800
that could restore his power.

712
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,800
Think again.

713
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:22,800
How could I have such a precious pill?

714
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,800
It was from the High God?

715
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,800
It was the Master who gave me the opportunity to set him free.

716
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,800
In this way,

717
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,800
I have saved his life.

718
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,800
I can follow him

719
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:43,800
and take the power of the High God.

720
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,800
I'm sorry.

721
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,800
I'm sorry.

722
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,800
I'm sorry.

723
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,800
I'm sorry.

724
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,800
I'm sorry.

725
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,800
I'm sorry.

726
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,800
I'm sorry.

727
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I'm sorry.

728
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,800
I'm sorry.

729
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,800
I'm sorry.

730
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,800
I'm sorry.

731
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,800
I'm sorry.

732
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:57,800
I'm sorry.

733
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
I'm sorry.

734
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I'm sorry.

735
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,800
I'm sorry.

736
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,800
I'm sorry.

737
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,800
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,800
I'm sorry.

739
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I'm sorry.

740
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,800
I'm sorry.

741
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:15,800
I'm sorry.

742
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,800
I'm sorry.

743
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,800
I'm sorry.

744
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:21,800
