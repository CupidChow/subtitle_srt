1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,200
The

2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
The

3
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
The

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
The

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
The

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
The

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
The

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
The

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
The

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
The

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
The

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
The

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:56,780
The

14
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,780
I'm not a low-level spy.

15
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,780
But since you're here,

16
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,780
you should trap Xie Xue Chen first.

17
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:08,780
I'll save him at the most critical moment.

18
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
In this way,

19
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,780
he owes me another life.

20
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,780
But to be honest,

21
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,780
the greed of the world

22
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,780
often escapes from the heart.

23
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,780
I'm afraid that

24
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:24,780
the greed of the world

25
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,780
often escapes from the heart.

26
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:29,780
I'm a little curious

27
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,780
what the greed of the world

28
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,780
will be.

29
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,780
Miao Miao.

30
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Miao Miao, where are you?

31
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,780
Where are you?

32
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,780
Miao Miao.

33
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Miao Miao, come out.

34
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,780
Miao Miao.

35
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
Miao Miao, I brought you a little fish cake.

36
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,780
Pick up the sword.

37
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
Father.

38
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,780
You can't throw your sword away

39
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,780
at any time.

40
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,780
I know I was wrong.

41
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Are you looking for that little snow cat?

42
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
It won't come to ask for snow.

43
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:26,780
I'll kill it.

44
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Why?

45
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,780
What's that look on your face?

46
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Father, although the snow cat is a monster,

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,780
it doesn't harm people.

48
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,780
Why did you kill it?

49
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:38,780
It's my new cat.

50
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,780
You can't be kind to a person who has a heart.

51
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,780
Did you forget?

52
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
No, I don't understand.

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,780
Mother said that

54
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,780
you can't be kind to a person who has a heart.

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Why can't you be kind?

56
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,780
You can save people with your heart.

57
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Is this your way of doing things?

58
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:57,780
Answer me.

59
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Yes.

60
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,780
Okay, if so,

61
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,780
you should break your love.

62
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
If you have a bias,

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,780
how can you tolerate people with great love?

64
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,780
If one day you have a choice,

65
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,780
one side is love, the other side is the world.

66
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,780
Can you give up your love

67
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:19,780
to save people?

68
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,780
Why can only choose one?

69
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Life is short,

70
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,780
and it's more rare.

71
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,780
Xue Chen,

72
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,780
you will never change.

73
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,780
You will be the king of the human world,

74
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,780
and the king of the three realms.

75
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Until that day,

76
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
the fate of the world's people

77
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,780
will be in your hands.

78
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
Love will only become your weakness,

79
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
and it will also make the world's people

80
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
in danger.

81
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:45,780
Since you have the right to be a king,

82
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,780
and your heart is devoted to the people,

83
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,780
then your heart will be

84
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,780
free from all evil and die.

85
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
You shouldn't choose to love only one person

86
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,780
or one thing

87
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,780
including yourself.

88
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,780
Why is Xie Xue Chen's greed and desire cage

89
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,780
different from others?

90
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Because he has no greed and desire.

91
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,780
No greed and desire?

92
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
How is that possible?

93
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,780
He has the highest level of cultivation.

94
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:18,780
He is the best in the world.

95
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,780
He has been forced to cultivate

96
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
the path of heartlessness since he was a child.

97
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
A person who doesn't even care

98
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
about his own life,

99
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
what kind of greed and desire can he have?

100
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,780
Yu Ying,

101
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,780
can your greed and desire cage

102
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,780
still see more memories?

103
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,780
For example, what he went through

104
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,780
ten years ago?

105
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Saintess,

106
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,780
I am in the greed and desire cage.

107
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:51,780
What has nothing to do with greed and desire

108
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,780
can't be looked back.

109
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,780
If that's the case,

110
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,780
it's useless for you.

111
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Saintess,

112
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
what do you mean?

113
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,780
It's so obvious.

114
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
Can't you see it?

115
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
You want to kill me?

116
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
We can just

117
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,780
play a show for Xie Xue Chen.

118
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
You don't have to kill me.

119
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
If you kill me,

120
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
my body will know.

121
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,780
It seems that you don't know

122
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
that there is a flaw in the painting list.

123
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,780
What flaw?

124
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,780
When you die,

125
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,780
you will know.

126
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,780
You really betrayed An Yu.

127
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,780
I will kill you.

128
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,780
I didn't expect that

129
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,780
our Xie Shao Sect Leader,

130
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,780
a master of the magic mirror,

131
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,780
would take away

132
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,780
my weak girl's power.

133
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
That's not kind.

134
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,780
Weak girl?

135
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,780
When you threatened me,

136
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:15,780
why didn't you think

137
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,780
if you were thick-headed?

138
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,780
Fine.

139
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,780
I'll give it to you.

140
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
From now on,

141
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
as long as it's mine,

142
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,780
you can keep it if you want.

143
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,780
You're dead.

144
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
You're the one who's dead.

145
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,780
How did you die?

146
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
How would I know?

147
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
You don't know?

148
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,780
Why would she know?

149
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:47,780
No.

150
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,780
She died and she didn't know.

151
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,780
How would you know?

152
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:53,780
It's obvious that

153
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,780
there's a flaw in the painting list.

154
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:56,780
The body can only sense

155
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
the death of the projection.

156
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,780
But it doesn't know

157
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,780
what happened before the projection.

158
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,780
It doesn't know who killed the projection.

159
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,780
If I knew

160
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
which idiot

161
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,780
made the list,

162
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
I would have to

163
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
take him down.

164
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
Enough.

165
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,780
Stop talking about the painting.

166
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:18,780
Before you left,

167
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,780
you called a man

168
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,780
who was so powerful

169
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,780
and powerful

170
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,780
that he would catch the Saintess

171
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
and Xie Xuechen back.

172
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,780
What happened?

173
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,780
You're good.

174
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:31,780
Go ahead.

175
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,780
When I train the projection,

176
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
you don't have to...

177
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
Although I don't know

178
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,780
whether the projection was killed by Xie Xuechen

179
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,780
or by the Saintess,

180
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
I can be sure that

181
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,780
someone killed them.

182
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:57,780
Then when we meet again,

183
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,780
there won't be any more surprises.

184
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,780
Aren't you afraid that

185
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:11,780
after he wakes up,

186
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:13,780
he will remember what happened just now?

187
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,780
What if an ordinary human

188
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,780
goes crazy?

189
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
No.

190
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,780
After he was resurrected by the Dark Clan,

191
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,780
he doesn't know anything when he wakes up.

192
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,780
Even if someone tells him,

193
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,780
even if he wants to ask a thousand times,

194
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
he can't remember.

195
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,780
You know it so well.

196
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
Did you

197
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,780
get resurrected by the Dark Clan?

198
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Young Master Xie,

199
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,780
I just blocked one arrow for you.

200
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Even if it's a sword from the illusion,

201
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,780
it's painful to be stabbed.

202
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,780
Why don't you care about me?

203
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
How about

204
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
you eat the demon elixir

205
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
that you just turned into?

206
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,780
I can also increase my power.

207
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,780
What's the benefit

208
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,780
of God's increase of power?

209
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
Hey,

210
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:07,780
can you find a reason?

211
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
Where are you going?

212
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
Yunxiu Manor, right?

213
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
There are only two places

214
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,780
closest to this place.

215
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,780
One is Jinghua Palace.

216
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:22,780
The second is Yunxiu Manor.

217
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Although Jinghua Palace

218
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
is one of the five sects of the Alliance,

219
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
now you're not sure

220
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,780
who the traitor is.

221
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Of course you won't go there rashly.

222
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
Although Yunxiu Manor

223
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,780
is not in the list of the Alliance,

224
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
it is known to the world

225
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:36,780
by its clever formation.

226
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,780
It's said that

227
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
the owner of Yunxiu Manor

228
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,780
has developed a conveyor belt.

229
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
It can transport people

230
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
up to ten thousand miles in a flash.

231
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,780
You want to use the conveyor belt

232
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,780
to return to Yongxue City as soon as possible,

233
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
right?

234
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,780
Miss Mu,

235
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,780
I'm not a person who doesn't know kindness.

236
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
You saved me.

237
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
An Li said I should thank you.

238
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:02,780
But we're not on the same path.

239
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:04,780
You follow me like this.

240
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:06,780
When my spiritual power is restored,

241
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,780
we will meet again.

242
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,780
Why don't we start from now

243
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
and go our separate ways?

244
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
You should know that

245
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
there is a word

246
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,780
called a book and a map.

247
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
If there is a way to stop me,

248
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I will make all the way.

249
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Isn't that good?

250
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,780
Why do you have to follow me?

251
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
What do you want to do?

252
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
What if I say

253
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
I want to give up my life to vote for you?

254
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
I don't want to.

255
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
What?

256
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
I don't want to.

257
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:41,780
I want to give up my life

258
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,780
to vote for you.

259
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
I don't want to.

260
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
I have to.

261
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,780
You think

262
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,780
it's fun to be with Sang Qi?

263
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:58,780
Most of the spiritual clans

264
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
are driven by human clans.

265
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,780
I'm only forced to obey him.

266
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Actually, I didn't want to

267
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,780
I'm also quite good at it.

268
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,820
Then you can just destroy the Demon Palace and become an ordinary person.

269
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,180
My spiritual bridge is broken.

270
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,180
I can't repair my spiritual power.

271
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,080
The Demon Palace

272
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,700
is the path I take to live and die.

273
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,240
But Xie Xue Chen,

274
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,300
if I'm willing to destroy the Demon Palace

275
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,940
for you

276
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,780
and become an ordinary person,

277
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,140
will you protect me?

278
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
Yes.

279
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,060
You think I'll believe you?

280
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,460
It doesn't matter if you believe me or not.

281
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,220
You can't resist it anyway.

282
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:58,940
I have my own answer.

283
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,900
Before I find it,

284
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,660
please stay by my side

285
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,540
Thank you, Young Sect Leader.

286
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,060
They have the phantom elixir.

287
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,940
We also have the shadow-shadowing elixir.

288
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,700
The jade shadow has been trained to cast shadows.

289
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,900
I think it will be faster to eat and drink.

290
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,900
It will be even harder to walk.

291
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,540
If you want to avoid the search for the new demon,

292
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,460
you can't just rely on the shadow to hide.

293
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,140
The shadow-shadowing elixir can help people to hide their appearance.

294
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,580
When others see your face,

295
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,300
they will only think that your appearance is ordinary and ordinary.

296
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,460
They will be over-expected.

297
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,420
Will you kill me

298
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,940
or only do the work when others see your face?

299
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,820
Do whatever little sign you dare.

300
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,780
I also want it.

301
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,180
Ahh, right,

302
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,180
help me add it up.

303
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Stupid.

304
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,060
How many dark clans have you killed?

305
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,700
Eight hundred without a thousand.

306
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,460
Then you killed less than me.

307
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
What are you remembering?

308
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
I'm remembering your wishes.

309
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:38,660
I heard that

310
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,660
two people can spend their lives together

311
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,660
only when they are of the same mind.

312
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,660
Why are you so alert to me?

313
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:55,660
I've been helping you

314
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,660
since we met.

315
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
You are so close to each other.

316
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,660
Then?

317
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:08,660
Go away.

318
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,660
The heart of a Taoist

319
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,660
is so powerful that it can kill hundreds of people.

320
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,660
But once it is attracted to the devil,

321
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,660
it is no different from mortals.

322
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,660
In the dark clans,

323
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:31,660
even if you have a spiritual power,

324
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,660
you will be like a snake.

325
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:34,660
Or,

326
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,660
this is what Miss Mu wants?

327
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,660
What do I want?

328
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,660
Don't you know?

329
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
We've been meeting for so long.

330
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,660
Why don't you ask

331
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,660
what kind of spiritual clan I am?

332
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,660
Don't you really want

333
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,660
to know more about me?

334
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,660
I don't ask.

335
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,660
You will tell me even if you don't.

336
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I'm Teng Ling.

337
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
When I was a kid,

338
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,660
half of my face was

339
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,660
a demon's tattoo like a ten-fingered.

340
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:32,660
This is the monitor.

341
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,060
It's very big.

342
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,260
It's very awake.

343
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,660
People who have seen it before

344
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,660
will be able to see it.

345
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:55,660
You really don't remember at all.

346
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
I don't remember anything.

347
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,660
I just remember that

348
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,660
you really don't remember anything.

349
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,660
What did you say?

350
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,660
Nothing.

351
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
You're so arrogant.

352
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,660
It's getting late.

353
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,660
We should find a place to rest.

354
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
If you don't rest,

355
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,660
Ma Er will rest too.

356
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,660
People are all the same.

357
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,660
Ma Er is also in it.

358
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:27,660
Thank you, Chen.

359
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,660
I'm also in it.

360
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,660
Coming.

361
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
Another bottle of wine.

362
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,660
Okay.

363
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
Here's your wine.

364
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
Boss, the hotel.

365
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Sir, I'm really sorry.

366
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,660
There are too many guests today.

367
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,660
Now,

368
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,660
only one room is left.

369
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,660
How about you and your servant

370
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,660
share a room?

371
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,660
No need.

372
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,660
Then you can live with my colleagues.

373
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,660
Very good.

374
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,660
What's good?

375
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:21,660
What are you looking at?

376
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,660
He's my husband.

377
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,660
I'm so rude.

378
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,660
I'm sorry.

379
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Waiter.

380
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,660
Please come in.

381
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,660
Okay.

382
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,660
This way, please.

383
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,660
This way.

384
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Those two seem to be strange.

385
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,660
They seem to be willing to do whatever they want.

386
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,660
Could they be kidnapped?

387
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,660
They seem to be very familiar.

388
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,660
I think so.

389
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,660
I think so.

390
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,660
I think so.

391
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,660
That man seems to be a good seller,

392
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,660
but he's not a common man.

393
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,660
Although he's not a good man,

394
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,660
he should be a good master.

395
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,660
That woman seems to be an ordinary person,

396
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,660
but she doesn't have the ability to kidnap others.

397
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,660
I heard there are many demons nearby.

398
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:08,660
Could it be...

399
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:10,660
Brother, you're thinking too much.

400
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,660
Those two are just ordinary people,

401
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,660
but they don't have the spirit of demons.

402
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,660
I heard that the people here are very generous.

403
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,660
There are often women who are very rich and force men to be rich.

404
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,660
That woman seems to be from a rich family.

405
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,660
Although the man is ordinary,

406
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,660
he has long waist and long legs.

407
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,660
He has a good sense of humor.

408
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,660
He must have something special.

409
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,660
Brother, you're more knowledgeable.

410
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,660
Thank you, Young Master.

411
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,660
I do have something special.

412
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,660
Take care, everyone.

413
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,660
You two, your rooms.

414
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,660
Room No. 1, Tianzi.

415
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,660
This way, please.

416
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,660
Looking at the embroidery on the clothes of the embroidery artists,

417
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,660
it should be the embroidery of the Palace of Pure Flower.

418
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,660
What are they doing here?

419
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,660
Could it be that there are high-class embroidery artists in the Palace of Pure Flower here?

420
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:15,660
Does Young Master Xie want to be a star?

421
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,660
What do you want?

422
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,660
Are you worried that I will kill someone and silence him?

423
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:23,660
Could it be that you won't?

424
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:28,660
Maybe I will. Maybe I won't.

425
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,660
But you're right to be worried.

426
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,660
I'm not a good person.

427
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:42,660
You're not a person.

428
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
There's a demon aura.

429
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,660
I've hidden the aura for a long time.

430
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,660
Sir, please take care.

431
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,660
Sir, this way, please.

432
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,660
Master Gao.

433
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,660
It's been a long time.

434
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,660
Please sit down.

435
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,660
It's him.

436
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,660
I...

437
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,660
Please enjoy.

438
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,660
Thank you.

439
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
Senior, you're finally back.

440
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,660
Junior Brother Lu and I have checked the east side.

441
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,660
We didn't find anything.

442
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,660
What's going on over there?

443
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,660
Senior Song, you don't know.

444
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,660
Senior and I were attacked by the forest tribe.

445
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,660
What kind of forest tribe? Did you get hurt?

446
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,660
Senior Gao is a genius and has a high level of cultivation.

447
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
With our senior, of course we won't get hurt.

448
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,660
Oh, right.

449
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,660
It's this little demon beast with the eyes of a tiger.

450
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,660
Senior said that this is one of the ten great beasts, the Tartar.

451
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,660
Tartar?

452
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,660
His hearing and smell are all the best.

453
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,660
Where are the treasures?

454
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,660
They know best.

455
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,660
Give it to me.

456
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,660
Here.

457
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,660
Senior and I just ran into him.

458
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,660
I wonder where this little guy stole so many treasures.

459
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Wow, they're all good treasures.

460
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,660
Yeah.

461
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,660
You, the Tartar, stole so many treasures.

462
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:13,660
If you're caught by the forest tribe,

463
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,660
I won't forgive you.

464
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:19,660
Senior, you seem to be very fond of this Tartar.

465
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,660
You don't want to train him into a spirit beast, do you?

466
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,660
Although the Tartar is a beast,

467
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,660
it looks very weak.

468
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,260
It's no match for the enemy.

469
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,660
I'm afraid it's not suitable to be a spirit beast.

470
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:31,660
I can fight against the enemy myself.

471
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,260
Why do you need the spirit beast to help?

472
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,660
Senior is right.

473
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,660
I heard that the Xie Young Master of the Snow City

474
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,660
is also a one-man show,

475
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:41,660
and never sees the spirit beast.

476
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,660
Senior Gao and the Xie Young Master are both talented people.

477
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,060
How can we compare?

478
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,060
That's right.

479
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,460
Okay, we still have a mission to do here.

480
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,260
Take a rest and keep looking.

481
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:52,660
Yes.

482
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:59,060
Your little mouse has golden ears.

483
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,260
It's cute.

484
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,260
The little mouse is timid.

485
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,860
It will be scared and even die of cowardice.

486
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,660
Look at its ears.

487
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,060
The more it rips, the brighter it is.

488
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,860
It looks pretty, but it's a brave battle.

489
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,260
Who is it?

490
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,460
Who?

491
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
There.

492
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,460
What are you doing?

493
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,260
They are coming to us for trouble.

494
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,860
That's your trouble.

495
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,060
It's already at this time.

496
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
Why are you still separating us?

497
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:36,860
What are you doing?

498
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,260
Cooperate with me.

499
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,460
Who are you?

500
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,260
Why did you break in?

501
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,460
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

502
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,660
Get out.

503
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,260
Go.

504
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,860
Close the door.

505
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,260
They don't have the spirit beast's breath.

506
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,460
Get up.

507
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,460
I don't...

508
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:14,260
What if they are still eavesdropping at the door?

509
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,460
The show is over anyway.

510
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,660
How about we pretend to be real?

511
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,260
Let me go.

512
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,660
Have you had enough?

513
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,660
No.

514
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,060
You three search around today.

515
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,260
Who are you?

516
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,260
You are the one who is the most dangerous.

517
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,660
You are the most dangerous.

518
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,260
You three search around today.

519
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,460
Maybe there will be a spirit beast's breath at night.

520
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:44,460
Tomorrow morning, we will continue to find the spirit beast.

521
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Okay.

522
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,860
Go.

523
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,460
So they are here to find you.

524
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:57,860
Now, in the Palace of Pure Flower, there is only one girl with a super position and a high gender.

525
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,860
That is the Miss of the Mingyue Villa.

526
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:05,260
Now, the disciple of the Princess of the Palace of Pure Flower, Gao Qiuming.

527
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,660
So what?

528
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,260
I heard that she is engaged to you.

529
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:20,460
She is in bed with me in front of the fiancee.

530
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,660
Is it exciting?

531
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:23,860
She is not my fiancee.

532
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:28,860
Are you afraid that I will misunderstand you and explain it to me?

533
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:34,860
Xie Xuechen, you should marry me.

534
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,060
I love people more than her.

535
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,860
I love you.

536
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,260
I have never seen a shameless person like you.

537
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:58,660
You are half right.

538
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,460
I am not a human.

539
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,660
But I am shameless.

540
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Some?

541
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,860
The heart of the young master Xie is a little bit confused.

542
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,260
Is it because of me?

543
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:16,460
Do you fall in love with me?

544
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Yes.

545
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,660
Kill the heart.

546
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,860
Good.

547
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,860
Kill the heart is also a heart.

548
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:29,660
At least you can remember me.

549
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:34,460
What I am most afraid of is that you don't remember me.

550
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:40,060
I am afraid that you will forget me.

551
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,260
I am afraid that you will forget me.

552
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
I am afraid that you will forget me.

553
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,660
I am afraid that you will forget me.

554
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,860
I am afraid that you will forget me.

555
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,060
I am afraid that you will forget me.

556
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,260
I am afraid that you will forget me.

557
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,460
I am afraid that you will forget me.

558
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,660
I am afraid that you will forget me.

559
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,860
I am afraid that you will forget me.

560
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
I am afraid that you will forget me.

561
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,260
I am afraid that you will forget me.

562
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
I am afraid that you will forget me.

563
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:09,160
I am afraid that you will forget me.

564
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,460
I am afraid that you will forget me.

565
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,660
I am afraid that you will forget me.

566
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,660
Bursing sweet potatoes.

567
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Didn't you run away just now?

568
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,460
What else do you come back for?

569
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,460
Did you sew on my body and have a baby?

570
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,460
Sister.

571
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:31,660
You can speak?

572
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:34,260
Will you turn into a human?

573
00:27:34,260 --> 00:28:02,660
I can bring savory and refreshing

574
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
I won't hurt you

575
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,260
I... I just came out to find my father

576
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
I didn't do anything bad

577
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
Don't send me to the palace

578
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,260
Mom said that father is the richest embroidery master in the world

579
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,260
Those treasures are all from my father

580
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,260
I really didn't steal anything

581
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Really

582
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:24,260
The richest clan in the world is Bixiao Palace

583
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:27,260
Is your father Princess Bixiao Palace?

584
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Don't guess

585
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:37,260
What's your father's name?

586
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,260
Fu... Fu Canglin

587
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:41,260
Brother, do you know my father?

588
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,260
Princess Bixiao Palace is indeed blessed

589
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,260
But I've never heard that Bixiao Palace has a person named Fu Canglin

590
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,260
What's your name?

591
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,260
A... A'bao

592
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,260
You didn't go to the temple to get in?

593
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,260
Mom said that if you go to the temple

594
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,260
You will be caught by them

595
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:00,260
And be controlled by the human clan

596
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,260
You have to be a slave for your whole life

597
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:06,260
Mom said that it shouldn't be like this

598
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:10,260
I heard that Xie Shao has been in seclusion for many years

599
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:11,260
He rarely goes out of Yongxue City

600
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:15,260
It seems that he doesn't know the situation of the human clan

601
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,260
The human clan's oppression of the human clan is much worse than before

602
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:24,260
If the human clan goes to the temple to get in

603
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
They will become human clan's slaves

604
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,260
They can fight, scold, kill

605
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,260
They can also do business

606
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,260
They can't be free for life

607
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:35,260
But if they don't go to the temple to get in

608
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,260
They will have no status as good or evil

609
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,260
They can be killed regardless of their good or evil

610
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,260
This is the rule set by the human clan

611
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,260
The more domineering, the more shameless

612
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:52,260
Do you want to be sent home?

613
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,260
My baby is gone

614
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,260
I lost all my father's baby

615
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,260
I don't dare to go home

616
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,260
I don't dare to go home

617
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Okay, okay

618
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,260
Don't cry

619
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
I will help you get it back

620
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
Gao Qiangming is a good fighter

621
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,260
Don't make trouble

622
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:14,260
It's Gao Qiangming who took A'bao's baby first

623
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:17,260
It's a good thing that I helped him get it back

624
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
Since it's a misunderstanding

625
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,260
I will explain it clearly

626
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,260
Do you think they will believe it?

627
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:29,260
They will hand A'bao to the sword spirit department?

628
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:34,260
Young master Xie is a human

629
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:36,260
He will speak for people

630
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:38,260
But I am a human

631
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
I will stand up for the human

632
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
You are right

633
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,260
I don't want to convince you

634
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
Just leave me alone

635
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
Where is he?

636
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,260
Senior sister

637
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,260
I always think something is wrong

638
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:27,260
No one wears shoes in the same room

639
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
It's obviously a blind test

640
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,260
Fortunately, Senior sister Gao is smart

641
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,260
She can see your abnormality

642
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
Senior sister, you are so smart

643
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,260
I told you not to be so anxious

644
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,260
You should take off my shoes first

645
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,260
Then take off my clothes

646
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Look

647
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,260
People misunderstand

648
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
You should remember next time

649
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,260
The flower of a man should be slowly coming

650
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:56,260
But

651
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,260
I like it

652
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,260
You are so talkative

653
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,260
I won't believe it

654
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,740
Today I will catch you and the

655
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
You

656
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,260
You

657
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,260
Who is it? It's so late

658
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
You are still sleeping

659
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,260
Sorry to bother you

660
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,260
You are so evil

661
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,260
Chase

662
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
One is a human and the other is a demon

663
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,260
If you collude with each other, you will be heartless

664
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:08,260
Today I will take your hand

665
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:11,260
We are not evil

666
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,260
Stop talking

667
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,260
Stop talking

668
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,260
Stop talking

669
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,260
Stop talking

670
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
Stop talking

671
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
Stop talking

672
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,260
Stop talking

673
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Stop talking

674
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
Stop talking

675
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,260
Stop talking

676
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:30,260
Stop talking

677
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,260
Stop talking

678
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,260
Stop talking

679
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,260
Stop talking

680
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:34,260
Stop talking

681
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,260
Stop talking

682
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,260
Stop talking

683
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:37,260
Stop talking

684
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,260
Stop talking

685
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,260
Stop talking

686
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
Stop talking

687
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,260
Stop talking

688
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
Stop talking

689
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,260
Stop talking

690
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,260
Stop talking

691
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Stop talking

692
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,260
Stop talking

693
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,260
Stop talking

694
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,260
Stop talking

695
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,260
Stop talking

696
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,260
Stop talking

697
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,260
Stop talking

698
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Stop talking

699
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Stop talking

700
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,260
No

701
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,260
No

702
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,260
Is there anyone who is asking questions?

703
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:16,960
Why do you call πά bom

704
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,980
time goes by so fast

705
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,960
She is so good

706
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:27,920
The artwork photo

707
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,960
What are you talking about

708
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,880
Just tell me

709
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,000
AH

710
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,020
ishna

711
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
You're so evil.

712
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,020
You're so disgusting.

713
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:49,020
How dare you come out and scare me?

714
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
Steward.

715
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,020
Go.

716
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,020
Get him a mask.

717
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
Don't scare him again.

718
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
Yes.

719
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
Hurry.

720
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,020
Give her clothes and her clothes back.

721
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
Let me go.

722
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
She's a daughter of a rich man.

723
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:22,020
You're not going to die for her.

724
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,020
It's the greatest honor in your life.

725
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,020
Brother.

726
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
You stopped me.

727
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,020
You've won.

728
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
Let them go.

729
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:51,020
What if I can't?

730
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:53,020
I won't let you kill anyone.

731
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,020
Go.

732
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,020
They wanted to kill you.

733
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,020
I protected you.

734
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,020
They have no power to fight back.

735
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:23,020
You don't have to kill him.

736
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,020
Why do you insist on fighting?

737
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
I'm a man like this.

738
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,020
Why would he want to kill me?

739
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,020
I can't kill him.

740
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,020
Is it worth protecting

741
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:34,020
if you're the only one who wants to protect him?

742
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
It's right to think you're right.

743
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,020
Let's run, Shijian.

744
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:48,020
But it's not good for us to see him die.

745
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,020
We can't save him here.

746
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,020
Since he's a different monster,

747
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:54,020
he must be a little bit confident.

748
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,020
Let's go back to the gate and report it.

749
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
Hurry.

750
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,020
You used blood as a sword.

751
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,020
You protected him like this?

752
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
I said

753
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,020
I wouldn't let you kill anyone.

754
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,020
You don't have any power now.

755
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:28,020
Even if you use your blood,

756
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,020
I have a hundred ways

757
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,020
to defeat you easily.

758
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,020
You're not going to die.

759
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,020
You're not going to die.

760
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,020
You're not going to die.

761
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:52,020
You're not going to die.

762
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:54,020
You're not going to die.

763
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
You're not going to die.

764
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,020
You're not going to die.

765
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:00,020
You're not going to die.

766
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:02,020
You're not going to die.

767
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,020
You're not going to die.

768
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,020
You're not going to die.

769
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,020
You're not going to die.

770
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:10,020
You're not going to die.

771
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,020
You're not going to die.

772
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,020
You're not going to die.

773
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,020
You're not going to die.

774
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
You're not going to die.

775
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
You're not going to die.

776
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
You're not going to die.

777
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
You're not going to die.

778
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
You're not going to die.

779
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:28,020
You're not going to die.

780
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,020
You're not going to die.

781
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020
You're not going to die.

782
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,020
You're not going to die.

783
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,020
You're not going to die.

784
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:38,020
You're not going to die.

785
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,020
You're not going to die.

786
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,020
You're not going to die.

787
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:44,020
You're not going to die.

788
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
You're not going to die.

789
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
You're not going to die.

790
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
You're not going to die.

791
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,020
You're not going to die.

792
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,020
You're not going to die.

793
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,020
You're not going to die.

794
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,020
You're not going to die.

795
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,020
You're not going to die.

796
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,020
You're not going to die.

797
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,020
You're not going to die.

798
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,020
You're not going to die.

799
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:08,020
You're not going to die.

800
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:10,020
The Blood Sword is fake.

801
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,020
The Love Formation is real.

802
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,020
Your fake sword is with me.

803
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
In fact, the blood is the shadow,

804
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,020
so the Love Formation is set.

805
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,020
The blood from the Fàxiangxiu

806
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,020
is the soul of Zhichun.

807
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,020
I think you're just

808
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,020
overacting with me.

809
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,020
Wipe the blood out.

810
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:32,020
The blood from the Fàxiangxiu

811
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
is the soul of Zhichun.

812
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,020
The blood from the Fàxiangxiu

813
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,300
and blood spilling out

814
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,300
Gradually forming this maze

815
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,420
I was weak on the way

816
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,460
You've been patient with me for so long

817
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:46,900
Just for this moment?

818
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,500
You can set up a killing formation

819
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,580
What's the point of setting up this trap?

820
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,460
You saved me

821
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,420
It's a return for not killing you

822
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,380
Then I have to thank you

823
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,940
for your kindness

824
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,180
Why didn't you use the devil's bow just now?

825
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,780
If you had the devil's bow

826
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:05,860
you would have died

827
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:08,020
You were badly injured

828
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,900
You didn't have the power to protect yourself

829
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,780
You couldn't stop my devil's bow

830
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,940
You hurt people with the devil's bow

831
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:20,980
I used the blood to protect them

832
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:22,660
I lost my life after all

833
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,460
Let's end this game here

834
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:30,540
I killed people with the devil's bow

835
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,820
You killed people with the sword

836
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,220
What's the difference between

837
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,300
the devil's bow and the sword?

838
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,340
If I really wanted to kill you

839
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:38,980
you would have died

840
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,380
You just can't bear to do it

841
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:48,740
Xie Xuechen

842
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:51,820
You really left?

843
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,260
Xie Xuechen

844
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,300
I

845
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,140
I have something important

846
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:57,940
to tell you

847
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,140
Come back

848
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:00,100
Yaonan

849
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,180
Sister

850
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:18,000
rib

851
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:33,140
Tied, killed, attacked

852
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,140
A magic formation has four power, the stronger the power, the weaker the power

853
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,140
The four power of the ten thousand-monger Cuihua formation are all strong

854
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,140
It's easier to break

855
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,140
And this Linglong family is the first trapped formation in the world

856
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:51,140
It's harder to break if you're trapped

857
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,140
What if the people from the Swordless Realm come?

858
00:41:55,140 --> 00:42:00,140
Sister, A'bao, A'bao is going to find someone to save you

859
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:06,140
I've observed that the Linglong family is built by the Tuluo tree

860
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:10,140
It's so hard to break

861
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,140
A'bao, A'bao

862
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:24,140
Is he really going to find someone?

863
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,140
Yes

864
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Xie Xuechen

865
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:38,140
You protect him like this

866
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,140
Just because he's a human?

867
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:44,140
Is it the Human or the Spirit?

868
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,140
Can I decide?

869
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:00,140
What a couple, I don't like them

870
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,140
I don't like them

871
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,140
I don't like them

872
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,140
I don't like them

873
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:10,140
What a couple, I don't like them

874
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Young Master, we're here

875
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,140
But why are you here?

876
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,140
I'm here to save you

877
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,140
I know that I'll meet an old friend here today

878
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:52,140
But I don't know if he remembers me

879
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,140
I'm here to save you

880
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,140

A dream is like a dream, but it's no longer real

I have no wish in this life, I'm by your side
