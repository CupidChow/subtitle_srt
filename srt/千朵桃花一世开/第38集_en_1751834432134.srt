1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
How long do you want to play?

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The fog is too thick, I can't check it for a while.

8
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where is my bracelet?

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
My bracelet fell into the pool.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It fell into the pool.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Help me to...

12
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Thank you, Demon Lord.

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Can we go now?

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I can only rely on hard ones.

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Although I'm not good at math,

16
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can only rely on my strength.

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
It's Feng Xiang who is the Great Master.

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
God bless me.

19
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How dare you take the Longevity Lotus!

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Here comes the chance.

21
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Just take it.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The Longevity Lotus

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Since we've got the Longevity Lotus, let's go.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No need to fight with it.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
It's not that easy to get it.

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Demonic aura?

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Why would the Dark Shadow Demon be in the mortal world?

28
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Could it be that the Immortality Formation has been broken?

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Your Excellency, we didn't mean anything bad.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The Longevity Lotus is not mature yet.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Even if we eat it, we can't get the Longevity Lotus.

32
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's just that my old friend used the Longevity Lotus to save me.

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
So I want to keep it

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
and make it a part of the Guanyong.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
To take the Longevity Lotus for the Guanyong,

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
you guys are so smart.

37
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Here.

38
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't hurt it!

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
The Longevity Lotus

40
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Qian Guang?

41
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why are you here?

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Feng Xiang, I've always been here.

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
This thing.

44
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
It's the paws of people who need to greet you.

45
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Qian Guang and Feng Xiang's representative

46
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is made by God force.

47
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,980
How did you manage to

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
let them meet?

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,600
how could you be controlled by the power of the wheel?

50
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,880
But the wheel said

51
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,480
the price was taken by the destiny.

52
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,880
It can't be changed.

53
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,840
Can't be changed?

54
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,160
I'm the one who broke the destiny.

55
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,400
What can I do with the rules of destiny?

56
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,560
Even if you can break the curse of the wheel,

57
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,720
why did you do that?

58
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,800
Are you

59
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,240
helping Qian Guang and Feng Xiang to make up for their regret?

60
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,240
Lord Demon Lord,

61
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,840
you're really kind and kind

62
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,680
to help people.

63
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,480
Kind and kind?

64
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,280
Long time no see.

65
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,720
Long time no see, Lord Qian Guang.

66
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,520
But I think this time

67
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,960
you have mistaken the wrong person.

68
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,760
I think it's a man,

69
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,840
but it's not a man.

70
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,280
I have no resemblance to him.

71
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,720
Are you coming with your old friend?

72
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,320
If you still have the same trouble,

73
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,160
are you still willing to risk your life to save him?

74
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,040
I'm willing to risk my life to save him.

75
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,480
Your so-called relationship is ridiculous.

76
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,600
Lord Qian Guang, you don't have to be so anxious to prove

77
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,640
the relationship between me and him.

78
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,960
You've been out of the devil's way for so many years.

79
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,160
You should know very well

80
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,960
that the devil and the righteous are at odds.

81
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,640
I want to,

82
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,640
but I don't mean it.

83
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,920
Why are you here?

84
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,440
I don't mean it.

85
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,120
Why are you here?

86
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,160
Feng Xiang has been trapped for 6,000 years.

87
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,440
This is a ridiculous life.

88
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,440
She has been tortured endlessly.

89
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
You want to help her, but you can't.

90
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,240
But what if I can help you?

91
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:23,760
You have a way.

92
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,760
The time of the ancient times was born on the 10th day,

93
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,160
and was set for nine days.

94
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,720
And this Mount Luo Wu is where the nine days were buried.

95
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,760
The power between heaven and earth will not be born in vain.

96
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,200
The one-day cycle set by the wheel of destiny

97
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,520
is made by the power of the nine-day cycle.

98
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,640
I can take the power of the nine-day cycle with my blood,

99
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
and the one-day cycle will be disbanded instantly.

100
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
But...

101
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,560
I've been here with Feng Xiang for 6,000 years.

102
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,800
I know the difference between what I want and the price.

103
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,840
Just tell me.

104
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,960
With Feng Xiang's past injury,

105
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,960
if there is no one-day cycle,

106
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,960
she won't live for many years.

107
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,760
She has been stolen for 6,000 years by the one-day cycle.

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,040
If the one-day cycle is disbanded,

109
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
she will also die together,

110
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,840
and lose her life by returning the rules.

111
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,200
Since you came to me,

112
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,960
there must be a way to solve it.

113
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,400
Tell me.

114
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,960
If you can't get the power of the nine-day cycle,

115
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,600
how can you break it?

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,220
The law of the

117
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,200
One-day cycle is not difficult.

118
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,200
Will she live

119
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,000
if I return her the rule?

120
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,200
Lord Qian Guang.

121
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,320
You have to think it over.

122
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,560
Don't be afraid of me thinking too well.

123
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,520
My intention is never pure.

124
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,560
Then, is there no side effect

125
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,240
in this impurity?

126
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
No.

127
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,400
It's fine if you say so.

128
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,600
But I don't think so.

129
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,200
I don't think so.

130
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
I don't think so.

131
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I don't think so.

132
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I don't think so.

133
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
I don't think so.

134
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,120
I don't think so.

135
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
I don't think so.

136
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,840
If you say so, then I don't think so.

137
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
Wait for me.

138
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
So,

139
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,680
I only asked for one day.

140
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,040
It's my fault.

141
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,280
I was too indecisive.

142
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,880
So I made an irreparable regret.

143
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,600
You didn't say it out.

144
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
And you are alone.

145
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,640
Since you are destined to be together,

146
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
just let it go.

147
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,560
Why are you still involved in this curse?

148
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,840
Because I don't accept it.

149
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I want to force myself

150
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:04,840
to see the result.

151
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:06,840
Will it be different?

152
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
This is the result you want to see.

153
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,440
I was trapped for one day.

154
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,840
And you can only sleep

155
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,440
and be alone.

156
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I have been here for six thousand years.

157
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Feng Xiang.

158
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,440
You may not remember.

159
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,840
We had more than 30,000 days

160
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,840
of loving each other.

161
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,040
The first hundred years after I found you,

162
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,440
we actually met every day.

163
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,040
You've been the princess of my heart.

164
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:06,840
You. You.

165
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,840
Why are you here?

166
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,440
Feng Xiang.

167
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,760
I came to look for you specially.

168
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,440
How is your injury?

169
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,040
I don't need the money and effort.

170
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,600
The longevity lotus is still young.

171
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
I'll wait for you.

172
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,920
How do you know I'm waiting for the longevity lotus?

173
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,440
Since you left,

174
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,480
I've been following your footsteps.

175
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,680
I know what you want.

176
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,000
You want to have cultivation

177
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,160
and me, right?

178
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
ở

179
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,360
Xiaobai.

180
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,320
As for you,

181
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,520
let me make the assessment.

182
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,760
I'm a Emperor.

183
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,360
Daochuan all these years

184
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:17,360
you were the target.

185
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,880
is it a miracle moment?

186
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,240
But why can't you be an enemy?

187
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:32,960
From the beginning,

188
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,240
it is all about you.

189
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:37,800
Fengxiao.

190
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Can you forgive my anger

191
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,280
and stupidity?

192
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,320
Will you start again?

193
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,960
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

194
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,040
I choose you...

195
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,560
in the rest of my life.

196
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,200
want to see the snows voted together.

197
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,440
Fengxiang,

198
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,280
I asked your condition.

199
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,320
How is your injury?

200
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,640
I'm not going to bother you.

201
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,800
I have things to do.

202
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,840
You should go back to Xian Meng.

203
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,040
Thanks to you,

204
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,560
the dark clan has been sealed.

205
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,680
The mortal world is no longer the same.

206
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,840
Aren't you bored

207
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,360
being here alone?

208
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,560
I'm not bored.

209
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,640
I'm bored.

210
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,280
I need to be with you.

211
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm not bored.

212
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm not bored.

213
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,960
I don't have time for that.

214
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,040
It's okay.

215
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,680
I have time.

216
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,520
Every time you wake up,

217
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,360
you don't remember.

218
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Every time you wake up,

219
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,240
we fall in love again.

220
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,080
Feng Xiang.

221
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,760
Can you forgive me?

222
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,680
Give me a chance

223
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,400
to start over.

224
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,800
Why are you so familiar?

225
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,480
Do you have another reason?

226
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,320
I don't have any reason.

227
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,600
You're the only one

228
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,480
in my heart.

229
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,920
Where is the other reason?

230
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,320
If it's more than 30,000 days,

231
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,400
I repeat the same confession and entanglements.

232
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,520
I'm just a kid.

233
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,040
Six thousand years.

234
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
More than two million days and nights.

235
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,360
Only you know.

236
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,520
Only you remember.

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,760
Actually, I'm not the one who's in pain.

238
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,280
I'm not the one who's in pain.

239
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:43,760
It's you.

240
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,320
I want to tell you something.

241
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
Actually,

242
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,760
I fell in love with you

243
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,280
long before.

244
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,000
I want to tell you my feelings

245
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,800
when I still remember.

246
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,560
In those more than 30,000 days,

247
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,800
have I ever said these?

248
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,000
That's good.

249
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,120
In fact, our six thousand years of missing

250
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,320
is also my fault.

251
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,360
It's my pride.

252
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,760
It doesn't allow me to be half-dead in front of you.

253
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,520
Your pride is not wrong.

254
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,360
The one who follows the incense

255
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,040
is wonderful and brilliant.

256
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,760
He's the one who nourishes the world.

257
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,800
You should be proud of him in this life.

258
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:55,720
Then,

259
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,640
what's the matter with the meeting

260
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,200
tonight?

261
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,040
I'll take you back one day.

262
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,680
What's the price?

263
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,280
Nowadays,

264
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,000
if you want me to go back and not beg,

265
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,240
then you come just to set me up.

266
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,360
Save it.

267
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,480
Your life follows mine.

268
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,240
This night

269
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,720
will be the last night in my birthday.

270
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,760
If you exchange it with your life,

271
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,560
I don't allow it.

272
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,480
Since we could see each other,

273
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,080
I was afraid that I would never be able to be with you,

274
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,680
so I made a wish.

275
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,480
But in the past six thousand years, I finally understood

276
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,280
that the nine lives in this life

277
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:53,880
are not the true meaning of life.

278
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,680
Being together forever is not the only proof of love.

279
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,680
Do you still remember the first time I saw you,

280
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,680
did I say anything to you?

281
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,880
If I don't see the life,

282
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,280
how can I not think of it?

283
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,280
If I don't see it with my own eyes,

284
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,280
how can I live forever?

285
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,280
Feng Xiao, you shouldn't be trapped here.

286
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,480
You should go to the other world

287
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,880
to see the fireworks in the human world.

288
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,680
But you will die.

289
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,880
We are colleagues, comrades, and partners.

290
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,280
No matter what your identities are,

291
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,080
apart from being partners,

292
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,480
there is also a word called being able to fulfill it.

293
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:59,280
Feng Xiao, forgive me.

294
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,480
I will leave first this time.

295
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:07,080
But I don't want you to feel the pain of losing me.

296
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:13,680
I will erase your memories.

297
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,080
When you wake up, you will forget me.

298
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,480
Forget the past six thousand years.

299
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,080
Promise me.

300
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
After you forget me,

301
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,280
you will be a happy and happy Feng Xiao.

302
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,080
Feng Xiao, okay?

303
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,680
If I don't promise you,

304
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,080
I will force you again.

305
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,080
Feng Xiao,

306
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,080
you know it.

307
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
I have my own way.

308
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,280
Every time I fight with you,

309
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,480
I can't get over it.

310
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,480
Feng Xiao,

311
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,080
just sleep for a bit longer.

312
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,680
That's enough.

313
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,680
After I wake up,

314
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:20,680
I will forget you completely.

315
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,480
When that time comes,

316
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,880
I will go to see my life.

317
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,680
In my fireworks,

318
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,880
don't regret it.

319
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,480
Okay.

320
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,680
Okay.

321
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,880
You are quite interesting.

322
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,280
Feng Xiao?

323
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,280
Qian Guang has someone in his heart.

324
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,280
I have a feeling for you.

325
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,280
I have a feeling for you.

326
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
I have a feeling for you.

327
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
I have a feeling for you.

328
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:33,280
The night is full of ice and the candlelight is on the night.

329
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,280
I look forward to living with you in my life.

330
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:47,280
Your face is like a warm wind blowing through the silence.

331
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,680
The love is deep and deep.

332
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:54,280
The past is so deep.

333
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,280
The love is deep and deep.

334
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:07,280
The love is deep and deep.

335
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,280
Thank you for helping me fulfill my wish.

336
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,280
Thank you?

337
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,080
For what?

338
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,280
My end is Feng Xiao's new life.

339
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,680
Of course I should thank you.

340
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,280
Just do what you need to do.

341
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,280
I have erased Feng Xiao's memory.

342
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,680
After he wakes up,

343
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,280
he will not remember me.

344
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,280
The seven phoenixes are in danger.

345
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Feng Xiang is weak tonight.

346
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,680
I want you two to help me again.

347
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,280
Help me take care of him.

348
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,280
Please.

349
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,280
Your love and yours

350
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,080
will not be remembered by him.

351
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,680
It will no longer exist.

352
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,280
Are you really satisfied?

353
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,080
Love does not exist.

354
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,480
Every day he is happy and carefree,

355
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,280
is the place where my love belongs.

356
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,280
Let's go.

357
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:00,680
I will follow you to see the life-saving statue

358
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,080
and do some things.

359
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,480
How is your life in the neighboring island?

360
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
Thank you for your concern.

361
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,880
Everything is fine.

362
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
I will go now.

363
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,980
I will go now.

364
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Let's go.

365
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
Go.

366
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
Go.

367
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
Let's go.

368
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
Go.

369
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
Go.

370
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
Go.

371
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
Go.

372
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Go.

373
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Go.

374
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
Go.

375
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
Go.

376
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Go.

377
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Go.

378
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Go.

379
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,800
I can go now?

380
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,680
No...

381
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,680
I can eat.

382
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,880
The belt at the bottom is all crumpled up.

383
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,560
Feng Xiang uncomfortable.

384
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
I returned the static kötü to you.

385
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,640
Poisoners will be dead.

386
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,280
Time is different.

387
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
One thousand years

388
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,480
is just by a banner.

389
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,480
I'm still a dream,

390
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,480
but I'm not in love with you.

391
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:01,480
In this life,

392
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I have no regrets.

393
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,480
I'll stay by your side.

394
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Cherish what's worth.

395
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Don't wait.

396
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm still a dream,

397
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,480
but I'm not in love with you.

398
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,480
In this life,

399
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
I have no regrets.

400
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,480
I'll stay by your side.

401
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Why are you still here?

402
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
Your Majesty,

403
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
do you know us?

404
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,480
Do you think I'm confused?

405
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,480
Yesterday,

406
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,480
you came to the place of the waterless earth

407
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
to find the longevity forest.

408
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
You even fought with me.

409
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,480
Did you forget?

410
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,480
He also has the concept of yesterday.

411
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,480
It can be seen that he has broken the curse of reincarnation.

412
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
That's a comfortable win.

413
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,480
You're really petty.

414
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
You're really petty.

415
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
But there's nothing to deny.

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Your cultivation is above me.

417
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,480
I lost.

418
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,480
The longevity forest,

419
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,480
you can take it if you want.

420
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,480
The longevity forest blooms after a hundred years.

421
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,480
If you want it,

422
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
you have to wait another hundred years.

423
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Wait here for a hundred years,

424
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
just for a longevity forest.

425
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
Just for a longevity forest.

426
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,480
It's boring.

427
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
It's really boring.

428
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,480
You came to the place of the waterless earth

429
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,480
not to find the longevity forest and find the longevity forest?

430
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
Find the longevity forest?

431
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm just curious

432
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
if there's really a longevity forest

433
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
not to find the longevity forest.

434
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Besides, little girl,

435
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
do you really think longevity

436
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,480
is a lucky thing?

437
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Are you going to find the Qian Guang Jun?

438
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Who is Qian Guang Jun?

439
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Why should I go to find him?

440
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Everyone knows

441
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
Qian Guang Jun is the leader

442
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,480
of the Alliance.

443
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
Alliance is

444
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
a group of people who are not yet to be killed.

445
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
I don't want to be their target.

446
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I agree.

447
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,480
I agree.

448
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Where are you going now?

449
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Where are you going now?

450
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I haven't decided yet.

451
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
But the world

452
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,480
is full of

453
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
interesting places.

454
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,480
I advise you

455
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
not to stay in this cold place

456
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
and waste your time.

457
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
I've been in the dream for a thousand years.

458
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,480
I couldn't forget

459
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,480
the one I can't see.

460
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,480
I finally let it go.

461
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Do you really believe

462
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,480
he forgot?

463
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,480
Whether he forgot or not

464
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,480
is only his own decision.

465
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
As long as he can let it go,

466
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
it doesn't matter

467
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,480
if I believe it or not.

468
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
What about you?

469
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,480
Did you let it go?

470
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,480
What's the big deal?

471
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Since the longevity forest

472
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
has been obtained,

473
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,480
the story is over.

474
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
Go to Yongxue City now.

475
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
Qian Guang,

476
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,480
I'm sorry.

477
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,480
I didn't do it on purpose.

478
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,480
We have the same cultivation.

479
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,480
If I don't want to,

480
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
you can't erase my memory.

481
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,480
Although it's painful to bring the memory,

482
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
I still don't want to forget you.

483
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
What you want

484
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,480
I will try to achieve.

485
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
See the life,

486
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
see the fireworks.

487
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480
I will be as you wish.

488
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,480
Free and carefree,

489
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,480
proud and relaxed.

490
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
You have to be careful.

491
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,480
I will go now.

492
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Go.

493
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,480
Go.

494
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,480
Go.

495
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
Go.

496
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,480
Go.

497
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,480
Go.

498
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,480
Go.

499
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
Go.

500
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,480
Go.

501
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,480
Go.

502
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
Go.

503
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,480
Go.

504
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,120
but there is still a demon in the heart

505
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,120
when you keep your thoughts straight.

506
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,120
A demon in the heart

507
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,120
may not be evil.

508
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,120
A demon without a heart

509
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
may not be evil.

510
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:58,120
Many things

511
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,120
are just a thought.

512
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
Does the fate

513
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
also know?

514
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
The one who is respected

515
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,120
should keep my heart.

516
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,120
I am surrounded by demons in the heart.

517
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,760
If I can stand

518
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,760
at a thousand years' height,

519
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,760
can I see through it?

520
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Time

521
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,760
is not the key to see through it.

522
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,760
It's hard to do what you want.

523
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,760
If you can take it up,

524
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
if you can let it go,

525
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,760
you won't have to force yourself.

526
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,400
Goodbye.

527
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,400
Do you really plan to

528
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,400
keep it a secret?

529
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
I don't know.

530
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,400
I don't know.

531
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
I don't know.

532
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
I don't know.

533
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
I don't know.

534
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,040
How did you not see it?

535
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,040
Xuanxin's observation is very good.

536
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
When we are not seeing each other,

537
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,040
it's good for each other.

538
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,040
She must have noticed it.

539
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
In the end, she is the blood relative.

540
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Even their preferences are similar.

541
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,200
I feel hard to be fresh

542
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,280
You don't need many inherently

543
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,360
You can sleep to your heart's content

544
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,240
That will be good

545
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,200
It's late

546
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm not.

547
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,720
It's just that the wind is a little cold tonight.

548
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,120
My eyes are a little dry.

549
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,680
Tonight, I watched the sky at night.

550
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,160
I found that the sky was moving.

551
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,080
The two stars are calling out to each other.

552
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,520
It's very unfavorable to me.

553
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:19,240
So,

554
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,360
I just calculated it.

555
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,320
I found that

556
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,720
I have to give the person I love

557
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,840
the thing I love

558
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,040
to dissolve it.

559
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,360
Only when I love someone,

560
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,200
can I find it.

561
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,760
If you want me to find you,

562
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,960
you have to find me.

563
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,280
If I want to find you,

564
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,600
it depends on whether this gift

565
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,200
is my heart or not.

566
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,360
Do I like it or not?

567
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,400
Of course.

568
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,280
It seems that

569
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:06,320
my talent in making magic weapons

570
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,520
is quite strong.

571
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,960
I just studied it a little bit.

572
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,720
I've remade the Sword of Talisman

573
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,560
perfectly.

574
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,360
How is it?

575
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,160
The Sword of Talisman

576
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,040
is different from the ordinary sword.

577
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,080
Its body and all the minerals

578
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,120
are similar.

579
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,120
Therefore, there is no way to make it again.

580
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,720
I guess you've spent a lot of time on it.

581
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,520
I don't want to be a burden to you.

582
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:33,400
Fu Lansheng,

583
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,680
thank you.

584
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,440
Why do you have to thank me?

585
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:41,760
I want to see you

586
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,560
as a human-type?

587
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,880
That's all

588
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,240
my arrogant words.

589
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:50,960
After all,

590
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,200
I've already seen my ordinary life.

591
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,960
I've been practicing for a long time.

592
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,360
I'm still a beginner.

593
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:01,920
Master passed on his cultivation to me.

594
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,920
I just wanted to see the reason.

595
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,600
All the way,

596
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,800
I've done a lot of things

597
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,720
but I've done very few.

598
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,600
The Sword of Talisman

599
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,160
is the symbol of the Princess of Jinghua Palace.

600
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,640
That day in the dark prison,

601
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,640
I couldn't even protect it.

602
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,440
The Sword of Talisman

603
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,240
is my own uselessness.

604
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,440
So,

605
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,240
you rejected your sisters

606
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,000
and took the title of Princess of Jinghua Palace.

607
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,840
Qiumi,

608
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,680
you're not ordinary at all.

609
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,200
You're willing to risk your life to save

610
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,400
those sisters who once courted you.

611
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,440
You don't have the ability

612
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,200
to grab so many nuclear wires.

613
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,320
But you really give me the facts.

614
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,200
You kept screaming

615
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,880
without hesitation when you erg esto ouf danger.

616
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,080
You even

617
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,480
talk about

618
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,040
the shocking things to me.

619
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,260
Everyone

620
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,560
has to be powerful.

621
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,480
But every time,

622
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,760
you just go so far as to meet what you want.

623
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,200
Whenever I look at these things,

624
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,280
I find myself thinking

625
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,120
whether I should try harder

626
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,160
and be more brave.

627
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:26,760
Why you are so quiet todayMother?

628
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,640
What's your opinion?

629
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,760
I have a feeling you will pick a fancy one

630
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:41,200
What?

631
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,800
I…

632
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,680
That's wasting your time

633
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
If you don't believe in yourself,

634
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,600
you can believe in me.

635
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,400
Not only do I believe in you,

636
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,200
many people believe in you.

637
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,800
Who'sBlack that Everyone Kid bows to?

638
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,960
Of all the disciples speak,

639
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,400
only you

640
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,800
has never deliberately bound me.

641
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:38,360
garment.

642
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,840
But you still achieved

643
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,920
absolutely pacifism.

644
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,360
A pacifi even without a mind.

645
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,680
Xuan Xi,

646
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,160
your Taoists

647
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,000
have surpassed Master.

648
00:37:50,680 --> 00:38:04,600
Tifu,

649
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:12,240
Ladie,

650
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,680
Sir,

651
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
You...

652
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
As the new king,

653
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,680
can't you touch the right path?

654
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
If you're greedy,

655
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,680
you can't bear to miss the new part.

656
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,680
Put it down when you should.

657
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,680
You haven't got it, but you're shameless.

658
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,680
How can you be shameless if you can't keep it?

659
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
So what if I'm shameless?

660
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
So what if I know it?

661
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,680
Why do I keep thinking about it?

662
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,680
There's no end to the world.

663
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,680
Life is like a road.

664
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,680
If we talk about the original,

665
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,680
it's all about the past.

666
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
If we talk about the original,

667
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,680
it's all about the past.

668
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,680
So what if I'm shameless?

669
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,680
So what if I know it?

670
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:12,680
Why do I keep thinking about it?

671
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:14,680
There's no end to the world.

672
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,680
Life is like a road.

673
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,680
If we talk about the original,

674
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,680
it's all about the past.

675
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,680
Xuan Xin,

676
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,680
I believe you.

677
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
You can do it.

678
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
If you're born,

679
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,680
you'll have many lives.

680
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
If you die,

681
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,680
you'll have many lives.

682
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,680
So what if I know it?

683
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,680
So what if I know it?

684
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,680
I don't care.

685
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:15,680
Why did you kill Zhen in Yongxue City?

686
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
Demon Lord will come tomorrow.

687
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
Please come to my dream.

688
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,680
You don't believe Mu Xuan Ling can complete the plan?

689
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,680
I don't believe in everything.

690
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,680
Feng Yao,

691
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,680
I'm sorry.

692
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
I'm sorry.

693
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
I'm sorry.

694
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,680
I'm sorry.

695
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Do you know what the world of painting is?

696
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,680
And what the world outside the painting is?

697
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:54,680
The world of painting is created by you.

698
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,680
And the world outside the painting

699
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,680
is where we really exist.

700
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,680
Then how do you know

701
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,680
you're in the painting

702
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,680
or outside the painting?

703
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,680
Outwardly.

704
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,680
At ease.

705
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
Don't be so light.

706
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
It's the same everywhere.

707
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,680
At ease.

708
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,680
If everything can be done with peace of mind,

709
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,680
then it's good.

710
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,680
Why are you in a hurry to get the sword?

711
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Since we're all here,

712
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,680
why don't we have a good time?

713
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,680
What are you up to again?

714
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:03,680
I'm just asking you to come to my dream.

715
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,680
You've been with him again.

716
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,680
You're trying to deal with me.

717
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,680
It's not like that.

718
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,680
I took you to Qiongju Island and the Snow Tower.

719
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,680
Although the process was deceiving,

720
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,680
I never thought of hurting you.

721
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:35,680
I just want to evolve you

722
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
and help you return to the right path.

723
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,680
Return to the right path?

724
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,680
It's fine to be right,

725
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,680
but how can I evolve?

726
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,680
You're just like those stupid people.

727
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,680
You want a righteous person

728
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:50,680
to be free from the right path.

729
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,680
You...

730
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,680
This...

731
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
There's a ghost here.

732
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,680
That's right.

733
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,680
What's going on?

734
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,680
Demon Lord has no possibility of evolving.

735
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
The way to evolve completely

736
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,680
is to kill it.

737
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,680
But I saw the way to evolve in the Heaven Destiny Book.

738
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
You've never really entered the Heaven Destiny Book.

739
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,680
You entered the illusion I created.

740
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,680
What you can see

741
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,680
is the real Heaven Destiny Book.

742
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:42,680
I'm just kidding.

743
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:44,680
What you can see

744
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,680
is what I want you to see.

745
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,680
You've been trying to evolve

746
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,680
and use the Demon Lord.

747
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,680
But you've been trying to kill me.

748
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:56,680
That's right.

749
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,680
The enemy of Wushui, Demon God,

750
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,680
actually used the Spirit Water to make the Demon Soul.

751
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:04,680
The Xuanbing Su-Mogu of the Snow-Castle

752
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,680
actually used the Xuanbing

753
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,680
Su-Mogu of the Snow-Castle to kill the Demon Lord.

754
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,680
And now, the only thing left

755
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,680
is to use the Power of Chaos

756
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,680
to kill the Demon Lord completely.

757
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
I gave you the Power of Chaos.

758
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,680
I can seal it.

759
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,680
Even if you sealed the Power of Chaos,

760
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,680
what's the point?

761
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,680
I've already set up a killing formation in the city.

762
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,680
But the Xuanxin has broken through the magic statue

763
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
and upgraded the Yan-Sword.

764
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,680
It led the Immortal Alliance to guard the outside.

765
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:47,680
Demon Lord,

766
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,680
you can't escape from this Yongxue City.

767
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,680
Why do you have to kill it?

768
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,680
Because the future generations

769
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,680
will destroy the Heaven and the Earth.

770
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,680
And Demon Lord is closely related to the future generations.

771
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,680
The future generations will create the world.

772
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:07,680
How can we destroy the world?

773
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,680
It's not something that can be said in a few words.

774
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,680
You just need to remember

775
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,680
that if you don't kill the Demon Lord,

776
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,680
the Heaven will definitely destroy the world.

777
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,680
Do you want to see

778
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:36,680
the world that Xie Xuechen risked his life to protect

779
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,680
completely destroyed?

780
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,680
The evil thoughts of Demon Lord

781
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,680
were forced by the Heaven's fate.

782
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,680
But even so, he's still ungrateful.

783
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:53,680
He shouldn't have been killed like this.

784
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:56,680
If the wrong thing happens this time,

785
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:59,680
you can never kill me again.

786
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,680
Have you thought it through?

787
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,680
You're not a good person.

788
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,680
You're a bad person.

789
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,680
I've already figured it out all along.

790
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,680
You're not a bad person.

791
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:17,680
Even if the Heaven comes,

792
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,680
I believe that people will be able to win.

793
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,680
Just like what Zhaoming and Xie Xuechen did,

794
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,680
they were also fighting against the Heaven.

795
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:29,680
I was awake.

796
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,680
But you answered me well.

797
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,680
It's time.

798
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,680
It's time.

799
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:42,680
It's time.

800
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:45,680
It's time.

801
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:10,680
For love, I'll go through the snow and the rain

802
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:16,680
I look forward to the day I spend with you

803
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,680
Looking at that person, a dream, drunk and without a face

804
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:30,680
I have no regrets in this life, I'm by your side

805
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:43,680
For love, I'll go through the snow and the rain

806
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:52,680
I look forward to the day I spend with you

807
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:59,680
For love, I'll go through the snow and the rain

808
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,680
I look forward to the day I spend with you

809
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:12,680
Looking at that person, a dream, drunk and without a face

810
00:49:12,680 --> 00:49:19,680
I have no regrets in this life, I'm by your side

811
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:33,680
