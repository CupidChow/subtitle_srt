00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,200
The

2
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,200
The

3
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,200
The

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,200
The

5
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
The

6
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
The

7
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,200
The

8
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
The

9
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,200
The

10
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,200
The

11
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
The

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,200
The

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,480
The

14
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,480
The

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,700
The

16
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,740
The

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,740
The

18
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,700
I hope you can support us

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,700
We have been fighting long and hard for ourM Philosophy

20
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,200
HMM

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,700
OK

22
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,700
If you allow I'll leave

23
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
Thanks

24
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,200
Master Xie, there's one last thing.

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,640
Can I see Xuan Xin again?

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,320
Yes.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,480
I told you long ago

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,960
that it's cold and cold.

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,560
You should wear more clothes.

30
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,640
Why did you forget it again?

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,520
Master,

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,880
you've made up your mind.

33
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm different from others.

34
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm not possessed by the Dark Clan

35
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,160
or possessed by anyone.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,800
Everything

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
is my own choice.

38
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,640
I should be

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,800
responsible for all the crimes.

40
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Master once said I was ignorant.

41
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,600
But I couldn't

42
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,600
do it.

43
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,240
Master,

44
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,920
I don't want you to die.

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,560
I believe you can do it.

46
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,600
You're born with a clear mind.

47
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,400
From now on,

48
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:50,360
you're the new master of the Dark Clan.

49
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,640
You'll help Master Xie to calm down.

50
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
You'll lead the disciples of the Dark Clan

51
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,760
to find a new guardian.

52
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,480
Promise me.

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
You can do it.

54
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:10,360
I

55
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
will do it.

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,160
The love between people is hard to break.

57
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,160
It needs to be done.

58
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,680
Don't blame Master Xie.

59
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,160
Don't blame anyone.

60
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,160
The most ungrateful person I've ever lied to

61
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,960
is you, silly boy.

62
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,840
Is the hairpin you gave me true?

63
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:41,960
That day,

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,120
everyone in the righteous court had a demon in their heart.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,120
But not everyone would be possessed.

66
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,160
Can we control our obsession and desire?

67
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,280
Can we choose the right path?

68
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,280
It depends on who we choose.

69
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
There's not only one answer

70
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,400
in the world.

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,400
So, Xuan Xin,

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,200
go your way

73
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,480
and find your own answer.

74
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,840
I

75
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,880
can only call you here.

76
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,520
Master.

77
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,280
Go back.

78
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,480
I'll go

79
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,400
on my own in the last battle.

80
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,520
I'll go show them

81
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,800
what I'm made of.

82
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,800
Okay.

83
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Is it for the sake of the spirit clan?

84
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you for your help,

85
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,480
Chief Nan.

86
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,960
You're welcome.

87
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm glad to have it.

88
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,080
How are Xue Chen and Miss Mu?

89
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
They've left the clan in the name of the Lord.

90
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,480
The news has spread to all the clans.

91
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,720
The Lord has just finished handling the matter.

92
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,920
As for Mu Xuan Ling,

93
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,560
she has nothing to do

94
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
but to stay in the Snow Tower to recuperate.

95
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
However,

96
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,320
although she's a little talkative,

97
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,320
I can't say much

98
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,920
if she's not here.

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,680
I'll go back and report to the Lord.

100
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,600
Goodbye.

101
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Take care.

102
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,320
It's the first time I've seen such a free prisoner.

104
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,440
It's different with the support.

105
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,320
Why are you here, Chief Nan?

106
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,440
I'm thinking

107
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,920
if I should go back to the Cloud Embroidery.

108
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
That's right.

109
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,480
You were not involved in the Alliance's chaos.

110
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
I came here to help Xie Xue Chen.

111
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:56,080
Now, the Three Shadow Clouds have been destroyed.

112
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,680
The Alliance has been captured.

113
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,880
Zhu Tai Yi has the guardians of all clans.

114
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,240
Xie Xue Chen has regained his power.

115
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,880
You should go back and have a rest.

116
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,080
What about you?

117
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm now a prisoner of Snow Tower.

118
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:12,840
I can be free.

119
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,080
But the Alliance won't let me go.

120
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,760
You don't miss your office life in Cloud Embroidery Manor.

121
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Do you?

122
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,400
You do whatever you want.

123
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,120
You really don't consider

124
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,240
the suggestions to Confuciangiggling Manor?

125
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,520
Chief Nan,

126
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,120
you seem to help me

127
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,760
a little too much.

128
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,920
Why put so many risks

129
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,520
In fact, I wanted to take you away

130
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,840
from Mingyue Villa.

131
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,280
If I took you away,

132
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,960
you wouldn't have met Xie Xuechen

133
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,720
or Sang Qi.

134
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,640
You wouldn't have lived a ten-year dark and silent life.

135
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,360
You wouldn't have become a demoness who was killed by the Alliance.

136
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:08,920
I have a regret

137
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
for what I've done.

138
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,360
I've never given you anything.

139
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,360
I'm not good to you.

140
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
You don't have to be like this.

141
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:23,400
You've given me something.

142
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,040
I...

143
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,520
You just don't know.

144
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,640
Let me tell you a secret.

145
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,160
Do you want to hear it?

146
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,360
I'll keep it a secret.

147
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
In fact,

148
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
my three sects were destroyed

149
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,760
and it wasn't done by the Dark Clan.

150
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,240
It was my brother

151
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,920
who colluded with the evil sect

152
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,760
and pretended to be the Dark Clan to take me away.

153
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:02,960
Xingyi,

154
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
you're my son too.

155
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,600
But since you did something that would hurt your brother,

156
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,080
I...

157
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
I have no choice.

158
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,400
I colluded with the evil sect

159
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,680
and caused his three sects to be destroyed

160
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,880
and destroyed his two sects.

161
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,120
So what?

162
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,560
I won't destroy him.

163
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,280
Do you know that I have a son like that?

164
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,320
Bastard!

165
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,200
You bastard!

166
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,920
I'll kill you!

167
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,800
I told Xun Yue to do that!

168
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,120
The three sects of Nanxun Yue have been destroyed.

169
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,360
You can't do anything about it.

170
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,000
But the letter is also a golden pill.

171
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,000
It's also forgotten.

172
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,520
Do you want to ruin the hope of the mountain villa

173
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,560
for a useless person?

174
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
I'm willing to die to atone for my crime.

175
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:44,800
You want to kill me,

176
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,920
don't kill me!

177
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,640
Get out of my way!

178
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,840
I'll kill you!

179
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,720
Mother.

180
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
She atoned for Nanxun Yue's crime

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,160
and atoned for all her crimes.

182
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,840
I still can't forget

183
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,840
how she looked before she died.

184
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,040
Mother!

185
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,040
It seems that she was very satisfied.

186
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,400
I'm sorry.

187
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,600
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,720
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
I'm sorry.

190
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,280
I'm sorry.

191
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,040
I'm sorry.

192
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,840
I'm sorry.

193
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,680
I'm sorry.

194
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,680
She's satisfied.

195
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,880
Her son can get everything.

196
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,800
But she just died.

197
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,240
It's too late.

198
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,520
I was angry

199
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,080
because of my father's bias and injustice.

200
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,640
But at that moment,

201
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,360
I only have Xie Mo left.

202
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
Someone can love her so much.

203
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:42,160
She can even die for her lover.

204
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,720
In my life,

205
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,600
I've never met anyone like that.

206
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,240
But when I met you,

207
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,200
you promised

208
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,400
to give me a little bit of love.

209
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,960
You give me a little bit of your love.

210
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,280
I'll give you a little bit of my love.

211
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,440
That's just my unintentional words.

212
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,480
I know.

213
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,480
It's just that after many years of reunion,

214
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,920
I saw your love and devotion to Xie Xue Chen.

215
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:26,920
I finally understand

216
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,680
what I missed.

217
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Nan Xun Yue.

218
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,560
You don't like me, do you?

219
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't know.

220
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,080
I don't know if I like you

221
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,360
or your love for someone else.

222
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,440
So I think I should leave,

223
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,560
try to stay away from you and her,

224
00:14:57,280 --> 00:15:00,480
and see what I want.

225
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:10,600
Yeah.

226
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,720
She.

227
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,760
You.

228
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,480
I...

229
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
You...

230
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,680
What's my heart?

231
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,760
How much did you hear?

232
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:00,440
Not much.

233
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,600
From the moment you said you liked her.

234
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,440
What's that look?

235
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,760
You didn't care?

236
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,040
Or you were angry?

237
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,000
Why didn't you tell me?

238
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,600
I didn't even figure it out.

239
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,000
How can I tell you?

240
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,640
Or should I tell you

241
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,880
I like

242
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,360
the feeling of her liking you?

243
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,240
Doesn't it sound weird?

244
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,360
So I think

245
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,880
I should keep a distance from her.

246
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,000
What if you do?

247
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,480
Xie Xue Chen I know

248
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,520
rarely asks about one thing.

249
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,960
Are you flustered?

250
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,040
No.

251
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,120
She's always thinking about you.

252
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,360
What's there to be afraid of?

253
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:00,520
In a few days,

254
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,520
I'll be going back to Yun Xiu Villa.

255
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,520
You don't have to see me off.

256
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
And I advise you

257
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,920
to act first.

258
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
You must realize my wish.

259
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,240
Then nothing will change.

260
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,160
I'm leaving.

261
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,760
Are you having fun?

262
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,800
It was

263
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,000
the first time

264
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:44,400
I heard

265
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,440
from the South Blue House.

266
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:49,760
Are you angry?

267
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,120
Not at all.

268
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,240
Are you going down the hill today?

269
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:55,960
Surely.

270
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,120
Why not?

271
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,280
You said you're not angry.

272
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,000
Usually with Xie Xue Chen,

273
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,000
you just

274
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,600
stay by her side.

275
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,360
Normally, Xie Xue Chen

276
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,200
wouldn't say that.

277
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,720
If you don't want to go, then forget it.

278
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:10,720
Go!

279
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,080
Go! Go wherever you want!

280
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,840
You're taking me down the mountain like this.

281
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,800
I'm afraid it's not good to be so obvious.

282
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
If you don't kill me,

283
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,760
Princess Wei Su

284
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,320
will be very dissatisfied.

285
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,200
Let's go.

286
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,800
Now such a simple Founding Spirit

287
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,320
that I've been separated from Left yang've Aries is here.

288
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,640
The cliff is so high.

289
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,240
I'm kind of scared to be seen.

290
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,720
But Xie Xue Chen.

291
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,240
I made up an idea

292
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,680
of a good way to cover up.

293
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,320
You...

294
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,720
Ming,

295
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,120
please.

296
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,140
How is it?

297
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,100
Has no one seen you?

298
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,660
I don't want to be disturbed by others.

299
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:45,380
All right.

300
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:47,500
No one can recognize you then.

301
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,140
Let's go.

302
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:50,780
Let's go.

303
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,420
Whose hand are you using?

304
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:06,940
Good.

305
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:07,820
Good.

306
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:08,380
Good.

307
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:08,780
Good.

308
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,380
Good.

309
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,020
Good.

310
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,580
Good.

311
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,340
Good.

312
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,100
Good.

313
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,900
Good.

314
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,580
Good.

315
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,580
Good.

316
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,540
Good.

317
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,100
Good.

318
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,940
Good.

319
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,460
Good.

320
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,100
Good.

321
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,500
Good.

322
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,220
Good.

323
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,780
Good.

324
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,060
Do you want to make a big move?

325
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:21,620
Yes.

326
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,500
Good.

327
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,300
Good.

328
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,140
Good.

329
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,140
Look carefully.

330
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:26,820
First shot.

331
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:28,860
Second shot.

332
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,580
Good.

333
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,380
Good.

334
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,340
Good.

335
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,420
The knife is in the person.

336
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,060
Both knives fly together.

337
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,780
Good.

338
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,900
He's lying. I know it too.

339
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:41,300
Do you know that in the mortal world,

340
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,380
you'll get beaten up?

341
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,060
How do you know?

342
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,300
You've been beaten up?

343
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,180
Really?

344
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,580
You've really been beaten up?

345
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,580
Good.

346
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,340
One more.

347
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:54,820
Good.

348
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,620
Tell me.

349
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,740
You're so skilled.

350
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,900
Who dares to beat you?

351
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,220
I'm just young.

352
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:00,900
Don't mention it.

353
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,020
You're so funny.

354
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,020
I won't mention it.

355
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,580
Desserts.

356
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,580
Anyway, what's important is the modern woman.

357
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,580
Desserts.

358
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,340
Desserts.

359
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:10,940
Desserts?

360
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,940
Desserts.

361
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,380
Desserts.

362
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:14,980
Desserts just came out.

363
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Miss, try it.

364
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,620
This one.

365
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,460
This one.

366
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,220
This one.

367
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,420
All of them.

368
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:23,620
Okay.

369
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,140
You like to eat desserts so much.

370
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,700
In the mortal world,

371
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,020
the first thing my brother took me to eat

372
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,940
was desserts.

373
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:34,020
Desserts.

374
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Desserts.

375
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,020
Desserts.

376
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,020
You pay for it, right?

377
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,180
The news is all over the place.

378
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,620
You're a bit brave.

379
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,060
You're a cultivator.

380
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,380
You're not like me.

381
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,820
Miss,

382
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,500
you're wrong.

383
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,740
If it's about the way of calculation,

384
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,020
we mortals

385
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:11,580
may not lose to

386
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,180
those high-ranking cultivators.

387
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
What do you mean?

388
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,900
They're just calculating the fate of the cultivators.

389
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,620
How many lives are there in cultivators?

390
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,700
For hundreds of years,

391
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,500
even if they talk nonsense for so long,

392
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,300
they'll probably wait until the day they're tough.

393
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,620
But the law of the mortal world

394
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,620
is so strict.

395
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
And mortals

396
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,860
live for decades.

397
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,300
But they're far from patient.

398
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:40,300
If they're not accurate,

399
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,060
in less than a month,

400
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,420
they'll be allowed to be in the limelight.

401
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,700
It makes sense.

402
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:50,860
For example,

403
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,860
the legendary Yunxiu Villa.

404
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,260
They all say the owner has the ability to take over the world

405
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,820
and calculate the fate of the people.

406
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
It's reliable.

407
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,220
It's not.

408
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,620
If he really has the ability,

409
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:08,220
how could the Yunxiu Villa

410
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,940
be taken over by the mortals?

411
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,180
The map?

412
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,180
Miss,

413
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,660
what do you want to calculate?

414
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:19,900
Fate.

415
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,580
I wonder if you have eight characters.

416
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,020
Eight characters?

417
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,220
I don't know.

418
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,980
Okay.

419
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,660
Miss,

420
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,500
can you put these coins on the case?

421
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,220
I'll solve it for you.

422
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,220
Miss,

423
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,020
you're in a complicated relationship.

424
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,420
That's right.

425
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:48,780
In your opinion,

426
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,420
will there be any changes in this relationship?

427
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,620
No.

428
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,220
Miss,

429
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,260
you're in a dead end.

430
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,580
I don't think it's a good idea.

431
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,900
As the saying goes,

432
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,420
the old won't go, the new won't come.

433
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,460
Why don't you add a few more coins?

434
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,420
I'll show you the next one.

435
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,580
Nonsense.

436
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,500
You're a liar.

437
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,260
No need to wait a month.

438
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,380
I'll take your money now.

439
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,940
You...

440
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,740
Get back off.

441
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:40,380
Miss Feng,

442
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,780
Excuse me.

443
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,700
I can explain.

444
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,420
Why are you talking to him?

445
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,820
I don't like his conclusion.

446
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,380
He's just an ordinary man.

447
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,660
I'm just an ordinary man too.

448
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,460
He and I are obviously enemies.

449
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,140
I won't let you be a part of your evil work.

450
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,340
I'm just like that.

451
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,020
I'm afraid that

452
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,660
a thousand years is not enough for me to learn to be a part of it.

453
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,500
So,

454
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,460
you have to keep an eye on me.

455
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,060
Do you like it?

456
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,500
No.

457
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,980
Really?

458
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,460
No.

459
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,020
What would you like to eat?

460
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,820
Two bowls of noodles.

461
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,460
Okay, please wait a moment.

462
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,380
Thank you.

463
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,100
You seem to be familiar with this noodle house.

464
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:23,260
Do you come here often?

465
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,020
I used to come here often.

466
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,340
But

467
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,420
the owner seems to be pregnant.

468
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,580
Two bowls of noodles are ready.

469
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,580
Thank you.

470
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,540
Thank you for saving my father a few days ago.

471
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,940
I'll treat you to these two bowls of noodles.

472
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,900
Your father?

473
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:44,580
Do you remember

474
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,140
a few days ago,

475
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,820
I helped an old man who was sick

476
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,220
and was robbed by a thief?

477
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,500
My money is gone.

478
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,420
You should be glad that you're in the mortal world.

479
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,140
Otherwise, you would be dead now.

480
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,500
Please spare my life.

481
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,580
Get out.

482
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,100
Thank you.

483
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,140
Old man,

484
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,220
why did you come out to buy medicine at such a young age?

485
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,260
Is there no one at home?

486
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,380
I have a son at home.

487
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,700
You're not filial.

488
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,620
Miss, you misunderstood.

489
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,460
I've been sick for years.

490
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,420
My savings are all spent.

491
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,980
My son has been buying medicine for me

492
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,660
and making noodles day and night.

493
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
I don't want him to run around

494
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
and come to get medicine by himself.

495
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,020
It's okay.

496
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:39,420
Is that old man your father?

497
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,660
That's my father.

498
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:41,860
After my father came back,

499
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,060
he told me everything about saving you.

500
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,980
From your clothes to your age,

501
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,740
he kept it in his heart.

502
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,420
I thank you again for my father.

503
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,660
It's okay.

504
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:54,700
And my daughter.

505
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,260
After hearing this from my grandfather,

506
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,540
she said she would be a hero like you.

507
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,580
Xiaofeng, come here.

508
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,380
She's shy.

509
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,900
She doesn't dare to come to see you.

510
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:10,660
Miss, you and this...

511
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,500
My husband.

512
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,820
You and your husband should come here

513
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,380
and eat noodles with me.

514
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,260
Don't charge me.

515
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,540
Since you said so,

516
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,700
we'll eat with you.

517
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,620
You're welcome.

518
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,940
Enjoy your meal.

519
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,300
Eat.

520
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,540
Thanks to you,

521
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,260
I can eat a bowl of noodles without money.

522
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,100
Thank you, Chen.

523
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,100
Tonight,

524
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,340
I seem to see the real world.

525
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,020
It's not that good.

526
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,380
But it seems

527
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,140
not that bad.

528
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,380
Xiaofeng, look at the fireworks.

529
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,820
Last time I saw the fireworks

530
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,420
was ten years ago.

531
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:33,460
Is that person so important to you?

532
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,180
Your big brother.

533
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,740
It's important.

534
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,020
Very important.

535
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,660
Are you sure you can tell the difference between me and him?

536
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,180
I have a very simple

537
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,620
but accurate way to tell the difference.

538
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,260
Do you know what it is?

539
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,540
Come here.

540
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,580
I'll tell you.

541
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,860
I don't have feelings for my big brother.

542
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,700
I have feelings for you.

543
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,620
If the time passes by ten thousand years

544
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,060
I'll bring you to him.

545
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,180
There's aumph between the eye and the river

546
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:32,660
The past seems to be in love

547
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,080
as if we loved each other

548
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
precariously

549
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,100
Every night they cook

550
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,300
It's a pity.

551
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,700
What's a pity?

552
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,300
The journey is over.

553
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,300
The prisoner of Snowblade City

554
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,900
should go back to the prison.

555
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,300
You don't need to go back.

556
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
Where should I go?

557
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,300
I've been staying at the Snow Tower.

558
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,100
What's going on?

559
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,300
I'll have someone arrange an accommodation for you.

560
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Actually,

561
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,300
I don't know where I should stay.

562
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,300
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

563
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,300
I'm afraid that I'll be left alone.

564
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:18,100
It's not important.

565
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,700
I don't care.

566
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,100
What's important is

567
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,700
in your heart,

568
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:27,700
what identity I'm left with.

569
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,100
I'm already content

570
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,100
with stealing half of your happiness.

571
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,700
But I hope

572
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,700
you can answer me earlier.

573
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,300
What am I to you?

574
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,100
I'm leaving.

575
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,100
I'm leaving.

576
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,700
You're so distracted.

577
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:21,300
You didn't even notice me when I was nearby?

578
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,100
Just say what you want to say.

579
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,700
Xue Chen,

580
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:32,700
I've watched you grow up.

581
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,100
Don't lie to me.

582
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100
You're not normal

583
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,700
to Mu Xuan Ling.

584
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,900
Look at the Snow Tower.

585
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,900
It's so beautiful.

586
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:45,700
It's so beautiful.

587
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,900
Look at the Snow Tower.

588
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,100
It's so quiet and peaceful

589
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,900
in the night.

590
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:52,300
But you know

591
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,500
how many dark waters are under it.

592
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,300
It's your responsibility

593
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,700
to protect the people of Snow Tower.

594
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,100
You'll have to protect the Alliance in the future,

595
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,300
and the Human Clan.

596
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,100
Compared to the responsibility of the City Leader,

597
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
you should know

598
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,300
more clearly than I do.

599
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,900
But in the beginning,

600
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,300
he didn't do anything wrong.

601
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:18,700
He even kept helping me.

602
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,300
Elder,

603
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,500
is there really a conflict

604
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:27,900
between the world and the people?

605
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,100
If it's not Mu Xuan Ling,

606
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,900
but your father,

607
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
your elder,

608
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:34,900
other disciples of Snow Tower,

609
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,900
or the people of the mountain,

610
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,700
when facing the choice,

611
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,100
should I abandon you?

612
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,700
One person,

613
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:46,900
a hundred people,

614
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:47,900
and ten thousand people,

615
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,300
if they are innocent,

616
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
how should I measure the value of life?

617
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,700
The one who sacrifices less

618
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:54,900
and gains more power,

619
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,100
is that really a good thing?

620
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,300
Your heart

621
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,700
is moving.

622
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,500
Yes.

623
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:03,900
I have a problem.

624
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,700
The righteous path

625
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,700
has always been rough and muddled.

626
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,300
The one who sees it will definitely solve the problem.

627
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,900
This is the truth that has been passed down since ancient times.

628
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,100
Is the truth that has been passed down since ancient times

629
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
definitely right?

630
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,500
Elder, please rest assured.

631
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,100
I only have the goods.

632
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:26,900
The responsibility to bear

633
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:28,700
will definitely be borne.

634
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
The moon rises and the sky falls.

635
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:35,500
I have an appointment with Xuan Xin

636
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,500
to guard her together.

637
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,900
I should go now.

638
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,500
You...

639
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,500
Didn't you already leave?

640
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,700
This mortal world is really strange.

641
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,100
I was the one who followed the rules and followed the rules.

642
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,100
Now I am following the rules.

643
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,900
You are also the one who are surprised.

644
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,300
Since you have already returned,

645
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,700
just stay here.

646
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,900
Senior, you just left like that?

647
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,500
You don't even stop me.

648
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,700
You are not even too relieved about me, right?

649
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,300
Or do you think that

650
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I am a useless person

651
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,300
who has lost all my powers?

652
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:13,700
I am still the first time

653
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,300
to pay you this kind of money.

654
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:17,100
It's easy to say.

655
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
I brought it especially for you.

656
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,500
This...

657
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,300
The money you gave me

658
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:24,700
is not even counted as my bribe.

659
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,700
Just treat it as a little tribute to Junior Sister.

660
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,300
Thank you for taking care of me a few days ago.

661
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,500
Take it, Senior.

662
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,700
This...

663
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:39,900
Take it as it is.

664
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,700
I will take it.

665
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,300
But if you cause trouble,

666
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,500
we will still take revenge.

667
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Of course.

668
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,300
Let's go.

669
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,500
Senior, take care.

670
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,700
It would be great if it really lasts for a thousand years.

671
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,700
It's a pity that he is Sang Qi.

672
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,500
How can he take it so easily?

673
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,300
What's wrong with Chun Shang Sword?

674
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,100
How could this be?

675
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:50,500
Could it be that he is here?

676
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,500
Master, did something happen?

677
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,500
Who...

678
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:07,100
Stay here.

679
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,500
I will take care of it.

680
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
I will take care of it.

681
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,100
Don't go anywhere.

682
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Yes.

683
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,500
The sword is shaking in the sword.

684
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,700
The sword is recognizing its owner.

685
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:21,300
Chun Shang Sword has been passed on to me since my mother died.

686
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,700
I don't even recognize my master.

687
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:23,900
Who else can I have?

688
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,500
Sang Qi.

689
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
It's really you.

690
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,700
I still can't forget you.

691
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,300
Chun Shang.

692
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,500
Chun Shang.

693
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,100
Su Ning Zhen.

694
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
Fine.

695
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,700
Let me teach you a lesson

696
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,500
before I make a decision.

697
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,100
I will also teach you a lesson.

698
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,860
Sang Qi.

699
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,660
I'm heading to avenge my sister!

700
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,780
Beging!

701
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,980
To your good!

702
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:45,600
The

703
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,620
Although this is a calm

704
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,100
But I always feel

705
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
Something is going to happen

706
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,100
That's because of the heart of Master Xie

707
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
It's not calm

708
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,100
To make the heart not moving

709
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
It's not easy

710
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Don't worry, Master Xie

711
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:02,100
The south master's formation is unparalleled

712
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
In addition, you are already

713
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,100
On the open formation

714
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
Set up a new formation

715
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,100
Hid from the public

716
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Once there are spiritual groups

717
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
They must have nothing to hide

718
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,100
Kill if you want to kill

719
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Why are you so weak?

720
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
In the world

721
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Are you having fun?

722
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:12,100
You are the one who met the master like this

723
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,100
You are still here

724
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Ten years in the dark

725
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,100
You should know the end of betrayal

726
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,100
When I made the decision

727
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,100
I have already thought about the consequences

728
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,100
You are my most proud disciple

729
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,100
I can give you another chance to choose

730
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
Think about it

731
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Are you going back to the dark with me now?

732
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:53,100
Or after I kill everyone here

733
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,100
You will come back with me

734
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
I will come back to the dark

735
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:11,100
Why is there no news of the spiritual group entering the formation?

736
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,100
I will write the order

737
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Sang Qi

738
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,100
You are Nan Xu Yue, right?

739
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,100
The formation in the city is also set by you

740
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:25,100
Not bad

741
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,100
I can do nothing about you

742
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,100
But I have to leave the Mu Xuan Ling

743
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,100
I'm afraid I can't do anything about you

744
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,100
I'm afraid I can't do anything about you

745
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,100
I'm afraid I can't do anything about you

746
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,100
I'm afraid I can't do anything about you

747
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,100
I'm afraid you can't stop me

748
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,100
Nan Xu Yue

749
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:59,100
What's wrong with you?

750
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:02,100
It will be a little damaged if you turn on the Gui Li formation

751
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,100
But you can't die

752
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,100
Gui Li formation

753
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,100
The Shanzhong World can temporarily trap Sang Qi

754
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,100
But it's not a long-term plan

755
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
The time is tight

756
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,100
I have to set up the formation immediately

757
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,100
And send you away from the Yongxue City

758
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,100
You can't trap Sang Qi

759
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,100
Don't worry about me

760
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:25,100
You have been dead for a long time

761
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,100
He will take you back to the dark

762
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Even if you don't die, you will live a life of death

763
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
I'm used to it

764
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:32,100
This is my fate

765
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,100
It has nothing to do with you

766
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:36,100
I shouldn't drag you down

767
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:43,100
What are you doing?

768
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,100
Let him go

769
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,100
I'll go back to the dark with you

770
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,100
You have been in the mortal world for a long time

771
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:50,100
You haven't learned much

772
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,100
But you are getting worse

773
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,100
You are useless

774
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,100
He is not from the Alliance

775
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
He is not dangerous enough for you

776
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,100
Don't kill him

777
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,100
I'm sorry

778
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,100
I'm sorry

779
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,100

00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:21,100
I'm sorry

797
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:23,100
I'm sorry

798
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:25,100

799
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,100

You and I, that one person, that one dream

No more left face

822
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,100
This life is forever

823
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,100
Accompany you
