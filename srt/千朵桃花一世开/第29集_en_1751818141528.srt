Streamer Master 제품

13
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,740
I have traveled a long way

14
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:44,120
For you, I miss you

15
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,740
What a pity

16
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Frankly speaking

17
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,080
I want to ask for your help

18
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,900
akesane

19
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,640
Who could like me?

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,640
I'm just a slave in your manor.

21
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,640
As long as you nod,

22
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,640
I'll let them open the lock ring.

23
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,640
That's easy to say.

24
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,640
Which slave do you like?

25
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,640
Take it away.

26
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,640
But you came from afar.

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
But you didn't catch my daughter's birthday party.

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,640
I'm really sorry.

29
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,640
You can stay in the manor for a few days.

30
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:24,640
So that I can enter the place.

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,640
You're welcome.

32
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,640
But there are many emergency situations in Yongxue City.

33
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
Father is in a hurry.

34
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
Please forgive him.

35
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,640
Is there any trouble in Yongxue City?

36
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,640
If there is a place where Mingyue Manor can help,

37
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,640
just tell me.

38
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,640
We work together.

39
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,640
We should help each other.

40
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,640
It's just a private matter in Yongxue City.

41
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,640
I don't dare to bother you.

42
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,640
When can you open the lock ring?

43
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Don't worry.

44
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Please wait a moment.

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,640
I'll ask someone to get the key to the lock ring.

46
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Thank you.

47
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I'll wait in the manor.

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
Okay.

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Let Chief Dai check

50
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,640
which Lingnu is Xie Xuechen's favorite.

51
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,640
Yes.

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
If we can let someone like Xie Xuechen open the lock ring,

53
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,640
that Lingnu must have something special.

54
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,640
Then we can change the fate of Ling'er.

55
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
Ling Lv.

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
Ling Lv.

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,640
Ling Lv.

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,640
You know it's the birthday of the First Miss.

59
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,640
You don't know where she is.

60
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,640
It's okay to steal.

61
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,640
How dare you steal?

62
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,640
My brother gave me that.

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,640
I didn't steal it.

64
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,640
First Miss, she stole it.

65
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,640
This is not my clothes.

66
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
It's late.

67
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,640
If you're done with the punishment,

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,640
take her away.

69
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Don't disturb my rest.

70
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,640
First Miss, please leave.

71
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,640
Even if you didn't steal it,

72
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,640
it's someone else's.

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
I'll let you steal.

74
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,640
Good.

75
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,640
How dare you push me.

76
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
I didn't expect that.

77
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,640
You're pretty tough.

78
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
Sun Guan.

79
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,640
What's up?

80
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Master said that the Young Master of Yongxue City

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,640
likes a Lingnu in our village.

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,640
Master asked you to find out who that Lingnu is.

83
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
That young man in the morning,

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
is it Xie Xuechen?

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,640
Then the Lingnu he likes...

86
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
Kill him!

87
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,640
Kill him!

88
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,640
Kill him!

89
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,640
Kill him!

90
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,640
Kill him!

91
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,640
It's Zeng Qi.

92
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
He's here so fast.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,640
Linlin!

94
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Young Master,

95
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
where are you?

96
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,640
If you die, come back and take me away.

97
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,640
Help!

98
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Help!

99
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,640
What happened?

100
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,640
Run!

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,640
He's here!

102
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,640
Young Master!

103
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,640
This is the Miss of the Gao family, right?

104
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
Linlin!

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Linlin!

106
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Linlin!

107
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,640
He's been here.

108
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,640
Your spirit body is heavily damaged.

109
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,640
If you force your way through time and space,

110
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,640
you might be able to escape.

111
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,640
You...

112
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Who else isn't afraid of death?

113
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
Linlin!

114
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Don't be afraid.

115
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,640
It's okay.

116
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,640
I'll take you away.

117
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Thank you for saving my life.

118
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Are you the Young Master of Snowblade City?

119
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,640
Xie Xuechen?

120
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Why are you here?

121
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
Why are you wearing her clothes?

122
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,640
Miss,

123
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,640
the evil army has entered the mountain and slaughtered us.

124
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,640
We can't stay here for long.

125
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,640
Take me to find a slave who is close to you

126
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,640
and change into her clothes.

127
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,640
I'll take her to lure the Golden Tiger Army.

128
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
You and Elder Hua will take Miss away.

129
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,640
When I was young,

130
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
I asked you to die for me.

131
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,640
I owe you.

132
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,640
Today,

133
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,640
I'll return all of it to you.

134
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,640
So the death you said

135
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
was meant to be tonight.

136
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,640
Where is Linlin?

137
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,640
Where did she go?

138
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Elder Song...

139
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
Elder Song took her away.

140
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,640
Where did he go?

141
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,640
I left first.

142
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,640
I don't know where they went.

143
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,640
We can leave the manor from there.

144
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,640
You and I will escape together.

145
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,640
Since you can escape,

146
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,640
you can escape by yourself.

147
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,640
But you must remember,

148
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,640
sacrificing others to protect yourself is not right.

149
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,640
Gao Qiangming,

150
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,640
don't be like that again.

151
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,640
It's dangerous in the manor.

152
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
They must have lured the flying camp in the opposite direction.

153
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Linlin.

154
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,640
I'm coming.

155
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,640
Stop!

156
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:55,640
I'm not Miss Gao.

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Miss Gao, you made a mistake.

158
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,640
Lingwu?

159
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,640
We were fooled by this old man.

160
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,640
This old man pretended to protect her and lured us here.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,640
He's really a loyal man.

162
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,640
Then kill him.

163
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Elder Brother.

164
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,640
Ling'er.

165
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,640
Elder Brother, you finally came to save me.

166
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,640
I told you I would take you away.

167
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,640
Let's go.

168
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,640
How did you get hurt?

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,640
Elder Brother, I'm fine.

170
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,640
Really.

171
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,640
Let's go.

172
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,640
Elder Brother.

173
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,640
Elder Brother.

174
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,640
Elder Brother, are you okay?

175
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,640
I'm fine.

176
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,640
Don't be afraid.

177
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
I'm fine.

178
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Ling'er.

179
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,640
Don't be afraid.

180
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,640
Why is the mark on her face

181
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,640
exactly the same as the hand mark in the chaos?

182
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,640
Is it because...

183
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,640
I'm so tired.

184
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,640
It doesn't hurt.

185
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,640
It doesn't hurt at all.

186
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Elder Brother,

187
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
wherever you go in the future,

188
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,640
I want to be with you.

189
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm here to get a small slave.

190
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,640
It's a golden dragon shield.

191
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
Xie Xuechen.

192
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,640
Give it to me.

193
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,640
What do you mean?

194
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,640
I'm asking for the key to the lock and ring.

195
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,640
Are you still pretending to be a slave?

196
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,640
I was wondering

197
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,640
why you asked me

198
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,640
for a small slave.

199
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,640
Why did you ask me?

200
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,640
I knew you saw her face clearly.

201
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
I just knew

202
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,640
that this is what

203
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,640
you were planning.

204
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,640
My good nephew,

205
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
give it to me.

206
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,640
Ling Di was killed.

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,640
I don't know how long it can last.

208
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,640
We can't fight with Gao Ruxu anymore.

209
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Li Han, wait for me.

210
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
I'll get the key to the lock and ring.

211
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,640
Elder Brother!

212
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
Leave me alone.

213
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,640
I came for you.

214
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,640
Xianzhi,

215
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,640
you're now a slave.

216
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:23,640
I'm afraid you can't even

217
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
take one move from me.

218
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,640
As long as you give it to me,

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,640
I can take it

220
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,640
as a matter of

221
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,640
your cooperation with Sang Qi.

222
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,640
Why did Sang Qi choose to come here today?

223
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,640
I think you should

224
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,640
know more about the situation.

225
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,640
You're a member of the Alliance,

226
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,640
but you're greedy for power.

227
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
A heartless person like you

228
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
doesn't deserve to be killed.

229
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,640
You!

230
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,640
You're a beggar.

231
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,640
You're a beggar!

232
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
Elder Brother!

233
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,640
Elder Brother!

234
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
Elder Brother!

235
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,640
Are you alright?

236
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Elder Brother, are you alright?

237
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,640
Give it to me.

238
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,640
If you give it to me,

239
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,640
I'll spare your life.

240
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,640
Don't be afraid.

241
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,640
Close your eyes.

242
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:37,640
When you open your eyes,

243
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,640
everything will be alright.

244
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:41,640
No!

245
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Elder Brother!

246
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,640
Be good.

247
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,640
Listen to Elder Brother.

248
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,640
I'm obedient.

249
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Elder Brother, I'm obedient.

250
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,640
Elder Brother!

251
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,640
You're a traitor!

252
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,640
You're a traitor!

253
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,640
You want to kill yourself?

254
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,640
Go!

255
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:49,640
Elder Brother!

256
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,640
Elder Brother!

257
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,640
Elder Brother!

258
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,640
Huan Dun Zhu!

259
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,640
Elder Brother!

260
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,640
Elder Brother, you're so cruel.

261
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,640
You're so cruel.

262
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,640
I'm not a traitor.

263
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,640
I'm a traitor.

264
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,640
Elder Brother,

265
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,640
I'm not a traitor.

266
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,640
Elder Brother,

267
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,280
Brother

268
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
Why are you going?

269
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,320
fans

270
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,120
miners

271
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,760
servant

272
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,520
Brother

273
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,040
big brother

274
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,420
Kiss

275
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:43,920
mother

276
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,920
Hurry.

277
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,920
Hurry and open the lock.

278
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:51,920
Sang... Sang Ju.

279
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,920
Sang Ju is coming.

280
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Hurry. Hurry.

281
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,920
Let's leave together.

282
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,920
You said you would take me with you.

283
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
You can't lie to me.

284
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,920
I don't want to be alone.

285
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Sang Ju.

286
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
Sang Ju, don't die.

287
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,920
Sang Ju, don't die.

288
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,920
Sang Ju.

289
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,920
Don't die.

290
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,920
Sang Ju.

291
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,920
Big brother.

292
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,920
Big brother.

293
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,920
Big brother.

294
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Big brother, you're awake.

295
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Big brother.

296
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,920
Big brother.

297
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Big brother.

298
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:17,920
I'm just a little donkey.

299
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:21,920
Except you, I care about me and love me.

300
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
You said you would take me away.

301
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,920
I believed it.

302
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Ling Er.

303
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:31,920
I'm not sad at all when they hit me.

304
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,920
Because I want to be a brother.

305
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,920
You can take me away as soon as you die.

306
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,920
Ling Er, don't care about me.

307
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Go.

308
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,920
This is...

309
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,920
The power of the red light.

310
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I want to be a dream, but I can't.

311
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I have no one to be with me.

312
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
Ling Er.

313
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,920
Don't do this.

314
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,920
Don't lose your power.

315
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,920
Ling Er.

316
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,920
It turns out...

317
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,920
It turns out...

318
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,920
It turns out that you got me out of here.

319
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,920
You died like this.

320
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,920
It's a good deal for you.

321
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
You're so sad.

322
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Why don't you go with her?

323
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
Ling Er.

324
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
I can't.

325
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
How is Mo Tianезде and the others?

326
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Are you saying that you encoding depth is nicer than for you two?

327
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Lin Mo caused Fan소리.

328
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Yet he still keeps a secret.

329
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,920
Fearing that with so muchert else doing the same thing

330
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,920
there.'s no one to show the respect and succeed.

331
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,920
That's why even adjacent with the White tengan

332
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:18,920
can't be as stubborn as the arrows that can kill.

333
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:24,640
He has no

334
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,640
Ling'er, don't trust her. Don't go with her.

335
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,240
Ling'er!

336
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,040
Ling'er!

337
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,040
Don't go!

338
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,640
Ling'er, don't go.

339
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Come back!

340
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,240
Ling'er, don't.

341
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,640
Don't!

342
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,440
Your spirit body can't hold on anymore.

343
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,640
Do you really want to die here?

344
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,640
Ling'er, don't.

345
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,640
Ling'er, don't.

346
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,040
Do you really want to die here?

347
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Ling'er.

348
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
Ling'er.

349
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,640
There's still time. You must leave.

350
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,840
I'll go back to the past.

351
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,840
I just hope that she can be safe and sound.

352
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,240
But in the end,

353
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:35,840
it was the warmth that I gave her that day that made her forget her pain for the rest of her life.

354
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,440
She's even still in death.

355
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,840
Xie Xuechen, ten years ago,

356
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,840
I saw you in the Wheel of Life Mirror.

357
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,240
You knew that I couldn't save her even if I went back to the past.

358
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:57,040
Then why did you deliberately go back and repeat the same thing?

359
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:02,440
Do you know what time is to me?

360
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,840
The beginning is the end.

361
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,640
The beginning is the end.

362
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,440
I can go back and forth in time and space,

363
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,640
but I can only be an observer.

364
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:30,240
I can't make any changes to the past or future.

365
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,840
Similarly, for the God of Death,

366
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:37,440
this is also the essence of fate.

367
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:41,040
All the ending is written before the beginning.

368
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:47,440
All the actions against the heavens are already in the destiny.

369
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,560
What should I do?

370
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,040
I have to cooperate.

371
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:06,040
Ling'er has to cooperate.

372
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,840
Why must I say that the fate is arranged like this?

373
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,040
I also can't see the fate.

374
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,040
But someone told me

375
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,240
I thought that you are that person.

376
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,640
You have the power of the Chaos.

377
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,640
The power of the Chaos can reverse the Yin-Guo.

378
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,440
But I can't even save Ling'er.

379
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,440
You can save her.

380
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,440
The power of the Chaos Bead gave you the remaining power.

381
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,240
That's why she can't be awakened.

382
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,440
As long as you can be strong,

383
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,840
you can be reborn.

384
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
But if you can't be strong,

385
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
the power of the Chaos will return to her body.

386
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,840
But if that's the case,

387
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,440
you will be completely dead.

388
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,640
You will be dead.

389
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,240
In my opinion,

390
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,840
it's not being reborn,

391
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,040
but being reborn.

392
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,240
I just need to destroy the God's Cauldron.

393
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Then I can save her.

394
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,840
Did you hear it clearly?

395
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
I heard it clearly.

396
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:19,040
I heard it clearly.

397
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:21,240
But I just

398
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,640
returned the thing that belongs to her to her.

399
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,040
Those who can walk past the God's Cauldron are all people.

400
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,040
After I die,

401
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,640
the power of the Chaos will return to Ling'er.

402
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Then where will my God's Cauldron go?

403
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:52,640
A common man's God's Cauldron will naturally disappear from the world.

404
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,840
But your God's Cauldron has a ten thousand years of life.

405
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,440
Maybe it has another source.

406
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,840
So I have a time to stay in the world.

407
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,840
You are just a small piece of the human world that I have left.

408
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:11,040
Could it be that my God's Cauldron has something to do with Duoshen?

409
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:15,240
If the Ten Thousand Years of Decade is Ziresi's old quarry,

410
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,640
if person has Mayreg'加強,

411
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,640
what harm will that do to the Ancient Teahouse?

412
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,840
I won't believe it.

413
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,240
Feng에요!

414
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,440
That has no use.

415
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,040
In the year before, the Elderly is still sick from over paradise.

416
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,040
We are lucky, she can hide.

417
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
I'll return all of this to you.

418
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
I've waited for you.

419
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,040
I told you,

420
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:40,040
you will return.

421
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
The Snowblade Master

422
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
The Snowblade Master

423
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,040
It's always been you.

424
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:34,040
You are my big brother.

425
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Since you gave me your life,

426
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:46,040
then I will keep the world you love for you.

427
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,040
If one day,

428
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
I accidentally die,

429
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,040
I can go find you.

430
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,040
By then,

431
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,040
don't blame me.

432
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,040
Thank you, Xue Zhen.

433
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:13,040
Thank you, Xue Zhen.

434
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,040
Please leave me alone.

435
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
You're finally back.

436
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,040
Thank you, Xue Zhen.

437
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,040
The Snowblade Master

438
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:53,040
The Snowblade Master

439
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,040
How dare you show up?

440
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,040
The Snowblade Master has died and you are reborn.

441
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,040
That's his fate.

442
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,040
Don't use fate as an excuse.

443
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:07,040
If you didn't do what you wanted,

444
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,040
and kill him,

445
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,040
how could he risk his life?

446
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:15,040
This should be the end of everything.

447
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
I want to avenge the Snowblade Master.

448
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
I don't have time for this.

449
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,040
You suffered from the Death Fragment of the Immortality Formation.

450
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:31,040
You are already a loser.

451
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,040
You just regained your power of the Chaos.

452
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,040
You can't be more brave.

453
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,040
This power of the Chaos

454
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,040
should have been lost to me.

455
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,040
But at this moment,

456
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:44,040
you have no chance.

457
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,040
You are not Nan Xun.

458
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Who are you?

459
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:54,040
It seems that the power of the Chaos

460
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,040
still hasn't been found.

461
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:02,040
It's okay if you forget me.

462
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Then let's get to know each other again.

463
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:19,040
I have no choice.

464
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
I have no choice.

465
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,040
The sky is clear.

466
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,040
You have been in the cold place for a long time.

467
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,040
I will take you home.

468
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
Why did you bring me here?

469
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,040
Sit down.

470
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,040
Pardon me.

471
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:00,040
We are synchronized in agrunting l Ambience.

472
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,040
We live in chaos.

473
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
For tens of thousands of years,

474
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:17,040
we lived our own life

475
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,600
It's really ridiculous

476
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,560
I don't remember

477
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,160
what you said

478
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:28,800
I only remember

479
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,000
you killed Xie Xuechen

480
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,200
It doesn't matter

481
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,120
Heaven's will can't be changed

482
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,600
No matter what the process is

483
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,160
the result is the same

484
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:56,120
Others and you and me

485
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,600
are just for a moment

486
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,640
Only you and me are the same

487
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,480
forever

488
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,720
I'm just Mu Xuanling

489
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,320
I never believe in fate

490
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,000
Sometimes it's a long time

491
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,880
Sometimes it's a long time

492
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,520
It's just a moment

493
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,880
What matters is who you're with

494
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
I never like eternity

495
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,880
and I will never be with you

496
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,960
I heard that in this world

497
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,520
as long as two people get married

498
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,560
it's a promise to stay together forever

499
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,760
Today

500
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,600
is the day we reunite

501
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,840
and the food given by God

502
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,880
It's not good to get married today

503
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,040
I don't want to

504
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
I want to do whatever I want

505
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,760
but Xie Xuechen alone

506
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,360
can only

507
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,520
live or die

508
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,800
The marriage

509
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,400
doesn't matter to you

510
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,680
but

511
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,840
it must

512
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,200
There are setting sun and sunset on both shores

513
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,920
the fire of fire is so strong

514
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,440
Looks like time

515
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,880
has it got into trouble again

516
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,200
It's been so many years

517
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:13,400
I have never seen such a annkle world

518
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,240
But Xu Feng hasn't

519
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,840
But the blood space is still sealed.

520
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,440
The eight thousand formation has been rebuilt.

521
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,240
Could it be that the dark clan still has the source of the Net?

522
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:33,560
This kind of Taotian Demon Qi is not an ordinary Dark Clan.

523
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,760
I'm afraid its power of power is also Sang Qi.

524
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,360
Impossible.

525
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,280
I've been to the dark prison many times.

526
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,280
I've never seen anyone stronger than Sang Qi.

527
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Kill!

528
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Who are you?

529
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,640
Xie Xue Chen?

530
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Now all the sects are in fear.

531
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,840
The dark prison is in danger.

532
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
The other sects should be more united.

533
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,840
Everyone, gather the elite disciples quickly.

534
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:26,240
Go to the Mount Liujie with me to investigate.

535
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,240
Yes.

536
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,040
A'Bao.

537
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:43,240
Are you going with them?

538
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
Yes.

539
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,240
You stay in Yongxue City and wait for me to come back.

540
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Then...

541
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
Then you...

542
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:03,240
Be careful.

543
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
I...

544
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,240
I'm helping my mother.

545
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,240
She is still waiting to see you.

546
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Okay.

547
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,240
How dare you come to our dark prison?

548
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Okay.

549
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,240
Then let's fight today.

550
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:31,240
I'll let you come in and out of the prison.

551
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,240
How do you know how to use the magic?

552
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Let's trap her with the dark prison.

553
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Tang Bi, take the car.

554
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
Are you afraid?

555
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:15,240
A warrior's destiny is either to win or die in battle.

556
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,240
You should die in the battle.

557
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
Who are you?

558
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:25,240
I'm Zhao Min.

559
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,240
You are the God of Duos who is suppressed under the lava.

560
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,240
You're still alive?

561
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:34,240
I don't want to hear the word God of Duos again.

562
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,240
Next time, kill me.

563
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:44,240
The rules of the dark prison should be changed.

564
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,240
From now on, you are no longer a weak and strong man.

565
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:53,240
You are the only one who can live.

566
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:57,240
The winner is the god of death.

567
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,240
The loser will be killed.

568
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Congratulations.

569
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,240
The dark prison is destroyed.

570
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,240
The old man is dead.

571
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
It's time to save him.

572
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Master, Miss Mu doesn't want to change her clothes.

573
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,240
We've tried to persuade her for a long time.

574
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,240
It's okay. You can leave.

575
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
Yes.

576
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,240
You're crazy.

577
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,240
I'm sober.

578
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
I know you don't want to wear a wedding dress.

579
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,240
Because you want to mourn for Xie Xue Chen.

580
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
I won't force you.

581
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,240
You are black and white.

582
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
I'm also black and white.

583
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,240
I will also be very compatible.

584
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,240
You are the God of Heaven.

585
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:29,240
How can you believe in the marriage of a mortal man and woman?

586
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,240
I don't believe it.

587
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
But I know

588
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,240
you always want to have such a marriage with Xie Xue Chen.

589
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,240
You want to make a common knot with her.

590
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:45,240
You want to use the heaven and earth as evidence.

591
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,240
You want to die without a word.

592
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I can give you what Xie Xue Chen can give you.

593
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,240
I don't want to love you.

594
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,240
I just want to accompany you.

595
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,240
It's a long road.

596
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:11,240
As long as we can go on together.

597
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,240
I will never forget you.

598
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:09,240
I will never forget you.

599
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,240
I will never forget you.

600
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
I will never forget you.

601
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I will never forget you.

602
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,240
I will never forget you.

603
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
I will never forget you.

604
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,240
I will never forget you.

605
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:23,240
I will never forget you.

606
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:25,240
I will never forget you.

607
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:27,240
I will never forget you.

608
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,240
I will never forget you.

609
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,240
I will never forget you.

610
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,240
I will never forget you.

611
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
I will never forget you.

612
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,240
I will never forget you.

613
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,240
I will never forget you.

614
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,240
I will never forget you.

615
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,240
I will never forget you.

616
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
I will never forget you.

617
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,240
I will never forget you.

618
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:49,240
I will never forget you.

619
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,240
I will never forget you.

620
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:53,240
I will never forget you.

621
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,240
I will never forget you.

622
00:44:55,240 --> 00:44:57,240
I will never forget you.

623
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
I will never forget you.

624
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
I will never forget you.

625
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
The future is dark and windy.

626
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,240
I will never forget

627
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,240
the time we spent together.

628
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
I will never forget the day

629
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
we spent together

630
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
in the peach blossom garden.

631
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,240
I look at you

632
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,240
and dream about you.

633
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,240
I have no regrets.

634
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
I will never forget you.

635
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:23,240
I will never forget you.

00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,240
I will never forget you.
