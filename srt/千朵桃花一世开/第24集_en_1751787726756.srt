7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Thank you.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xie Ya Chen.

9
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Are you okay?

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why am I here?

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You don't remember?

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Am I being possessed by the Dark Clan again?

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Have you thought it over?

14
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
As long as you tell me where the Chaos Bead is,

15
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I will open the Immortal Formation for you.

16
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Let the place of the evil become the Jiao Tu,

17
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
to hide your hatred for years.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's a simple deal.

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Isn't it?

20
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Who are you?

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Why can you open the Immortal Formation?

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The Immortal Formation is the source of the Chaos.

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
For many years, the power has been absent.

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
As long as you make the right move in the right place,

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
you can break it.

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When the Alliance established the Immortal Formation,

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I was lucky enough to see it.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
So I know where the source of the evil is.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Six thousand years ago?

30
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
No, you are not even six thousand years old.

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But these things have nothing to do with me.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
The Chaos Bead has been destroyed.

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's destroyed by Gao Feng Xu.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The Chaos Bead is a sacred thing.

35
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It can't be destroyed.

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
We don't have much time.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
So we don't have to waste it on these nonsense.

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Believe it or not, it's up to you.

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Okay.

40
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Star Valley of the Mirror Flower Palace

41
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
has five people left in the last palace.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
You all know where the Chaos Bead is, right?

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
It's okay if you don't tell me.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You are not my only choice.

45
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Enough.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I should go and make my plan.

47
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Sang Qi,

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
we are allies after all.

49
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think I will miss you after you die.

50
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Who is this He Xian Wu?

51
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why does he know how to open the Star Formation?

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
When Feng Xiang and Qian Huang built the Star Formation,

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
he was on the side of it.

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
So he lost the steps and the power of the Formation.

55
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
How is that possible?

56
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It was six thousand years ago when he built the Star Formation.

57
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Break!

58
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Nothing in this world is impossible.

59
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The Star Formation is broken.

60
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I need to save it.

61
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
If the Star Formation is really opened,

62
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
can the Alliance handle it?

63
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The Star Formation and the Mystic Heaven Gate

64
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
are badly damaged in the previous battles.

65
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Now the whole dragon is out of hands.

66
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
It's impossible to deal with it.

67
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I heard that there are more than five thousand people

68
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
in the inner palace of the Bixiao Palace.

69
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
There are more than ten thousand people in the outer palace.

70
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I think they can fight.

71
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Bixiao Palace?

72
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
They only care about themselves.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
This time, the Great Emperor will not fight with the enemy.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
How can we expect it?

75
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
The neighboring island itself is the enemy.

76
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
In this way,

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
the only one who can back up is only Yongxue City.

78
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Facing the attack of the Dark Clan and the Spirit Clan,

79
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
even if it's Yongxue City,

80
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
it will still be the end of the wall in the end.

81
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
In this battle, the Alliance is very fierce.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Why is there a fairy here?

83
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm doing what I planned.

84
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This time, the Wanxian Fortress is not broken.

85
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The four-legged barrier has been opened.

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If the practice continues to be repeated,

87
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the Dark Clan will discover it.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They will definitely pay no attention to the price

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
and go out of the city.

90
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
With the power of the two of us,

91
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm afraid it's hard to stop the wave.

92
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I went into the dark domain.

93
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Even if I can't stop Sang Qi,

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I can still fight for the repair barrier.

95
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You've already betrayed the dark domain.

96
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
They won't stay with you.

97
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
For so many years,

98
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sang Qi never really wanted to kill me.

99
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
After the Su Ning Xie incident,

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I know that he is not a heartless person.

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Xie Xue Chen,

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll be with you in this world.

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Will you believe me?

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Be careful.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I'll go find you if I'm not late.

106
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Master!

107
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Master!

108
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Fortunately, I broke the barrier

109
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:30,840
and the dark clan's

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Wu Xin Shui

111
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
is finally over.

112
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You're just like me.

113
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Like a moth flying in the fire,

114
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
you gave your heart to the human clan.

115
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
But you

116
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
are luckier than me.

117
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You're different from me.

118
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Tell me,

119
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
why did you come back?

120
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Aren't you afraid that I'll kill you?

121
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,920
Your past

122
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,500
dismissed all the standing for your actions.

123
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,000
It's when you night out in such a peaceful place

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
that you're unable to charge

125
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
your men.

126
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:24,880
You are actor with yes

127
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,260
Can you please help me?

128
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,460
I also want to help you.

129
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,060
Mr. 허ués.

130
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,580
I'm home.

131
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,900
Have my very first meal.

132
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,180
Idiot.

133
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,660
Yi Lan.

134
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,460
What's wrong with you?

135
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,940
I will keep you informed.

136
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,940
I...

137
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,940
But Master, you can't go back.

138
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,940
Master.

139
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
Master.

140
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:37,940
Master.

141
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
Master.

142
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,940
I've been a chess player for my whole life.

143
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,940
I'm about to reach the end.

144
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,940
But you still have a choice.

145
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
Master,

146
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,940
I wish the road ahead of you is a good one.

147
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:02,940
Master.

148
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Master.

149
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Master.

150
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
Master.

151
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
Master.

152
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,940
Master.

153
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
Master.

154
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Where's your ear?

155
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,940
Master.

156
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
Who are you?

157
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
What do you want?

158
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
What do I want?

159
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,940
We met in the forest.

160
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,940
You caught me.

161
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
You forgot?

162
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
I'm Su Nianxi, a disciple of Jinghua Palace.

163
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
You caught me

164
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
just to help you heal.

165
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm Ling Zou.

166
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,940
Why did you kill me?

167
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,940
I'm Tong Feng Bao Xin.

168
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,940
Why should I kill you?

169
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
You're so strange.

170
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,940
Your wound is bleeding.

171
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,940
Let me help you.

172
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
You're too badly injured.

173
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,940
I've been working hard today.

174
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,940
I need to rest a little bit before I can recover.

175
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,940
Master.

176
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:26,940
You're asleep.

177
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,940
I didn't expect you to save this rabbit

178
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,940
just to eat it.

179
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:55,940
It smells so good.

180
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
The rabbit is so cute.

181
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,940
It's really delicious.

182
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
Don't you think it's cruel?

183
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
But I have to live.

184
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,940
You can eat other food

185
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
just to live.

186
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,940
What if I eat you

187
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
just to live?

188
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,940
Then you'd better do it faster.

189
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:17,940
I'm afraid it hurts.

190
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
What else?

191
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
What else?

192
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,940
I think it's more delicious.

193
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
I suspect you're not a human.

194
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,940
I also suspect you're not a wolf.

195
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
If I eat you,

196
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:40,940
aren't you afraid?

197
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
Don't you hate me?

198
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,940
You just want to live.

199
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
No.

200
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,940
I'm a half-monster in the spirit tribe.

201
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
I was born with a sin.

202
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
I'm evil.

203
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
I'm evil.

204
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
I'm cruel.

205
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,940
I'm cold-blooded.

206
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
Under the heaven,

207
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:14,940
there's no difference

208
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,940
between the different tribes.

209
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:17,940
I tell you.

210
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,940
In order to grow,

211
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
the grass will break the rock and soil.

212
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,940
In order to grow,

213
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,940
the rabbit must eat grass.

214
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:25,940
The beast eats meat.

215
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,940
The human eats the beast.

216
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,940
However,

217
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
even the strongest life in the world

218
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,940
is interesting.

219
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,940
It's full of the ground

220
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,940
and becomes the food for grass to grow.

221
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,940
There's a meaning in being born.

222
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
The heaven is not good or evil.

223
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,940
It's not strong or weak.

224
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,940
The earth is not good or evil.

225
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:44,940
It's not good or weak.

226
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:45,940
The earth is not good or weak.

227
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,940
It's not good or weak.

228
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,940
The existence of a half-monster

229
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
is the meaning of the heaven.

230
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:52,940
The lightness of life

231
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,940
is not the way of heaven.

232
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,940
It's the way of the secular world.

233
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
In order for us to live,

234
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:01,940
we also need to eat

235
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:02,940
a lot of life.

236
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,940
The rabbit I ate

237
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,940
is the same as the me you ate.

238
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,940
But I will respect

239
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
every life I ate.

240
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,940
No matter how bad it is,

241
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:12,940
it can't be wasted.

242
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:13,940
You can't let go

243
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:14,940
of every life's effort.

244
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,940
So,

245
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,940
although I'm afraid of being eaten by you,

246
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,940
I won't hate you.

247
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,940
Maybe

248
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,940
this is the meaning of me meeting you.

249
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:34,940
Sang Qi,

250
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,940
I'm really happy to meet you.

251
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:39,940
You may not know that

252
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,940
you are actually very gentle.

253
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
I'm really sorry.

254
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,200
time has turned back

255
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,340
to a Xunkgai

256
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,180
a bomb

257
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,940
the probability of diamonds

258
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,700
the chance to lean on

259
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,580
the chance to touch

260
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,800
the opportunity of dragons

261
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,540
disaster

262
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,640
厲害

263
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,880
makes us

264
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,260
take risks

265
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
true

266
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,640
Ming's dispatch

267
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,500
here is the place

268
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:42,500
We once left here together.

269
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,500
All these years have passed.

270
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
It's still beautiful.

271
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,500
Right?

272
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:13,500
This sword is the sword we love each other.

273
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,500
It's also the sword we misunderstand.

274
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Those joys, sorrows, pain, and hatred.

275
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:38,500
I should let go of it today.

276
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:43,500
I know you don't like killing.

277
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:48,500
But I'm not a good person.

278
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,500
I just want to be with you.

279
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,500
I just want to be with you.

280
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,500
I just want to be with you.

281
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I just want to be with you.

282
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,500
I just want to be with you.

283
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,500
I'm not a good person.

284
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,500
I know I'm not a good person.

285
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:24,500
I've made a lot of mistakes these years.

286
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,500
But I'm still asking for your forgiveness.

287
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:35,500
It's all my fault.

288
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
If I could have believed it,

289
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,500
we wouldn't have separated.

290
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,500
You wouldn't have suffered so much.

291
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,500
I'm sorry.

293
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm sorry.

294
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,500
I'm sorry.

295
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:15,500
I'm sorry.

296
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm sorry.

297
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I'm sorry.

298
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm sorry.

299
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,500
I'm sorry.

300
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,500
There's no need to really ask.

301
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,500
There's a reason.

302
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:40,500
To release the anti-der全題風雪穿越兩年不負於間

303
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,500
To escape for the night climate, the day I harmony with you.

304
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,500
A dream can't be than when you and I were together.

305
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,500
There's no right or wrong in this life.

306
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,500
I'm willing to be by your side

307
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,700
Fang Qi

308
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm willing to be by your side

309
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
Love is like a snowstorm,

310
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
passing through the six years,

311
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
never giving up.

312
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
I hope that the peach blossoms will bloom

313
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:37,700
to accompany you that day.

314
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
I look at that person in the mirror,

315
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,700
and dream of him,

316
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,700
but I have no feelings for him.

317
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,700
There is no fate in this life,

318
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,700
I'm willing to be by your side

319
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,700
Sang Qi

320
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I like you the most

321
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Master

322
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,700
Master

323
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
We half-demons were born to be despised

324
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:34,700
No birth, no life

325
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I was abandoned under the mulberry tree in Qi Lu

326
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,700
So my name is Sang Qi

327
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,700
You are the Xuan Ling Hua, the one who is always in the phoenix mode

328
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,700
so call yourself the Mother Xuan Ling

329
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Today I accept you as my disciple

330
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:57,700
From now on, the dark jade is where you belong

331
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,700
Ling Er

332
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,700
Ten years ago in the Ming Yue Villa

333
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,700
The reason I noticed you

334
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:10,700
was because of what I saw in you

335
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,700
I saw myself

336
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
If Ning Xi and I have a child,

337
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
it should be like you

338
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Now is not the time to be sad

339
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,700
There is something important to do

340
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,700
Master Xie

341
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
The dark jade has been sent by the Cang

342
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
and dared to come to cure us

343
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
The magic array is about to be broken

344
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
to the point where it can't be repaired

345
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
The dark clan is still alive

346
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
If they rush out of the magic array

347
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
they will be killed

348
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Now we can only block the void sea

349
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,700
to stop the dark clan from recovering

350
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,700
It's not easy to seal the void sea

351
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,700
It's not easy

352
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:08,700
We need to use a lot of power to have a chance

353
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,700
If you want to use my power, you can do it

354
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:15,700
Please continue to control the barrier with the dark curse

355
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
I will go to the dark jade

356
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
to seal the void sea

357
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,700
Master, be careful

358
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
The dark clan has entered the city

359
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,700
Kill all the slaves

360
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,700
Don't spare any living thing

361
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,700
The princess said to lock them in the dungeon

362
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,700
and watch them closely

363
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
If they collude with the dark clan

364
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,700
we will all die

365
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,700
Go

366
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,700
Who?

367
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,700
Who are you?

368
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,700
You are free

369
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,700
I'm leaving

370
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,700
But

371
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,700
the freedom you want

372
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,700
will never disappear

373
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
I need your help

374
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
The soldiers of the dark clan I brought

375
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,700
have rushed into the city

376
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,700
As long as you are willing to join hands with me

377
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
we can cooperate with each other

378
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,700
and destroy the Bixiao Palace

379
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,700
Xuan Lian

380
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,700
Are you okay?

381
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,700
I'm fine

382
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,700
It seems that we have the same intention

383
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,700
to come here

384
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
If I didn't come here

385
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
are you going to ignore yourself

386
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
and use all your power to seal the void sea?

387
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,700
Now the Dark Formation is about to break

388
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,700
Only in this way can we stop the Dark Clan

389
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,700
Maybe there is a better way

390
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,700
I'm not dead

391
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
But he left the spiritual pill to me

392
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
His spiritual pill

393
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
has gathered thousands of demonic weapons of the void sea

394
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,700
and has the support of the Jade Pillar Palace

395
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,700
Maybe

396
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,700
we can temporarily seal the void sea

397
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,700
If we use the Jade Pillar Palace to purify the spirit pill

398
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:21,700
and turn the demonic weapon into a spirit

399
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,700
we can seal the void sea

400
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,700
The Immortal Formation is damaged

401
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,700
It's a good opportunity

402
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,700
We should first defeat the Human Clan

403
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,700
and then fight for the position of the leader

404
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
The Dark Clan's leader, listen to my order

405
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,700
Let's go

406
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:35,700
It seems that the Dark Clan

407
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,700
has discovered the damage of the Immortal Formation

408
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,700
I'm afraid the barrier won't last long

409
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,700
Let's start

410
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,700
The Immortal Formation is destroyed

411
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,700
Destroy the Alliance

412
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,700
and take the human's sword

413
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,700
Calm your mind, purify your mind

414
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,700
and hold on to the barrier

415
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
The Immortal Formation is destroyed

416
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,700
The Immortal Formation is destroyed

417
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,700
The barrier is broken

418
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,700
The system is broken

419
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,700
The barrier is broken

420
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,700
The system is broken

421
00:28:58,700 --> 00:28:59,700
The barrier is broken

422
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,700
You are here

423
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,700
You come here and go

424
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:13,700
Why do you come here?

425
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,700
I have been married for so many years

426
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
but I have not received any benefits

427
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,700
I'm still tortured every day

428
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,700
If anything happens to you

429
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,700
I will lose much

430
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,100
As for me

431
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,620
A fine of one or two times or more

432
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:28,140
is not to be counted

433
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,740
Some steps do not count

434
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,420
watch out

435
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:48,740
If I knew it

436
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,220
I would not be involved in business

437
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,700
You should practice more

438
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,380
But it's just a deal

439
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,380
Why are you so serious?

440
00:29:57,380 --> 00:30:01,380
If it's not just a deal

441
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,380
Silly

442
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,100
Mom

443
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:19,700
Mom

444
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,180
Sheng'er, watch out

445
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,060
The next generation of the Lin family

446
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,500
will be in trouble

447
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,100
for sure

448
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,620
I'll go to the new generation

449
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:30,580
and ask what happened

450
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:32,580
It's a pity you don't have the chance

451
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,900
Jiang Li?

452
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,700
What's the meaning of

453
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,700
the Xiu Xiange collusion with the Dark Clan

454
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
and murdering the same kind of people?

455
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,700
Fu Yuan, stop

456
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,700
The Alliance established the Sword Spirit Division

457
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,700
Why didn't you report to me

458
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,700
when you tried to kill the Lin family?

459
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,700
The Xiu Xiange

460
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,700
is just correcting the mistakes of this world

461
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,700
And you are all

462
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,700
the victims of the wrong

463
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,700
The Sword Spirit Division

464
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
destroyed the limited power of the Sword Spirit Tribe

465
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,700
and destroyed the power of the Sword Spirit Tribe

466
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,700
The Sword Spirit Division

467
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,700
was established to limit the Lin family

468
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,700
who harmed the people

469
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,700
The

470
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,700
mastermind of the Bixia Palace

471
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,700
has been in charge of the Sword Spirit Division for generations

472
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,700
It's the least possible to restrict

473
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,700
the Lin family's freedom

474
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,700
But it has also maintained the peace and safety

475
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,700
of the people and the Lin family for so many years

476
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,700
Isn't it a good thing?

477
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Good thing?

478
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,700
It seems that Elder Duan

479
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,700
doesn't think what he did was wrong

480
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Then I'd like to ask

481
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:49,660
The

482
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,660
four-leaf clover

483
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:53,660
is it because

484
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:55,660
the human race is born

485
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,660
to be more noble than the Lin family?

486
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,660
The Bixia Palace is like this

487
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
The Sword Spirit Palace is like this

488
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,660
The Alliance is always like this

489
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,660
The surface is bright and bright

490
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,660
but the inner power is already rotten

491
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,660
If it is not completely destroyed

492
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,660
what will the Lin family say in the future?

493
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,660
Jiang Li

494
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,660
We can talk

495
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,660
I don't want to kill you

496
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,660
Move

497
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,660
Shang'er

498
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,660
Brother

499
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,660
Shang'er, get up

500
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,660
Mom

501
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,660
Come to my house

502
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
Bad guy, you are not my dad

503
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,660
My dad is in the bathroom

504
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
It's the most expensive classroom in the world

505
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
My mom said your dad is a bad guy

506
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
But

507
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,660
he is not like you

508
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,660
You

509
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,660
You are Cang Li

510
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Dad, you know Fu Cang Li

511
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Who is he?

512
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,660
He

513
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
What?

514
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,660
You don't dare to say

515
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,660
Then I'll help you

516
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,660
The young master of the Bixia Palace

517
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,660
The brother of Zhou Yuan Ting

518
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,660
My father Fu Cheng Zhou

519
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,660
How did he die?

520
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,660
If it wasn't for the Bixia Palace

521
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,660
You killed your brother and took the throne

522
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:23,660
My mother

523
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,660
took me to change my name

524
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,660
Yan Pei Liuli

525
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:29,660
How could there be today's Jiang Li?

526
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,660
Dad

527
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,660
What he said

528
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
is not true

529
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,660
Right?

530
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,660
This is the truth

531
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Right?

532
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
Princess Fu

533
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,660
No

534
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,660
The one who took the throne

535
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,660
was Fu Cheng Zhou

536
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,660
not Fu Yuan Ting

537
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,660
You, you actually know

538
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,660
I knew it

539
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,660
But you didn't want people to know

540
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,660
So I pretended not to know

541
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Mom

542
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,660
What happened?

543
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,660
What are you hiding?

544
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,660
Madam

545
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Now we know

546
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:21,660
What else can we hide?

547
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,660
Maybe you were wrong at the beginning

548
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,660
He should know the truth

549
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,660
That year

550
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,660
the Bixia Palace was about to be destroyed

551
00:34:31,660 --> 00:34:33,660
The one who developed the new hair dryer

552
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,660
and held the whole palace

553
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
was him

554
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,660
He married my family

555
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,660
and saved the Bixia Palace

556
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:43,660
So your grandfather

557
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
appointed him as the heir

558
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,660
Your father was angry

559
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,660
and wanted to take the throne

560
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,660
and was killed by your grandfather

561
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,660
This fool

562
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,660
in order to keep

563
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,660
your grandfather and father's reputation

564
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:59,660
he hid the truth

565
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,660
He was willing to be criticized

566
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,660
and misunderstood

567
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:05,660
Is it worth it?

568
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,660
When it happened

569
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,660
you were still young

570
00:35:11,660 --> 00:35:13,660
Your mother didn't know the truth

571
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,660
She just took you out at night

572
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,660
but never heard from you

573
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,660
But Cang Li

574
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:21,660
Do you know why

575
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,660
your name is not on the family register of the Fu family?

576
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,660
That's because your uncle

577
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,660
wanted to protect you

578
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,660
He wanted to make you

579
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,660
free from the use of enemies

580
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,660
He was so confused

581
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,660
that he took everything away

582
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,660
But all these years

583
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
he has been waiting for you

584
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,660
to come home

585
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,660
Do you understand?

586
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:45,660
Fu Yuan Ting is your uncle

587
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,660
not your enemy

588
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Do you understand?

589
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,660
What's the meaning

590
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
of telling me all these?

591
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,660
I tell you

592
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,660
what I'm doing now

593
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,660
is not because of the family hatred

594
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,660
but because of the alliance

595
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,660
You can't hurt them

596
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,660
You can't hurt them

597
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,660
I'm not the one who did it

598
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,660
I'm the one who did it

599
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,660
I'm the one who did it

600
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:17,660
I'm the one who did it

601
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,660
Yan Sen

602
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,660
If you don't change

603
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,660
you wouldn't set up the Milky Way

604
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,660
You feel bad

605
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,200
about Want Your Majesties

606
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,660
Su Ye

607
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,660
It's all over

608
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,660
Episode 15

609
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,060
Father, mother,

610
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,260
A'Dou, run!

611
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,660
What's going on?

612
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,260
Someone opened the secret passage

613
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,540
and destroyed the formation.

614
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:04,980
How can we escape?

615
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,220
Once the formation is opened,

616
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,860
no one can escape.

617
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,060
Jiang Li is still inside.

618
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,580
She helped us so much.

619
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:12,780
We can't take it

620
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
if we report it to the enemy.

621
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,540
Jiang Li is a human.

622
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,660
She won't take the benefit of the spiritual clan.

623
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,140
She will betray us sooner or later.

624
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,020
We'd better get rid of her soon.

625
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,260
Let her and the people of Bixiao Palace

626
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,780
die together.

627
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,100
The heart of the human is still in my hand.

628
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,460
I can't bear it.

629
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:42,820
They can't hold on for long.

630
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:44,260
The most vulnerable part of the formation is here.

631
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
We'll kill her together.

632
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:46,940
Good.

633
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,740
When we break out of the barrier,

634
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,740
we can kill them with the Black Heaven Gate.

635
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:56,700
Senior.

636
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,140
The barrier of the Immortal's Formation is almost destroyed.

637
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,020
If we rely on the salt barrier,

638
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:02,300
the spiritual power will be exhausted.

639
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,580
Once the salt barrier is broken,

640
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,340
we can't stop the Dark Clan anymore.

641
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,900
Don't think about failure.

642
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,820
Wait until the last moment.

643
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:09,540
Yes.

644
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,940
The barrier is broken.

645
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:18,660
Kill them!

646
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,300
Aim!

647
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,220
Run!

648
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,620
Run!

649
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,340
Goodbye.

650
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,620
I wonder if there are any dark clans

651
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,820
escaping from the two mountains.

652
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,300
Xuan Xin and the others are still in Wanxian Town.

653
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,820
Let's go meet them.

654
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,020
What's wrong?

655
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:42,620
Something is wrong with the dark clouds.

656
00:39:46,100 --> 00:40:10,900
Copycat

657
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,820
Nice board, huh?

658
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,620
As my only 600 units I took it.

659
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:20,340
So you three,

660
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:22,960
The power of giving up is shared based on death,

661
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:31,420
Amidst the Staff

662
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:35,040
umes all are helpless.

663
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:38,580
The people and people above

664
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,620
Were defeated by someone,

665
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,960
And the power is still shared,

666
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,960
Brother.

667
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:50,960
Is it you?

668
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,760
Big brother.

669
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,960
No.

670
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,760
You are not big brother.

671
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
Who are you?

672
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,760
You forgot me.

673
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,960
But you fell in love with me.

674
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,960
The world is always so clever.

675
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
The night is burning.

676
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:20,760
What do you mean?

677
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,760
When I found you,

678
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,960
you should have lost all your power to fill the sky.

679
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,360
You can't even turn into a human.

680
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,160
Day after day.

681
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
I used my power to raise you.

682
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,960
You used my power to restore your power.

683
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,360
But you betrayed me at the critical moment.

684
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,160
You sent me here.

685
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm willing to stay by your side.

686
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,160
The flowers are in full bloom.

687
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,160
The day I spend with you.

688
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,160
I look at the bright and bright dream.

689
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,560
I have no more yearning.

690
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:03,160
I have no more wishes.

691
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I'm willing to stay by your side.
