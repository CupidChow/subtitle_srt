5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I've been raising you with my blood and spirit for a day.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You used my power to restore it,

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
but at a critical moment, you betrayed me

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and sent me here.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
It seems that you have forgotten everything.

11
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Chu, why are you here?

12
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The Emperor Zhao Ming is arrogant and greedy.

13
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
He is guilty.

14
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Now, by the will of God,

15
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
he will put you in the abyss of glory and will never let you out.

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
When I left,

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
you said you would wait for me at home.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why are you here now?

19
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am Shanggu's magical weapon, the Soul-gathering Bead.

20
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's the most powerful and powerful bead in the world.

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
How could you hide it in your home?

22
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Didn't you say you like me and want to marry me?

23
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Are you willing to be with me for a thousand years?

24
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's just the pride of being a woman.

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I want to return what you have.

26
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I was born in chaos and had no end.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
A thousand years is just a short time for me.

28
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I have been through a lot of hardships.

29
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
But now,

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
you are thinking about who God is.

31
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You are arrogant and arrogant.

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I can't let you go like this.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You are not Zhu.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Who are you?

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You are a mortal.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You are greedy and greedy.

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You still want to marry me.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
If I am not Zhu,

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
is there another Soul-gathering Bead in the world?

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The ladder is the bridge between the human world and the human world.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Now the human king is calling for the rebellion.

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The ladder is broken.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
From now on, the human world will have no chance to rise to the sky.

45
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The human king is calling for the rebellion.

46
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The ladder is broken.

47
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
From now on, the human king is calling for the rebellion.

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
The ladder is broken.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The human king is calling for the rebellion.

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The ladder is broken.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The human king is calling for the rebellion.

52
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The ladder is broken.

53
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The human king is calling for the rebellion.

54
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The human king is calling for the rebellion.

55
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The human king is calling for the rebellion.

56
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
This is the Chu state, my home.

57
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Who are you?

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
I am the other world?

59
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I suffered the Force of Destruction.

60
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The результатs of thisazhaka,

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
after this I am in theyt and is under Flaming Spire,

62
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
for thousands of years.

63
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
you still have the same face.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
The more you look at the five states,

65
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the more you are a fool.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Since you are here,

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
let me think about

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
how I should take revenge on you.

69
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I used to feed you with my blood and spirit power.

70
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Today, in this Blood Formation,

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I will take back

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
everything that belongs to me.

73
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The Chaos Bead is a spiritual weapon

74
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:52,000
that can control the power of the ten

75
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
and can restore the time and space

76
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
and turn the world upside down.

77
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The Goddess of Chaos

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
was so high back then.

79
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Look at how she looks now.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
She is so blind.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
She can't even resist a blood formation.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Seek forgiveness from me.

83
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Admit your betrayal.

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Admit your crime.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Seek me to let you go.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I am just myself.

87
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am not a Goddess of Chaos.

88
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Everything you said

89
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
is not true.

90
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I have never been through

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
what you said.

92
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I don't have the power

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
to turn the world upside down.

94
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
But you want me to ask for forgiveness.

95
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Dream on.

96
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Dream on?

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I really don't know

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
how Xie Xue Chen will be like this

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
when he sees you.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
If you have any grudges,

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
come at me.

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't be involved with him.

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You are heartbroken.

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
He is here.

105
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Xuan Ling!

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Who told you to come?

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This formation is dangerous.

108
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Leave now.

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I will take you out.

110
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Out?

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Who are you?

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am Zhao Ming.

113
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
You are Ren Huang, Zhao Ming?

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You are also Zhao Ming.

115
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
I killed the Heaven Realm

116
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
with one arrow.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
The gods could not fight against me.

118
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
If it wasn't for the betrayal

119
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
of the Chaos-gathering Formation,

120
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I would have already

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
destroyed the gods

122
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and would have been

123
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
under the protection of the Dragon Flame for ten thousand years.

124
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Recently, Sang Qi has been training the Jade Prowess.

125
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It has caused the evil aura to be affected.

126
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
That's why I have a chance to fight you.

127
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I have a feeling.

128
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I know that

129
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I have a chance to stay in the world.

130
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
We are just like each other.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But how can you say that I am your chance?

132
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Today,

133
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
it has been ten thousand years

134
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
since we last met.

135
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Come back.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
This is what you used to look like.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You asked me why.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I can kill you

139
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
anytime, anywhere.

140
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Xue Chen!

141
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Xue Chen!

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
A strong man

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
doesn't need to deceive the Dragon Lord.

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am the one who can kill you.

145
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I am the one who can kill you.

146
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You don't need to deceive the Dragon Lord.

147
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I said you are.

148
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You are.

149
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You are just a small piece

150
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
of me that is left in the mortal world.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Your twenty years of life

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
is just a moment for me.

153
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Who am I?

154
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
I don't have a god or a life.

155
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I don't have you.

156
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Even if you are the Zhaoming of the Human Realm,

157
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
the God of Ten Thousand Years,

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
today, I will take her away

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
from here.

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
There are ten thousand soldiers in the sword.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The land is not destroyed.

162
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Are we in the illusion

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
created by the God?

164
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Everything in front of us is a fantasy.

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
In fact, the God of War is still in your hands.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You are still alive

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
for ten thousand years.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Now, everything has changed.

169
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Everything has changed.

170
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Xie Xu Chen,

171
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you will come back one day.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I will be waiting for you.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I will be waiting for you.

174
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I will be waiting for you.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I will be waiting for you.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I will be waiting for you.

177
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Are you all right?

178
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Did you escape secretly?

179
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't worry, Master Xie.

180
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
We didn't escape secretly.

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
But we just received a message.

182
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The spirit clan attacked all the sects.

183
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Yongxue City,

184
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Xuan Tian Gate,

185
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
and Jinghua Palace

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
have been destroyed.

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
But the Bixiao Palace

188
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
is in great danger.

189
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
The Bixiao Palace

190
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Father, mother,

191
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
you are awake.

192
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Sheng'er.

193
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
How are you?

194
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Sheng'er, are you all right?

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I am fine.

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Mother, I am fine.

197
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
How is the Bixiao Palace?

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The spirit clan has been driven away.

199
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
The Bixiao Palace has been saved.

200
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Thank you, leader.

201
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
May the Bixiao Palace and the King of Wei be safe.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Thank you, both of you.

203
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
I will deal with the mountain queen.

204
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Thank you.

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
The Bixiao Palace

206
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
The rest of the time,

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
keep them company.

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Come.

209
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Look at you.

210
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Slowly.

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
How are they?

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Vice Palace Leader and Elder Duan

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,000
attacked each other with their own forces.

214
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The Shuqing Palace is in danger.

215
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
They have no power to return to the heaven.

216
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Now,

217
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
they are just going back to the palace to fight against Zhao.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The last time,

219
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
leave it to their family.

220
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The river has been controlled.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's go interrogate them.

222
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Father.

223
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
Sheng'er.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
If it wasn't for saving me,

225
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
you wouldn't have been hurt like this.

226
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's all my fault.

227
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
If I had practiced more,

228
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I would have been stronger.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
If I had found out about Jiang Nida earlier...

230
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
You fool.

231
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's not your fault.

232
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Don't blame yourself.

233
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You have been a good boy since you were a child.

234
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You are upright and kind.

235
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You are optimistic.

236
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
So this time,

237
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
don't blame yourself.

238
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Don't be afraid.

239
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Don't be hated.

240
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
It's just...

241
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
The path you take...

242
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Maybe...

243
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
You really have to go by yourself.

244
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I hope you can still be like before.

245
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Live happily every day.

246
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Be happy.

247
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
From now on,

248
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
we won't force you to fight for the position of leader.

249
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Go to him.

250
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Sheng'er.

251
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Live happily

252
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
according to your own wishes.

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
I don't want to, mother.

254
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I want to be with you.

255
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Mother.

256
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Sheng'er.

257
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I don't want to.

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Don't be like this.

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If you are like this,

260
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
I can trust you.

261
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
I don't want to.

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Sheng'er.

263
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No.

264
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Sheng'er, you have grown up.

265
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Where is your parents?

266
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I don't want to.

267
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I don't want you to look at me.

268
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Be good.

269
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Leave first.

270
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Okay?

271
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Sheng'er.

272
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You can think of it as

273
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I went to travel with your mother.

274
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I also

275
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
never

276
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
traveled with your mother.

277
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Good child.

278
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
If we have seen each other

279
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
in high and low places,

280
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
we will always be here.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I have been thinking about it for a lifetime.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Sheng'er.

283
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It's over.

284
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let me

285
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
think about it.

286
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Sheng'er.

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Don't let me

288
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
feel uneasy.

289
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Be good.

290
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Mother.

291
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Sheng'er.

292
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Sheng'er.

293
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Don't cry.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Your hand is doctor's shirt.

295
00:16:38,000 --> 00:17:01,940
Your hands were

296
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,440
Everyone here is far from the previously abandoned іslander mist'ge.

297
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,480
They are now in need of extra help.

298
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,040
I am not strange.

299
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:53,040
Therefore, they need to die pun preceding any size of disasters.

300
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,800
This is my order.

301
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,840
Make yerde agai problem familiarity.

302
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,280
Now?

303
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,120
It's the first time I comb your hair in so many years.

304
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,080
How can you say that?

305
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,080
I'm afraid you'll scold me if I don't.

306
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,600
Yuan Ting.

307
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,000
Am I old?

308
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
Look. I have white hair.

309
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
Don't be afraid.

310
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
Don't pull.

311
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,000
The more you pull, the more you'll hide.

312
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,960
Look.

313
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,960
Isn't it still youthful?

314
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:45,760
I've been a professional for a lifetime.

315
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:52,720
I still remember the first time you took me to see you.

316
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
It was like yesterday.

317
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
I said you have a good taste.

318
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,960
You must have been attracted to me.

319
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,800
That's why you chose to marry me without hesitation.

320
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,600
Right?

321
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,840
Actually, I've seen you before.

322
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:18,680
I secretly went to your Bixiao Palace to watch the competition.

323
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,040
That competition...

324
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,520
Your senior, junior, junior, and junior

325
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,520
beat you down.

326
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,320
You lost so badly.

327
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,120
You've embarrassed me.

328
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:42,320
But you did take the risk.

329
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,840
I'm just curious.

330
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,800
How can a person lose so badly

331
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,200
and still smile so happily?

332
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,800
It's really envious.

333
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:04,640
If I can be with someone who's so lively and cheerful

334
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,120
and be with him forever,

335
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,720
how happy would that be?

336
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,200
In our whole life,

337
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,920
we've been quarreling and fighting.

338
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,240
Most of the time,

339
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,920
you're the one who's tolerating my bad temper.

340
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,920
If it were someone else,

341
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,920
it would've been a hundred and two-thirds.

342
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Yuan Ting.

343
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,040
Marrying you

344
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,440
is my blessing.

345
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
No, no, no.

346
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,920
Marrying you is my best gift.

347
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,720
Everyone's saying that I married you

348
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,200
for the sake of interest and marriage.

349
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,400
They don't know anything.

350
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,400
They don't know your good.

351
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,640
Every time you're out there,

352
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,160
you protect me, your helpless husband.

353
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,160
You're willing to go far away for your child.

354
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,280
You're a person who dares to love and hate.

355
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,600
You never care about other people's eyes.

356
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,000
The longer you're with me,

357
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,040
the more I respect you

358
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,640
and love you.

359
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,840
Ah.

360
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,640
Ah...

361
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,440
Ah...

362
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,440
Shuiying.

363
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,160
Why didn't you kill me?

364
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,160
If it wasn't for the explanation of Chief Xie,

365
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
I would have killed you long ago

366
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,160
to avenge my dead comrades.

367
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,160
Chief Xie.

368
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,160
We want to talk to her alone.

369
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
Yes.

370
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
I believe that what you did was right.

371
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:09,160
I believe that everything you did was for the sake of the spiritual clan and A'bao.

372
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,420
But why did you listen to the fate and the nuclear

373
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,160
energy and be willing to be used by her?

374
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,160
Is A'bao safe now?

375
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,160
In this battle,

376
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,160
the death of the two human souls and the two tribes is very serious.

377
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Many innocent people died in the battle.

378
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,160
You and Bi Xiao Gong

379
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,160
are far behind in this matter.

380
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,160
Yet you are so close to each other.

381
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,160
You are so close to each other.

382
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,160
Is this the result you want?

383
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,160
Or

384
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,160
do you really think that the nuclear energy and the way I used to use it was right?

385
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
She didn't use me.

386
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:49,160
Everything I did

387
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,160
was her own will.

388
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,160
Why do you believe her so much?

389
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,160
After I married Xiu Xiu,

390
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,160
I had A'bao.

391
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,160
I didn't want to see the two of them

392
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,160
end up being enslaved.

393
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,160
So,

394
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,160
I wanted to kill all the hypocrites

395
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,160
in the Alliance

396
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,160
and save the spiritual clan.

397
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,160
That day,

398
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
I followed a boat full of spirits

399
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,160
to the neighboring island.

400
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,160
I wanted to kill their leader

401
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
and save the spiritual clan.

402
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,160
But that one who was so skilled

403
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
was Qin Chuan.

404
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,160
I was determined to kill him.

405
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,160
But he

406
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,160
didn't kill me.

407
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,160
You can go.

408
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,160
Why didn't you kill me?

409
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,160
I gave you three chances

410
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,160
to kill me.

411
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,160
I didn't know what kind of plan he had in mind.

412
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,160
But I felt

413
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,160
that he was different from the other Xiu clan.

414
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,160
So, I followed him

415
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,160
to see what he wanted to do.

416
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,160
He didn't do anything

417
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,160
to make me free on the island.

418
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,160
I followed him

419
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,160
to a tea house.

420
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,160
I found that

421
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:18,160
it was all spirits.

422
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,160
It even included the spirits I wanted to save.

423
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,160
They were laughing and giving.

424
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,160
Do you know that

425
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,160
they were sincere to me and

426
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,160
they respected and thanked me?

427
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,160
I bought the spirits

428
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:34,160
to bring them to the neighboring island.

429
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,160
He Xianwu

430
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,160
was the one

431
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,160
who treated the human and spirit clans the same.

432
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,160
I knew I misunderstood him.

433
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,160
So, I decided to give up the assassination.

434
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
I just wanted to go home.

435
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,160
But his men didn't let me do it.

436
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,160
That's when I realized

437
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,160
that he was sincere

438
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,160
to the third assassination.

439
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,160
The second assassination

440
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,160
was also a failure.

441
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,160
I misunderstood you.

442
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,160
I will leave the neighboring island.

443
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,160
It's okay.

444
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,160
You still have a third chance.

445
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
But I don't want to kill you.

446
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,160
People

447
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,160
have to pay for their mistakes.

448
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I have no other choice.

449
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,160
I can only go to the assassination.

450
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,160
I have no other choice.

451
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,160
I have no grudge against you.

452
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,160
You can kill me if you want.

453
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Why torture me?

454
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
I never wanted to kill you.

455
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,160
On the contrary, I wanted to help you.

456
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,160
Help me?

457
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,160
You are humiliating me.

458
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
You don't even know what I want.

459
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
How can you help me?

460
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,160
You are named Fu Cang Li.

461
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,160
Your father

462
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,160
is the brother of Princess Bixiao

463
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,160
Fu Yuan Ting.

464
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,160
Yin Quan Wei said

465
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
your father was killed.

466
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,160
Your mother took you

467
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:12,160
and fled abroad.

468
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,160
She changed your name

469
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,160
to Jiang Li.

470
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,160
Then you married

471
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,160
a Xiu Bao Shu.

472
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,160
And you gave birth to a daughter

473
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,160
named A Bao.

474
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:26,160
A Bao?

475
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,160
How do you know these?

476
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,160
Who are you?

477
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,160
These days, you have been

478
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,160
following me everywhere.

479
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,160
What do you think?

480
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,160
It's good here.

481
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,160
People and spirits can be together.

482
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
But this is not my home.

483
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
I won't stay.

484
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,160
If I tell you

485
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,160
I can make the world

486
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,160
become a spiritual island.

487
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,160
You want to help the spiritual clan?

488
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,160
But you are a human.

489
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,160
Why do you do this?

490
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,160
You are also a human.

491
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,160
But my family is a spirit.

492
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:12,160
Everyone is equal.

493
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,160
But the human clan

494
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,160
thinks they have the divine weapon

495
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
to kill other living things.

496
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
This is wrong.

497
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,160
We need to correct it.

498
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,160
We have to pay for this mistake.

499
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,160
Pay the price.

500
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Even if you really think so,

501
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,160
how can you make the fairy

502
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,160
with the power of the spiritual island?

503
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,160
How is it impossible?

504
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,160
I saw the spiritual warrior

505
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,160
he trained secretly.

506
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,160
How can this move you?

507
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
How is it impossible?

508
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,160
He has proved that he is good to the spiritual clan.

509
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:52,160
I don't care what his ultimate goal is.

510
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,160
What matters to me

511
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,160
is only A'bao and Xiu Xiu.

512
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,160
I can do anything for them.

513
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,160
Don't take me as an excuse.

514
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,160
A'bao.

515
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
I hate this. I hate you,

516
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:08,160
sister of the second brother.

517
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:10,160
I like them.

518
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
If you don't have them,

519
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,160
you can't live with me.

520
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,160
A'bao.

521
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,160
If Gao Zhu dies,

522
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
I will die too.

523
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
But I don't have parents.

524
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,160
The freedom you're talking about

525
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,160
is to let the two spiritual clans

526
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
live and die together?

527
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
A'bao likes the human clan

528
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,160
and is happy with them.

529
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:38,160
But what you're doing now

530
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,160
is just pushing A'bao into the abyss of hatred.

531
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,160
Actually, you don't have

532
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,160
A'bao and my mother.

533
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,160
You've been out for so long.

534
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:50,160
You're only doing this for the sake of killing.

535
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,160
Sister.

536
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
A'bao.

537
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm sorry.

538
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,160
I made you suffer.

539
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,160
But you have to believe me.

540
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
I don't have a father.

541
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,160
I miss you and your mother.

542
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
I want to be with you

543
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,160
every day.

544
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,160
I don't have a father.

545
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,160
I don't have a father.

546
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
I just want to

547
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,160
create a home for you

548
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,160
and your mother.

549
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
I want to be with you

550
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
and your mother.

551
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,160
I want to create

552
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:48,160
a fair and just world.

553
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,160
I admit

554
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,160
that I was too aggressive before.

555
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
Jiang Li.

556
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,160
If you can trust me,

557
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,160
I'll give you another chance.

558
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
From now on,

559
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,160
all the cultivators of the Alliance

560
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,160
don't need to be angry anymore.

561
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,160
They can be treated equally.

562
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,160
If you really want to be fair and just,

563
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,160
if you want to

564
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,160
keep the peace between the two clans,

565
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,160
tell me

566
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,160
what I want to do.

567
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I don't know what his plan is.

568
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,160
But I can tell you

569
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:48,160
that he wants to use the power of chaos

570
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,160
to open the ladder

571
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
and go to the God Realm.

572
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,160
Does he want to become a god?

573
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,160
I don't know.

574
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,160
I don't know.

575
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't know.

576
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I don't know.

577
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,160
I don't know.

578
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
I don't know.

579
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,160
I don't know.

580
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,160
I don't know.

581
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,160
He Xianwu

582
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,160
treats me so well.

583
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,160
I can't help you stop him.

584
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:24,160
Thank you for saving my life.

585
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
I see you treat A'bao

586
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
and Miss Mu

587
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,160
equally.

588
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,160
I believe you.

589
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,160
But I can't believe

590
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,160
others.

591
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:44,160
I don't believe that

592
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,160
the bond between the two clans

593
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
can be easily broken.

594
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:52,160
That's all I can tell you.

595
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
Moreover,

596
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,160
I really don't know

597
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,160
where he is.

598
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
The seal of dark jade

599
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,160
against the God of Duos.

600
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,160
The rescue of the Alliance.

601
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:08,160
I've never heard of it.

602
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Xie Xuechen,

603
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,160
are you tired?

604
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You've been with me

605
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
all the way.

606
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:20,160
Are you tired?

607
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,160
Of course I'm tired.

608
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:26,160
But who asked me to choose you?

609
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,160
You.

610
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,160
But who asked me to choose you?

611
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,160
No matter how difficult or dangerous it is,

612
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:34,160
you can't leave me.

613
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
The God of Duos is in the middle of the Alliance.

614
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,160
I don't know

615
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,160
if he's telling the truth.

616
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:52,160
Whether it's true or not,

617
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,160
Xie Xuechen,

618
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,160
you should know

619
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
that no matter it's your big brother

620
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
or the God of Duos,

621
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,160
they're not you.

622
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,160
In my heart,

623
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,160
you're not anyone's subordinate or substitute.

624
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,160
You're the unique Xie Xuechen.

625
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,160
My Xie Xuechen.

626
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
But it seems that

627
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,160
it's a long way to go.

628
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,160
It's not over yet.

629
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,160
The seal of the dark prison

630
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:40,160
is just temporary.

631
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,160
As long as the demon in my heart doesn't die,

632
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,160
the evil demon in the dark prison

633
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,160
will be out sooner or later.

634
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,160
I don't know why

635
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,160
or where the demon is.

636
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,160
He's been planning for many years.

637
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,160
He must have a plan.

638
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,160
He can't give up everything for nothing.

639
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,160
Thank you, Lord.

640
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:02,160
You're in such a hurry.

641
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
What happened?

642
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,160
Qiuming is missing.

643
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,160
Missing? What happened?

644
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,160
News from the Palace of Pure Flower

645
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
said that Qiuming was missing

646
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,160
after cleaning up the battlefield.

647
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,160
Will he be okay?

648
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,160
Gao Xiu is awake.

649
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,160
This is the tea we just got.

650
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,160
Gao Xiu, come and have a taste.

651
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Why am I here?

652
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,160
In the Star Valley,

653
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,160
only five people were left.

654
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,160
Except for the dead Sang Qi and Princess Su,

655
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,160
the rest

656
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
were killed.

657
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
The rest were Xue Chen,

658
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,160
Miss Mu,

659
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,160
and you, Gao Xiu.

660
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,160
I don't know

661
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
where the river is.

662
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,160
But it's been watching the Chaos Bead.

663
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,160
It must be asking the people around.

664
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
And you, Gao Xiu,

665
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,160
is one of them.

666
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
Xue Chen asked me to

667
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,160
protect you here.

668
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
What's the situation outside?

669
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,160
Did the Immortal Alliance

670
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,160
push the spiritual clan?

671
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,160
The Dark Clan joined the battle.

672
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:24,160
The situation has changed.

673
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,160
The people have been defeated.

674
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,160
Many people have been injured.

675
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,160
Now,

676
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,160
we need the Chaos Bead.

677
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
We need to use the power of the Chaos to rebuild Wanxian Town.

678
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
Xue Chen will watch the Chaos Bead.

679
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
He will think about

680
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,160
what to do.

681
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,160
Please send me back to the Golden Flower City.

682
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,160
I can't watch the Dark Clan

683
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,160
break through the mortal world.

684
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,160
So,

685
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,160
the Chaos Bead

686
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
is in the hands of Xie Xue Chen.

687
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,160
I don't know who has the Chaos Bead.

688
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
Master Nan and Xie Xue Chen

689
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,160
are friends.

690
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:18,160
Shouldn't you ask him about this?

691
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,160
If

692
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,160
I

693
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,160
want to hear

694
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,160
Gao Xiu's story,

695
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,160
what do you want?

696
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Are you afraid of Gao Xiu?

697
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,160
What's so scary about me?

698
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,160
Are you going to

699
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
kill me?

700
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,160
You're joking.

701
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,160
I

702
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
just want to ask you

703
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
to give me a painting.

704
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
This painting

705
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
was painted by Nan Mouxin.

706
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
In the painting,

707
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
there are mountains, water, flowers, birds and the flag.

708
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
But I feel like

709
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,160
there's something missing.

710
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
I'm not good at painting.

711
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
I'll go back to the Golden Flower Palace.

712
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Nan Xuyue, what do you want?

713
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,160
Gao Xiu seems to be a little excited.

714
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,160
Why don't you sleep a little longer?

715
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
The painting is beautiful.

716
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:22,160
The painting is beautiful.

717
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,160
This mountain, water, and heaven and earth

718
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
is small enough for you.

719
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
You should be satisfied.

720
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,160
Chief Nan, you don't seem to be

721
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
too happy.

722
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
You just heard

723
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
that the Soul Bead is in Xie Xuchen's hands.

724
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
But I'm a little curious.

725
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Sang Qi and Gao Qiumin

726
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
have completely different positions.

727
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
They're even enemies.

728
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,160
But they're all hidden.

729
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
What they want to protect

730
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
is the Soul Bead

731
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
or someone else.

732
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
Or

733
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
this person is the Soul Bead.

734
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,160
He Xianwu,

735
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,160
I've said

736
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
that

737
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
if you dare to touch it,

738
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
I'll kill you.

739
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
Chief Nan doesn't want to go to the dreamland.

740
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,160
The dreamland is

741
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,160
the person in front of you.

742
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
If you can't see it,

743
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
I'll protect you.

744
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,160
Even if the person in front of me

745
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,160
is trying to ignore your heart

746
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,160
for Xie Xuchen,

747
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
or even to interrupt your plan.

748
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,160
Not bad.

749
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:58,160
It's a good tea.

750
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
The Soul Bead is the key to opening the ladder.

751
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
It's a good tea.

752
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
It's a good tea.

753
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
It's a good tea.

754
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,160
It's a good tea.

755
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
It's a good tea.

756
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
It's a good tea.

757
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
It's a good tea.

758
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I'm sorry.

759
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I'm sorry.

760
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
The Soul Bead is the key to opening the ladder.

761
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,160
As long as the ladder can be repaired,

762
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,160
I can save his life.

763
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,160
But Chief Nan,

764
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
you won't

765
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
even want to hurt him, right?

766
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
If I really can't

767
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
do it,

768
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
why don't you kill Xie Xuchen?

769
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
Why don't you kill Xie Xuchen?

770
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
I told you earlier

771
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,160
that Xie Xuchen's existence is a threat.

772
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
Not only to you and me,

773
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,160
but also to Mu Xuan Ling.

774
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,160
As long as Xie Xuchen is here,

775
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
Mu Xuan Ling will

776
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
die with him again and again.

777
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
He might die one day.

778
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,160
You want to protect Mu Xuan Ling,

779
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
why don't you

780
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,160
kill Xie Xuchen with me?

781
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:22,160
You mean

782
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
that the missing of Qiu Ming

783
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,160
is related to the Crane Necklace?

784
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Pass the order of the Alliance.

785
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,160
The Alliance wants to track down the Crane Necklace.

786
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,160
Not only the order,

787
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,160
I also want to get a grand prize.

788
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,160
No, no matter how much,

789
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,160
I will find Qiu Ming.

790
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
He will be fine.

791
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
Don't be distracted.

792
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Distracted?

793
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
What's the relationship between me and Gao Qiu Ming?

794
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
I hate him the most.

795
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
He's the best.

796
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
Really?

797
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
Of course.

798
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
You don't hate him, right?

799
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
When we were kids,

800
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
who would cherish it for a lifetime?

801
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
In this war,

802
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,160
many people died.

803
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
Gao Qiu Ming,

804
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:26,160
I won't let him die.

805
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
I'm sorry.

806
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,160
I'm sorry.

807
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,160
I'm sorry.

808
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,160
I'm sorry.

809
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I'm sorry.

810
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,160
I'm sorry.

811
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm sorry.

812
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
I'm sorry.

813
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,160
I'm sorry.

814
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
I'm sorry.

815
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,160
I'm sorry.

816
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,160
I'm sorry.

817
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm sorry.

818
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
I'm sorry.

819
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
I'm sorry.

820
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,160
I'm sorry.

821
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,160
I'm sorry.

822
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I'm sorry.

823
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,160
I'm sorry.

824
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
I'm sorry.

825
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,160
I'm sorry.

826
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm sorry.

827
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,160
I'm sorry.

828
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
I'm sorry.

829
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I'm sorry.

830
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
I'm sorry.

831
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
I'm sorry.

832
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
I'm sorry.

833
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
The snow in the snow

834
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:18,820
is like a

835
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:20,820
floating fish.

836
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:22,820
I'm afraid that I'll spend

837
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:26,820
more time with you.

838
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:28,820
I look at that person

839
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:30,820
and dream of him.

840
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,820
But I don't know why.

841
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:34,820
I have no wish

842
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,820
in this life.

843
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:38,820
I'm with you.

844
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,820
I'm sorry.

845
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,820
I'm sorry.

846
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,820
I'm sorry.

847
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,820
I'm sorry.

848
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,820
I'm sorry.

849
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,820
I'm sorry.

850
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,820
I'm sorry.

851
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:00,820
I'm sorry.

852
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:02,820
I'm sorry.

853
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,820
I'm sorry.

854
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,820
I'm sorry.

855
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:08,820
I'm sorry.

856
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,820
I'm sorry.

857
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,820
I'm sorry.
