Changmin

00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Xie Xuchen

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Changmin

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Ten thousand years

9
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ten thousand years

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Ten thousand years

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Hard work

12
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hard work

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
In the end it's a joke

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
A meaningless joke

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to kill

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I am the one who has been in the name for ten thousand years

17
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your words can make everyone suffer

18
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Can hide all the sins

19
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Why

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Why

21
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Kill

22
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
In the end it's a joke

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I want to kill

24
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
In the end it's a joke

25
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to kill

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
In the end it's a joke

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I want to kill

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
The gods are not tolerant

29
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Let this ridiculous thing end today

30
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Let me teach you not to be angry

31
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will teach you how to fight

32
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
That day was very high

33
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The holy king stood very far

34
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't see his face

35
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But I will remember

36
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
His ambition to ascend to heaven

37
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The actions of the gods are not correct

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Today I want to have only one day in this world

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No more gods

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
This is what I want to do for the rest of my life

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:50,000
This is what I want to do for the rest of my life

42
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Li'er

43
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Didn't you tell me

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You hate me the most

45
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
After this

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
You will only be an enemy

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Wake up, okay?

48
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I will take you to see the world

49
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I will accompany you to see the world

50
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Whatever you want to do

51
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I will accompany you, okay?

52
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Xie Xuechen

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You have stopped the war of the human spirit

54
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
And sealed the sea of virtual world

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Rebuilt the ten thousand immortal world

56
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Looks like a big victory

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
But in fact, it's a defeat

58
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Xie Xuechen

59
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Admit it

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's your arrogance that has caused the death of your child

61
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I will not let you go

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I will not let you go

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I will not let you go

64
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I will not let him die

65
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
But he is dead

66
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I said I will not let him die

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Really?

68
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
You betrayed me without hesitation

69
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Suppressed me

70
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Now you dare to die for Xie Xuechen

71
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Forget it

72
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
But

73
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
It's not over yet

74
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
We will meet again

75
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
There is no place for no worries

76
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
The Chief has been using us

77
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He has been calling us for this day

78
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Why did the Chief deceive us?

79
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Say it

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Say it

81
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Say it

82
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Say it

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Say it

84
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Say it

85
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Say it

86
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Say it

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
What we believe

88
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Want to kill us in the hope of eternity

89
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What we are angry about

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
But save us from the king

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Right or wrong

92
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Right or wrong

93
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Good or evil

94
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
From the beginning

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Is fake

96
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is fake

97
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Xue Yichen

98
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Xue Yichen

99
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Wu Kui

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Xue Yichen

101
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Xue Yichen

102
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Xue Yichen

103
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Xue Yichen

104
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Thank you, Chief

105
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Li'er

106
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You rest here first

107
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I have to deal with something

108
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I will be back in a while

109
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will stay here with you today

110
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
He will be with me

111
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
To help you out

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Li'er

113
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
It hurts

114
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
You are still alive

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
but you cannot get into the spiritual center

116
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Why?

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Only there is one possibility

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,920
She doesn't want to

119
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Meet you

120
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Next

121
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I will be busy

122
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
The last one

123
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You have to help her

124
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
So that other people can also

125
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,800
Sect Leader doesn't want to accept her spirit energy.

126
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,600
Sect Leader is...

127
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,800
saving her life.

128
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Shut up! Bring me all the spirit energy!

129
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,400
Thank you for taking me back to Yun Xiu Manor.

130
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm no longer Lin Dong Lang.

131
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,800
No one will bully me.

132
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,400
I'll return the sugar balls to you.

133
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,000
Thank you.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,800
Thank you.

135
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you.

136
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,400
Thank you.

137
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,600
Thank you.

138
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Thank you.

139
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,800
Thank you.

140
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,200
Thank you.

141
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,400
I'll return the sugar balls to you.

142
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Why do you want to return them?

143
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
What about after you return them?

144
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
What do you want?

145
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
After I return them,

146
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,400
I'll go find Xie Xue Chen.

147
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
This is a lie.

148
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,800
Only the outer layer is sweet.

149
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,600
But the inside is very sour.

150
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,200
Why do you like it?

151
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,600
What I like...

152
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,600
is not sugar balls.

153
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,800
What is it then?

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,400
What is it then?

155
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,200
Me?

156
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,200
I like it so much that you want to kill Xie Xue Chen.

157
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,400
Why do you want to kill him?

158
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,200
What did he do wrong?

159
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,400
He didn't do anything wrong.

160
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,200
What he did wrong was me.

161
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,800
It was fate.

162
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
What fate?

163
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,800
I've tried to make up for it for you.

164
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,000
You and Xie Xue Chen...

165
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
are fated to be...

166
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,600
not to be.

167
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:05,400
Even so,

168
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,400
what does it have to do with you killing him?

169
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:14,000
I couldn't understand

170
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,200
what fate was.

171
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:22,600
But when I knew you were the Chaos Bead,

172
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,800
I realized the real meaning of this.

173
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
It's a life-and-death situation.

174
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,400
You and him are fated to die alone.

175
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,000
Your ex-husband is about to die.

176
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,400
I wanted to save your life,

177
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,600
but I didn't think...

178
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
that I...

179
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,600
would become the ghost of the ex-husband.

180
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,900
An eye for an eye,

181
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,200
then you see all this.

182
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,200
Hence, you're hyping up your anger.

183
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:17,440
We agreed to stay together until we die.

184
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
I don't need your grace.

185
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,200
I don't care about your life.

186
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,200
Don't go!

187
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:54,200
I'm so happy that I can't stop thinking about you.

188
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,200
You're the one who's always with me.

189
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
We're meant to be together.

190
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,200
I said I wanted to be with you.

191
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,200
I should be with you.

192
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,200
You're like a flower blooming in the wind.

193
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
Please follow me to the fireworks in the world.

194
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,200
Nan Xiyue!

195
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,200
You still have dreams to find, to investigate, and to find the one you haven't let go of.

196
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,200
You can't die.

197
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,200
Wake up!

198
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:41,200
You passed by the river, the water, the river, and the people.

199
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,200
The people are laughing and laughing.

200
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,200
It's because of love, it's because of you.

201
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,200
The flowers are blooming.

202
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,200
Nan Xiyue!

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,200
I'll give you a little bit of my love.

204
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
Okay?

205
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:16,200
I'm willing to be with you like a peach blossom.

206
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Nan Xiyue!

207
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,200
Nan Xiyue!

208
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,200
It's because of love, it's because of you.

209
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
The flowers are blooming.

210
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,200
Please give us the divine order.

211
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,200
Who's asking for the divine order?

212
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,200
The Buddha's clan, please give us the divine order.

213
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,200
The gods have always been worshipped by the mortal world.

214
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,200
There must be human beings.

215
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,200
However, now the evil spirits have been destroyed by the evil spirits.

216
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,200
They have dragged the human clan into chaos.

217
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,200
Please give us the divine order.

218
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,200
Please give us the divine order.

219
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:09,200
The evil spirits have been destroyed by the evil spirits.

220
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,200
The mortal world is in chaos.

221
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,200
But the mortal world is weak.

222
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,200
It's not good to do good deeds.

223
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,200
The book of divine order is with us.

224
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,200
We will re-establish the country and rebuild the world.

225
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
We thank you.

226
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,200
We thank you, the divine order.

227
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,200
Tianming, you're back.

228
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,200
Don't you feel bored seeing other people's lives?

229
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,200
We were born in the red alliance.

230
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,200
We were born together with the Heavenly Emperor.

231
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,200
We are beyond the three realms.

232
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,200
It's boring.

233
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,200
What does it have to do with me?

234
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,200
The land of the sea and the land of the mountains,

235
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,200
we are all the same.

236
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,200
We are all the same.

237
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,200
We are all the same.

238
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,200
What does it have to do with me?

239
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,200
The land of the sea and the land of the mountains,

240
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,200
we are all the same.

241
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Even if we are the gods,

242
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,200
we are all the same.

243
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,200
We are all the same.

244
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,200
How is it to be without you and me?

245
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,200
Tianming,

246
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
you don't understand love.

247
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,200
You don't want to change his fate.

248
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,200
Then his fate

249
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:29,200
will be written by me.

250
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:35,200
Even if the Heaven Book is destroyed,

251
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,200
and the candle is lit,

252
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,200
I will never give up.

253
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,200
You said I don't understand love.

254
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Then I will fall into the mortal world

255
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
and see

256
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:57,200
how your love

257
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,200
will change my fate.

258
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,200
What is the love you are talking about?

259
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,200
When that time comes,

260
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,200
you will come back,

261
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,200
right?

262
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,200
I will never give up.

263
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
I will never give up.

264
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
What was that just now?

265
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,200
I thought you were going to die.

266
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,200
Nan Xuyue is a test of her skills.

267
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Do you think you can save her?

268
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
You...

269
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Who are you?

270
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Wu Nai.

271
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Tianming.

272
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
Tianming.

273
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Tianming.

274
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,200
The alliance will be cut off.

275
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
The war will stop.

276
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,200
We will go back to Qingshan.

277
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Everyone,

278
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
thank you for saving us

279
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
from the fire.

280
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
I, Jiang Li,

281
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
stand here today.

282
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
From now on,

283
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,200
all the tribes will not make any mistakes.

284
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
If there is a violation,

285
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,200
we will be in danger forever.

286
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
If there is a violation,

287
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,200
we will be in danger forever.

288
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,200
Bixiao Palace will be established here.

289
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,200
From now on, the people will be the same.

290
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,200
We will never be slaves.

291
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
Jinghua Palace will also follow the will of the current leader.

292
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
From today,

293
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,200
we will abolish the sword and spirit silk.

294
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,200
We will never force the tribes.

295
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I have sent my disciples to go to the安郁.

296
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,200
If Gao Xiu and Fu Xiu come out,

297
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,200
we will be able to save them in time.

298
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,200
There is still one thing

299
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
I hope everyone can allow.

300
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,200
Earlier, when my father died,

301
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
the Alliance was in an emergency.

302
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,200
I was ordered to temporarily lead the Alliance.

303
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
But the position of the leader

304
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
is not what I want.

305
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
Now, the Immortals Formation is re-established.

306
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
The dark tribe is sealed.

307
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,200
The people are united.

308
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,200
I think the position of the leader

309
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,200
is not what I want.

310
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,200
I think the position of the leader

311
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,200
should be entrusted to someone more suitable.

312
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,200
The cultivation of the Xuanxing Immortal is extraordinary.

313
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,200
It is pure and good.

314
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
This time, in the battle against the dark tribe,

315
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
we have made great achievements and are very important.

316
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
I believe the Immortal

317
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
can lead the Alliance

318
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,200
and re-establish peace.

319
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
That day, in the main hall,

320
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
the leaders of each sect asked the Alliance Leader

321
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
to take the position of leader.

322
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
The leader said that he was just waiting for a while.

323
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
If we force him now,

324
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,200
it is a wish to repay him.

325
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
Moreover, the Xuanxing Immortal

326
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
has the position of leader.

327
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
It is very happy.

328
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
The Xuanxing Immortal,

329
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,200
are you willing to take this responsibility?

330
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,200
I will not let you down.

331
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,200
I will not let you down.

332
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
I hope that all of you

333
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,200
can protect the people and not let the past be destroyed.

334
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,200
Yes.

335
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,200
Now that the storm has subsided,

336
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,200
I believe that the Xuanxing Immortal

337
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,200
can lead the Alliance to re-establish peace.

338
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
As for Yongxue City,

339
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,200
I hope to entrust it to you two.

340
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,200
There is one thing

341
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,200
that I do not need to hide from you.

342
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
Mu Xuanling is the Chaos Bead.

343
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
Mu Xuanling is the Chaos Bead?

344
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:12,200
Before, I did not prevent the bandits from being angry.

345
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,200
I was able to take over his position.

346
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
But what I owe him,

347
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
the Human Clan owes him too much.

348
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Ten thousand years ago, the Chaos Bead was already in the sky.

349
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
It has already been able to bear the responsibility of the world.

350
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,200
Six thousand years ago,

351
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,200
the Alliance used the Chaos Bead to create the Wanxian Town.

352
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,200
It used up all of the power of the Chaos.

353
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,200
And all this time,

354
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
he helped the Alliance, but was suspected and sacrificed.

355
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,200
Now, he is even dying to save me.

356
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,200
I owe him my life.

357
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,200
The Human Clan and the Alliance owe him money.

358
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,200
No matter what,

359
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,200
I will return it.

360
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,200
Moreover,

361
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
he is the person I love.

362
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I must save him.

363
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,200
Okay. I understand.

364
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,200
Xiu Chen,

365
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,200
we will be responsible for guarding the Yongxue City.

366
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
You can rest assured.

367
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,200
If it's the Longevity Lotus,

368
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
then there is really such a thing in this world.

369
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,200
Who are you?

370
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,200
Are you also here to wait for the Longevity Lotus?

371
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,200
I came to save someone.

372
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,200
Save someone?

373
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Who?

374
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
The one I admire.

375
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
There won't be any good results

376
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
if you are obsessed with love.

377
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
The Longevity Lotus,

378
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I won't let you go.

379
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,200
The Longevity Lotus is about to bloom.

380
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
But no one knows when it will bloom.

381
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Why don't we wait together?

382
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,200
I don't want to wait with you.

383
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,200
There is a story about the Longevity Lotus.

384
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I wonder if you are interested in listening to it.

385
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
I don't want to wait with you.

386
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
I don't want to wait with you.

387
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
I don't want to wait with you.

388
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
I don't want to wait with you.

389
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
I don't want to wait with you.

390
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,200
I don't want to wait with you.

391
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
I don't want to wait with you.

392
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
I don't want to wait with you.

393
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,200
I don't want to wait with you.

394
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,200
I don't want to wait with you.

395
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
I don't want to wait with you.

396
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,200
I don't want to wait with you.

397
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
I don't want to wait with you.

398
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
I don't want to wait with you.

399
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,200
I don't want to wait with you.

400
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
I don't want to wait with you.

401
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,200
I don't want to wait with you.

402
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,200
I don't want to wait with you.

403
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:42,200
I don't want to wait with you.

404
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,200
I don't want to wait with you.

405
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
I don't want to wait with you.

406
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,200
I don't want to wait with you.

407
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
I don't want to wait with you.

408
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,200
I don't want to wait with you.

409
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,200
I don't want to wait with you.

410
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
I don't want to wait with you.

411
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I don't want to wait with you.

412
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I don't want to wait with you.

413
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I don't want to wait with you.

414
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
I don't want to wait with you.

415
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
I don't want to wait with you.

416
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
I don't want to wait with you.

417
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,200
I don't want to wait with you.

418
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,200
I don't want to wait with you.

419
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I don't want to wait with you.

420
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
I don't want to wait with you.

421
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,200
I don't want to wait with you.

422
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,200
I don't want to wait with you.

423
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
I don't want to wait with you.

424
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,200
I don't want to wait with you.

425
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,200
I don't want to wait with you.

426
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,200
I don't want to wait with you.

427
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,200
I don't want to wait with you.

428
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't want to wait with you.

429
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,200
I don't want to wait with you.

430
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,700
I don't want to wait with you.

431
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,700
I don't want to wait with you.

432
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:44,700
I don't want to wait with you.

433
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,700
I don't want to wait with you.

434
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,700
I don't want to wait with you.

435
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
I don't want to wait with you.

436
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
I don't want to wait with you.

437
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:57,900
No need to ask how far the journey is

438
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,700
For love, the snow is black

439
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:04,700
Through the two years, I can't meet you

440
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:10,700
I look forward to the day when the peach blossoms bloom

441
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,700
Qian Guang has been looking for you

442
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,100
I'm alone in a dream

443
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,700
No longer attached to me

444
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,100
No more regrets in this life

445
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,100
I'm with you

446
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,100
The lover of Qian Guang Jun has always been you

447
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:54,100
Fengxia, I was wrong

448
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,100
If I could tell you at the right time

449
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:01,100
The person I love is you

450
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,100
I won't be tormented by you for six thousand years

451
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:09,100
I'd rather never see you

452
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,100
I can stay with you for a thousand years

453
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:15,100
But if I don't see you

454
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:17,100
I'll be lonely

455
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:20,100
I can't bear to leave you alone in this world

456
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Suffering in this endless cycle

457
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Now I'm only late, I'm not late

458
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,100
Qian Guang

459
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,100
This path is wrong no matter what

460
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
Fengxia

461
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,100
Qian Guang

462
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,100
I can help you solve this cycle

463
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,100
I'm sorry

464
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm sorry

465
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
I shouldn't have done that

466
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Qian Guang

467
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
Qian Guang

468
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,100
You know the price of going against the law

469
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,100
Do you know what you'll pay when you see the wheel

470
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,100
What will you pay

471
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,100
I'll pay you

472
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,100
I'll pay you

473
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
I'll pay you

474
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
I'll pay you

475
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,100
I'll pay you

476
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,100
I'll pay you

477
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,100
I'll pay you

478
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,100
I'll pay you

479
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,100
As long as I can bear the price

480
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,100
That's enough

481
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,100
Just want to see him

482
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,100
Just bear 38,000 stringed instruments

483
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,100
They will eat your soul

484
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,100
If you are a dead person

485
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,100
If the dead person is me

486
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,100
He will also take this longevity lotus without hesitation

487
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,100
I hope that in this nerve

488
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,100
Can find a way to revive him

489
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,100
Meet Qin's son

490
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
Everyone is the same

491
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Go

492
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,100
Go do what you want to do

493
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,100
Save the people you want to save

494
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,100
When it's too late

495
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,100
I'll go

496
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,100
Li'er

497
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,100
I have allowed you

498
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,100
There are still many things to be done

499
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
From the beginning

500
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I will never let you leave me

501
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,100
Go

502
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,100
Let you try your best

503
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,100
You can keep it, right?

504
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,100
But you didn't do that

505
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Xie Xuechen

506
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,100
Do you regret

507
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,100
As a student of Snowy City

508
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
Protect the city leader

509
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
It's the same as not accepting the word

510
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Then why do you still have to go up

511
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
Isn't it good to let them die?

512
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Xie Xuechen

513
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,100
You just can't bear to die

514
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,100
I love you

515
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
You

516
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,100
You

517
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
You

518
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,100
You

519
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
Li'er

520
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,100
Li'er

521
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,100
Li'er

522
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,100
Who are you?

523
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,100
The human race is not afraid of Xie Xuechen

524
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:44,100
See you on the birthday

525
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I haven't seen anyone on the God-Devouring Platform for a long time

526
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,100
That 38,000 sword

527
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,100
Is the God-Devouring Platform

528
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
Yes

529
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,100
The 38,000 swords are the original

530
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
The original sword

531
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,100
The original sword

532
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,100
The original sword

533
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:33,100
The original sword

534
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,100
The original sword

535
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,100
The original sword

536
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
Only the original sword is strong

537
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Only the original sword is strong

538
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
Only the original sword can survive on the God-Devouring Platform

539
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,100
Only the original sword can survive on the God-Devouring Platform

540
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,100
You can get here

541
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
You must have seen Fengxiang and Qian Guang

542
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,100
Yes

543
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,100
Then do you know

544
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Make a wish to me

545
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Must pay a small price

546
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
I know

547
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,100
Just want to make sure

548
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Is the price

549
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Just need me to bear

550
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
No involvement with others

551
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Your wish

552
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,100
The fewer people involved

553
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:03,100
The less people who need to pay the price

554
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
I seem to remember

555
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,100
Someone made a wish

556
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,100
To involve all living things

557
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,100
Paid a huge price

558
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:14,100
I just want to save one person

559
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,100
The gods and the gods are all different

560
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
Want to make the dead come back to life

561
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:21,100
Only two people can do it

562
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,100
One is Si Ming Tianming Shu

563
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
The two are Yuan Yin Xuan Ni

564
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
Yuan Yin Xuan Ni turned into Su Ning Xi

565
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:30,100
I'm afraid it's hard to get out of here

566
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,100
May I ask

567
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:34,100
Where is Si Ming God?

568
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,100
You want to ask him for help

569
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,100
No

570
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,100
I have never seen him

571
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
But I remember

572
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,100
He is cold and cold

573
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:45,100
Not like me

574
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,100
It is said that the gods abandoned the human race

575
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,100
No longer communicate with the world

576
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
But why did the gods leave Changsheng Lian Yi

577
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,100
And come here

578
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:53,100
And

579
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
What is this place

580
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
No matter how suspicious you are

581
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
I am also confused

582
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
Why am I the only god here

583
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,100
You don't know

584
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Ten thousand years ago

585
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,100
Someone asked me to wait here

586
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
But that person didn't tell me

587
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,100
What kind of person I'm waiting for

588
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Is a man or a woman

589
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Is an old or young

590
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,100
I feel that the gods have not disappeared

591
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
But where did they go

592
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:27,100
It seems that something very important happened

593
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,100
I just want to ask

594
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
But I forgot

595
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,100
But forget

596
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
It must be that there is power above me

597
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
That's why I forgot

598
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Heaven's Book

599
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:41,100
Yes

600
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Maybe it's the Heaven's Book

601
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,100
Someone used the Heaven's Book

602
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,100
To control the fate of the gods

603
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
Do you know

604
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,100
The Heaven's Book is a magic weapon used to lie

605
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,100
The words come out and the hair is broken

606
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:54,100
All lies will come true

607
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,100
Its power is far above me

608
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:59,100
But it also needs to pay a great price

609
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,100
Without any gain

610
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,100
It doesn't need to pay a price

611
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,100
If I just want to save one person

612
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,100
God, do you have a way

613
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,100
I can help you go back to the past

614
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:15,100
Change its trajectory before that person dies

615
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,100
You can think about

616
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:19,100
Which time and place to go back to

617
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:22,100
I have turned around and sent you back

618
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:24,100
If I haven't broken it

619
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:26,100
Then I don't need to see it again

620
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,100
In the end, he won't die

621
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,100
I want to go back to Wanxian Town

622
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,100
Before it breaks apart

623
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,100
Stop He Qianwu

624
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,100

625
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:25,100
