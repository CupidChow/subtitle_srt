Episode 16

6
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What are you looking at?

7
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Kill!

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
This Princess Qingyang

9
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
is the gift from Xiling State

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
to the Holy Ruler.

11
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Kill!

12
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Can a noble princess

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
be regarded as a gift?

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In this chaotic world,

15
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
what does a princess have to do with it?

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Lord He Zhou is here!

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Hurry up!

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
How dare this spy

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
steal the map of the army!

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Let's go!

21
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Holy Ruler!

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Holy Ruler!

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
We just caught a spy

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
who was trying to escape from prison.

25
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
We found the map

26
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
of the army

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
on him.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
It must be the traitor

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
who wants to stop our army from returning to the city.

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What is the purpose of stealing the map of the army?

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Speak!

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
He is dead.

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
He is hiding the poison in his mouth.

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He is in prison.

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Holy Ruler!

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
It is a dead end.

37
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Fortunately, the patrols found him.

38
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Otherwise,

39
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
if the map of the army is lost,

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
our army will be delayed.

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's a pity that the spy is dead now.

42
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
We have no evidence.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
What do they want to do?

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Fortunately, the map of the army is safe.

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Pass my order.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Keep the map of the army tonight.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Return to the city tomorrow.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Yes.

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Back up!

50
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Let me go!

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Wait!

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Back up!

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Back up!

54
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Back up!

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,880
The

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
army is here!

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Back up!

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The army is here!

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Back up!

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Back up!

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Back up!

62
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Back up!

63
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Back up!

64
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Back up!

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Back up!

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Back up!

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I heard that the Xie Yang

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
chief of the West Shrine came with the army.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It must be him.

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The princess of West Shrine came to the east

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
to take care of the army?

72
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Yes.

73
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Yes.

74
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
They are a perfect match.

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes.

76
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Yes.

77
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Right?

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
They are so beautiful.

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Yes.

81
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The princess of West Shrine.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The princess of West Shrine.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
The princess of West Shrine.

84
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The princess of West Shrine.

85
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The princess of West Shrine.

86
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The Holy Lord gave the most recent

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Chang Le Palace to the Princess of Qing Yang

88
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
from Chang Ming Palace.

89
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
It seems that this person will soon

90
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
become the Goddess of Light.

91
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I thought that Miss Zhu

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
would marry the Holy Lord.

93
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You said that if the Holy Lord

94
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
marries the Princess of Qing Yang,

95
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
what about Miss Zhu?

96
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Will the Holy Lord be promoted to the Princess of Qing Yang

97
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
or will he be driven away

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
by the guards of the Qing Yang Palace?

99
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
The one who can help Zhao Ming

100
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
stabilize the situation

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
and fight against the gods with him

102
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is his accomplice.

103
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If I can't help Zhao Ming,

104
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
for him,

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
what am I?

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Holy Lord,

107
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
the Princess of Qing Yang has entered

108
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
the Chang Le Palace.

109
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What should we do next?

110
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
After a while,

111
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
the Xiling spy who followed

112
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
the Princess of Qing Yang

113
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and the head of the palace

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
will be sent away.

115
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Since the Holy Lord has found the spy,

116
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
why don't you

117
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
kill them all?

118
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Compared to not having a spy,

119
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
the spy who knows is more valuable.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
We can use them

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
to convey the information

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
that we want to convey.

123
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Holy Lord, rest early.

124
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Holy Lord,

125
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the Princess of Qing Yang wants to see you.

126
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Did you come here at midnight

127
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
for something important?

128
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What I said to the Holy Lord

129
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
was nothing but nonsense.

130
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I know that the Holy Lord

131
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
has the intention to fight against the gods.

132
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I'm willing to help the Holy Lord

133
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to avoid it.

134
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you want to go to the God Realm,

135
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you must pass the ladder.

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
However, without the permission of the gods,

137
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
you have to use the body of a mortal

138
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
to force yourself to climb the ladder.

139
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You will be tormented by the fire of the gods.

140
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The mortal body

141
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:35,520
can't bear the

142
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,520
pain of the ladder.

143
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,520
I can help the Holy Lord

144
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
to adapt to the pain of the ladder in advance

145
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,520
and find the way to ascend the sky.

146
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
You can say yes.

147
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,520
The Holy Lord has studied the method of fighting against the gods for many years.

148
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,520
He can definitely judge it to be true or false.

149
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
Holy Lord, I'll call the imperial doctor.

150
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,520
No need.

151
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,520
What do you want?

152
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,520
What I want

153
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,520
is to stay in the Dongze Palace.

154
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
My father sent me to Dongze

155
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,520
because he wanted me to enter the Dongze Palace.

156
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,520
If I can't complete this task,

157
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,520
he will kill me and my mother.

158
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,520
Then let the Holy Lord

159
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,520
take your mother to Dongze

160
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
and help you leave.

161
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
If I can leave so easily,

162
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,520
how can I wait until now?

163
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,520
Holy Lord,

164
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,520
my father was controlled by the evil gods

165
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,520
and tried to pursue the method of immortality

166
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,520
to help the evil gods to practice poison.

167
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,520
I was used by my father

168
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,520
to test the medicine and poison since I was a child.

169
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,520
In order to better control me,

170
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,520
he gave my mother the seven poisons.

171
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Only the evil gods have the antidote.

172
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:02,520
If you leave forcibly,

173
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
there will be no medicine to cure you.

174
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,520
I hope that the Holy Lord can marry me

175
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,520
or marry me in a foreign dress

176
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
to hide my father

177
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,520
and the evil gods behind him.

178
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,520
The pain of the heart

179
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,520
that grows in the blood vessels

180
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,520
is the punishment

181
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,520
for Hao Tian's love for the divine qi.

182
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
When the blood vessels

183
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
spread from the heart to the fingertips,

184
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,520
Hao Tian's heart

185
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,520
was filled with the pain.

186
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Hao Tian was so angry

187
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
that he was so angry

188
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,520
that he was so angry

189
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,520
that he was so angry

190
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
that he was so angry

191
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,520
that he was so angry

192
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,520
that he would lower the heaven's law.

193
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,520
that he would lower the heaven's law.

194
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,520
The present time is the disaster of the snow.

195
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,520
The present time is the disaster of the snow.

196
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
The Qing Mai.

197
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:16,520
This name

198
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,520
sounds pretty good.

199
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
You can only come back to the deep pool with me

200
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,520
and completely remove the pain of the Qing Mai.

201
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,520
and completely remove the pain of the Qing Mai.

202
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,320
I don't really know how to say it.

203
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
I'm afraid that you'll be upset.

204
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
I'm afraid that you'll be upset.

205
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Tianming.

206
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
I think I understand the meaning of love now.

207
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I think I understand the meaning of love now.

208
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
It's not only sweet,

209
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
it's also bitter and sour.

210
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
I don't want to go back to the Shentai.

211
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
I want to be someone who has feelings.

212
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
I want to be someone who has feelings.

213
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Just for this so-called love,

214
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Just for this so-called love,

215
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
you'd rather die.

216
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
you'd rather die.

217
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
As long as it's a person,

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
as long as it's a person,

219
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
wouldn't everyone die?

220
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
But you are a ancient deity.

221
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You're superior to humans and gods.

222
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
You're superior to humans and gods.

223
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
You deserve to die.

224
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Do you know?

225
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
Do you know?

226
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
I don't know if I know.

227
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
I don't know if I know.

228
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,320
But now,

229
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
this is my choice.

230
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
I didn't expect that Zhao Ming

231
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
could calm down

232
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
in such a short time.

233
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
These little states are useless.

234
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,320
I'm useless.

235
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,320
If I hadn't been trapped in the mortal world,

236
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
I really wanted to catch him

237
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
and fight him.

238
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
I really wanted to catch him and fight him.

239
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Then use the human clan's method to deal with him.

240
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Heroes can't beat the beauty.

241
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
Qingyang has already

242
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
succeeded in entering the palace.

243
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
How many emperors have been destroyed in the red camp?

244
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
How many emperors have been destroyed in the red camp?

245
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
As long as Qingyang can stir up chaos,

246
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,320
then Zhao Ming's emperor's

247
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,320
luck will be in danger.

248
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
By then,

249
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
what kind of god can he fight against?

250
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,320
In the end,

251
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
I'm the only one who can do it.

252
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
Heavenly Order God?

253
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Heavenly Order God,

254
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I've been a minister for many years

255
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
and I haven't answered your questions.

256
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
I didn't expect that

257
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,320
you actually came to the mortal world.

258
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,320
Heavenly Order God left the temple.

259
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Did God give you instructions?

260
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Then,

261
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
who gave you instructions

262
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
when the three gods came to the mortal world?

263
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
Don't be angry,

264
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
God.

265
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,320
The gods are not here.

266
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
I'm not angry.

267
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
God, don't be angry.

268
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
The gods don't want to break the rules of the heaven.

269
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,320
We came here

270
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,320
because of the order of the Heavenly Order Book.

271
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,320
Do you still remember

272
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
the prophecy of the God's egg and the fall of the gods?

273
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Yes.

274
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
Please tell Aoyi

275
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
to let us find the gods.

276
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
So you're afraid.

277
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
The emperor

278
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
is also for the gods.

279
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
In my eyes,

280
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
the gods are the same

281
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
in the human race

282
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
and the spirit race.

283
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,320
Even if they know where the gods are,

284
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
how can they know?

285
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
The gods are watching us.

286
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
They can't show themselves.

287
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
Now they're here.

288
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
Is there anything to explain?

289
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
You want to deal with Zhao Ming.

290
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
But this fire

291
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
is still not strong enough

292
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
and not strong enough.

293
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
The gods mean...

294
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,320
Keep Zhao Ming

295
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
distracted by the state affairs.

296
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Even

297
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
disappear.

298
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Are you ready?

299
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
Let's start.

300
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
The fire

301
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
will not destroy the clothes

302
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
and body,

303
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
but will cause

304
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
a great pain and torment.

305
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
If you can stand it this time,

306
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
you will get used to it.

307
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
The fire is still not strong enough.

308
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
The gods are watching us.

309
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
The fire is still not strong enough.

310
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
The fire is still not strong enough.

311
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
The fire is still not strong enough.

312
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Tonight,

313
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:26,460
I shall

314
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
set on the required track.

315
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
Perfect.

316
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,320
He Zhou.

317
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,320
Why are you here?

318
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Go back, go back.

319
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,160
Is Zhang Mingke inside?

320
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,040
No, no.

321
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,360
By the way,

322
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,280
do you have any special feeling?

323
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,560
Like the burning of the Tengdu?

324
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,960
No.

325
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,920
What's wrong?

326
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,920
There's something important to do today.

327
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:58,120
I can't see you for now.

328
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,560
But what happened?

329
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,920
He Zhong,

330
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,560
don't lie to me again.

331
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,880
No.

332
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:06,640
This...

333
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,360
I...

334
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,120
He Zhong,

335
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,680
His Majesty has rested.

336
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,360
No one can disturb him.

337
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
He Zhong,

338
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,080
is it related to Princess Qingyang

339
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,800
what you said?

340
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,880
Go back first.

341
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,240
I'll explain it to you later.

342
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,160
I...

343
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:51,840
His Majesty is really tired.

344
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,360
Let's not disturb him.

345
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:57,720
Okay.

346
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,320
I'll come another day.

347
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,600
Isn't that too violent for someone

348
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,280
to say so?

349
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,520
Is there a child for me?

350
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,360
boanting.

351
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
I'm not looking for her.

352
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,240
Did A'Zhu come here?

353
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,640
I heard her voice.

354
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:46,760
Yes.

355
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,080
I didn't let her in

356
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,640
as you told me.

357
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,480
That's good.

358
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
You didn't tell A'Zhu about this

359
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,440
and didn't let her come near you.

360
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,880
Is it because you're afraid that A'Zhu

361
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,320
will suffer the same pain as you

362
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,960
or you don't want her to worry

363
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,640
about your weak condition?

364
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,960
Let A'Zhu be.

365
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,200
I...

366
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,360
Just tell me what you want to say.

367
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,560
There's a rumor in the palace

368
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,440
that Princess Qingyang will marry Shengju.

369
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,080
If Princess Qingyang goes to Changming Hall,

370
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,200
the spy in West Shrine will believe it.

371
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
He will send the news to West Shrine soon.

372
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,040
The crisis of Princess Qingyang will be resolved for now.

373
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,720
But if we don't tell A'Zhu the truth,

374
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,240
I'm afraid she will be sad.

375
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,360
Just tell me.

376
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,240
A'Zhu's whereabouts

377
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,480
you should know very well.

378
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,000
If she knew what I'm doing,

379
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,840
she would help me at all costs.

380
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,160
It's not a matter of life or death.

381
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,720
Even if she knows she's the Chaos Bead,

382
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
I don't want to use her.

383
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
Let A'Zhu be A'Zhu

384
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,320
but not A'Zhu of Zhao Ming.

385
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:12,920
Save your face

386
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,160
There were noのは

387
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,880
Blessed products

388
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,560
Is this so

389
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,160
a

390
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,320
What to see

391
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,800
E spoiler

392
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,520
Guozheng

393
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,080
It's gone

394
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,920
Let a pair of dreams be parted without a trace

395
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,400
I have no regrets in this life

396
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:43,960
I'll stay by your side

397
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,720
Go, go, go

398
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
What's wrong?

399
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,280
Miss Zheng

400
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,440
We're here to deliver some snacks to Princess Qingyang

401
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:57,640
Why don't you go in?

402
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,120
Because...

403
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,160
Because...

404
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,200
A girl came to deliver something yesterday

405
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,920
and was teased by Princess Qingyang

406
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,400
We didn't dare to go in

407
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,440
I'll go

408
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:13,400
Thank you, Miss Zheng

409
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,160
What are you doing here?

410
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,600
I heard that you teased a maid yesterday

411
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,840
They're a little afraid of you now

412
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,040
and dare not come in

413
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,040
So I came to deliver some snacks for them

414
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,560
You're really a tough girl

415
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,040
You made a mistake and you can't say it

416
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,600
They don't have to come here anymore

417
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm sorry

418
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I'm sorry

419
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm sorry

420
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,000
I'm sorry

421
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm sorry

422
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I'm sorry

423
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm sorry

424
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,600
But you're the princess

425
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,240
If nobody takes care of you

426
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,920
it would be inconvenient for you to live here

427
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,760
She doesn't need to be taken care of

428
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,800
I'm sure that she's used to it

429
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,480
Do you still live here?

430
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,960
If I tell you that I don't

431
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Are you going to send me back to West Shrine?

432
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,760
You don't have to be so hostile to me.

433
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,160
I never thought of being your enemy.

434
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,160
Even if I take away the Holy Ruler?

435
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,360
I know you like the Holy Ruler.

436
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
But you should have heard it.

437
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,160
Soon I will marry him.

438
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,960
You are useless here.

439
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,960
You should go to Changming Hall to cry.

440
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,160
I don't own Changming Hall.

441
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
I don't have any strongholds.

442
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,160
I am just curious.

443
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,960
You never saw him before.

444
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
But you want to marry him.

445
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,960
Is it really because you like him?

446
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
I don't like him.

447
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
But I have to marry him.

448
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,960
Marry someone you don't like?

449
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,960
Is it too casual?

450
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Just because I like him, I will marry him.

451
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Is it too casual?

452
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
Look outside.

453
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
There is such a beautiful pond in our West Shrine Palace.

454
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
And such a wide peach tree.

455
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,960
And a elegant platform.

456
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,960
Do you know every time I see these beautiful scenes,

457
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
I am thinking about what dream?

458
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:31,960
I am thinking about the beauty.

459
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Where should I die?

460
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,960
So you see,

461
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,960
people can't feel the beauty.

462
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
That's right.

463
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,960
So you have to keep your good memory.

464
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,960
You are protected so well.

465
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,960
You can never understand it.

466
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,960
But you are still alive.

467
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
Does it mean

468
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
you still have hope and concern in your heart?

469
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
So

470
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:21,960
you should live well.

471
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,960
What if you realize your wish?

472
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
I have delivered the dessert.

473
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,960
I will go now.

474
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Miss A'chu.

475
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
A'yan.

476
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Don't come here anymore.

477
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,960
The farther you are from her, the better.

478
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Why?

479
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
She is not a kind person.

480
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Not a kind person?

481
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,960
Why do you say that?

482
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,960
The more beautiful a woman is, the more beautiful she is.

483
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,960
You are right.

484
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,960
I am not a kind person.

485
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,960
I am not a kind person.

486
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,960
The more beautiful a woman is, the more cruel she is.

487
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
What kind of power is this?

488
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,960
What about me?

489
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,960
You are different.

490
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,960
You don't have a heart.

491
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,960
You are a person without a heart.

492
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
A'yan.

493
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,960
Do you have any past with Qingyang?

494
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,960
No.

495
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,960
I have reminded you all.

496
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
Do you hear me?

497
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,960
Where is Zhao Ming?

498
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
Is he still busy?

499
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
His Majesty is busy with work.

500
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
He can't see him for a few days.

501
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Then...

502
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
Why did you suddenly leave?

503
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,960
Dong Ze is no longer in the prison.

504
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Why do you need Dong Ze?

505
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Dong Ze needs you

506
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,960
not because of the prison.

507
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
It's because of your intelligence.

508
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,960
You know the world and you can see people's hearts.

509
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,960
No one can solve it.

510
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,960
In the wrong time,

511
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,960
in the wrong place,

512
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
these things

513
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
are not meaningful.

514
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,960
You really went to the Ghost Valley?

515
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,960
His Majesty said that

516
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,960
I was there.

517
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
We really went together.

518
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
We went together.

519
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,960
You can play the last game

520
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,960
with me.

521
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,960
This chess game

522
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,960
seems to be

523
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,960
too difficult.

524
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
I really didn't expect

525
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
that the game of

526
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
the longevity festival to be so complicated.

527
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
No result, no victory.

528
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,960
This is the way the Emperor

529
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,960
has been waiting for.

530
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,960
If I can keep you here,

531
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,960
it's not bad.

532
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I stayed.

533
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,960
For His Majesty,

534
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
it's not necessarily a good thing.

535
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,960
You should know

536
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,960
that I only believe in the world.

537
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,960
I also know that His Majesty

538
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
believes in the world.

539
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
Maybe in the future,

540
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
I will be able to

541
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,960
fulfill the wish of the Emperor

542
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,960
and the God of War.

543
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,960
It seems that I can't keep you here today.

544
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,960
I'll leave now.

545
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,960
I wish you

546
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
to walk without fear.

547
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
You have a heart

548
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,960
for everything.

549
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,960
A heart?

550
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,960
Then I'll take it as a blessing from His Majesty.

551
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,960
Eat.

552
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,960
This is the antidote for this month.

553
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,960
Your good daughter's

554
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
mission is progressing well.

555
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Qingyang.

556
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,960
How is Qingyang?

557
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,960
I know that she is very fond of Zhaoming.

558
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,960
She was living in Changming Palace

559
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,960
in a very happy life.

560
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,960
Maybe she has forgotten

561
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
that her mother is still here.

562
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,960
That's good.

563
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,960
I hope that she never comes back.

564
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,960
You want to get rid of me?

565
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Impossible.

566
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I'm her father.

567
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,960
What right do you have

568
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,960
to use your daughter,

569
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,960
your daughter, as a medicine,

570
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,960
as a weapon, as a bargaining chip,

571
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
to fulfill your dirty purpose?

572
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,960
She is the princess of Xiling.

573
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,960
She should dedicate everything

574
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
to the eternal life and prosperity of Xiling.

575
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,960
To Xiling?

576
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,960
For the sake of your

577
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
eternal self-sacrifice?

578
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
I'm the king of Xiling.

579
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Xiling is me.

580
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,960
I'm Xiling.

581
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
Your honor,

582
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
according to the spy,

583
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,960
Qingyang is fond of Zhaoming.

584
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,960
He will get married soon.

585
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,960
Useless.

586
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,960
Who wants to listen to these

587
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,960
love stories? Why hasn't Qingyang started yet?

588
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,960
Maybe he hasn't found

589
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,960
the best time to kill.

590
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,960
The best time?

591
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,960
Is your daughter

592
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,960
in love with Zhaoming

593
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,960
and trapped by love?

594
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Her mother is still in my hands.

595
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,060
You are poisoned by the

596
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,960
child of the devil.

597
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
No one can poison me.

598
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
If you die,

599
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,960
your precious daughter

600
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
will die too.

601
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,960
Besides, Qingyang himself is poisoned.

602
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
He uses my medicine to keep his life.

603
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,960
I'll write a letter

604
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,960
to ask him to do it as soon as possible.

605
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,960
Why don't you go to the east

606
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,960
and supervise him to complete the task?

607
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
If he still has to delay,

608
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,960
you can find a chance

609
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
to kill him yourself.

610
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
A letter from Lord Xiling.

611
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
He misses his daughter very much.

612
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,960
He wants to come to the east to celebrate her birthday.

613
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,960
Lord Xiling doesn't like this daughter.

614
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,960
He must have a plan

615
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
for this.

616
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
There must be a way to get back at him.

617
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Your Majesty, we have to refuse.

618
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,960
No.

619
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:00,960
Let him come.

620
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Your Majesty.

621
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,960
Your Majesty.

622
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,960
He is a part of the solution.

623
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
If he doesn't come,

624
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
I will invite him to come.

625
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
But your body...

626
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,960
It doesn't matter.

627
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
I have gradually mastered

628
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,960
the method of controlling the fire of heaven and earth.

629
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,960
I can handle it.

630
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,960
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

631
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Now,

632
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I don't have to hide it from Zhu anymore.

633
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
How is Zhu recently?

634
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,960
She knows you are busy,

635
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,960
so she doesn't come.

636
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
She has been playing alone

637
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
in Linglong Palace.

638
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
She doesn't know what she is playing.

639
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,960
She even went to see Princess Qingyang several times.

640
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
But she didn't fight.

641
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,960
She looks fine.

642
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
But I don't know

643
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
if she is really fine

644
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,960
or pretending to be fine.

645
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
President Zhangiting.

646
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,960
You occurred in our caravan.

647
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,960
I was wearing a long dress

648
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,960
and was living at a faraway place.

649
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,960
So I didn't think

650
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,960
that you would show yourself tomorrow.

651
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Did you go to bed yet?

652
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
She said that

653
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,960
I would be awake tomorrow.

654
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,960
Didn't you get sleep while dealing with her?

655
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,960
Of course not.

656
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,960
Let her sleep and we can rest.

657
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Come.

658
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,960
Good morning.

659
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,960
Johnson.

660
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Your Majesty.

661
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,960
To speak of the matter,

662
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,960
I just gave it to my mother's uncle

663
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:33,960
Why didn't you report it to me?

664
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,960
If you don't believe me

665
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
you can open it yourself

666
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,960
Prince Xiling is coming to Dongze to visit you

667
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,960
Did you send a message in private?

668
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,960
You did it on purpose?

669
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,960
You should know the most about my relationship with him

670
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
He is my uncle

671
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:03,960
and the most despicable person in the world

672
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,960
I don't know

673
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
You are a man who is always so arrogant

674
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,960
and cunning

675
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,960
I don't believe what you said

676
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,960
You are a man of great power

677
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Why did you pretend not to know

678
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,960
and hide it from me?

679
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,960
I didn't hide it from you

680
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
I just don't want to be with someone like you

681
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Someone like me?

682
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,960
The most respected king

683
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,960
is willing to be my friend

684
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,960
It's just a short conversation

685
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
It means the king is a smart person

686
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:53,960
A smart person

687
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
who can see the essence of things

688
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,960
and know what is important

689
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,960
But you never learn to

690
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:03,960
let go of the past

691
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,960
and move forward

692
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
You can let go of the past

693
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Yes

694
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Your past is all about the devil

695
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,960
and the ghost

696
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Of course there is nothing worth remembering

697
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,960
I warn you

698
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,960
This is not Xiling

699
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,960
Why are you playing tricks?

700
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,960
Who is it?

701
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm here to deliver something for the maid

702
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,960
You lied to me

703
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,960
You said you and Qingyang didn't have a relationship

704
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,960
Now I caught you

705
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Are you lying to me about Zhang Ming?

706
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
You are here to deal with me?

707
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960
You can do it too

708
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
Tell me the truth

709
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
Where are you going?

710
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
You don't have to do this

711
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,960
I'm not going

712
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,960
I know you have a lot of questions

713
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Let's do it one by one

714
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
I will tell you everything

715
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,960
I will tell you everything

716
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,960
I will tell you everything

717
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,960
Then tell me

718
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,960
What's going on between A Yan and Qingyang?

719
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,960
I can't tell you about them

720
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
If you don't tell me, I will go ask Zhang Ming

721
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
No, no, no

722
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
He is busy, don't go to him

723
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,960
A Yan is not from Dong Ze

724
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,960
You know that

725
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,960
I heard A Yan's home is in Xiling

726
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,960
If his home is a home

727
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Then he won't have to go through so much trouble

728
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,960
A Yan was born with a hard life

729
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,960
When he was very young

730
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,960
His parents sold him to the security office in Xiling

731
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,960
Such a small child

732
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,960
He suffered a lot of torture

733
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
He tried his best

734
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,960
He finally survived in that kind of place

735
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
From now on, he can only stay in the dark

736
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
And do the most dangerous assassination mission

737
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,960
When A Yan was in danger

738
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,960
Princess Qingyang saved him

739
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,960
Yes

740
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,960
The security in Xiling

741
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,960
Are you going to kill the princess of Xiling?

742
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,960
Your wound is poisonous

743
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:39,960
I can't get you out of this yard

744
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,960
This is poison

745
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,960
I only have poison here

746
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
To poison with poison

747
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,960
If you don't dare

748
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Then forget it

749
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
To give your life to a stranger

750
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
Who is the first time you meet

751
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
It seems that

752
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
You don't expect much

753
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,960
Qingyang's mother was born in Hanwei

754
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,960
She is not favored by the king of Xiling

755
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Qingyang is a princess

756
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,960
But he also suffered a lot

757
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
He lives in the farthest place

758
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
He is afraid of being attacked

759
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,960
Qingyang lives in the farthest place

760
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,960
But because of this

761
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,960
A Yan can enter quietly

762
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,960
And not be discovered

763
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Princess

764
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,960
This is the latest medicine

765
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,960
The king asked you to try

766
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,960
King of Xiling pursues longevity

767
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
But he is afraid of danger

768
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,960
Need blood relatives to test medicine

769
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
Let Qingyang, who is not favored

770
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,960
Be his medicine

771
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,960
What's wrong with you?

772
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,960
A Yan

773
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,960
You are here

774
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,960
Your eyes

775
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
It's okay

776
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,960
It's just a medicine

777
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,960
It will be fine soon

778
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
A Yan is angry

779
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,960
But there is no way

780
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,960
I had to accompany Qingyang

781
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
Steal medicine from the imperial hospital

782
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,960
Punish him secretly

783
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,960
In this way

784
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,960
Two people with hard lives start to rely on each other

785
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,960
They are in love

786
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,960
But no one can say it

787
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,960
Because they can live well

788
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,960
For them

789
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,960
It's already a snake king

790
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,960
What happened later?

791
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
Later

792
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,960
King of Xiling

793
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I don't know where A Yan learned about Qingyang

794
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,960
He told A Yan

795
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,960
Can go to the military camp

796
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,960
The border is tight

797
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
If you set up a military palace, except for being a general

798
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,960
It's not impossible for you to marry the princess

799
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
A Yan went?

800
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,960
Went?

801
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
He was angry and he was dead

802
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
After a few years

803
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
A Yan took a scar and military palace

804
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,960
Returned to the court

805
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,960
But learned that the king of Xiling

806
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,960
For the gold mine needed for the medicine

807
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,960
Married Qingyang to a merchant

808
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
Over a hundred years

809
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
In the face of A Yan's question

810
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
King of Xiling said

811
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,960
If A Yan can take back the treasure of the south

812
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,960
So A Yan went to the south alone

813
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,960
Every time

814
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,960
Finally, the treasure was brought back to Xiling

815
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,960
But when he gave the treasure

816
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,960
But found the treasure empty

817
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
No one knows why the treasure is lost

818
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
A Yan asked King of Xiling

819
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,960
Give him another chance

820
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
King of Xiling promised A Yan

821
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,960
Can get the gold in half a year

822
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
A hundred thousand taels as betrothal gifts

823
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
Get out

824
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:31,960
Can marry Qingyang to him

825
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
But before the death

826
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,960
A Yan heard Qingyang and King of Xiling discussing

827
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Father

828
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
When A Yan brought back a hundred thousand taels of gold

829
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
I secretly hid one

830
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,960
By then

831
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
He can't reach the request

832
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,960
We can mention other conditions to him

833
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
You are really the father's good daughter

834
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,960
It turns out that everything is Qingyang's plan

835
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
He saved A Yan in the midst of danger

836
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
In order to get the most loyal servant

837
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,960
Then

838
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,960
He took the throne

839
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960
Then use A Yan's like

840
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
Complete King of Xiling's task

841
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,960
So that he can live better

842
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,960
Do you believe

843
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
A Yan doesn't believe

844
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
So

845
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
He asked Qingyang

846
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Since you have heard

847
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,960
Then I have nothing to hide

848
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:23,960
You don't really think I want to marry you, do you?

849
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,960
Although we both had a hard time

850
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
It doesn't mean that we are the same kind

851
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,960
I am the princess of Xiling after all

852
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
And you are just a secret guard

853
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,960
Even if I used you

854
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,960
You should be grateful

855
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,960
At least you have a little value to be used

856
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,960
A Yan took the burden to leave Xiling

857
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Travel to all countries

858
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Lucky to have the Holy Lord

859
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
To root the east

860
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
It turns out that A Yan

861
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,960
lived so bitterly before

862
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,960
But He Zhou

863
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,960
Why do I think

864
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,960
Qingyang is not that kind of person

865
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,960
You only know Qingyang for a long time

866
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,960
What kind of person is Qingyang

867
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,960
A Yan is clearer than you

868
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,960
You just listen to A Yan's advice

869
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,960
Stay away from Qingyang

870
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,960
Does Zhaoming know this past?

871
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Does he?

872
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,960
Yes

873
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,960
Then why

874
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,960
does he still want to marry Qingyang?

875
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
The Holy Lord can't

876
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
do whatever he wants

877
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
He has his own thoughts

878
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
What is Zhaoming busy with these days?

879
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,960
Why doesn't he want to see me?

880
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,960
It's complicated

881
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
In short

882
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
The Holy Lord is busy with the practice of the law of anti-god

883
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
No way to escape

884
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,960
Qingyang

885
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,960
Can help Zhaoming

886
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,960
Right?

887
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Holy Lord, Miss Zhu went to Qingyang

888
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,960
Will come back

889
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,960
Qingyang Princess's birthday

890
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,960
The Holy Lord set up a banquet to celebrate her

891
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:49,960
Lord Xiling also came personally

892
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:51,960
She is a princess

893
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,960
We can't envy her

894
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,960
Why don't you do it?

895
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,960
Do you

896
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,960
want to wait here

897
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,960
and see your mother

898
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:05,960
being framed?

899
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,960
If I have any flaws

900
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,960
don't think about it

901
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,960
You are talking to my father

902
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,960
Father

903
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,960
I want to quit the medicine

904
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,960
I said

905
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,960
It's not easy to assassinate Zhaoming

906
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,960
I need time

907
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,960
This Sanlin poison

908
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
is made specifically for Zhaoming

909
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,960
You put it on the strength

910
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
Find a right time to stab his body

911
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:37,960
Even if he is born with a divine foot

912
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,960
he can't resist

913
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:45,960
Your mother

914
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,960
is alone in Xiling

915
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,960
She thinks about you day and night

916
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:53,960
If you finish the task earlier

917
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,960
you can go back to Xiling earlier

918
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,960
to see your mother

919
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,960
Qingyang Princess's birthday

920
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,960
Qingyang Princess

921
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,960
Qingyang Princess

922
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,960
Qingyang Princess

923
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,960
Qingyang Princess

924
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:53,960
Qingyang Princess

925
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:55,960
Qingyang Princess

926
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,960
Qingyang Princess

927
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,960
Qingyang Princess

928
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,960
Qingyang Princess

929
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,960
Qingyang Princess

930
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:05,960
Qingyang Princess

931
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:07,960
Qingyang Princess

932
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:09,960
Qingyang Princess

933
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,960
Qingyang Princess

934
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,960
Look at that person

935
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,960
A dream

936
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,960
No more face

937
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:19,960
No more regret

938
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Stay by your side

939
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,960
Qingyang Princess

940
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,960
Qingyang Princess

941
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:47,960
Qingyang Princess

942
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:49,960
Qingyang Princess

943
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:51,960
Qingyang Princess

944
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,960
Qingyang Princess

945
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,960
Qingyang Princess

946
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,960
Qingyang Princess

947
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:59,960
Qingyang Princess

948
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Qingyang Princess

949
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,960
Qingyang Princess

950
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:05,960
