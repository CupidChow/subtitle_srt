6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
A Yan.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You are not happy?

8
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Tomorrow is Qingyang's birthday party.

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The kitchen prepared a lot of beautiful wine for the party.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I stole two bottles.

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Do you want to drink?

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you.

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I don't have parents,

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
and I haven't celebrated my birthday.

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
What about you?

17
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I have parents,

18
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
but I haven't celebrated my birthday.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I haven't celebrated my birthday.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I heard He Zhou tell your story.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Zhang Ming said

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
some people are destined to be unable to put their love in the hand.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But I think

24
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
love can't be hidden.

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
A Yan,

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
do you think the love Qingyang had for you before

27
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
is real?

28
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Is it possible that what he said to you in the end was a lie?

29
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Have you ever thought about asking again?

30
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You have so many questions.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But you can't answer any of them.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm going to find Zhang Ming.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He can always give me a lot of answers.

34
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I can kiss your wound.

35
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Don't waste it.

36
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I'm sorry.

38
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You drank.

39
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You said

40
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
you only used me.

41
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You never loved me.

42
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
But you said

43
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
you only used me.

44
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
You said

45
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
you only used me.

46
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You said

47
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
you only used me.

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
But you really liked me.

49
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I really liked you.

50
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm asking you one last time.

51
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Can you not lie to me?

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you dare to tell the truth,

53
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm willing to help you.

54
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
No matter how many times you ask me,

55
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
my answer is the same.

56
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You're just a knife to me.

57
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
A tool that can make me live better.

58
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Of course,

59
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I need you now.

60
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you're willing to help me,

61
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I can continue to pretend to like you.

62
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Even after I marry Zhang Ming,

63
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I can continue to...

64
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Enough!

65
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
You really have no heart.

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You drank.

70
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I drank.

71
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I drank such a big pot.

72
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
How did you do it?

73
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I fell.

74
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Why did you fall so badly?

75
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Because I'm a pig.

76
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Pigs are good at rolling.

77
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
This is

78
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
a wedding gift I've been preparing for a long time.

79
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The material used is

80
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
the hairpin you helped me win.

81
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Inside,

82
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
there's my own name tag.

83
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I didn't want to give it to you.

84
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
But after thinking about it,

85
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I decided to give it to you.

86
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm sorry.

87
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I'll give it to you.

89
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Henni and Qingyang.

90
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
He Zhou said you've been

91
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
secretly doing something lately.

92
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It seems like you're doing something.

93
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
So you're doing this.

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Do you like it?

95
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I like it.

96
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's good that you like it.

97
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Chu,

98
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I'm sorry.

99
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I'm sorry.

100
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Don't drink so much in the future.

101
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Okay?

102
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
But if I don't drink so much,

103
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I won't have the courage to give it to you.

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
What is this?

105
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
This?

106
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
This is

107
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
the most popular embroidery style recently.

108
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Is it good?

109
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You're drunk.

110
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'll send you back.

111
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Are you cold?

112
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Then hold me tight.

113
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
If only this road could be longer.

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Zhao Ming,

115
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
in the future,

116
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,000
I hope you can be healthy.

117
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Thank you for holding this birthday banquet for me.

118
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I propose a toast to the Holy Ruler.

119
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Please.

120
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Please.

121
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I'd like to present a dance to you

122
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
to express my gratitude.

123
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I've been dancing since I was a child.

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
This dance is very famous

125
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
in our West Forest.

126
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I'm looking forward to it.

127
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Thank you.

128
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Good.

129
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Good.

130
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Good.

131
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Qingyang, what are you doing?

132
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Kneel down.

133
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Qingyang, how dare you assassinate the Holy Ruler?

134
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
This is treason.

135
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
You can't be forgiven.

136
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
The West Forest King is difficult to lead the state.

137
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
He's been executed.

138
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
The second Dong Yun

139
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
is a person who is kind and discreet

140
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and betrays his own friends.

141
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
This has nothing to do with me.

142
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
How dare you raise the Holy Ruler's name?

143
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Take him away.

144
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Yes.

145
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Go.

146
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Zhao Ming,

147
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
you can't be punished.

148
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Zhao Ming,

149
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
you can't kill me.

150
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm the king of West Forest.

151
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
There are tens of thousands of West Forest soldiers

152
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
waiting for me behind me.

153
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
The West Forest Army is united with the princess

154
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
to assassinate him.

155
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Everyone can't tell the difference.

156
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
From the law and the Qin's forest,

157
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I can kill you.

158
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
The people have their own justice.

159
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
The war has just started.

160
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I believe that the soldiers of West Forest

161
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
won't be so cruel to the king

162
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
for such a despicable king.

163
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you don't kill him,

164
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
you'll be in trouble with Dong Ze.

165
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Take him away.

166
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Yes.

167
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Go.

168
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Zhao Ming,

169
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
you can't kill me.

170
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Are you okay?

171
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm fine.

172
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
The West Forest Army is crazy.

173
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
They are too bold.

174
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
That's right.

175
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
How will the Holy Ruler deal with them?

176
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
The assassinator is Shen Sui.

177
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You know better than me.

178
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
But there is one thing

179
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
that you should go and see.

180
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I shouldn't have done this.

182
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You really don't have a heart.

183
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The whole life of the Holy Ruler

184
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
is enough

185
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
for this moment.

186
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You said

187
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
you only loved me.

188
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
You never loved me.

189
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
But I'm glad

190
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
that you love me.

191
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll ask you one last time.

192
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll ask you one last time.

193
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Can you not lie to me?

194
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Let me go.

195
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Let me go.

196
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
What are you doing here?

197
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Go.

198
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
No.

199
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You still won't tell the truth.

200
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
Right?

201
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
You come to ask me these questions

202
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,840
When did you become so crazy?

203
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,120
To deal with a lunatic like you

204
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,640
you have to use the method of madness

205
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,160
Is the answer that important?

206
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes

207
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,640
I told you

208
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,160
no matter when

209
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,160
the answer is the same

210
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,560
Go

211
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,160
Go

212
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,240
You are not afraid of death

213
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,360
but you take the better life as an excuse to push me away

214
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,800
Do you think I will believe it?

215
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,720
I used you at that time

216
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,520
Don't be self-righteous

217
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,400
I saw Tiantian was happy just now

218
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,120
That is the treasure of the inner circle

219
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
So you hid it

220
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,760
right?

221
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,960
You are right

222
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
I am a fool

223
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,800
I can't see clearly what you did

224
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,560
and what you said are all intentional

225
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,360
Intentionally push me away

226
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,760
You want me to give up

227
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
Because you know

228
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
as long as Xiling King is alive

229
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,720
he will not really let you go

230
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,640
He will always use you to control me

231
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,520
until I die

232
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,720
right?

233
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:34,920
Yes

234
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,760
Do you think it is meaningful to ask these questions now?

235
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,720
Today, this Kunqu

236
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,080
Qingyang must die

237
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,800
Then I will die with you

238
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,680
I don't need it

239
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,200
This is my vow

240
00:18:59,160 --> 00:18:59,840
Yan

241
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,720
will always guard the princess

242
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,360
It is a vow that I swore in my heart

243
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,840
These few years after leaving Xiling

244
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,480
I am the master

245
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,200
But today

246
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,060
I will not leave

247
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,020
Xin Song

248
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:34,200
I don't need to ask the moon for love.

249
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,200
I'll go through the years of love.

250
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I believe.

251
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,200
I believe.

252
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,200
I believe.

253
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,200
I believe.

254
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,200
I believe.

255
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
I believe.

256
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
I believe.

257
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,200
I believe.

258
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,200
I believe.

259
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,200
I believe.

260
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I believe.

261
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,200
I believe.

262
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,200
I believe.

263
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,200
I believe.

264
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,200
I believe.

265
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
I believe.

266
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
I believe.

267
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
I believe.

268
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,200
I believe.

269
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
I believe.

270
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
I believe.

271
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,540
I believe.

272
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:35,180
I've been waiting for you for a long time

273
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,740
I've been waiting for you for a long time

274
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,700
From now on,

275
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:43,220
I'll never see you again

276
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,340
I'll never see you again

277
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,460
Is this a letter?

278
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:51,660
I'll always be by your side

279
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,660
Sometimes it is

280
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,560
Chengzhi

281
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:02,340
Did it say God Dao Tianming is present?

282
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:03,920
This,

283
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,700
it didn't

284
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:11,120
The change is fate

285
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,120
I won't wait anymore

286
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,680
Go over everywhere into the mortal world

287
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,060
It doesn't matter if you shoot poison or float

288
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,420
This disaster

289
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,620
Hurry up

290
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,180
Stop

291
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,380
Speak

292
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:29,680
trillion

293
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,500
Go

294
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,260
Go

295
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,580
There is a trap

296
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:47,400
No

297
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,980
What is it?

298
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,820
Go

299
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,420
line up for all the lift you can!

300
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,980
Your High Concentration!

301
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,020
The lift of the god

302
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,380
shall give 3,000 men and women.

303
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,320
Holy supers fully laugh

304
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,340
to give you

305
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,940
3,000 men and women!

306
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,580
He's a Statesman.

307
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,740
Such a bandit!

308
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,420
Why?

309
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:05,940
Why?

310
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,840
He's for killing him.

311
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,720
Geez, get out of here.

312
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Not forct或 serving the Khan.

313
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,920
Don't kill him, please!

314
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,120
He's moron!

315
00:22:11,140 --> 00:22:12,480
Easy, easy.

316
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,820
Stop it, easy!

317
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,380
Oh gosh,

318
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,080
player Chang Sullivan!

319
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:23,420
The war was over

320
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:25,420
The army returned to the city

321
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,420
The people welcomed them

322
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,420
It's only been a few days

323
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,420
But it's like this

324
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:33,420
They might have forgotten

325
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:35,420
Who is protecting them?

326
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,420
What are you doing?

327
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,420
This is for the city

328
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,420
What are you doing?

329
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,420
This is for the city

330
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,420
That chicken is mine

331
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,420
That duck is mine

332
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,420
I'm so hungry

333
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,420
Me too

334
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,420
I swear that I will go to the hospital

335
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:29,420
With these dead people

336
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,420
The people are living in a dead end

337
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Dead things?

338
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,420
This is disrespectful!

339
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,420
Go away

340
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,420
Who do you think you are talking to?

341
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,420
I don't care who you are

342
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,420
The world is in our hands

343
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,420
It's not true

344
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
It's not true

345
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
It's not true

346
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
It's not true

347
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,420
It's not true

348
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,420
Hierarch

349
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,420
What do you want from us?

350
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:49,420
It's not true

351
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,420
It's not true

352
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,420
Help!

353
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,420
The death of the Emperor!

354
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,420
Be careful!

355
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:01,420
We can't die!

356
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,420
We can't die!

357
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,420
Why?

358
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:06,420
God will punish us!

359
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,420
God will punish us!

360
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,420
Lord Zhao Ming!

361
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,420
The child!

362
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,420
Dong Ze is in danger.

363
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,420
You can't even eat your own parents and children.

364
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,420
What kind of life is this child?

365
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,420
We can't die!

366
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,420
We can't die!

367
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,420
Mother!

368
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,420
Mother!

369
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,420
You are so greedy.

370
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:41,420
Please arrest the children of Tong Nan secretly.

371
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
Please spare us, Lord.

372
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,420
We are also following orders.

373
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:47,420
The arrest of Tong Nan's children has already begun in various villages.

374
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,420
It's not the only place.

375
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,420
No!

376
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,420
Please spare us, Lord.

377
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,420
He Zhou!

378
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,420
Send 3,000 Tong Nan's children to the palace immediately.

379
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,420
Yes!

380
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:05,420
You sent Tong Nan's children to the palace to protect them, right?

381
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
Only in this way,

382
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:10,420
they won't be caught by others.

383
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:14,420
Your people have made you sad.

384
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,420
Are you angry with them?

385
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
They are just afraid.

386
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
They have no other skills other than me.

387
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:28,420
They can't practice.

388
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,420
Facing the disaster of Yuan Chao's own power,

389
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:33,420
they will be afraid and blind.

390
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,420
They will be afraid and blind.

391
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,420
They will be afraid and blind.

392
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,420
They will be afraid and blind.

393
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,420
They will be full of resentment and even do wrong things.

394
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:47,420
I admit that I have been disappointed.

395
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,420
But I won't give up.

396
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,420
I know.

397
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:55,420
In your eyes, it's not just one person, one thing.

398
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:59,420
There are also people and things in the world.

399
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,420
I remember that you once told me

400
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,420
that people are simple and complicated.

401
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:07,420
They are very simple and simple.

402
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,420
They can also be very hard.

403
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,420
There is one thing that I have never told you.

404
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,420
Actually,

405
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,420
I already know that I am a chaos pearl.

406
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,420
When did you know?

407
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:27,420
But I want to be the pearl that stays by Zhaoming's side.

408
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,420
Do you know why I came to the mortal world?

409
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,420
I want to see you.

410
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:40,420
I want to see you.

411
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,420
It's not just a matter of being with you.

412
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:45,420
It's also a matter of being with you.

413
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,420
If you don't want to see me,

414
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,420
you have to stay with me.

415
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,420
I have to see you.

416
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,420
I have to see you.

417
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,420
I have to see you.

418
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,420
I will let you see me.

419
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,420
I will let you see me.

420
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,420
I and the existence of the Heaven's Book

421
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:08,420
are just to maintain the order and operation of the world.

422
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:11,420
As for the life and death of all living things in the world,

423
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
the air and the moon and the stars,

424
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,420
it has nothing to do with us.

425
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,420
I am in contact with the world.

426
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
It's you.

427
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:22,420
It's you who taught me

428
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,420
what is human,

429
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,420
what is love,

430
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
what is protection.

431
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,420
Protect?

432
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,420
When the same man and woman enter the palace,

433
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,420
I will protect them with you.

434
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,420
Just like what you said.

435
00:28:42,420 --> 00:28:44,420
The nature of protection.

436
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:51,420
Lord He Zhou,

437
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,420
we found some new gods again.

438
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,420
The four men and two women

439
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,420
were all born in the year of Cang Hao.

440
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,420
Come with me.

441
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
My mother said that

442
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:02,420
the Holy Queen can't go home anymore.

443
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:03,420
What's so sad about it?

444
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,420
It's a good thing to be able to be

445
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,420
honored by the nine gods.

446
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,420
Being a god will be a trap.

447
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,420
We will die.

448
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,420
Don't talk nonsense.

449
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,420
It's not death.

450
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,420
It's just leaving the mortal body

451
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,420
and going to the Heaven Realm to serve the gods.

452
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,420
The Holy King ordered us

453
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,420
to take good care of these children.

454
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,420
Yes.

455
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Did the Holy King ask me not to die?

456
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,420
Don't misunderstand him, child.

457
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,420
The Holy King was born by the will of the Heaven.

458
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:30,420
He shouldn't have been involved in this world's rebellion.

459
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:32,420
But I've been in the Holy King's body for more than ten years.

460
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
Every day,

461
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,420
he's not worrying about

462
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,420
an ordinary person like you and me.

463
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,420
Didn't your village

464
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:41,420
receive his protection and grace?

465
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,420
Even if it's the Holy King,

466
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,420
he's not the only one who's worried about you.

467
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,420
He's the only one who's worried about you.

468
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,420
Even if the Holy King is the Holy King,

469
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,420
there are also difficulties for him.

470
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,420
But we have to believe him.

471
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:54,420
He will give us the best time.

472
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,420
What's the purpose of the God's summoning?

473
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:01,420
I want you to help the King Zhaoming

474
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,420
become the strongest in the world.

475
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:06,420
Zhaoming is determined to serve the gods.

476
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:09,420
Helping him is like destroying the Heaven Realm.

477
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,420
Now the two realms are in chaos.

478
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:12,420
The gods are fighting with each other.

479
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,420
The four times are lost.

480
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,420
The disaster is raging.

481
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,420
You're not enough to carry out the God's spell.

482
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:22,420
You can't be the strongest in the world.

483
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,420
You can't be the strongest in the world.

484
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:28,420
God wants to turn the world around himself.

485
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,420
He wants to turn the world around himself.

486
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,420
It's better to reopen than to make up for it.

487
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
What's the reopen?

488
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,420
You'll know when it's reopened.

489
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:42,420
Go.

490
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,420
Your Majesty, the state preceptor is back.

491
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,420
The state preceptor has been away from the palace for days.

492
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,420
Now he's back.

493
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:06,420
Is he someone who cares about the palace

494
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:08,420
and the people in the palace?

495
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,420
I care about the people in the palace?

496
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:13,420
I'm not a person who cares about the people in the palace.

497
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,420
I care about the will of the Holy Ruler.

498
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,420
The God's Sword.

499
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,420
The Holy Ruler was born with a divine aura.

500
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,420
He's a man of the aura of the human king.

501
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,420
If we can make the God's Sword recognize the Lord,

502
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,420
we can fight against the gods.

503
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:34,420
I've broken the God's Sword's spell.

504
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:36,420
I've been to the entrance of the turtle cave.

505
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:40,420
But I can only sense the strong sword aura.

506
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,420
I can't make the God's Sword show up.

507
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:50,420
I've been away from the palace for days

508
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,420
and I've been searching for ancient weapons.

509
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,420
I've found a record.

510
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,420
The God's Sword is made of red-striped sand.

511
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:00,420
If you want to lure it out,

512
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,420
you need to use the sand aura.

513
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Use the sand aura?

514
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,420
The Holy Ruler can use human blood as a weapon.

515
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:12,420
But I can use other people's blood.

516
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,420
Thank you for your advice.

517
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Will you stay in the palace this time?

518
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:28,420
No.

519
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:33,420
I'll meet the Holy Ruler.

520
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,420
I want to leave the palace for a few days.

521
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:12,420
To do what?

522
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,420
Go to meet my husband.

523
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
When should I depart?

524
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Today.

525
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:24,420
At this moment.

526
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
I'll go with you.

527
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,420
No.

528
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,420
I want to go with you.

529
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,420
I'm not going with you.

530
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,420
It's not a big deal.

531
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,420
I'll go with you.

532
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,420
I'll go with you.

533
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:39,420
No, I'll go alone.

534
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,420
It's dangerous to return to the capital.

535
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
How can you go alone?

536
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,420
I'll go with you.

537
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,420
I've decided.

538
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,420
But Your Majesty...

539
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,420
You stay in the palace

540
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:48,420
and protect the children.

541
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,420
Don't let anything happen to them.

542
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,420
Okay.

543
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,420
I'll stay in the palace

544
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
and wait for you

545
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,420
to come back.

546
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,420
Take care of yourself.

547
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,420
I'll be back in ten days.

548
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,420
Don't worry about doing what you want to do.

549
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,420
I'll do my best to protect this place.

550
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
I believe you.

551
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,420
I'll do my best to protect this place.

552
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,420
I'll do my best to protect this place.

553
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
I believe you.

554
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Me too.

555
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
I'm leaving.

556
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:07,420
You've almost turned the book upside down.

557
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,420
What are you looking for?

558
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,420
I'm a Chaos Bead.

559
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,420
How can I have no power of chaos?

560
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,420
When you were just transformed,

561
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,420
we were also very confused.

562
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,420
The Holy Lord said

563
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,420
you should be the one who could fill the sky

564
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
and use up your spiritual power.

565
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,420
Although he gave you a broken soul,

566
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,420
but for ancient magic,

567
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:28,420
it's also weak.

568
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:32,420
Is there no way to recover quickly?

569
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:33,420
The matter of the artifact

570
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
is more mysterious than the matter of the gods.

571
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,420
Don't worry too much.

572
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,420
The palace has been strengthened.

573
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,420
I'll go and look for it.

574
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:45,420
A'Zhu,

575
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,420
you seem to be a little different now.

576
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,420
Different?

577
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,420
You seem to be more and more like the Holy Lord.

578
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,420
But don't learn from him.

579
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,420
The Holy Lord is not here.

580
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:03,420
You have to take care of yourself.

581
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:21,420
How can I help Zhao Min?

582
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,420
If I can recover all my memories,

583
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,420
can I recover the power of chaos?

584
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,420
Can I recover the power of chaos?

585
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Brother A'Yan.

586
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Xiao Che.

587
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,420
Brother A'Yan.

588
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,420
Give it to me.

589
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,420
Brother A'Yan,

590
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,420
this is the film you gave me yesterday.

591
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,420
There are two pieces left.

592
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,420
I'll return it to you.

593
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Why don't you keep it yourself?

594
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,420
No need.

595
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,420
I'm going to the palace with them today.

596
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,420
The Holy Lord lied to us that he would give us a chance.

597
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,420
He secretly left the palace and went to the temple.

598
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,420
We are going to find the Holy Master

599
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:21,420
and go to give him a chance immediately.

600
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,420
I heard that there is plenty of water and food in the palace.

601
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:24,420
It can also be brought back

602
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,420
to ease the pain in front of everyone.

603
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:26,420
Brother A'Yan,

604
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:27,420
do you want to go with us?

605
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,420
Who is spreading the rumors?

606
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,420
This is not a rumor.

607
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,420
It was said by the official in the palace.

608
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,420
If you want to live, you can only depend on yourself.

609
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,420
If you want to go together,

610
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,420
then meet me in the palace.

611
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,420
I'm leaving, Brother A'Yan.

612
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,420
If you are worried about the illness in the palace,

613
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,420
I'll go with you.

614
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:57,420
You stay here

615
00:37:58,420 --> 00:37:59,420
to take care of your mother.

616
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,420
A'Yan,

617
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
Zhang Ming is not only your Holy Lord,

618
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
but also my benefactor.

619
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,420
If he didn't solve it for me,

620
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,420
we would have been dead long ago,

621
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,420
right?

622
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,420
The Holy Family gave me the poison.

623
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:16,420
They let you kill me?

624
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,420
Then why didn't you listen to them

625
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,420
and tell me instead?

626
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,420
I'm not that careless.

627
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,420
I did want to kill you.

628
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,420
But even if I could kill you,

629
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,420
this kind of life would not end.

630
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:32,420
My whole life

631
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
will be a burden controlled by them.

632
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,420
And my mother

633
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,420
will also be abused

634
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,420
and never see the sun again.

635
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,420
Qingyang wants to seek the Holy Lord.

636
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,420
By my order,

637
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,420
I want to

638
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,420
exchange my mother's safety

639
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,420
and freedom.

640
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,420
If you want to break the game,

641
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,420
you can

642
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:05,420
kill me.

643
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,420
But you have to kill me

644
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,420
in front of everyone

645
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,420
at your birthday banquet.

646
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,420
Till death do us part.

647
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,420
And then...

648
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,420
Zhang Ming has told me everything.

649
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,420
This is the fire-proof stone.

650
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
It can protect you from the fire.

651
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:26,420
But after today,

652
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,420
there will be no Princess Qingyang in this world.

653
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
Princess Qingyang should have died long ago.

654
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,420
You are

655
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,420
a different person.

656
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,420
If there are more days,

657
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:38,420
I will definitely want to be your friend.

658
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,420
If there is still a chance,

659
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,420
I want to get to know you again.

660
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,420
I also want to thank Zhu.

661
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,420
The blood of the Goddess

662
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,420
can help me solve the poison.

663
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,420
It's her blood

664
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,420
that helped me and my mother

665
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,420
to save us.

666
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,420
If we are to talk about our love,

667
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,420
it should be you who stays and I go.

668
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,420
Maybe

669
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:09,420
I can't beat you.

670
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,420
Don't play tricks on me.

671
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:15,420
We have a deal.

672
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,420
No matter what happens,

673
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,420
we have to face it together.

674
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,420
Okay.

675
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,420
We respect the Goddess.

676
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:30,420
We will never let you down.

677
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,420
We respect the Goddess.

678
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:33,420
We will never let you down.

679
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
We respect the Goddess.

680
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,420
Where are they?

681
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,420
I can't stand the考验不挑索.

682
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,420
I just arranged a few people

683
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:43,420
to burn the bones.

684
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:47,420
There are so many people joining.

685
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
It's so stupid and ridiculous.

686
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,420
The bottom of the house is full of blood.

687
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,420
That's great.

688
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,420
I really want to see

689
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,420
how Zhao Ming will react

690
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,420
when he sees the traitor

691
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,420
who killed his own guardian.

692
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
It's coming.

693
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,420
Where are the people you arranged?

694
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:10,420
We can sell Zhao Ming.

695
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,420
Those two leaders.

696
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,420
They sold the soul to me

697
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,420
for a few bags of rice.

698
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,420
They are no longer

699
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,420
ordinary people.

700
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:21,420
They are ordinary people

701
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,420
who I defeated.

702
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,420
I guess I have no chance

703
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,420
to defeat Zhao Ming.

704
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,420
But I have more chance

705
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
to defeat ordinary people.

706
00:41:44,420 --> 00:41:46,420
You broke into the palace

707
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,420
without permission

708
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,420
without permission.

709
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,420
We agreed to sacrifice our lives.

710
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,420
But the Huo Army

711
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:52,420
lied to us.

712
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,420
They told us to listen to them.

713
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,420
They thought we were fools.

714
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,420
You…

715
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,420
I'll wait here.

716
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:57,420
You should leave now.

717
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,420
I'll go to Yuan Bing.

718
00:41:58,420 --> 00:41:59,420
You should go to the city

719
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,420
to protect the child.

720
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:01,420
Be careful.

721
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
She is the bride of the Huo Army.

722
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
She must know where the Goddess is.

723
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:06,420
Catch her.

724
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:07,420
Catch her.

725
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Catch her.

726
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:09,420
Give her to the Goddess.

727
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:10,420
Catch her.

728
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,420
Give her to the Goddess.

729
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:12,420
Catch her.

730
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,420
Catch her.

731
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:14,420
Catch her.

732
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,420
Catch her.

733
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,420
Catch her.

734
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,420
Catch her.

735
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
Catch her.

736
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,420
Do you see?

737
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:43,420
This is the nature of human.

738
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,420
Catch her.

739
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
Catch her.

740
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,420
Catch her.

741
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,420
Catch her.

742
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,420
Catch her.

743
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Catch her.

744
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,420
Catch her.

745
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,420
Can you calm down?

746
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,420
The God's weapon

747
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,420
can't interfere with the human world.

748
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
Then you just watch here.

749
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,420
You lost.

750
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,420
The third bet.

751
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,420
Human nature is selfish.

752
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:14,420
You should take the bet.

753
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
According to the bet,

754
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,420
you should go back with me.

755
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,420
The God's weapon can't interfere with the human world.

756
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
Then you just watch here.

757
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
