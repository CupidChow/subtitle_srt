Episode 16

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
The days are getting worse.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Grandpa, I'm hungry.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
I don't understand.

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
No.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
How can the good days be like this?

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Who knows?

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Give me some rice.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
We don't have rice here.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
We don't have rice here.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Look, I have soup.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
This is still vegetable soup.

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
We haven't eaten for days.

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Nowadays,

19
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we fight every day.

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can't supply food.

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
We can't even buy rice.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If it wasn't for those divine jade,

23
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
so many things would have happened.

24
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's right.

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I heard that

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
the Southern Yuan State is also in a mess

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
because of the divine jade.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But these are all

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
the affairs of the officials.

30
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What are they?

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Don't spread it.

32
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Lord Shen Shi,

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
according to the divine jade,

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
there are a lot of fresh grass

35
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
on the forest hill of the Southern Yuan tribe.

36
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Can you really help me

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
to make the elixir of life?

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
The divine jade will be burnt

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
when it falls from the sky.

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
If you don't know how to act,

41
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
you will defy the divine jade.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I dare not.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I dare not.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It's just that

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
in order to avoid the gold mine,

46
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I have sent troops to attack other tribes.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
If we attack the Southern Yuan now,

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm afraid that we don't have enough troops.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You don't cherish the chance of a lifetime.

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you don't cherish it,

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
then you can give it to others.

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No, no, no.

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Calm down.

54
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will go to recruit troops to buy horses.

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I will definitely take back the elixir of the Southern Yuan.

56
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
If it doesn't work,

57
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I will marry my useless daughter Qingyang

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
to other small states to exchange for military aid.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The process is not important.

60
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Just get the result.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
As you wish.

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Lord,

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Princess Qingyang has been waiting outside for a long time.

64
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Bring her in.

65
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Yes.

66
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Father,

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Mother has been sick for a long time.

68
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Please continue to bring her in.

69
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The elixir is for the elixir.

70
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
She is a sick girl.

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
She doesn't deserve to be used.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's okay.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Don't bother me.

74
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Get lost.

75
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Go.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Go.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Go.

78
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Yan,

79
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
thank you

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
for this trip.

81
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's my duty.

82
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
According to the investigation,

83
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
it's not as expected by the Holy King.

84
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
But there are spies behind the scenes

85
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
controlling the states.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
They are also the vanguards of the Divine Court.

87
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
The gods are using the states to attack me.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because of the emergency,

89
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the war in the east

90
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
is not suitable for the gods.

91
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
According to the investigation,

92
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
the Eastern Ze clan of the Lian clan

93
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
is going to the states to fight.

94
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Send more troops to protect the weak tribes.

95
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
If there are any more people

96
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
colluding with the gods,

97
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
don't worry.

98
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

99
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Now the wars in the states are starting.

100
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
There is still no sign of the invader.

101
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
The gods haven't calmed down.

102
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The invaders are getting up again.

103
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
There are many people

104
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
who are so blind.

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
They are not able to

106
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
use the power.

107
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Gods.

108
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Gods.

109
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Gods.

110
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Your Highness.

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
There are gods.

112
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
There are gods in the palace.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The gods have brought the divine decree.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
They said they would seal the gods for the Holy Ruler.

115
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Our people

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
are going to have gods too.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Divine decree

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
is just a piece of paper.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The Holy Ruler should think twice.

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
The gods are so proud of you.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You just need to follow the divine decree

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
to give the three thousand men and women in the world

123
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the throne.

124
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You are so proud.

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Why don't you just follow the decree?

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You dare destroy the divine decree?

127
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I have said that

128
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
if Dong Ze doesn't accept the divine decree,

129
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will be more careless.

130
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You are so ungrateful.

131
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Now the wars in the states

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
are killing more than three thousand people.

133
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You are just giving away three thousand children.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are they

135
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
more important

136
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
than those who died in the wars?

137
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The gods

138
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
don't understand the meaning of life at all.

139
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
They don't understand the meaning of life at all.

140
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't want to drink

141
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and eat.

142
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Give me the military order.

143
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
From today on,

144
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the gods will enter Dong Ze.

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Kill them.

146
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes.

147
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Who dares?

148
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You are just following the divine decree

149
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
and don't respect the gods.

150
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I will kill you.

151
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are just following the divine decree.

152
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Zhao Min,

153
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
you will pay for this.

154
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
There are people in this world who are not grateful to the gods.

155
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
This hard bone

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
makes things complicated.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But it's also interesting.

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you can't beat the mountain and fight the tiger,

159
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
you can kill them with a sword.

160
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The gods are limited in the mortal world.

161
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You can't kill them.

162
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But if

163
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
the states he protected

164
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
rise up

165
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
and seek for the public support,

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:37,000
the

167
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Zhao Min has sent the envoys

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
to fight the war

169
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
under the balance of the soft and hard sword.

170
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
under the balance of the soft and hard sword.

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
under the balance of the soft and hard sword.

172
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Now,

173
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I want them to

174
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Now,

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I want them to

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
fight against Zhao Min.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm afraid it's not easy.

178
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
People have endless thoughts.

179
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
The king of Xiling wants to have a baby.

180
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
If you give the child of the wind god to him,

181
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
just to kill the wind,

182
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
then the war fire

183
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
will be lit.

184
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I like the war fire the most.

185
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
This world

186
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
should be

187
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
a place where the gods can rest.

188
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Don't worry too much.

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Although the states are in a state of chaos,

190
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
our border guards are well trained

191
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
and full of fighting power.

192
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
They can suppress the enemy.

193
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The human race is born from the same root.

194
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Now we have to fight on the battlefield

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and meet each other.

196
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
The gods are so vicious.

197
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Besides,

198
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
the current situation is strange.

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The states are changing.

200
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It must be the gods behind the control of the layout.

201
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's why the war fire is so fierce.

202
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Your Majesty.

203
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
The spy of the flying pigeon

204
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
claimed that the king of Xiling was killed.

205
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
He has gathered the armies of the tribes

206
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and formed a strong army.

207
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He is coming to the east border.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
This battle

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
is a battle between the inner and inner wars.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
The gods are fighting against each other.

211
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The state is already at a loss

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
in the battle.

213
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
If we send the strong soldiers of the east to fight,

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
even if the army of the east is strong,

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I'm afraid it's not enough to calm down.

216
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You go to inform the generals

217
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
to set up the troops and go out at any time.

218
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Yes.

219
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Zhao Ming.

220
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Zhu.

221
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Why are you here?

222
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I can't eat alone.

223
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want you to eat with me.

224
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
You said you wanted me to eat with you.

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Actually, you came to eat with me.

226
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
As expected.

227
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You are so kind.

228
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm so happy.

229
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm so happy.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm so happy.

231
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm so happy.

232
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
As expected.

233
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Nothing can be hidden from you.

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I still have a lot of principles that I haven't learned.

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
But I know

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
if people don't eat well,

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
their body will collapse.

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
If your body collapses,

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
what should those who need you do?

240
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
So you have to fill your stomach first.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Then you can have the strength to fight.

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Zhu is right.

243
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Zhu.

244
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
The war is on.

245
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I will clear the city today.

246
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Clear the city?

247
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I heard people say that

248
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
the king's clear the city

249
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
is different from the general's.

250
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Do you

251
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
have to go?

252
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
The way of the army

253
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
is one in strategy and the other in mind.

254
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
This battle

255
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is not only with the battle of people,

256
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
but also with the battle of gods.

257
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have to go

258
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
and I have to win.

259
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
This battle

260
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
is not only with the battle of people,

261
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
but also with the battle of gods.

262
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I have to go

263
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
and I have to win.

264
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Why are you not upset?

265
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Are you worried

266
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
or not willing to give up?

267
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,580
Give up?

268
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
He hasn't given up.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
W Study

270
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
You want to know

271
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
what exactly

272
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Love is a desire or a motivation?

273
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
As long as I think of her,

274
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
we will never be apart.

275
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
No matter what happens,

276
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
I will always be with you.

277
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Please forgive me,

278
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
I will bring her back to the altar as soon as possible.

279
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I will not let anything happen to her.

280
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
The death of the Thunder is just a warning.

281
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Love is a desire,

282
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
and the law of the heavens will be enforced.

283
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
The laws of the heavens cannot be broken.

284
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If we cannot stop the movement of the Soul-guarding Bead,

285
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
we will destroy it without a word.

286
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I will not let you do that.

287
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I will not let you do that.

288
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I will not let you do that.

289
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will not let you do that.

290
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I will not let you do that.

291
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Although you have been destroyed,

292
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
you have been indifferent to everything for a while.

293
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
But you are a little bit lost today.

294
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
But you love her.

295
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I love you.

296
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
You finally wake up.

297
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Zhaoming.

298
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You are going to go out of the battle soon.

299
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Don't waste your spiritual power on me.

300
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
You have been exhausted for a long time.

301
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Your body will be damaged.

302
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The medicine of the Yuyi's Ningshen Drug may not be useful.

303
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It will be more effective to reduce your spiritual power.

304
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Who said that the medicine of the Yuyi's Ningshen Drug will not be useful?

305
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I feel much better now.

306
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Besides, I am not struck by lightning.

307
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
The State Preceptor helped me to block it.

308
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,000
They say that bad people are struck by lightning.

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I feel much better now.

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
But this experience is strange.

311
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I have been thinking about it for a long time.

312
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I have sent people to investigate the hidden thunder in Linglong Hall.

313
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Zhu, if the weather is good,

314
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
you should go out less often.

315
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,000
You must be careful during my time in the capital.

316
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
If you are not at ease,

317
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,000
let me go with you.

318
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Zhu, sometimes, you should not block the thunder in front of you

319
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
or walk together to protect it.

320
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Do you know that the motivation to fight in the front

321
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
is from the friends behind you?

322
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
As long as the friends behind you are safe,

323
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,000
the soldiers can fully invest in

324
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
fighting against the enemies in front of them.

325
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
It seems that the soldiers have protected the friends.

326
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
But in fact,

327
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
they are also the soldiers who are protected by friends.

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I hope that you can stay in the palace

329
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
and protect me well.

330
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I protect you?

331
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Then how long will it take you to come back?

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I will come back safely

333
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
before you finish eating this candy.

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I will let A Yan stay in the palace.

335
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,000
You can find him in any situation.

336
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Zhang Ming, starting tomorrow,

337
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I will learn archery.

338
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Learn archery?

339
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I don't want to be a pearl

340
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
that fainted after being struck by a thunder.

341
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I also don't want to be a pearl

342
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
that needs A Yan's help in everything.

343
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Since I have decided to protect you,

344
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I must have the power to protect you.

345
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Compared to when you just woke up,

346
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
you are different.

347
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
People will grow up.

348
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Although the pearls will not grow up,

349
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
they will still be visible.

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I will be able to see them clearly.

351
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
But I will also understand a lot of principles.

352
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Zhang Ming, your back

353
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
will be safe and sound.

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I will be waiting for you.

355
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
But why is every day so long?

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
It's so long that I have read a lot of novels,

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
eaten a lot of desserts,

358
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
and written a lot of words.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
It's still not over.

360
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
This should be the idiom you taught me.

361
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
It's all the same.

362
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Your candy has been eaten up.

363
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,000
But it still hasn't come back.

364
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It's not over.

365
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
I still have one left.

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Half a month ago, there was only one left.

367
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
You don't dare to eat it.

368
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
You're afraid it won't come back.

369
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It will come back.

370
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
I buried this jade pen

371
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
to let you write your own life.

372
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Not like this now,

373
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
to let others take your life.

374
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What do you mean by that?

375
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Wait for me to go to a place.

376
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:07,000
When you get there, you will know everything.

377
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
This is...

378
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Zhao Ming's secret room.

379
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Do you really know Zhao Ming?

380
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
In order to protect the people,

381
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Zhao Ming wanted to fight against the gods.

382
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
This is something you and I have known for a long time.

383
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
That's right.

384
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Fighting against the gods is indeed not fake.

385
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But what if you use it to sacrifice others?

386
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Even if Zhao Ming is a man of great power,

387
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
he will still be a man of great power.

388
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If you want to fight against him,

389
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
even if Zhao Ming is born with a great power,

390
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
fighting against the gods is not easy.

391
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
You can only fight against him with the power of the gods.

392
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
The Chaos Bead is the only way

393
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
for him to get it.

394
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
And you...

395
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
are the Chaos Bead.

396
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Do you want to know the whole story?

397
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
When the world first opened,

398
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
the two great gods of the world were in full bloom.

399
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The two great gods were in full bloom.

400
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
The two great gods were in full bloom.

401
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The Chaos Bead

402
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,000
and the Destiny Book.

403
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,000
So, Zhao Ming brought you back to the world

404
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,000
just to use your power of the Chaos Bead to fight against the gods.

405
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,000
The so-called saving you

406
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
is just to push you into the next game.

407
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
But I don't remember what you said.

408
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
I only know that it was Zhao Ming who woke me up.

409
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,000
It was him who brought me a lot of warmth and happiness.

410
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:02,000
What Chaos Bead, what Ancient God Qi.

411
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
I am just a useless person without power.

412
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
I just want to be a good person and stay by Zhao Ming's side.

413
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Nothing else matters.

414
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Even my own life doesn't matter?

415
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
You already fell in love with Zhao Ming.

416
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
The thunder is warning you.

417
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The God Qi can't have feelings.

418
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
It can't be patient.

419
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Otherwise, it will be destroyed by the world.

420
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
For now,

421
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:38,000
you should come back to the God Pool with me

422
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
to cut off your feelings.

423
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Continue to be the God Qi of the same life as the heavens.

424
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Only in this way can you be free.

425
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I won't go back.

426
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I already began to feel something.

427
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
How can I be willing to go back

428
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
and live such a cold and lonely life?

429
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
What can the same life as the heavens do?

430
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
The differences that everyone cares about

431
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
are not important to me.

432
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
How to live is not important.

433
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
How to live is important.

434
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Who to live with is important.

435
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
The Chaos Bead you mentioned

436
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:21,000
was already gone when it was in the God Pool.

437
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,000
The one who saved Zhao Ming was An Zhu.

438
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
We will have our own lives.

439
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I saw the cause and effect of life and death.

440
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Why do you still not understand?

441
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,000
A person's feelings are the shortest

442
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
and the weakest.

443
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
The one who doesn't understand love,

444
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
is it really me?

445
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
God's will.

446
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I should call you that, right?

447
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
You said that we have been together for tens of thousands of years.

448
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
But I'm sorry.

449
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I really don't have this memory.

450
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Maybe this book will make you sad.

451
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
But I won't go back with you.

452
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I want to stay with you.

453
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
I want to be with you.

454
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
But I won't go back with you.

455
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
I want to stay here

456
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
and let Zhao Ming come back.

457
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Even if you die,

458
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
you have to stay with him.

459
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I'll take good care of him in your next life.

460
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
owane.

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,000
Yes, I can leave with ultramarital energy.

462
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
What are you going to do?

463
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
In this case,

464
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
we will make three bet.

465
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If I win,

466
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
you will go back to Shenzhen with me.

467
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
If you win,

468
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,000
you want to stay as a person,

469
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
then stay.

470
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Why should I bet with you?

471
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
I can give you this.

472
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
This is the Qian Kun Pearl.

473
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,000
At the critical moment,

474
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
it can save Zhao Ming's life.

475
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,000
What do you mean?

476
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
What destiny does,

477
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Zhao Ming will live and die.

478
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
The destiny book has never made a mistake.

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
And this Qian Kun Pearl,

480
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
it can reverse the Qian Kun

481
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
and fight for Zhao Ming's life.

482
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You have to

483
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
bet on this bet.

484
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Okay.

485
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
I will bet with you.

486
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,000
I bet with you.

487
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Some destiny,

488
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,000
you can't let go

489
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,000
of it.

490
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
What is love?

491
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Why can people live in peace

492
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,000
when they have love?

493
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's so hot.

494
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,000
If we can have love,

495
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,000
wouldn't the altar

496
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
be so calm?

497
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,000
You and I are the gods.

498
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,000
We should follow the good heaven.

499
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,000
The process of loving is the process of destruction.

500
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,000
Anyway, you are by my side.

501
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Sun, moon, silver,

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,000
the universe is in chaos.

503
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Destiny,

504
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
we will be together forever.

505
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The battle in the holy land,

506
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
the destiny is broken.

507
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
The destiny is broken.

508
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Everything is in chaos.

509
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,420
The

510
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,000
way to do it

511
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
is to follow the divine order.

512
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
The destiny book says

513
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
it's dangerous to repair it.

514
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Hao Tian,

515
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'm willing to sacrifice myself

516
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
to repair the Heaven's tomb

517
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
for the soul-stay.

518
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Please allow me.

519
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
The gods are different.

520
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
You can't follow them.

521
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
The soul-stay is a rescue attribute.

522
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
You should deal with the world.

523
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
You are a running attribute.

524
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
You have your own mission.

525
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Destiny,

526
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
it's against the will of the heaven.

527
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Do you know the consequences?

528
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,000
The destiny is broken.

529
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The destiny is broken.

530
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
The destiny is broken.

531
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The destiny is broken.

532
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,000
The destiny is broken.

533
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The destiny is broken.

534
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
The destiny is broken.

535
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The destiny is broken.

536
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,000
The destiny is broken.

537
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The destiny is broken.

538
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The destiny is broken.

539
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The destiny is broken.

540
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
The destiny is broken.

541
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
The destiny is broken.

542
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
The destiny is broken.

543
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
The destiny is broken.

544
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
The destiny is broken.

545
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The destiny is broken.

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
The destiny is broken.

547
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The destiny is broken.

548
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,000
The destiny is broken.

549
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
The destiny is broken.

550
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
The destiny is broken.

551
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The destiny is broken.

552
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
The destiny is broken.

553
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The destiny is broken.

554
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,000
The destiny is broken.

555
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
The destiny is broken.

556
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,000
The destiny is broken.

557
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
The destiny is broken.

558
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
The destiny is broken.

559
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,000
The destiny is broken.

560
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
The destiny is broken.

561
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
The destiny is broken.

562
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,000
The destiny is broken.

563
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
The destiny is broken.

564
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
The destiny is broken.

565
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
The destiny is broken.

566
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
The destiny is broken.

567
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
The destiny is broken.

568
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
The destiny is broken.

569
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
The destiny is broken.

570
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
The destiny is broken.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
The destiny is broken.

572
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
The destiny is broken.

573
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
The destiny is broken.

574
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
The destiny is broken.

575
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
The destiny is broken.

576
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
The destiny is broken.

577
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The destiny is broken.

578
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
The destiny is broken.

579
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
The destiny is broken.

580
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
The destiny is broken.

581
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
The destiny is broken.

582
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,000
The destiny is broken.

583
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,000
The destiny is broken.

584
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,000
The destiny is broken.

585
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,000
The destiny is broken.

586
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,000
Quickly go.

587
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Otherwise,

588
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
only the clubs can meet.

589
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
A'Chou

590
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,000
You are alive.

591
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,300
Your hand!

592
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,060
Those

593
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,700
are my memories.

594
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,400
The control orb must have got

595
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,600
effected

596
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,100
and be directed to

597
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,400
do something Rudy 나는

598
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:34,900
iggling

599
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,300
In procedures of destiny,

600
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,640
Zhao Ming will suffer chiefly of death.

601
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,840
This Qian Kun Bead can reverse the Qian Kun

602
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,240
and fight for Zhao Ming's life.

603
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,280
You have to

604
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,360
take this gamble.

605
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,720
News from the front.

606
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,800
Our army has been ambushed by the enemy.

607
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,040
The Holy Ruler is seriously injured.

608
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,120
He can't be cured with military medical care.

609
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,040
Send the most capable imperial physician to the camp.

610
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,720
Is this the Holy Ruler's death?

611
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,320
A Yan.

612
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,440
Let me go to the camp with the imperial physician.

613
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,560
You go to the camp?

614
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,160
Can you cure the disease or kill the enemy?

615
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,680
The Holy Ruler's injury is caused by the imperial physician.

616
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:35,320
The imperial physician can't cure Zhao Ming's illness.

617
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,440
Take me there. I can help him.

618
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,760
Staying in the palace is the most helpful thing for the Holy Ruler.

619
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,240
Zhao Ming is in danger. Only I can save him.

620
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,040
The Holy Ruler's order to me is to stay in the palace and protect you.

621
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:52,840
You can do whatever you want in the palace, but I won't let you leave the palace.

622
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:55,200
The Holy Ruler's order.

623
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,360
Do you really only see him as the Emperor?

624
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,760
You and Zhao Ming are born to be together.

625
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,720
Your friendship has already surpassed the Emperor's.

626
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,400
Friendship and brotherhood.

627
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,880
I know that the military power is like mountains.

628
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,480
But you abandoned the identity of the Holy Ruler.

629
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:19,240
You know that your brother is a traitor, but you still want to obey him and be loyal?

630
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,120
Now, Zhao Ming is heavily injured.

631
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,120
He must be in a critical situation.

632
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,320
A Yan.

633
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:29,720
I won't make it hard for you to be loyal.

634
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:34,640
But I will definitely use my own method to go to the camp to find Zhao Ming.

635
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:39,840
Can you still not know your own feelings?

636
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,440
I have a thought in my heart.

637
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:49,040
I am still unable to ask my true love.

638
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:53,040
I am willing to go through the six years of love.

639
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:57,440
I am willing to go through the six years of love.

640
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
He Zhao, where is Zhao Ming?

641
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,640
Uncle, why are you here?

642
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,440
Tell me, where is Zhao Ming?

643
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,440
Zhu.

644
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:22,240
I am willing to go through the six years of love.

645
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:28,840
I am willing to go through the six years of love.

646
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:35,240
I am willing to go through the six years of love.

647
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,640
I am willing to go through the six years of love.

648
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Zhu, why are you here?

649
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,040
You scared me to death. I thought you...

650
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,040
What did you think I was?

651
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,440
Where did you get hurt?

652
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,640
How did you lose your power? Why didn't you retreat?

653
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,840
We won.

654
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
We won?

655
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,840
But the news from the palace said that the war was a failure.

656
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,040
You lost your power.

657
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,440
That was yesterday's war report.

658
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,840
The so-called failure was a trap set by the Holy Ruler.

659
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,840
I hid it from you because I wanted to do a full-on play.

660
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:19,240
This morning, the Holy Ruler led his army to break through the enemy and won the war.

661
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,040
Then why did you look so defeated?

662
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,440
I was just eating something in the afternoon.

663
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:28,040
You've been with the army for months. You should eat something when you win.

664
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,840
Celebrate it.

665
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
You know about this too?

666
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,440
I know.

667
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,040
So you hid it from me?

668
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,440
You're so mean. You scared me to death.

669
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,240
What's wrong?

670
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,440
Nothing.

671
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:52,040
The war report isn't all fake. The Holy Ruler really got hurt.

672
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:56,040
Where did you get hurt? Did you get hurt badly?

673
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,840
I brought a lot of good medicine from the palace.

674
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,640
Come with me. I'll help you apply the medicine.

675
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,840
Since you fell in love with Zhao Ming,

676
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,240
you didn't hesitate to disobey the Heaven.

677
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,840
Then the first bet we made

678
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,840
is that no one will see Zhao Ming.

679
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,240
This is...

680
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,040
This is Princess Qingyang of West Shrine State.

681
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,040
This is Zhu.

682
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,440
This is the second one.

683
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,640
This is the third one.

684
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:53,240
This is the fourth one.

685
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
This is the fifth one.

686
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
This is the sixth one.

687
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
This is the seventh one.

688
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,240
This is the seventh one.

689
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
This is the seventh one.

690
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
This is the seventh one.

691
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
This is the seventh one.

692
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
This is the seventh one.

693
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:39,240
This is the seventh one.

694
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
This is the seventh one.

695
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
This is the seventh one.

696
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,240
This is the seventh one.

697
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,240
This is the seventh one.

698
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,240
This is the seventh one.

699
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,440
This is the seventh one.

700
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,440
This is the seventh one.

701
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,440
This is the seventh one.

702
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
This is the seventh one.

703
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,240
Does every wound hurt?

704
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,840
Since I was little,

705
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,240
I've been following my father into battle andYou've been following your father into battle and

706
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,440
I've been following my father into battle and was just the soldier alone.

707
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:21,440
When you feel bitter, eat a piece of sugar.

708
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,560
If there's sweet, it won't be so bitter.

709
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:31,960
Your eating speed is slower than I thought.

710
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,040
I've been planning to go back with you with this sugar.

711
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,840
I also hoped that you would have a wish.

712
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:52,840
I didn't expect that you would be so strict on me on the day of my return.

713
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,840
I'm afraid that I ate too fast and you wouldn't be able to come back.

714
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,840
I'm even more afraid that...

715
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,840
I'm even more afraid that I'll eat up the sugar and you won't be able to come back.

716
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,040
So, when there's only one last piece left,

717
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
I won't dare to eat it.

718
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Fortunately, I finally got to be reunited with you.

719
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:42,040
The weight of the armor is so heavy.

720
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:54,040
Do you know that there have been many rumors in the palace saying that you are the God of War who can't win?

721
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Today, I finally realized that the God of War is so heavy.

722
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,040
I've never been a God of War.

723
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,040
It's just that every time, I'm holding a beer that I'm going to die from.

724
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,840
You surely won't die.

725
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,440
I surely will?

726
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,040
I surely will.

727
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,840
How did you get hurt?

728
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,040
I got hurt while riding a horse.

729
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,240
It's fine. It doesn't hurt.

730
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:41,240
Did I tell you that you never lie?

731
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,840
Your eyes can't lie.

732
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:56,040
Such a deep wound...

733
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,840
How can it not hurt?

734
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:07,840
A'Zhuo,

735
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,440
this journey...

736
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,440
has been hard on you.

737
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,440
Promise me.

738
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,040
You must be fine.

739
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,840
You already fell in love with Zhao Ming.

740
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,440
If you get struck by lightning, it will be a warning.

741
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:43,640
A miracle cannot be moved, and it cannot be loved.

742
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:46,640
Or else, it will be destroyed by the world.

743
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:07,640
