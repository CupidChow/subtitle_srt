00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,740
The

2
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,740
The

3
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,740
The

4
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,740
The

00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,740
The

00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,740
The

00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,740
The

8
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,740
The

9
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,740
The

10
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,740
The

11
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,740
The

12
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,740
The

13
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,740
The

14
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:20,740
The

15
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,740
The

16
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:22,740
The

17
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:23,740
The

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,740
The

19
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:25,740
The

20
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,740
The

21
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,740
The

22
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:28,740
The

23
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,740
The

24
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,740
The

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,740
The

26
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:32,740
The

27
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,740
The

28
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,740
The

29
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,740
The

30
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,740
The

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:37,740
The

32
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:38,740
The

33
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,740
The

34
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,740
The

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,740
The

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,740
The

37
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,740
The

38
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,740
The

39
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,740
The

40
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,740
The

41
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,740
The

42
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:48,740
The

43
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,740
The

44
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,740
The

45
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
The

46
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,740
The

47
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,740
The

48
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,740
The

49
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,820
The

50
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,820
The

51
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,820
The

52
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,820
The

53
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,260
But why are you here?

54
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,820
I've been here for years

55
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,820
I know I'll meet an old friend here

56
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,620
But I don't know if he remembers me

57
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,820
Xie Xuechen

58
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,820
You left me here to grill meat

59
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
I must find someone to help you

60
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,820
Sister

61
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,820
I found the smartest person in the world to save you

62
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,820
I'm here to save you

63
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,820
In your eyes

64
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,820
I'm afraid the whole world is a smart person

65
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Linglong family

66
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,820
You know this formation

67
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,820
Linglong family only kneels and doesn't kill

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,820
It's a benevolent formation

69
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,820
benevolent

70
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,820
This formation is not made of blood

71
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,820
It has a golden light

72
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,820
It can be seen that the person who doesn't have the formation is very thick

73
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,820
If you want to kill, you don't need a formation

74
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
If you want to have a formation, you don't need blood

75
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
I think this person is in an emergency

76
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,820
I can only use the next strategy to deal with the enemy

77
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,820
I'm afraid it's not easy

78
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,820
You're really a smart person

79
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,820
Childe, help him

80
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,820
Sister is a good person

81
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:48,820
I was trapped here because I had a fight with a friend

82
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,820
If you help him, I'll give you my baby

83
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Okay

84
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:57,820
Then I dare to ask the girl

85
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,820
Why is your friend trapped here?

86
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,820
I was indebted to him

87
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:07,820
I risked my life to save him from the fire

88
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:11,820
Later, we fought the enemy together

89
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:12,820
We fought together

90
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,820
We fought together for a lifetime

91
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:19,820
But I didn't expect that he would hurt me because of a little misunderstanding

92
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,820
He hit me

93
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Childe, you don't believe it?

94
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,820
No

95
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,820
You said it, so I believe it

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,820
Then would you like to give me some advice?

97
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,820
The river falls into the four directions

98
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,820
The eight sides of the dragon are trapped

99
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
It seems that he is really capable

100
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,820
The Linglong family has changed

101
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,820
Next, you need to listen to me step by step to get out of the formation

102
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:04,820
The first step, the second life, comes out of the pig's body

103
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,820
The pig's body?

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,820
This formation is made of the river map

105
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:17,820
Looking at the river map and star image, the difficult part should be here

106
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,820
The second life

107
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,820
Two

108
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,820
The second life

109
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,820
Seven

110
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
The second life

111
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,820
Seven

112
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,820
Should be around

113
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
The second life

114
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,820
Seven

115
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Should be around

116
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,820
The fourth life

117
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,820
Eight

118
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,820
Eight

119
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,820
Eight

120
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:06,820
Eight

121
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,820
The fourth life comes out of the tiger's body

122
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,820
The tiger's body?

123
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,820
The fourth life

124
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,820
Nine

125
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,820
Nine

126
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,820
Eight

127
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,820
Nine

128
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Eight

129
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,820
Nine

130
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,820
Eight

131
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,820
Nine

132
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:48,820
I don't know the origin of this person

133
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,820
If he is suspicious of me after breaking the formation

134
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,820
The fourth life

135
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,820
Childe

136
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
There is still one last step

137
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,820
Miss, I'm afraid you're not thinking of where to stab me

138
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Yes, yes, yes

139
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,820
I was going to stab your neck

140
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
So you won't be tortured

141
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,820
I don't want to interfere in other people's grudges

142
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,820
I'm not interested in fighting and killing

143
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,820
But since I can break this Linglong family

144
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:25,820
I can naturally lock you back

145
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,820
Why are you like my friend

146
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,820
You can't even joke

147
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:36,820
The friend you are talking about is the young master of Snowblade City

148
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Thank you, Snow God

149
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,820
Last step

150
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,820
Two fours as the shoulder

151
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,820
Six eights as the foot

152
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Five as the middle

153
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,820
The Linglong family

154
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Break

155
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,820
Miss, don't

156
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,820
Make a mistake

157
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,820
Wrong

158
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Five as the middle

159
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,820
Not to find the dance

160
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,820
But

161
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,820
Go to the stone to save the dance

162
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,820
Stone and dance are the same

163
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,820
That should be

164
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Stone and dance are the same

165
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,820
That should be

166
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,820
Stone and dance are the same

167
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,820
That should be

168
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,820
Stone and dance are the same

169
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,820
That should be

170
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Stone and dance are the same

171
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,820
That should be

172
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Stone and dance are the same

173
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,820
That should be

174
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Stone and dance are the same

175
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
That should be

176
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,820
Stone and dance are the same

177
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,820
That should be

178
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,820
Stone and dance are the same

179
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,820
This sister looks good

180
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,820
Who are you

181
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,820
I'm from the Yunxiu Villa, Nanxuye.

182
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:47,820
May I ask your name?

183
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,820
Mu Xuanling.

184
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,820
You're the water wood, Zhan Qinghua?

185
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:55,820
I'm the most similar to the wood.

186
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,820
Okay.

187
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,820
Wow!

188
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,820
The carriage of Mr. Nan looks ordinary.

189
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
I didn't expect it to be so spacious.

190
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,820
With the space of the formation,

191
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:21,820
you're indeed the first person in the formation.

192
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,820
It's said that there are two people born with the right skills.

193
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
First, it's Xie Xuechen.

194
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,820
Second, it's you, the master of the manor.

195
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
The master of the manor is talented.

196
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,820
He can make up for the past and future.

197
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,820
My mother also said that

198
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:40,820
Mr. Nan is the smartest person in the world.

199
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
She also said that

200
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:45,820
he can't hide everything from you, right?

201
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:49,820
That's already the past.

202
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I've long lost my ability to make up for it.

203
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,820
So I know more about the world than anyone else.

204
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,820
How do you know that Xie Xuechen trapped me in the Linglong family?

205
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,820
To be honest,

206
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:08,820
I founded the Linglong family together with Xuechen when I was young.

207
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,820
So in this world, except me, only he can do it.

208
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,820
You're Xie Xuechen's friend?

209
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:17,820
He's so cold-hearted.

210
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,820
How can he have a friend?

211
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,820
You're not friends with Xuechen?

212
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,820
Then you...

213
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,820
Yes, I'm his friend.

214
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,820
Xie Xuechen is in trouble.

215
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
He's not kind to me.

216
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,820
I can't just ignore him.

217
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,820
How about...

218
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,820
I understand.

219
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:46,820
You still want to solve the misunderstanding between friends, right?

220
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,820
If that's the case,

221
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,820
you can go back to the Yunxiu Villa with me.

222
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,820
Xuechen will go with you.

223
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,820
You know that Xie Xuechen will go to the Yunxiu Villa?

224
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,820
With his current situation,

225
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
there's no choice, right?

226
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,820
It's hard to guess.

227
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,820
It depends on whether you're willing to go with me.

228
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,820
I really mean it.

229
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,820
Then I want to go, too.

230
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
Why are you going?

231
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,820
You'd better go home. Don't let your mother worry.

232
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:16,820
I should be grateful to my father.

233
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,820
Besides, I want to find my father.

234
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,820
I need to learn skills.

235
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,820
I want to practice with my sister.

236
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,820
You've helped me.

237
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,820
Don't mention the gratitude.

238
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,820
I won't teach you if you want to learn skills.

239
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,820
Besides, I have other things to do.

240
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:33,820
I can't do it for you.

241
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,820
Sister.

242
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,820
Give me the man's clothes.

243
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,820
I can go...

244
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
to your house for a class.

245
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
Father is a good boy.

246
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,820
He won't cause trouble.

247
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
Just give me a small nest.

248
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
It's okay if there's no nest.

249
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:55,820
I...

250
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Father can sleep in a hole.

251
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,820
Is that okay?

252
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Don't look at me, Master Nan.

253
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,820
I'm not his person.

254
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
He asked you.

255
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,820
You can decide.

256
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,820
Please be my guest.

257
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,820
Okay?

258
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
Okay. Thank you, Master Nan.

259
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
Sister.

260
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
Sister.

261
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
Sister.

262
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,820
Actually, I've made up my mind.

263
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,820
I'll meet an old friend here today.

264
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820
I've waited for a long time.

265
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,820
I almost thought I wouldn't see him.

266
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,820
Did you see him now?

267
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Please enjoy.

268
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
Is that Nan Xuyue from Yunxiu Villa?

269
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,820
I heard she was born with a sharp tongue.

270
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:34,140
But she was

271
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,820
a loser.

272
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,820
Yes.

273
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,820
Poor her.

274
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,820
How can she stand it?

275
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
Her father is still looking for a doctor.

276
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,820
Now he's here.

277
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I wonder if he can

278
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
take the Soul Bead to save her.

279
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,820
Why are you sitting here?

280
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,820
I can't do it anymore.

281
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
My legs are broken.

282
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
I'm in a bad mood.

283
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,820
But you don't seem to be very sad.

284
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:20,820
It's just that I'm bored.

285
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:29,820
I'll be your friend.

286
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,820
Okay?

287
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,820
I heard that

288
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:35,820
a little love is precious.

289
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
You sell your candy.

290
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,820
Give me a little.

291
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:42,820
I'll give you my little love.

292
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,820
Okay?

293
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
I'll give you one.

294
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Thank you.

295
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,820
So many candies.

296
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:21,820
But you only gave me a little love.

297
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,820
You're really a beautiful girl.

298
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,820
I saw it.

299
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,820
I saw it.

300
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
I saw it.

301
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,820
I saw it.

302
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
I saw it.

303
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,820
I saw it.

304
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:48,820
But she has forgotten me.

305
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
Feng Yang, go back.

306
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
Yes.

307
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,820
Wait here.

308
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,820
I think he'll be here soon.

309
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,820
Sister, this cake is delicious.

310
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:25,820
Try it. It's really delicious.

311
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,820
Delicious.

312
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,820
It's good if you like it.

313
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,820
It's good if you like it.

314
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,820
Have you known Mr. Nan and Xie Xue Chen for a long time?

315
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,820
About more than ten years.

316
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,820
Then you know everything about Xie Xue Chen.

317
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,820
It depends on which aspect.

318
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,820
Young Master, Young Master Xie is here.

319
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,820
Thank you, Aunt.

320
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,820
You're here.

321
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,820
Take off your hairpin.

322
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,820
Let's play.

323
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:34,820
Brother, you're so handsome.

324
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:38,820
That's because we haven't seen each other for a long time.

325
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:49,820
Why do you think I'm not happy to see you?

326
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,820
You look very happy.

327
00:18:57,580 --> 00:18:58,340
But

328
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,780
why did you bring her here?

329
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,060
Miss Mu said

330
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,300
there was a misunderstanding between you and her.

331
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,740
You believe it?

332
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,420
No.

333
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,380
You really love to watch the fun.

334
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,980
You came here

335
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,060
because you have something to say?

336
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,300
I do have something to say.

337
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,020
Xie Xue Chen,

338
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,740
you bastard.

339
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,500
Miss Mu may still be angry.

340
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,620
It's not the best time to talk.

341
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,140
Why don't you rest first?

342
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,540
After you're relieved,

343
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,540
you can solve the misunderstanding.

344
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:53,460
What do you think?

345
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,060
If you finished,

346
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,860
you should hear it!

347
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,260
Read it again!

348
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:59,300
No.

349
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,420
Xiao'ai 게ng Rig pressures

350
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:28,740
If someone dares to do something in the Yingshou Villa

351
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,460
will he die here immediately?

352
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,100
So please don't act rashly

353
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,020
Look at what you said

354
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,420
I'm a good person

355
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,460
Do you know who he is?

356
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,780
There are only a few spirits with magic power

357
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:46,660
And he's old enough to guess it

358
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,500
Since he guessed it, why did you bring him here?

359
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,820
Because you used the Spirit Dragon Armor

360
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,300
Sit

361
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,340
It's not difficult to kill Zhen with blood

362
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,380
But you only choose to trap him

363
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,860
It means you don't want to kill him

364
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,540
This is one of them

365
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,140
What about the other one?

366
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,180
The other one is the Xiu Bao rat

367
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,660
He has a spirit

368
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,660
He won't approach the evil disciple

369
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,220
who has the blood of the dead

370
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,940
A Bao likes Miss Mu so much

371
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,940
It means he's not a bad person

372
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,700
You should know that

373
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,820
Be careful

374
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,220
The dark jade saintess

375
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,540
Instead of letting her make trouble outside

376
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,860
It's better to stay under your own skin

377
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,100
You did the right thing

378
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,780
What about you?

379
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,420
How are you?

380
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,200
When I was trapped in the

381
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,580
He gave me a kind of medicine

382
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,580
Although it can restore my spirit power for a short time

383
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:00,580
But I can't use any more spirit power

384
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:03,780
I heard him telling the story of saving you

385
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,780
But I didn't expect he used the half-day method

386
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:12,180
Half-day help, half-day trouble

387
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,140
Interesting

388
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:15,140
Interesting?

389
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
I'm sorry

390
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:20,140
What are you laughing at?

391
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,140
Do you have a solution?

392
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,140
You have the blood of the dead

393
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,140
Your healing power is higher than others

394
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,140
After a few days, you can restore your spirit power

395
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,140
I can't wait that long

396
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,140
But there are other actions in the dark jade

397
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
I can't wait that long

398
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,140
There is a way to restore the spirit power

399
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,140
By using the way of restoring the spirit ink

400
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
Do you want to try?

401
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
Yes

402
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:58,140
How long does it take to send the magic array from the Yinxiu Mountain to Yongxue City?

403
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,140
It's easy to reach other array

404
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,140
Can you make it in one day?

405
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
One day?

406
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,140
Okay

407
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,140
I'll borrow your new command

408
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:17,140
Chief, Sang Qi and the Alliance are trying to escape

409
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,140
Be careful

410
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,140
I'll be back soon

411
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,140
I just contacted the Alliance's secret guard

412
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,140
The Alliance's five sects only know that Xie Xuechen has not been released from Wanxian Town

413
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,140
They don't know anything else

414
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,140
Xie Xuechen is out of trouble

415
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:36,140
But he didn't return to Yongxue City immediately

416
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,140
There are two possibilities

417
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:42,140
First, Xie Xuechen has doubts about the Alliance's five sects

418
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:45,140
He knows that Wanxian Town was attacked

419
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,140
There is a spy among the Alliance's five sects

420
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:52,140
Second, he hasn't restored his real power

421
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,140
He can't return to Yongxue City immediately

422
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:01,140
He can't even contact the Alliance's five sects

423
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
Thanks to Xie Xuechen's skills

424
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,140
If he really regains his power

425
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,140
and knows that the Alliance's five sects are evil

426
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,140
he will return to the Immortal Sect and eliminate the traitors

427
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:17,140
So it's very likely that he is still badly injured

428
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:20,140
You guys continue to train your head and body

429
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
and find their whereabouts

430
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,140
Yes

431
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Do you know who the traitor of the Alliance is?

432
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,140
I don't know yet

433
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,140
So I need to return to Yongxue City as soon as possible

434
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,140
and find out the traitor who is protecting the wonton

435
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:44,140
Have you ever been in the dark?

436
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
I don't know about others

437
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,140
How can I not know about you?

438
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,140
With your personality

439
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,140
only war can be abandoned

440
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:03,140
There is only one possibility that you will be caught in the dark

441
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,140
You did it on purpose

442
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,140
Six thousand years ago

443
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,140
the first generation of the Alliance took the opportunity

444
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,140
to set up Wanxian Town on the Mount Liangjie

445
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,140
It blocked the way for the dark clan to invade the human clan

446
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,140
Since then, the dark clan has been difficult to enter the human world

447
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,140
But the human clan has never been able to escape the dark

448
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:23,140
No one knows what is going on in the dark

449
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,140
They don't know how to defeat the enemy

450
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:31,140
So you have already planned

451
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,140
before you go to repair the barrier

452
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
If you can repair the barrier smoothly

453
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
you will be able to retreat

454
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
If you are in danger

455
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,140
let them catch you in the dark

456
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,140
and find out what is going on

457
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Is that right?

458
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,140
So you released the kind of

459
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,140
the kind of thing that can only live for a day

460
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:59,140
but can transmit images

461
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,140
The camp

462
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,140
This small camp is quite powerful

463
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,140
but you can find out about Sang Qi's situation

464
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,140
It is because he found out about Sang Qi

465
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,140
that it is clear that there is something wrong

466
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,140
Why?

467
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,140
Sang Qi's strength cannot be underestimated

468
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,140
Even if he is injured

469
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:16,140
it is impossible to find out about the loss of the camp

470
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:19,140
Unless Sang Qi is acting

471
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:21,140
he wants people to think

472
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:23,140
that he is really a skilled warrior

473
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,140
What is the purpose?

474
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,140
It is because I can't find out his purpose

475
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,140
so when the spiritual power was restored

476
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
I killed Zhu Shengguang

477
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
If the guess is useless

478
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
it is best to kill him

479
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
directly

480
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
It is a pity

481
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,140
I misjudged the effect of the prescription for half a day

482
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,140
I didn't expect that the spiritual power

483
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
could only last for half an hour

484
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
Xie Xuechen

485
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:49,140
Do you know that this is a gamble?

486
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
What if you die in the dark?

487
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
That is a life

488
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:56,140
Anyway, the external immortal formation cannot be repaired

489
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:05,140
The way of cultivation cannot be long

490
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,140
I believe it

491
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
Xie Xuechen

492
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:14,140
There is one more thing that I find strange

493
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:17,140
Why did Sang Qi get the phoenix-shaped elixir?

494
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
Phoenix-shaped elixir?

495
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,140
Six thousand years ago, the mountain collapsed

496
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,140
and the phoenix-shaped elixir was made

497
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:30,140
How could anyone make the phoenix-shaped elixir?

498
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:34,140
Xie Xuechen

499
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,140
I think

500
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,140
Mr. Wan's hunting was just a beginning

501
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Behind this

502
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:44,140
someone is playing a big game

503
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,140
There are so many unsolved mysteries

504
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,140
Have you ever thought of

505
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:54,140
seeing her through the wood?

506
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,140
I have

507
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,140
I told you

508
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,140
If you didn't want to

509
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,140
how could she threaten you?

510
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:13,140
It's because you want to see

511
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
what kind of person she is

512
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,140
What is her purpose behind it?

513
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Why is she so obsessed with you?

514
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,140
Is that right?

515
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Yes, I even thought of using her

516
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,140
to deal with the dark jade and the mourning qi

517
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
But you set up the Linglong family

518
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
and chose to share the Yang Biao with her

519
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,140
Did you change your mind?

520
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,140
Using a woman to investigate

521
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,140
is in contrast to my character

522
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,140
Moreover, she is also a smart person

523
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,140
I used her to investigate the mourning qi and the dark jade

524
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,140
She would also use me to investigate the immortal alliance

525
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,140
It's hard to say who you are

526
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:50,140
But you just

527
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
went back to find her

528
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,140
didn't you?

529
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,140
You put her in Linglong family

530
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:59,140
You came to the Yuanxiu Villa first

531
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:01,140
It should be you who arrived first

532
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,140
But you arrived late

533
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:06,140
You don't feel surprised to see her here

534
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:09,140
You just ask me why I brought her here

535
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,140
It means you have been back

536
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,140
You know that the Linglong family was robbed by me

537
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,140
Right?

538
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
The sword dragon has been shining

539
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
There must be a spiritual clan nearby

540
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Look for it carefully

541
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
Yes

542
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Go over there and see

543
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
The sword temple

544
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,140
Uncle Miao, if you go to the sword temple

545
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,140
you will be caught by them

546
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,140
and controlled by the human clan

547
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,140
You have to be a slave for your whole life

548
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,140
But if you don't go to the sword temple

549
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,140
and register

550
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,140
you will not have the identity of a good demon

551
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,140
You can kill them all

552
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,140
Don't learn from the spiritual clan

553
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,140
Did Xu Yue save her?

554
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:13,140
Xu Yue?

555
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,140
Xu Yue

556
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:24,140
She said she wanted to get out of the dark

557
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,140
and start over

558
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Do you believe it?

559
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,140
You dare not believe it

560
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,140
and you can't bear to kill

561
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,140
Then follow your heart

562
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,140
and see clearly

563
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,140
whether she is a good demon

564
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:36,140
or not

565
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,140
I believe you

566
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,140
You have to see clearly

567
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:40,140
what kind of person she is

568
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,140
and what she wants to do

569
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
A'bao

570
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:51,140
I have something important to do

571
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,140
and the road to the end is not safe

572
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,140
And you can't fix the skills I have trained

573
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:58,140
When Xie Xuechen and I leave

574
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,140
you can go home

575
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
If you really want to find your father

576
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,140
you can ask Nan Xu Yue to help you

577
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,140
It's the same

578
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,140
I like you, A'bao

579
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Do you want to be with me?

580
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,140
It seems that I have to tell you the truth

581
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:27,140
I am a bad person from the dark

582
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,140
I only eat the little beast like you

583
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,140
I am good at cooking, cooking and cooking

584
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:36,140
I am good at hiding

585
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:40,140
I know you are not bad

586
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,140
I can feel it

587
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Besides, you have a treasure

588
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:49,140
I can learn the skill of weapon training

589
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,140
I have taught you for a long time

590
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,140
Don't think I will agree to it

591
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,140
After we finish the mountain villa

592
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,140
we will not be on the same path

593
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,140
Brother told you not to follow him

594
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,140
You didn't listen

595
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
You

596
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:10,140
You are young and talkative

597
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,140
Sister, you are angry with your brother

598
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:17,140
Why do you come to him?

599
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,140
Do you want to revenge?

600
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,140
I was too used to him

601
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,140
When I find a chance

602
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:28,140
I will beat him like this

603
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,140
What is it?

604
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:34,140
Little kid, don't ask so much

605
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,140
Actually, Xixue Chen is not bad

606
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:41,140
After all, we are different

607
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,140
I always beat him

608
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,140
He is so straightforward

609
00:32:47,140 --> 00:32:50,140
It's normal that he can't accept it

610
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,140
Sister, you are so familiar with this

611
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:59,140
It's like my mother always complains about my father

612
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:01,140
He never comes back

613
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,140
He never comes back

614
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
Then he explains that

615
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:08,140
he may encounter some troubles

616
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,140
and can't come back for a while

617
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Sister, you said in the English house

618
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,140
there is something important

619
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,140
You didn't tell me what it is

620
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:28,140
Dad, I have a question for you

621
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:31,140
Do you believe that

622
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,140
there is a rebirth in this world?

623
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,140
Mom said

624
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,140
except for the dark clan, they won't die

625
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:41,140
The forest and human clan will die

626
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,140
They will die

627
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:51,140
They will be reborn

628
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:54,140
unless there is a miracle

629
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:58,140
The god clan abandoned the human clan

630
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
They even closed the ladder

631
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,140
They have no spiritual power for thousands of years

632
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,140
Where did they get the miracle?

633
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,140
So, mom said

634
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:11,140
I should protect my life

635
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:14,140
After all, I can only live once

636
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,140
I should go

637
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,140
It's not shameful

638
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:26,140
The sword and the formation are powerful

639
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,140
The man is powerful too

640
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,140
It seems smooth

641
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,240
The

642
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,640
The

643
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,140
The

644
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
The

645
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,140
The

646
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
The

647
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,140
The

648
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,140
The

649
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,140
The

650
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:16,140
The

651
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,140
The

652
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:20,140
The

653
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,140
The

654
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:24,140
The

655
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:26,140
The

656
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,140
The

657
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
The

658
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:37,140
The

659
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,140
The

660
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:48,140
The

661
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:51,140
The

662
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,060
Miss Geng champagne

663
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:58,300
colleagues

664
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:17,940
my man

665
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,020
Strong Para-he Quem

666
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:21,540
I will talk about my matter later.

667
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:23,980
What did Gao Xiu Shi encounter?

668
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,380
A few of my fellow disciples and I

669
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,780
had a fight in the nearby post station.

670
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,060
We encountered a demon.

671
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,700
We finally escaped.

672
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:31,420
On our way back to the Palace of Pure Flower,

673
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,500
we encountered a massacre.

674
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,860
It must have been done by that demon's accomplice.

675
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,740
Sect Leader Nan,

676
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,620
both of my junior brothers are dead.

677
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:43,940
Afterwards, I ran away with my junior sister.

678
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:46,580
I remembered that the Cloud Bear Villa was nearby.

679
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,380
I came to ask for help.

680
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,220
Could you send someone to save my junior sister, Cui Wan Wan?

681
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,100
Don't worry, Senior Gao Xiu Shi.

682
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:02,740
Young Sect Leader Xie, it's perfect that you're here.

683
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:04,780
I have something to ask you.

684
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,780
Can I have a word with you?

685
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:09,460
Sure.

686
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,540
No need.

687
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,540
I have a wound on my body.

688
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,860
It's not convenient to walk.

689
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,780
Let's just talk here.

690
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,300
I'll go prepare a room for Gao Xiu Shi.

691
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:36,860
I wonder what Fourth Princess has to say.

692
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,180
Master said that for the past six thousand years,

693
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:43,180
there have been more than one massacre in the Immortal Sect.

694
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,340
The repair of the barrier

695
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,460
was done by the previous Alliance Leader.

696
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,700
This time, because the Alliance Leader is closed,

697
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,020
we can only choose the strongest of the previous Alliance.

698
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,460
That is, Young Sect Leader Xie, you came.

699
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:56,260
Young Sect Leader Xie not only has the strongest ability,

700
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,940
but also has great intentions.

701
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:00,140
If he takes the position of Alliance Leader in the future,

702
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,460
he will surely be able to expand the Alliance even more.

703
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:04,260
That's why,

704
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:08,420
if we don't get rid of such a person early,

705
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,060
it will be a big trouble.

706
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,780
It's really hard to get stuck in such a small area.

707
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:22,500
The repair of the barrier in the Yun Xiu Manor is quite interesting.

708
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:25,420
I really can't get in without this method.

709
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,060
Xie Xue Chen,

710
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,020
I still want to kill you

711
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:31,660
after two days of not seeing you.

712
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,740
Just because of you?

713
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,660
Sister!

714
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,660
Something... something scary is coming in.

715
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,060
Stay inside. Don't go out.

716
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:59,660
You killed the shadow before, right?

717
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,660
Okay.

718
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:04,060
Then let me cut off your head.

719
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:06,860
Take it back and cut it off.

720
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,660
You shouldn't have come.

721
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,860
What? You're afraid that I'll die?

722
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:01,660
Can you stop being so emotional in front of me?

723
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,460
Zhan Ying, listen to my explanation.

724
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:10,260
The previous time, you were so angry.

725
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,260
You were so angry that you even tried to kill me.

726
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:16,060
Zhan Ying, listen to my explanation.

727
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,460
The previous time, it wasn't what you thought.

728
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:18,660
I...

729
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:21,060
I don't want to listen!

730
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,060
Before I came,

731
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:26,460
Yu Ying and Chi Ying especially told me

732
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:30,660
that you are the one who is the most secretive and has two sides and three sides.

733
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:33,860
Tell me not to believe your nonsense.

734
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:36,260
It's not like that. Don't listen to his nonsense.

735
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,860
I know that I'm sincere and trustworthy.

736
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,740
Brother, I almost killed Kong Ling.

737
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,860
What are you doing?

738
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:59,260
Tang Handai, your ajaious sense of manner.

739
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,660
If you let me get our jump rope,

740
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,060
it must

741
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,460
until later in the next days.

742
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:06,960
If you don't even practice putting your handsucks to standardized,

743
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,940
I will repeat this several times.

744
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:44,340
I don't want to be by your side

745
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:50,920
Love,

746
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,120
I'm left alone in a dream, without a trace.

747
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:33,120
I have no wish in this life, but to be by your side.

748
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:54,920
The Long Ballad
