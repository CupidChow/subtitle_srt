00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 18

3
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Go back with me.

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Then you can live like an ordinary person.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Is that okay?

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But Yong Xue Cheng lost his lunch.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
How should I explain it?

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
If you stay, you will die.

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Even if you die, you have to protect him.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I have chosen my own path.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I will not change my choice.

12
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Is this the love between the world?

13
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The strong are weak because of this.

14
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,000
The wise are stupid because of this.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Sect Leader Nan,

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
if you really want to die,

17
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
then you must die.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you really want to help me,

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
help me entrust A'bao to Fu Lan Sheng.

20
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Invite him to Bixiao Palace to look for his father.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you can't find him,

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
then send A'bao home.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Okay?

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Okay.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let me go.

26
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I want to be with my sister.

27
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
A'bao, A'bao, come here.

28
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Go with me, okay?

29
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I will take you to look for your father.

30
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Bixiao Palace has a lot of treasures.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There are plenty of treasures.

32
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can choose whatever you want.

33
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
No, Brother.

34
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I will give you all my treasures, okay?

35
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Help me save my sister.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
A'bao, come here.

37
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Listen to me.

38
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
This is the only request from your sister.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Go with Brother Fu.

40
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This way, you can make your sister feel at ease.

41
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Then, find your father quickly

42
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
and make your mother feel at ease.

43
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Even if it's our little A'bao,

44
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
he has his own things to do

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
and his responsibility, right?

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
But A'bao's death is innocent.

47
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You don't want him to die, right?

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Let's go with Brother Fu to save my sister.

49
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Do you think A'bao can make you feel at ease?

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I think so.

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
He is not like you.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
A'bao, let's go.

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You go with Brother Fu.

54
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You go with Brother Fu.

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Brother Fu is a good boy.

56
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
He can make you feel at ease.

57
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
How about you?

58
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
He is a good boy, too.

59
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I think so.

60
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
He is a good boy.

61
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Brother Fu.

62
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Let's go.

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Go, go, go.

64
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Go.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Go.

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Go.

67
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Go.

68
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Go, go.

69
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Come in.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
City Leader, how is your injury?

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
It will take some time to heal.

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
But it's fine now.

73
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
How is Elder Cang?

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
During the battle at the main tower,

75
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
the one who was honored by the law died.

76
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Many of the people were injured.

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Elder Cang is currently handling the matter of the mountain queen.

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It might take some time.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Are you here to see me?

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
The sect leaders of the Alliance

81
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
are asking to see you.

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Okay.

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Senior Brother.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I heard a few words from the sect leaders.

85
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,560
They seem to have some

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
fear of you.

87
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
They said that you...

88
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Senior Brother,

89
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
you should go and hear it yourself.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Thank you, City Leader.

91
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't always delay

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
the matter of the dark jade saintess.

93
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will go and see her.

94
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I will go and see her.

95
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I will go and see her.

96
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You should go.

97
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Yes.

98
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Even the other sects

99
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
knew that the sect leader

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
was close with the dark jade saintess.

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We were worried...

102
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since we are here,

103
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
we don't need to keep it a secret.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
As the sect leader of Snow City,

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you are ignoring the rules of the Alliance

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
and causing trouble.

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Shouldn't you have an explanation?

108
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Thank you, City Leader.

109
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Thank you, City Leader.

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Leader He.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You saw

112
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
what happened to the sect leaders.

113
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
These people

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
just received your saving grace.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
They just turned around

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
and started to avoid you.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
They are really too much.

118
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
People know their own nature.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
When they are in a position to betray you,

120
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
they will be impeached and punished.

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
People are not saints.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
How can they be innocent?

123
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Your father and I

124
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
are old friends.

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
We won't stand on their position

126
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and blame you.

127
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But this time,

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
the Alliance was hit hard.

129
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
First, your father was attacked.

130
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The new leader

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
was killed by the dark jade saintess.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The tower was damaged.

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The entire Alliance was in panic.

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
A new leader

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is needed to protect the Alliance.

136
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Leader He's opinion is good.

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I wonder who you are thinking of.

138
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I think

139
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I want to recommend

140
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
City Leader to you.

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:38,000
You are the new leader of the Alliance.

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Don't decline.

143
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Let me finish.

144
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I think

145
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
first,

146
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
your spiritual power has been restored.

147
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
First, your cultivation ability has been improved.

148
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Second,

149
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
you don't care about your own safety

150
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
at this critical moment.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You saved half of Yongxue City

152
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
with your own strength.

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you are willing

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
to lead the Alliance,

155
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
you will be able to help.

156
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
But

157
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the only thing that bothers you

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
is that

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
you were captured by the dark jade saintess

160
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
ten years ago

161
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and the dark jade saintess.

162
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
So,

163
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
before you become the new leader,

164
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
you must kill the dark jade saintess first

165
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
and completely break the boundary with the dark jade saintess

166
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to prove your name

167
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and to make a comeback for the Alliance.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The Alliance

169
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Xie Xuechen,

170
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
what are you doing now?

171
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I borrowed paper and ink from Nan Xuyue.

172
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Nothing else.

173
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I just want to remind you

174
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
to kill me.

175
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
A good person with a good intention

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
is still a bad person.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Such a simple reason

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
can't you understand it?

179
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't feel burdened.

180
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
After killing me,

181
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
as long as you prepare good wine and good meat for me in the next few days,

182
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I won't blame you.

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I hope that we can meet again in the next two years.

184
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
I hope that we can spend more time together.

185
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You and I, we are one person and two dreams.

186
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We have nothing to do with each other.

187
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I have no regrets in this life.

188
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I will be by your side.

189
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
I will be by your side.

190
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Qiu Min.

191
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Master.

192
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
It's so late.

193
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Why are you outside my house?

194
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The people from Snow-Cover City came.

195
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
They said that they would invite you to the Hall of Eternal Bliss tomorrow.

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
They want to deal with Mu Xuan Ling.

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
You are not a good person.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
You are not a good person.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
You are not a good person.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
You are not a good person.

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You are not the demon girl who sympathizes with you.

202
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
You want to plead for her, right?

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
How many times do you have to make the same mistake?

204
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
When did you learn to be so soft-hearted?

205
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
You sympathize with the spiritual clan and the dark clan.

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Master.

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
She saved us once.

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
And the mourning suit.

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
She died for me.

210
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I owe her a favor.

211
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
So can you go and plead for her tomorrow?

212
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I will beg you.

213
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Master.

214
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You are as kind as your mother.

215
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
But Qiu Min.

216
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Some people are not worth your concern.

217
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
They shouldn't have appeared.

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
And they shouldn't have stayed.

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Not to mention.

220
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Xie Xue Chen is the city leader of Yong Xue City.

221
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If you want to save the dead and calm the dispute.

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You have to kill the demon girl yourself.

223
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Otherwise, the name of Yong Xue City.

224
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Will be covered by dust.

225
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Kill me.

226
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Use my life to prove your steady style.

227
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
To calm the dispute between you and the dark clan.

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Master Xie.

229
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
Before becoming the leader.

230
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,000
You have to kill the dark god first.

231
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
And make a clear connection with the dark clan.

232
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Kill me.

233
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
You are still the one.

234
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The one who killed me.

235
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
The one who knows the truth.

236
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Mu Xuan Ling.

237
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let's go.

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
She finally figured it out.

239
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Listen to people's advice.

240
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Eat enough.

241
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Let's go.

242
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Let's go.

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Although Miss Mu is the daughter of the god.

244
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
She didn't do anything bad.

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
We treated her like this.

246
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
It's too cruel.

247
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Luckily I didn't tell A Bao.

248
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
If she knew.

249
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
She would be very sad.

250
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Nan Xue.

251
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Let's go.

252
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Don't care about her.

253
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
It's too cruel.

254
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Coming.

255
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Master.

256
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
She is here.

257
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Do you have anything else to say?

258
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Yes.

259
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
Your wound.

260
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
Is it healed?

261
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's healed.

262
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Then I can rest assured.

263
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Let's start.

264
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Let's go.

265
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
Master.

266
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Master Xie.

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What do you mean?

268
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Why don't you kill her?

269
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
She has been in Yongxue City for a thousand years.

270
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
It's enough.

271
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,000
She is the daughter of the god.

272
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Only one of these can make her die.

273
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Master Xie is so afraid that it's hard to convince everyone.

274
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Especially.

275
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It will make the Xuan Tian Sect.

276
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Everyone is sad.

277
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Miss Mu was controlled by the evil aura.

278
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
After the god's will was restored.

279
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
She stopped the red shadow.

280
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
She was so angry.

281
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She tried it.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
How to deal with it.

283
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's the choice of the living.

284
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you don't kill her.

285
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
I will kill her.

286
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Master.

287
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
This is Yongxue City.

288
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This is my decision.

289
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Master Xie.

290
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You want to cover her up.

291
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
The one who protects the sinner is covered.

292
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
And the evil aura.

293
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
You want to cover her up.

294
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
And Mu Xuan Ling.

295
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
She is innocent.

296
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
Innocent?

297
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
What do you mean?

298
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Since the dark aura.

299
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Mu Xuan Ling has been helping me.

300
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Helping the god.

301
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
She is chasing the evil aura.

302
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Kill the three shadows.

303
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
She can even sacrifice her own life.

304
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,000
Such a person.

305
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If the god's alliance is only because of her identity.

306
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Then it's a crime.

307
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Taking her life.

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's the god's alliance's fault.

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I don't agree.

310
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I don't respect it.

311
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Master Xie.

312
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Don't be so evil.

313
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Is the evil of Princess Su the truth?

314
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I, Xie Xue Chen.

315
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Have my own way.

316
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
And my own judgment.

317
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
To separate Mu Xuan Ling from the evil aura.

318
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
It's not to punish her.

319
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
But to let her get out of the dark aura.

320
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
To beg her for a thousand years.

321
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
To end the past.

322
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
From now on.

323
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Mu Xuan Ling.

324
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Is the person of my Yong Xue City.

325
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
I didn't expect that Master Xie is a thoughtful person.

326
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Miss Wu is not dead.

327
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's a good thing.

328
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
It's a good thing.

329
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Master Xie.

330
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Your feet were hurt.

331
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Congratulations for the slaying.

332
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
We all called it S6.

333
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,280
is the best strategy.

334
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,760
Once the needle is started,

335
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,840
it will cause great damage to the person who is not equipped.

336
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,400
If it's not related to life and death,

337
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,720
you should use it carefully.

338
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,760
Even if it's the end of life and death,

339
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,240
it's also destined to happen.

340
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,080
Why do we need to escape from the formation?

341
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
Maybe this formation

342
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,080
will never be useful one day.

343
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,440
I thought the formation that won't be useful

344
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,320
was almost used.

345
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,800
I thought the person who won't find it

346
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
will meet again.

347
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,800
Wu Xuan Ling,

348
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:13,920
I won't let you die.

349
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,360
You are my present.

350
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,120
Wu Xuan Ling,

351
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,160
I'm sorry.

352
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:37,400
I didn't give you a chance to choose.

353
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,120
Did you gear up for me

354
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,080
and leave?

355
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,440
I'll go to encourage you to be my brother.

356
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:32,280
Is it addressed as

357
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,280
and disguised as a corpse.

358
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,560
For you,

359
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:37,680
he refused.

360
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,760
There's another way.

361
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,080
If he leaves the Demon Palace,

362
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,440
there won't be any more demons.

363
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,360
The Disperse Palace is very dangerous.

364
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,680
To a spirit clan with broken spirit,

365
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,120
it will eventually cause the body to deteriorate

366
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,560
and die.

367
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,560
If he has the Jade Prowess Fox,

368
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,560
he can live.

369
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,960
This is another secret.

370
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,600
First,

371
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,640
return Great Thiominous spirit back to the Moon Z seafood,

372
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,000
and communicate with the scene to me.

373
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,120
Without this,

374
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:15,800
I would die.

375
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,320
Ten years ago,

376
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,240
my father was Risaged in the Mountain posts of the Moon.

377
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,840
That was my clan's Disperse.

378
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,360
A human clan has to

379
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,120
first open the Yin and YangApplause Clan

380
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,120
and hurt by it.

381
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,160
So I've been practicing the healing method since I was a child.

382
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,920
I've been practicing the Yuchue skill since I was a child.

383
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,480
I've been practicing the skill for three days.

384
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,840
My cultivation has been improved.

385
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,480
The Yuchue skill

386
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,000
still works?

387
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,440
So,

388
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,320
you're going to practice the skill for him?

389
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:56,840
Yes.

390
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,000
After he has the skill,

391
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,680
he can practice the spiritual power

392
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,520
and no longer suffer from the pain of demon-deceiving.

393
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,240
He won't have to be afraid of the burning of the sun

394
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,240
and go back to the dark domain.

395
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,160
He can live in the mortal world

396
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,240
in a dignified and good way.

397
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,880
It's enough to change the three realms

398
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,240
if the spiritual power is strong enough.

399
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,320
But,

400
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,680
what's the point?

401
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,800
Mu Xuan Ling,

402
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
live well

403
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,960
and continue to be that interesting person.

404
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,680
Give this boring world

405
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,400
something new.

406
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,520
Mu Xuan Ling.

407
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,120
Mu Xuan Ling.

408
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:51,960
Thank you, sir.

409
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,000
I'm cold.

410
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,640
I'm cold.

411
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,760
Mu Xuan Ling,

412
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,360
hold on.

413
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,680
Three days left.

414
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,240
Three days later,

415
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,640
I'll take you to see the mortal world.

416
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,480
Okay?

417
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,120
I just went to see

418
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,560
a new batch of martial artists.

419
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,040
They've been fighting for over an hour.

420
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,240
They still haven't decided who will win.

421
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,840
They're really not as good as the first batch.

422
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,640
I'm not saying that

423
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,120
they're very good at fighting.

424
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,040
They're far worse than the Saintess of the past, right?

425
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
What are you doing?

426
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,800
You want to fight too?

427
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,640
Come on.

428
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,840
Shut up.

429
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,560
How dare you mention Saintess?

430
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,640
You're in a bad mood these two days

431
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,720
because

432
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,840
Saintess would rather die than return to the dark.

433
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,120
How dare you mention her?

434
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,360
You're looking for death.

435
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,280
Chi Ying is back.

436
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,280
Chi Ying,

437
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,840
you're good.

438
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
You should go out

439
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,320
and blow up the 500-year-old sword.

440
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:49,920
The aura of the Copper Fish

441
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:52,960
is not worth enjoying.

442
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:54,920
It's not worth enjoying.

443
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,800
In just a few days,

444
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,000
my cultivation has reached such a level.

445
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Chi Ying,

446
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,280
you've hurt your body with the Golden Pellet.

447
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,760
You've hurt the enemy and hurt yourself.

448
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,320
You're really good.

449
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,680
I'll kill Xie Xue Chen sooner or later.

450
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:19,920
Enough.

451
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,240
Stop talking.

452
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
Go to the Xukong Sea and soak yourself.

453
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,960
I...

454
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,960
I don't like my friends who are too weak.

455
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
I just came out of the Xukong Sea.

456
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,560
I feel strange.

457
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,880
The aura of the Xukong Sea is so loud today.

458
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,240
It's like

459
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
something is going to happen.

460
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,960
Chi Ying has to go back.

461
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,080
Do it again.

462
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,800
I have to go back.

463
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,000
How long do we have to stay in the Então City?

464
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,680
It's so cold.

465
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
How can he leave?

466
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,040
Half of the disciples of Snow Tower

467
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,920
have been sent to guard the tower.

468
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:27,720
How long will it take

469
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:28,880
for the tower to be repaired?

470
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,200
Although the magic of the tower

471
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,680
will be confused by itself,

472
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,160
it will take ten days

473
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,960
and half a month.

474
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,120
That long?

475
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,000
Then Master Xie doesn't want to think of a way.

476
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,160
Speaking of Master Xie,

477
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,480
I heard that

478
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,360
he took Mu Xuan Ling back to his room

479
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,240
and didn't leave for three days and three nights.

480
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,080
Could it be that

481
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,040
Snow Tower

482
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,680
will have another

483
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,480
lady master with the same background as the Lin family?

484
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,320
The owner of Snow Tower

485
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:52,800
was turned upside down

486
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
by a demon girl.

487
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,320
If this is spread,

488
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,880
it will be a disgrace.

489
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,320
It's a disgrace to

490
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,320
their Yong Xue City.

491
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,480
Xie Xue Chen didn't say anything.

492
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,200
What are you two sisters

493
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,080
worrying about?

494
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:03,920
Junior Sister Gao,

495
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,840
we're just talking.

496
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:06,600
Besides,

497
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,360
it's not just us.

498
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,760
Other sects are also discussing it.

499
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:10,680
Don't discuss it.

500
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,520
Are we going to

501
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,520
be together in the Palace of Jin?

502
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,480
Junior Sister Gao,

503
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,920
Master Xie hurt your father.

504
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,280
Why are you still helping him?

505
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,360
What do you want me to do?

506
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,840
Should I kill him to take revenge?

507
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,480
But he saved me back then.

508
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:23,880
If I want to take revenge,

509
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,240
I was also captured

510
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,520
in Yun Xiu Villa.

511
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,840
If I get the captured one,

512
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,120
I'll be in trouble.

513
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:29,720
Well...

514
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,400
I didn't mean that.

515
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,960
Anyway, we're in the Palace of Jin.

516
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,360
We won't be talking behind their back.

517
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,560
You two sisters

518
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,520
should be careful.

519
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,600
If you talk too much,

520
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,760
you'd better give it to me.

521
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
You even help your enemy.

522
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,040
You should be punished.

523
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:51,680
You're awake.

524
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,240
You have to keep me alive

525
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,840
and take care of my work.

526
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:58,840
You're not tired

527
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,880
after three days and nights.

528
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,720
You haven't fully recovered yet.

529
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,560
You should rest more.

530
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,480
The sunshine is so nice today.

531
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,080
I thought I would die without a trace.

532
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,280
The Demon Palace is gone.

533
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,680
Why am I still alive?

534
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,600
How did you do it?

535
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,280
It's your fate.

536
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,480
You don't have to keep it from me.

537
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,000
I'll let you die alone.

538
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,360
You don't want to tell me?

539
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,160
I know that even if you don't tell me.

540
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,360
It's not easy.

541
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,320
I once asked you

542
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,720
if I was willing to enter the Demon Palace

543
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,520
and become an ordinary person,

544
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,320
would you protect me?

545
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,360
I seem to have an answer now.

546
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,080
I have to help my enemy

547
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,680
so that they couldduce me.

548
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,640
What should I do?

549
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,320
I lost the title of the red-uzzard capital seal.

550
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:45,360
You lost the title of pattern repair 전� Maintenant,

551
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,680
but I was alreadyaanobaku indeed,

552
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:49,520
I don't care if I don't have any chance.

553
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,400
Later, I will tell you.

554
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,480
Why don't you be lucky that I would get the chance

555
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,480
to make up for the loss?

556
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,640
My body is just recovered.

557
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,720
I might have a sus todo time.

558
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,440
You then have sus todo time?

559
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,520
I have 1000 years of life for the cinnabar.

560
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,520
What's the meaning of this?

561
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,520
You want to use the Fish God to protect me?

562
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
Just coincidentally.

563
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,520
Will you bring me the lock of the spirit ring?

564
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
No.

565
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,520
Then will you put me in a spell?

566
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:39,520
I won't.

567
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Then how are you planning to hold me?

568
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,520
You've recovered.

569
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:47,520
We'll go down the mountain tomorrow.

570
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,520
You're going to leave with me?

571
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,520
I'll take you to see the human world.

572
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,520
I still have some things to deal with.

573
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Have a good rest.

574
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,520
Mu Xuan Ling.

575
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,520
I never thought that you would have such a time to change your ways.

576
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
The strong are weak because of this.

577
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,520
The wise are foolish because of this.

578
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,520
Nan Xu Yue is indeed right.

579
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
Love is not my love.

580
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,520
I heard that you've been in the temple for many days.

581
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,520
You finally told me why the Taoist star collapsed.

582
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:54,520
A few years ago, I met someone.

583
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,520
Someone who made me have a new demon.

584
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
Who?

585
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
The Master of the Vast Immortal Pavilion.

586
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm the Master of the Vast Immortal Pavilion.

587
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,520
Why were you here till now?

588
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Remember, someone near you.

589
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,520
I remember, someone was aloneressed by Lord Whyan in the palace.

590
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,520
He just offered two drops of the Väst dependency.

591
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,520
I almost ran her to the Gu Howら.

592
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,520
I already left here with you this morning.

593
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,520
and be able to see the stars,

594
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,120
recover my original self,

595
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,960
no longer have selfish desires,

596
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,120
no longer suffer from unfulfilled desires,

597
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,880
then there will be no more love in the world,

598
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,560
and no more love in the heart.

599
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,240
You really have woken up.

600
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,240
I wanted to forget this,

601
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,840
but I don't know why

602
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,080
I can't forget it the more I want to forget it.

603
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,160
Day and night,

604
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,160
the seasons change.

605
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,760
His words

606
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
will appear in my ears

607
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,160
from time to time.

608
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,040
Gradually,

609
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,360
I think his words are right.

610
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,080
So you colluded with the Xiu Xian Pavilion and the Dark Clan

611
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,440
to expand the power of the Xuan Tian Sect

612
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:32,600
and make everyone in the world

613
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,960
to be defeated by the Xuan Tian Sect.

614
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,000
I want to be Buddha,

615
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,600
I want to be a demon.

616
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,440
You want everyone to follow the path of the Xuan Tian Sect.

617
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,160
Have you ever asked them if they are willing to?

618
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
If they would rather have love and hate,

619
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,640
suffer from unfulfilled desires,

620
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,160
and sink into desire,

621
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
you want them to follow the path of the Xuan Tian Sect,

622
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,880
they can do it in time.

623
00:38:54,760 --> 00:38:56,240
Won't there be hatred in their hearts?

624
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,640
Now that there are so many people in the Xuan Tian Sect,

625
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,080
there are a few who are really like you said,

626
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,480
and are very happy.

627
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,080
Is there no way

628
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,560
to make this world

629
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,200
have no more demons?

630
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,480
I once thought

631
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,160
the sound of the demon's heart

632
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,080
is a shadow of man.

633
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,320
The reason why shadows exist

634
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,280
is because we live under the sun.

635
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,080
The golden house is born,

636
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,760
the sunset is long,

637
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,680
the sun rises, the sky is short.

638
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,160
The real way to touch

639
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,520
is to create a

640
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,120
yellow and bright sea and night harmony.

641
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,760
Everyone has a place to live in happiness.

642
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,160
The heart and the demon

643
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,200
have no place to live.

644
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,960
But how to achieve

645
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,480
this yellow and bright world

646
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,400
is a difficult question.

647
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,400
The more I see it,

648
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,720
the more I feel that the human race is on the wrong path.

649
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:00,880
Under the Alliance,

650
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,960
the human race's life is getting more stable.

651
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,600
However, in contrast to this,

652
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,440
the spirit clan is driven to a cold place,

653
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,280
or is trapped in slavery

654
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,040
and has hatred in his heart.

655
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,720
It's not necessarily that

656
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,880
the absolute master is to live in peace.

657
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,760
So what should be done now

658
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,280
is not to kill,

659
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,440
but to find a kind of

660
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,800
just-right balance and coexistence.

661
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,280
It's different.

662
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,600
Thank you for solving my problem.

663
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,080
I have three things

664
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,120
to know the answer.

665
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,320
Please tell me.

666
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:52,640
The first thing is

667
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:56,080
where is the master of the Xiu Xian Pavilion?

668
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,640
I don't know.

669
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,200
The second thing is

670
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,640
the Alliance's various sects arrived at Yongxue City that night.

671
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,160
I was attacked by someone.

672
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,280
That person was wearing black clothes and was blindfolded.

673
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,120
His cultivation is above Yuan Ying.

674
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Under the statue,

675
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,640
he should be from the Xiu Xian Pavilion.

676
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,720
Who is he?

677
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,880
The master of the Xiu Xian Pavilion

678
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,560
is sitting on the most trusted messenger,

679
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,040
Yuan Ying.

680
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
But his face

681
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,040
has been hidden under the mask of black gold.

682
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,720
I don't know who he is.

683
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,400
I'm sorry that I can't help you.

684
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,360
Master,

685
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,320
it's time to talk about the third thing.

686
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,360
The third thing

687
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,680
is to prove it.

688
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:59,040
The Alliance's situation

689
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,800
is very serious now.

690
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,160
I'm the one who made the mistake.

691
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,160
It's hard to ask for help.

692
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:11,680
Now,

693
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,040
my brother is dead.

694
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,480
I'm very guilty.

695
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,880
Thank you, Master.

696
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,920
Thanks to the efforts of our Xuan Tian Sect

697
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,520
to resist the dark clan for a thousand years,

698
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,800
don't pursue the Xuan Tian Sect.

699
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:34,400
Okay.

700
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,240
The Alliance's situation is very serious now.

701
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,840
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

702
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

703
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:03,520
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

704
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:04,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

705
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

706
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

707
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

708
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

709
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,680
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

710
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

711
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

712
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,680
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

713
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,080
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

714
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

715
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:19,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

716
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

717
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:22,680
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

718
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,080
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

719
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:26,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

720
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

721
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

722
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:30,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

723
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

724
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

725
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:35,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

726
00:43:35,480 --> 00:43:37,080
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

727
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,680
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

728
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:40,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

729
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

730
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,680
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

731
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

732
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

733
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:48,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

734
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,280
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

735
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,880
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

736
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,680
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

737

I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,080
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

744
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,480
I'm afraid that the Alliance will be defeated.

745
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,880
