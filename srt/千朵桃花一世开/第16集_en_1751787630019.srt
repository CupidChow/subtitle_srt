1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,260
The

2
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,260
The

3
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,260
The

4
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,260
The

5
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:10,260
The

6
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,260
The

7
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,260
The

8
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:16,260
The

9
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,260
The

10
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,260
The

11
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,260
The

12
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:24,260
The

13
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,260
The

14
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,260
The

15
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:30,540
pouvoir

16
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,820
isation

17
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,820
recite

18
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:44,820
also

19
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:01,860
If your master knows that you're leaving me,

20
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,660
he will definitely make things difficult for you.

21
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:07,060
He hopes that you can marry Gao Feng Xu,

22
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,060
the leader of the Alliance.

23
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:16,260
I'm afraid that you'll be in danger if you go.

24
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,460
I won't listen to your master on this matter.

25
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:23,260
After Master and I say goodbye,

26
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,660
let's go to a place where no one can find us.

27
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,660
Okay?

28
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,860
Okay.

29
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,060
I'm not by your side.

30
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,860
Only he can protect you.

31
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:38,260
Ning Qi!

32
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,060
Why?

33
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,060
Because you disgust me.

34
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,460
So,

35
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,260
you were lying to me

36
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,460
about everything before.

37
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,260
I'll kill you!

38
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,660
From beginning to end,

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,860
it's all a trap.

40
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,060
As the Young Princess of Jing Hua Palace,

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,860
how can I fall for a lowly person like you?

42
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,660
Greetings, Saintess.

43
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,460
I wonder

44
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,660
if there's anything in this world that can make you hurt.

45
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,860
It's suitable that you summon me.

46
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,060
Your kidney was taken by the Alliance.

47
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,060
This is the magic weapon I've made for you.

48
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,060
It's called Duan Nian.

49
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,260
Duan Nian?

50
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,260
Duan Nian?

51
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:33,060
Duan Nian?

52
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,460
Duan Nian?

53
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:37,860
Duan Nian?

54
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,860
Duan Nian?

55
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,260
Duan Nian?

56
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,060
His power

57
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,460
is much stronger than the judgement of the Demon Hall.

58
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,860
Duan Nian?

59
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,260
I like this name.

60
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,860
Is the Chaos Bead in Snow Tower fake?

61
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,260
The Chaos Bead has been sealed in Snow Tower.

62
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,860
How could it be fake?

63
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Could it be that the Lord of the Vast Hall

64
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,860
has found an excuse to make a false accusation?

65
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:17,460
He wouldn't be so stupid.

66
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,460
Master,

67
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,060
I'm willing to go to the mortal world

68
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,260
to find the real Chaos Bead for you.

69
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
No hurry.

70
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,180
You haven't found your own

71
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,860
and matured Yuchue Palace yet.

72
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,460
You should stay in the dark

73
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:33,460
and have a good time.

74
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,460
Now that Lord Xie has taken you to the Demon Hall

75
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:41,060
and passed you to Yuchue Palace,

76
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,060
don't let him down.

77
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,460
Yes.

78
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,460
What a righteous light,

79
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,260
cold and fierce.

80
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,460
You should use your love

81
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,060
to make up for your loss.

82
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,860
Why didn't I kill him with one arrow?

83
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,060
It's so easy.

84
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,460
So good.

85
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,060
Yes.

86
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,860
Why didn't you kill him with one arrow?

87
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Simple.

88
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:20,460
When I succeed in Yuchue Palace,

89
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,460
I'll take Xie Xuechen's head

90
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,660
and watch the Master's Palace

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,660
in the Demon Hall.

92
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,860
Lord Xie paid a lot of price

93
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,860
to protect the Chaos Bead.

94
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,660
But in the end, it's a fake one.

95
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,060
But when was the Chaos Bead changed?

96
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,060
I'm afraid it's a fake

97
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,060
when it's put in the pig's foot.

98
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,660
I believe

99
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,460
that with Lord Xie's character,

100
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,660
he won't do such a thing.

101
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,460
Besides,

102
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,860
he risked his life to protect the Chaos Bead.

103
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:04,060
So we can get rid of his suspicion.

104
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,860
So it's before the pig's foot was put in.

105
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,660
Is it Mingyue Villa?

106
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,660
But at least we can know

107
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
the real Chaos Bead

108
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,060
wasn't in the hands of the Star-gazer.

109
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,260
It's a good luck.

110
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,260
We'll make a good use of it.

111
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,260
I believe

112
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,660
it's a fake.

113
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,860
The Chaos Bead is missing in Yongxue City.

114
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,060
I'll find the real one

115
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,260
and explain it to you.

116
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,660
But you should understand

117
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,260
that what the Star-gazer needs to protect

118
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,860
is never a specific thing.

119
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,060
It's the peace of the human race

120
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,460
and the world.

121
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,660
It'll never change.

122
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,060
It's good that Lord Xie is fine.

123
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,660
We're waiting here today

124
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,260
because we have a thing

125
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,460
that we hope you can accept.

126
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,460
Lord Bixiao,

127
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,860
we beg you to take the position of leader.

128
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
Lord Xie only died in the capital.

129
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,660
He has killed the human race many times.

130
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,260
He's the most meritorious person

131
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,260
in the Eastern Alliance

132
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,060
and the happiest person.

133
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,460
We're willing to protect the human race

134
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,060
from the leader.

135
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:23,060
Lingji Island is willing to be the leader.

136
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,260
Xuan Tianmen is willing to be the leader.

137
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,260
Jinghua Palace is willing to be the leader.

138
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,060
I'm no longer the leader.

139
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,660
Please choose another person.

140
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,460
Lord Xie,

141
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,460
that night,

142
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,660
Sang Qi and Xiu Xiange wrote a letter.

143
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,860
We were not strong enough to resist.

144
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,360
It made the people and the chaos

145
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,060
to be in danger.

146
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,460
And it's all because of

147
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:05,060
our failure and fault.

148
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,860
Fortunately, with you, Lord Xie,

149
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,260
everything didn't go wrong.

150
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,460
We've seen it very clearly.

151
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,260
The thing that the Alliance wants

152
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,460
can't be done by us.

153
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,260
Although you're not the leader,

154
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,460
the Alliance needs a new leader

155
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
to continue to move forward.

156
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
In this way,

157
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,060
the human race will have hope and future.

158
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,660
Therefore,

159
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,860
I beg you to grant me this.

160
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,660
I beg you to grant me this.

161
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,260
I'll just temporarily take the position of leader.

162
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,660
But everything is over.

163
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,660
Please choose another leader

164
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,260
to be the leader.

165
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,260
Temporarily?

166
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,460
The loss of the Chaos Bead

167
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,460
won't be hidden for long.

168
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,660
Please go back to the city

169
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,260
and be safe.

170
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,660
I'll lead the disciples of Yongxue City

171
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,460
to the Mount Liangjian to stop

172
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,260
in case of danger.

173
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,660
Jinghua Palace is closest to Mount Liangjian.

174
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Please send the disciples to help.

175
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:15,860
Yes.

176
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:18,060
Yes, leader.

177
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:32,260
It's true that the Alliance respects you.

178
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
It's also true that they push you out.

179
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,260
The position of leader of the Qiang family

180
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,060
is not very good.

181
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,660
You only have five words left.

182
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,660
It's not good to be weak.

183
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,260
The two mountains gather in the dark rain and the night.

184
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,460
And gather in the night.

185
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,460
Do you want to save them?

186
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,660
What about you?

187
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,660
Is it the same way to be alone or to be alone?

188
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,660
The Chaos Bead needs to be found.

189
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,060
The Immortal God of War needs to be guarded.

190
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,460
The spiritual and dark tribes need to be guarded.

191
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:12,060
The spiritual and dark tribes need to be guarded.

192
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,460
He needs to be saved.

193
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,460
If I don't go with you,

194
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,460
you will become the first leader

195
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,060
of the Tear Clan of the Alliance.

196
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,060
But before we set off,

197
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,460
I have something to arrange.

198
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,860
Does Gao Xiu know

199
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:37,660
how the Chaos Bead was sent to Yongxue City?

200
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:42,860
Back then, Sang Qi took the Demon King

201
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,260
and killed him in the Mingyue Villa.

202
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,260
I was too young at that time.

203
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,060
I can't remember many things.

204
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,460
I only know that it was Princess Jinghua

205
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,860
and Miao Hua Zunzhe who arrived at that time.

206
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,660
They saved me and took the Chaos Bead away.

207
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Miao Hua Zunzhe is Princess Su's master, right?

208
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,060
Yes.

209
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,660
My mother, Su Ningxi, and my master are sisters.

210
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,460
She was once a disciple of Miao Hua Zunzhe.

211
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,660
But when my mother gave birth to me,

212
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,460
she died of a miscarriage.

213
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,260
Miao Hua Zunzhe personally came to Yongxue City

214
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,860
and sent the Chaos Bead.

215
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,060
He sealed it into the tower with my father.

216
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,660
I asked Elder Cang.

217
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:20,060
The tower has never been opened in recent years.

218
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,060
There is no strange result.

219
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,860
What do you mean?

220
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
My father risked his life to protect the Chaos Bead.

221
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,260
The innocence of Yongxue City is of no use.

222
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,660
There is only one possibility.

223
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,860
The Chaos Bead sent to Yongxue City

224
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,660
was forged.

225
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,060
Then you mean that my Jinghua Palace is a thief.

226
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,460
Miao Hua Zunzhe and my master faked the Chaos Bead

227
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,060
and swallowed the Chaos Bead?

228
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,460
Jinghua Palace is not my enemy.

229
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,460
It's not the enemy of Yongxue City.

230
00:12:48,860 --> 00:12:50,060
I just want to find the Chaos Bead

231
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,660
and stop the First Immortal Pavilion and the Dark Clan.

232
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:54,260
Today, I told Gao Xiu

233
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,660
not to blame anyone

234
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,260
but to ask you for help.

235
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:00,860
You want me to help you

236
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,260
investigate my master?

237
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,060
Yes.

238
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:05,260
When Miao Hua Zunzhe was in Mingyue Villa,

239
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:08,460
he soon passed the position of Princess to Princess Su.

240
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,060
She disappeared from there.

241
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,060
Princess Su is the most likely person to know about the Inner Qi.

242
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,860
Then Sang Qi and my master must be good friends.

243
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:19,060
One of them painted the Mingyue Villa

244
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,860
and the other stole the treasure.

245
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,460
If so,

246
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,060
why did Sang Qi come to Yongxue City?

247
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,060
If Gao Xiu didn't suspect anything,

248
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,060
she wouldn't have come to see me.

249
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,460
You also want to know the truth.

250
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,460
Don't you?

251
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,860
City Leader,

252
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,460
I've packed up

253
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,860
what Junior Xuan Ling left behind.

254
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,860
Should I seal it

255
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,060
or...

256
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,060
Class,

257
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,460
cleaning,

258
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,860
and doing housework.

259
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:13,060
The life in Yongxue City is really boring.

260
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:15,460
The process of becoming an ordinary person

261
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,060
is really long.

262
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
That's strange.

263
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,060
I actually feel that Yongxue City

264
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,060
is a bit interesting

265
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,460
for these boring people and things.

266
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,260
They are the ones who have this kind of fun.

267
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,860
Are they the ones who have fun

268
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,860
or am I becoming boring?

269
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
It turns out that

270
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,860
since the beginning,

271
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,660
I have never escaped from Sang Qi's control.

272
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:53,460
Is it that I can never get what I want?

273
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,460
Whether it's the past

274
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,060
or the present.

275
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,260
Forget it.

276
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,060
I'll just die.

277
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,860
I'll just get what Xie Xue Chen wants to get

278
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,260
for her.

279
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,060
Put these things back to where they were.

280
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:16,460
Keep all the items.

281
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,060
City Leader means

282
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,660
she will come back?

283
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,460
Yes.

284
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,460
Yes.

285
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,660
I heard that the Saintess

286
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,060
used the spirit body

287
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,860
to activate the divine strike.

288
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:40,060
Is what she's practicing today

289
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,460
spiritual power?

290
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,060
I wonder if this spiritual power

291
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:46,460
is weaker than our magic.

292
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,460
Since you are so curious about the power,

293
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,060
let's let you feel it yourself.

294
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,060
In fact, there is no difference

295
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,860
between the power and the magic.

296
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,860
You have to continue to use your power

297
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,860
and know how to control it.

298
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,660
The key is to keep practicing.

299
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,260
How can you be so cruel?

300
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,460
As long as the power is controlled

301
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,460
to a certain extent,

302
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,660
you won't kill the dark clan immediately.

303
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,060
Just like the flame,

304
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,860
it won't burn the world in an instant.

305
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,260
The light

306
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,060
will burn you.

307
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Long time no see.

308
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,660
Recently, Chi Ying and Zhan Ying

309
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,860
are avoiding me.

310
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,060
Are you still

311
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:50,260
bothering about the mortal world?

312
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,860
Or are you thinking that

313
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,860
I lost the magic

314
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,260
and I'm too lazy to care about it?

315
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,460
The friendship between colleagues is so weak.

316
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,860
How could it be?

317
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:02,260
The Honorable Saint is as good as ever.

318
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,860
Recently, we heard that

319
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
the Saintess is busy with spiritual cultivation

320
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,460
and doesn't dare to bother us.

321
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,460
You guys

322
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,860
are also worthy of investigating my Saintess.

323
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,660
You just said

324
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,860
you didn't dare to bother us.

325
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,460
What is the important thing

326
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,060
that you dare to bother us now?

327
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm not going to bother you.

328
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,060
I'm going to see you.

329
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,660
The Honorable Saint wants to see you.

330
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,260
Now?

331
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Master,

332
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,860
you finally let me go to the mortal world.

333
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,860
I heard that you have been

334
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,860
caught a lot of cases recently.

335
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,260
I'm just following Master's orders

336
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
and practicing Jade Pavilion.

337
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,460
It seems that you have been practicing well.

338
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Then go.

339
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,460
Do you know where to start?

340
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,860
Jin Hua Palace.

341
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,060
Young Lord Gao Qiumin

342
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,060
is my self-proclaimed master.

343
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,860
I believe that he will help me find the Soul Bead.

344
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:34,860
Okay.

345
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,260
Master,

346
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,460
do you believe me?

347
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,460
Why do you ask?

348
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,860
Nothing.

349
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,460
I'm just worried that

350
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
last time

351
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,660
I didn't bring the Soul Bead back from Xie Xue Chen.

352
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,460
Will Master be able to

353
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,260
find the Soul Bead?

354
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,460
I'm just worried that

355
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,860
Master will suspect my loyalty.

356
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,860
Don't worry.

357
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Go.

358
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Go.

359
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,260
Mu Xuan Ling is a spirit.

360
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,860
But he wants to act like a dark clan.

361
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,860
It's different this time.

362
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
No.

363
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
Maybe he just acts more like it.

364
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,660
Isn't the Honorable Saint also a spirit?

365
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,060
In my opinion,

366
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:55,460
the Honorable Saint is more dark than the dark clan.

367
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,660
He betrayed a clan once.

368
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Of course there will be a second time.

369
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,860
I don't believe he will really fall for the Honorable Saint.

370
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,060
Honorable Saint, the Saintess is...

371
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,860
You don't need to know.

372
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,460
What about you?

373
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,860
I have got the Jade Pillar.

374
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,860
It's a magic trick.

375
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,860
I just need to practice for a few more days.

376
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:28,660
Then I can control the power and magic power freely.

377
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,260
I can use the enemy's weapon to defeat the enemy.

378
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,460
Isn't it interesting?

379
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Yes.

380
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,460
The Honorable Saint

381
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:16,460
Last time I came to the mortal world,

382
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,860
I wasn't welcomed so warmly.

383
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,860
Mu Xuan Ling.

384
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:21,860
The Princess ordered us to patrol the two mountains day and night

385
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,260
to prevent the dark clan from entering the mortal world again.

386
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,060
I didn't expect that the Holy Lady of Dark Domain came.

387
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:29,060
Su Ning Zhen.

388
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,860
It seems that she really cares about me and the Honorable Saint.

389
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,460
I didn't expect that you would be discovered when I just arrived in the mortal world.

390
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Fine.

391
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,660
I won't expose you.

392
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
I'll kill you all.

393
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,660
Why do you use the magic power?

394
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,860
Isn't it interesting?

395
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:04,660
I don't know if your body is burning faster than the dark clan.

396
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,660
Master Nan.

397
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,860
I knew it was you.

398
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,260
Miss Mu.

399
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,460
We meet again.

400
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,260
How did you escape?

401
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,660
Escape?

402
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,860
Okay.

403
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,860
You were taken away by Sang Qi.

404
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,060
I thought he would hurt you.

405
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,060
Did you do something wrong?

406
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,060
I was trapped in Snow City.

407
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,260
It was Master who took me home.

408
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,660
He treated me very well.

409
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,660
How could he hurt me?

410
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
Home?

411
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,260
Master Nan.

412
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:54,060
Although we know each other,

413
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,060
if you want to help those immortal allies,

414
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,460
I won't show mercy to you.

415
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Miss Mu.

416
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,460
Why don't you tell me

417
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:07,860
what happened after we got back to the dark domain?

418
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,260
Speaking of which,

419
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:12,060
Nan Xun Yue seems to have some feelings for me.

420
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:13,860
Master Nan.

421
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,660
I disappointed you.

422
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,660
I have to find a way to make up for it.

423
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,860
Master Nan.

424
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,260
Since you care about me,

425
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,260
can you help me?

426
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,260
What a...

427
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,460
How can I help you?

428
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,860
For example,

429
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,860
you can solve all the formation in the forest.

430
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,260
Let me kill all the cultivators.

431
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,060
And then?

432
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:44,260
Continue to take the Soul-gathering Bead?

433
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:48,060
Master Nan is always so smart.

434
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,460
In my heart,

435
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,660
I always know you are different from Xie Xue Chen.

436
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,460
You don't care about the immortal allies

437
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,860
or the human clan.

438
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,660
You will help Xie Xue Chen

439
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,460
to see the world of boredom

440
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
and see what's new.

441
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,060
In fact,

442
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:05,260
you care more about me,

443
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:08,860
right?

444
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,260
I can see you.

445
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,060
You can see me.

446
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,260
Master Nan.

447
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,460
Can you stand on my side?

448
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,060
I can give you what you want.

449
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:23,060
Including...

450
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,860
a little bit of love.

451
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
If I can't do this,

452
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,860
my cat road до icy to friendships

453
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,860
and help me to real-life myself,

454
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,260
I will die at the service of ocean.

455
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,460
If you just assistétique maigせて,

456
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,260
you will find what does help you most.

457
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,460
That's the way to appreciate the grav сейчас Frontier is coming.

458
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
Excuse me,

459
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,660
you may get along with her,

460
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,400
but I am afraid

461
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:55,860
you are just an angelal exorcist daughter give to you.

462
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,460
Flowers are the world, men are the world.

463
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,660
How could I die for a mere Xie Xue Chen?

464
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,460
I've been into your play for a long time.

465
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,460
I'm tired of it.

466
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,660
What an enemy.

467
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,660
I'm afraid Xie Xue Chen won't be nice to me anymore.

468
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,860
Mu Xue Ling.

469
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,660
Mu Xue Ling.

470
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,060
Since you've escaped,

471
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,660
why did you run away?

472
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,860
You want to kill me?

473
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
What a pity.

474
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,060
You failed.

475
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,260
Why didn't you chase after him?

476
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,660
Xie Xue Chen is here.

477
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
He can't escape.

478
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,660
But he seems a little strange.

479
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,460
The mole he's holding now

480
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,660
is called the Xie Xue Chen.

481
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,860
Because the life-forms

482
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,060
are the symbol of the Five-star Water.

483
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,460
Five-star Water?

484
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,060
It's recorded in the ancient book of Yin Xiu.

485
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,660
It's a medicine that makes people forget their love.

486
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,060
Forget their love?

487
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,260
Why did he take it?

488
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,660
Do you want to tell Xie Xue Chen?

489
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,260
No matter what the reason is,

490
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,660
he still hates the two kings.

491
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,660
If you were me,

492
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,060
would you tell Xie Xue Chen?

493
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,060
But he doesn't love Xie Xue Chen.

494
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,260
Nor does he love you.

495
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,460
I know.

496
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,460
Have you calculated it?

497
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,660
The ending of him and Xie Xue Chen.

498
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,460
What's the ending?

499
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,860
It's useful.

500
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,460
Yes.

501
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,060
The coldness and murderous intent in his eyes

502
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
were real.

503
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,460
Is it because I abandoned him that day

504
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,460
and hurt him too much?

505
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,660
I'm not afraid of death.

506
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,060
I'm not afraid of death.

507
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,260
It's really a bad start.

508
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:18,260
Why did I end up with the hardest tea in the Alliance?

509
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:20,260
This Xie Xue Chen

510
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,060
is very cunning.

511
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,260
He can't be hard-hearted.

512
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,460
He needs to be punished.

513
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,860
And he'll get carried away.

514
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,060
Xie Xue Chen,

515
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,460
say something.

516
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,060
Don't read it.

517
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,660
You know that

518
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,500
Sang Qi hit Ling Xi on me.

519
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,260
I didn't want to kill you.

520
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,060
He controlled me.

521
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:05,900
Xie Xue Chen,

522
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:08,660
what I said that day

523
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,380
was not my intention.

524
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,660
How could I not love you?

525
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,780
I tried my best

526
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:21,180
to escape from the dark jade.

527
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,940
I just wanted to be by your side

528
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,380
and be with you forever.

529
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,660
Be with you?

530
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,420
What's wrong with you?

531
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,380
It's been days.

532
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,660
Don't you miss me?

533
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:53,620
They say that a little farewell is better than a new marriage.

534
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,980
Anyway, you set a barrier outside.

535
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,340
No one can come in.

536
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,620
How about...

537
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,020
I have something else to do.

538
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,740
Take care.

539
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,180
I knew it.

540
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,540
This is the only way to drive him away.

541
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:54,900
Go.

542
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,100
자� moving

543
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,180
Master.

544
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,260
I was unlucky.

545
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:14,100
A death-like tendency, Xie Xue Chen.

546
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,700
What?

547
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,980
You lost your mask when you first arrived in the mortal realm.

548
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,860
You want me to save you?

549
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,300
There's no need.

550
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,900
to find Gao Qiu Ming in the Flower Palace.

551
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
So,

552
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,220
I want to be with him.

553
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,580
Even if I can't find the Soul Bead,

554
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,180
it's not bad to find more clues.

555
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,300
Are you sure

556
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,620
he will take you?

557
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:41,460
So,

558
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:43,700
I want to ask you for a favor.

559
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,900
If Xie Xue Chen saw me

560
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,460
being ill,

561
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,340
how can he leave me alone?

562
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,020
Alright.

563
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,060
Tonight,

564
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,900
I'll help you to play a show.

565
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,660
In my heart,

566
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,940
I know you are different from Xie Xue Chen.

567
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:15,740
You don't care about the Alliance

568
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:17,100
or the Human Clan.

569
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:18,980
Actually,

570
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,820
you care about me more.

571
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,460
Right?

572
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,580
I can see you through.

573
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,300
You can see me through.

574
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,020
Master Nan,

575
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,220
can you stand on my side?

576
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,420
I can give you what you want,

577
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,100
including

578
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,580
a little bit of love.

579
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:48,900
I know you want to see me.

580
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:53,060
You also feel that she is strange,

581
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,060
right?

582
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:55,500
In terms of her words,

583
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,020
her character,

584
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:59,340
and that Horsechestral Work Old Jet

585
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,060
are all midday employees.

586
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,300
But her mind is clear.

587
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,740
She isn't like that

588
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,900
girl that was controlled by O هذا decoration brought by Yue Chen Yogari that day.

589
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,460
If you want to know,

590
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,100
ask me now.

591
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,260
Okay?

592
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,140
Okay.

593
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,380
I feel right now.

594
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,340
What did you say to her in the forest?

595
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,500
She said she came for the Soul Bead.

596
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,180
She wanted me to help her.

597
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:28,260
And she would give me what I want.

598
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,220
What you want?

599
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,460
Her love.

600
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,540
Nan Xuyue.

601
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,940
You know how to bully people.

602
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,460
Since you asked,

603
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,220
I'm just a subordinate.

604
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,980
Gu outsiders don't want to be bullied.

605
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,340
Big brother,

606
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,940
Miss Leng중 would like to help you.

607
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,420
She Sir Jinzi still won't accept you?

608
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:08,380
She has already betrayed A' record and decided to run away from me.

609
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,900
She didn't like being human 49 years ago.

610
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,940
But for me,

611
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,380
and the people I want to protect,

612
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,980
I can't tolerate her.

613
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,620
I'll protect her.

614
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:25,460
Master Xie has finally become a human again.

615
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:27,700
Just like when I first met you.

616
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,580
You have desire, persistence, and you don't obey your family.

617
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,540
You have to win everything.

618
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,860
She's not a winner.

619
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,180
I won't let her go again.

620
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,100
Even if you're not loyal to her,

621
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
I won't let her go.

622
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,900
I know.

623
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,900
I've known everything since you decided to come to Liangjieshan.

624
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:04,900
Oh, right. I have something to tell you.

625
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,900
I have an urgent matter to attend to at Yunxiu Villa.

626
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:09,700
I'll leave early tomorrow.

627
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,300
What is it?

628
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,300
A secret.

629
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,900
It's fine.

630
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,300
I won't tell you then.

631
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:26,300
It's just that I haven't thought it through.

632
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:30,300
But if I want to tell this secret to someone else one day,

633
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,300
I will tell you.

634
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:34,500
Okay.

635
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,900
What about the Chaos Bead?

636
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,300
Do you have any clues?

637
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,700
I've already asked for help with the investigation.

638
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,300
Although she's the Young Princess of Jinghua Palace,

639
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:48,700
she was also the Young Master of Mingyue Villa.

640
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:53,300
I believe that she doesn't want to be the real Meng Chen.

641
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:09,900
Teacher, be careful. It's hot.

642
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,500
Don't push it.

643
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,900
You've been being so stubborn recently.

644
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,100
Just tell me what's wrong.

645
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,500
Teacher, what is the relationship between Sang Qi and your mother?

646
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,500
Why would the Chun Sheng Sword be her main weapon?

647
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,900
How is she worthy of being compared to your mother?

648
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,900
But how could I fall in love with a Lin Ze?

649
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,900
It's just that I'm kind.

650
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,500
I was so guilty after I kicked her out.

651
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
So I didn't have Jiang Jianqi.

652
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,900
Is that really the case?

653
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,500
Qiong Min.

654
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Master.

655
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,500
You're born to be a wine-drinker.

656
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,900
You're not as talented as Xie Xuechen.

657
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,500
You're a young and loyal master.

658
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,900
But you're too relaxed.

659
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,900
You're still wandering in the Golden Pellet Mirror.

660
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,900
I asked you here today to pass on my skills to you.

661
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,500
Master.

662
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,900
You're not fully recovered.

663
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
If you pass on my skills to me,

664
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:25,500
you'll be...

665
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,100
You don't have that much time.

666
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,300
I'll practice more in the future.

667
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,900
Sang Qi has a grudge against our Jin Hua Palace.

668
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,700
Since he's unwilling to be a part of the dark jade,

669
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,500
he'll seek revenge.

670
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,300
Besides, the Fiend of Chaos,

671
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:55,900
he's the only one who's watching over our Jin Hua Palace.

672
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,900
The world has changed.

673
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,300
It's getting more and more dangerous.

674
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,700
Do you understand?

675
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,100
I understand.

676
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
I understand.

677
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Master.

678
00:38:37,300 --> 00:38:38,500
Are you okay?

679
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,100
I'm fine.

680
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:44,300
Master.

681
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,700
Your hair...

682
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,900
Get out.

683
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,700
Master.

684
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,900
Get out.

685
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,300
I'm fine.

686
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,500
I'm fine.

687
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
I'm fine.

688
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,900
Get out.

689
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
I'm fine.

690
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,100
I'm fine.

691
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm fine.

692
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:31,300
Elder Zai Xi.

693
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,700
Have you waited long?

694
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,500
I came to talk to the princess.

695
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
Yes.

696
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,120
The one who is watching me in the Palace of Flower

697
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:54,120
is not the only one in the world.

698
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:58,620
The world has changed.

699
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,620
It's getting more and more dangerous.

700
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,620
You must be careful.

701
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:06,620
Do you understand?

702
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:09,620
Princess Su is the most likely to know about the inner Qi.

703
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,620
You also want to know the truth, don't you?

704
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,620
What Master said is dangerous.

705
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:20,620
Is it really about Sang Qi or Xie Xue Chen?

706
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,620
Why are you so anxious to pass the message to Qiu Min?

707
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,620
Now that the Chaos Bead is lost,

708
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,620
the Palace of Flower will surely attract the eyes of many people.

709
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:32,620
I can't hold the dark clan anymore.

710
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:37,740
Those dirty things hidden in the shadows will come to the Palace of Flower sooner or later.

711
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:41,740
I can die, but Qiu Min can't.

712
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,740
Mingyue Villa has been destroyed.

713
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:45,740
Mingxi is dead.

714
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,740
Sang Qi may not come to the Palace of Flower.

715
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,740
He can't wait to restore the whole Palace of Flower

716
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:54,740
and destroy the person who caused him to be cut off.

717
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
Why wouldn't he come?

718
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
If your sister didn't fall in love with this spiritual clan,

719
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,740
she wouldn't have done anything wrong.

720
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
What's wrong is to seduce her Sang Qi

721
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,860
and force her to marry Gao Feng Xu's Miaohua.

722
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,860
Miaohua is also for the sake of the Palace of Flower.

723
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
If not,

724
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:14,860
how could Gao Feng Xu agree to give the Chaos Bead to the Palace of Flower for a hundred years?

725
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,860
That's right.

726
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:19,860
Gao Feng Xu wants the Chaos Bead to regain its power.

727
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,860
The Palace of Flower is also based on the world's treasure.

728
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,860
What's wrong with sacrificing one person?

729
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:29,980
Miaohua has never treated her as her own disciple.

730
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:34,980
The love for her is just because she is the body of the Xuan Nu.

731
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:42,980
The body of the Xuan Nu.

732
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:45,980
The jade is immortal.

733
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:49,980
The people of the Xu family know that the dead can live a hundred years.

734
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,980
Who would have thought that

735
00:41:51,980 --> 00:41:55,980
she can also become the wife of the dead in the wedding hall.

736
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,980
I'm sorry.

737
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,980
Can't you forget all of this?

738
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:02,980
You've already been very cruel to Miaohua.

739
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:05,980
It's not enough.

740
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,980
It's all in the past.

741
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,980
Now you are the princess of the Palace of Flower.

742
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Qiu Ming already knows that Sang Qi is related to his mother.

743
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,980
He won't give up easily.

744
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:27,100
He will ask questions that shouldn't be asked.

745
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:29,100
Once someone starts to be curious,

746
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,100
the secret of the past will always be revealed.

747
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,100
Do you dare to let him know?

748
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:37,100
If someone really knows about the Chaos Bead,

749
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:40,100
no one who knows about this secret will open the door.

750
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,100
I won't tell Qiu Ming.

751
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,100
Even if it's the moment I die.

752
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,100
That place is still there.

753
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:52,100
Mingyue Villa still has traces of that year.

754
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:56,220
I know that you don't want to go to the place where Sister Peng Yin has stayed.

755
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:59,220
But now, this love affair,

756
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:02,220
we must make a plan.

757
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:05,220
There's someone.

758
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,220
Is this true?

759
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,220
My mother loved Sang Qi.

760
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:18,220
She was forced to marry Father for the Chaos Bead.

761
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,340
Qiu Ming.

762
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:24,340
I hope that the peach blossoms will bloom with you that day.

763
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:28,340
Look at that person, that dream.

764
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,340
No longer has a face.

765
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:38,340
I have no wish to be with you in this life.
