1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

5
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Episode 5

6
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Is this true?

7
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
We once loved Sang Qi.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
He was forced to marry his father for the Winyang Soul Bead.

9
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Qiu Min.

10
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You heard it.

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But you forgot it.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Go back.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
They say that a little girl is too excited.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Anyway, you set a barrier outside.

16
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No one can come in.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why don't you come in?

18
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Why don't you...

19
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You've been away for a long time.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I couldn't wait for you.

21
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I wanted to sleep first.

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Since you're back,

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
what do you want to do?

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Continue?

25
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a lot of things to do.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I can't protect you all the time.

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'll send you back to Snowblade City first.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Snowblade City?

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
What?

30
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Are you going to lock me up in the prison again?

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No.

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
No one can lock you up in the prison.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
No one can.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
But Xie Xue Chen,

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Sang Qi forced me to help him find the Soul Bead.

36
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Go back to Snowblade City with me first.

37
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll figure out a way to unlock the spiritual energy.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll go with you.

39
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Go.

40
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Go.

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go.

42
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Chief Xie,

43
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you'd better not force him to go to Snowblade City.

44
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Otherwise,

45
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
the spiritual energy that Zun Shang left in his soul

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
will take his life at any moment.

47
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I can still train my head.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you think

49
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
he will come?

50
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Why did Master change his plan?

51
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The sword power of Xie Xue Chen

52
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
is really not good enough for Xiao Qu.

53
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I finally got the head shadow.

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It took only one shot to fly away.

55
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
What a pity!

56
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The head shadow.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
The stupid head shadow

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
locked me in the prison.

59
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
This is the prison of Xie Xue Chen.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Why would I enter his prison?

61
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're really the master of Snowblade City.

62
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You've been thinking about this mountain.

63
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Forget it.

64
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
He's already here.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Let's see what his current greed is.

66
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Stop.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Father.

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I give you ten thousand people

69
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to protect you

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
and the world with my sword.

71
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You disappointed me.

72
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I let you close the gate of Snowblade City

73
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
and erase your thoughts.

74
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
You disappointed me again.

75
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Do you still remember

76
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
how you told me back then?

77
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I'm grateful

78
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
for not being able to go down the mountain.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Since you know your mistake, why didn't you change it?

80
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The previous people

81
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
didn't have the God's Cauldron.

82
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
We couldn't cultivate our spiritual power.

83
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We could only look up to the gods in the sky

84
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and beg for their help.

85
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The God's Cauldron is the gift of the gods.

86
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
You were born with the right way of life.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
You're loyal to the heaven and earth.

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
But you're distracted by your own personal feelings

89
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
and are disheartened.

90
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I don't understand.

91
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Father.

92
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I really don't understand.

93
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I can die for the people of the world.

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I can protect the people of the world for a hundred years and a thousand years.

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Why can't I die for the people of the world?

96
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You can't save the demons.

97
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
He is your desire

98
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
and your heart.

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Kill him.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It's just a fantasy.

101
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Can't you bear to kill him?

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Or

103
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
do you want to stay in this fantasy?

104
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
No.

105
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I won't kill him.

106
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Since I can't let him go,

107
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I won't let him go.

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
He has never been my enemy.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I won't let him go.

110
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
It's not my desire for justice.

111
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
So

112
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm your heart demon?

113
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Yes.

114
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
It's always you.

115
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You're here.

116
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Does it mean

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
that I'm also your desire cage?

118
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Then

119
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm also your heart demon?

120
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I remember

121
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
only two people protect each other

122
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to enter the same desire cage.

123
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Is it true?

124
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Xie Xue Chen

125
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
is also my heart demon.

126
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Mu Xuan Ling

127
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's not true.

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's not true.

129
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Mu Xuan Ling

130
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Mu Xuan Ling

131
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Let's talk about it again.

132
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm not going to kill you.

133
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm not going to kill you.

134
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
We're on two mountains.

135
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
This is a fantasy.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is a fantasy.

137
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll take you out.

138
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Go.

139
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I felt a spiritual wave just now.

140
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
What happened?

141
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
The projection of the jade shadow just now came.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
It mentioned that Sang Qi

143
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
planted spiritual energy in Mu Xuan Ling's soul.

144
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
After we got out of the desire cage,

145
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
she looked like this.

146
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I tried to send the spiritual energy

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
but it didn't work.

148
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The soul of the soul?

149
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Sang Jie planted the spiritual energy

150
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
in the dark jade before.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
It was in the position of the heart.

152
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Now it seems

153
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
the position has changed.

154
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You're the same as her.

155
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Try to find it in her spiritual stage.

156
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
See if there's anything that doesn't coordinate.

157
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll find it.

158
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
It's done.

159
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
She doesn't have the spiritual energy.

160
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Spiritual energy is too important to her.

161
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I dare not force her to leave.

162
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I have to seal it temporarily.

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
If I hadn't let Sang Qi take her away,

164
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
she wouldn't have suffered this torture.

165
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The ashes on her face

166
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
are also the signs of the soul.

167
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Is there anything else on her?

168
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
No.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
My head is dead.

170
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I just don't understand

172
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
why you ordered me

173
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
to lock the Saintess in there.

174
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Because they

175
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
will be in the same prison.

176
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I want Xie Xue Chen

177
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
to know this.

178
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So,

179
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
the Saintess also loves Xie Xue Chen.

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
But why did she...

181
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Why did she turn out to be Scholar Xie?

182
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Even if you remember anything,

183
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
you will still gotต bones.

184
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You will be hurt again and

185
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
forget all your feelings again.

186
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Xie Xue Chen, who he loves

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
and Scholar Xie's Meng Xuan Ling,

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
good student.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,680
I...

190
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,840
Xie Xue Chen.

191
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,560
Get out of my way.

192
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:45,880
Mu Xue Ling.

193
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,920
Xie Xue Chen.

194
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,080
Xie Xue Chen.

195
00:14:58,920 --> 00:14:59,840
Xie Xue Chen.

196
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,960
It's okay.

197
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,440
I'm not ready yet.

198
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,200
How can I be?

199
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
The seal has been sealed.

200
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,320
It's okay.

201
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,720
My life is a flop.

202
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:38,280
You owe someone the seal.

203
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,400
Since I have a relationship with Xie Xue Chen,

204
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:51,800
I don't think it's a good idea

205
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,360
to step into the trap quickly.

206
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,080
Perhaps Lord Nan loves you that way?

207
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,360
It's so strange.

208
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,760
Every time I feel that lying to you

209
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,080
is harder than lying to Xie Xue Chen.

210
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:08,440
You can even suffer from the pain of chasing your heart

211
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,600
for lying to him.

212
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,600
As long as I can lie to Xie Xue Chen,

213
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,320
the pain of chasing my heart is nothing.

214
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,120
But I didn't expect that the jade shadow would come.

215
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,480
Maybe Master is afraid that I didn't play it well enough.

216
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,760
If I can suffer from this pain,

217
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,920
Xie Xue Chen will not leave me alone.

218
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,360
If not,

219
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,760
he will definitely send me back to Yongxue City.

220
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,480
This is not within my plan.

221
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,080
You look a bit strange

222
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,840
now.

223
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,480
I am the real me now.

224
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,640
The one before was just a disguise.

225
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,840
And now you only want this paper.

226
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,160
Help me wash up and sleep.

227
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,560
You lied to me

228
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,640
and you didn't tell him.

229
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,360
I was very moved.

230
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:20,760
In my eyes,

231
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,200
Xie Xue Chen was just a central key to eureka pearl.

232
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,080
And you are different from others.

233
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,080
I thought you were a threat when we first met.

234
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,680
But now,

235
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
my thoughts have changed.

236
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,080
Maybe,

237
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,880
we can be friends who are closer.

238
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,080
Right?

239
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,080
You removed the barrier

240
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,680
because you trust her completely.

241
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,080
I know.

242
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,680
She is different from before.

243
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,680
She is suspicious.

244
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,280
But I want to believe her.

245
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
What if she makes trouble again?

246
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,280
If she can make trouble in front of me,

247
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,080
I will be so grateful.

248
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,080
You are the same as your sword.

249
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
You are so unyielding.

250
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:24,480
It seems that you can't afford to bear any result.

251
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,280
I should go.

252
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
But Mu Xuan Ling is...

253
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
Don't worry about her.

254
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
I will take care of her.

255
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:41,880
I see.

256
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,280
I should go.

257
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,280
Master is so strange.

258
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,280
He must have more secrets.

259
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,280
I'm afraid it's related to the Soul Bead.

260
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
I should tell Xie Xue Chen as soon as possible.

261
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:30,680
Go.

262
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,080
Hold on.

263
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:56,880
No.

264
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,880
If Ji Hua Palace's disciples see us,

265
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,680
they will report to Master.

266
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,080
What's so funny?

267
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,280
Didn't you go back to the dark domain with Sang Qi?

268
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,080
My friends and lovers are all in the mortal world.

269
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:19,680
I will come back.

270
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,880
How could Sang Qi let you come back so easily?

271
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,880
I don't believe it.

272
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
Of course I'm so eager to Xie Xue Chen

273
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
that I ran back.

274
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm so sorry.

275
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,480
I didn't expect you to be my friend.

276
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,880
You don't trust me at all.

277
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Friend?

278
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,480
At most, we are

279
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
friends who can say hello to each other.

280
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,680
I'm so happy to give you some of my love.

281
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,280
I overreacted.

282
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,280
If you want to be my friend,

283
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,480
I won't stop you.

284
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,680
But I'm telling you.

285
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,080
Don't play tricks on me.

286
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,080
Or I'll punch you

287
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,080
into pieces.

288
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,280
Then Xie Xue Chen is leaving. Hurry up.

289
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,280
No.

290
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,280
Wait.

291
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Wait.

292
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,280
I can't go there.

293
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,680
If Ji Hua Palace finds me,

294
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:06,680
Master won't forgive me.

295
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,280
Please.

296
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,280
Ji Hua Palace's people

297
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,680
are all out there.

298
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,080
Otherwise, why am I here?

299
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,680
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

300
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Xie Xue Chen.

301
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,680
Gao Xiu came here by chance.

302
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,080
I'm afraid you can't go back.

303
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,680
Gao Xiu came here by chance.

304
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,280
I'm sure she found out something.

305
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,280
Come with me.

306
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
This should be related to

307
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,080
Master Miao Hua.

308
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,480
That is to say,

309
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,080
the previous princess of Ji Hua Palace,

310
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,880
Master Miao Hua,

311
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,280
had an agreement with Master Gao.

312
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,680
Master Miao Hua forced your mother

313
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,880
to marry Master Gao

314
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,480
and use her body

315
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,680
to keep the Soul Bead.

316
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,080
But they didn't say

317
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,080
that Master Miao Hua

318
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,680
replaced the real Soul Bead.

319
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:53,680
Yes.

320
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,280
If the Soul Bead

321
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,680
is not in the hands of Ji Hua Palace,

322
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,280
how could Su Ning Zhen

323
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,880
send the Soul Bead to the young princess?

324
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,280
Could it be

325
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,280
that Master Xie scared her?

326
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,880
But

327
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,880
they did mention the real Soul Bead.

328
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,080
But they didn't mention it.

329
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,280
I came out of the palace

330
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,880
and went to find Master Miao Hua overnight.

331
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,480
I heard that Master Miao Hua

332
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
wandered around the world after taking the princess's place.

333
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,680
No one has seen her again.

334
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,280
So she is still in Ji Hua Palace.

335
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,680
When I was a child,

336
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,280
I secretly followed Master

337
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,880
to the forest near Ji Hua Palace.

338
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,480
There was a cave there.

339
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,280
Master found me

340
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,680
and was very worried.

341
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:34,280
He took me away immediately.

342
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,080
Later, Master told me

343
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,880
that Miao Hua lived there.

344
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
Back then, he was very vicious.

345
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
After he passed the princess's place to my master,

346
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:44,680
he hid there.

347
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,880
Hiding these news

348
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,480
didn't want anyone to bother him.

349
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,080
But

350
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,880
I went to the mountain to find out

351
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,480
that Master lied to me

352
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,480
after I went to the cave.

353
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
You...

354
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Master.

355
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,080
I am Qiu Min.

356
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,080
Gao Qiu Min.

357
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,280
Back then, you and Master

358
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,680
brought me back from the Mingyue Villa.

359
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,080
It was that child.

360
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,880
You...

361
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,480
What's going on?

362
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,480
Of course, it was made by my good disciple.

363
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,480
When my sister died,

364
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,280
my grandfather had a nightmare.

365
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,480
He couldn't sleep.

366
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:39,680
He came to see me

367
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,480
to soothe his mind.

368
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,280
You know what?

369
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,680
Why did you come?

370
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,280
I want to ask where the Soul Bead is.

371
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,280
At the moment of the Snowblade City,

372
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,480
no one found out that it was fake.

373
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,280
No wonder he didn't want to tell me.

374
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,480
He wanted to tell me

375
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,280
that he was going to kill me.

376
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,680
He wanted to pass the message to you.

377
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,880
You hid the Soul Bead?

378
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,280
Where is the Soul Bead now?

379
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,280
No one hid the Soul Bead.

380
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,480
No one could find it.

381
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,480
No one hid the Soul Bead.

382
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,280
No one could find it.

383
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,280
What does it mean?

384
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,680
I don't know.

385
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,080
I've never seen Master

386
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,480
hide anything.

387
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,880
Maybe the Soul Bead is not in the Palace of Pure Flower.

388
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,080
During the discussion between you and the elder,

389
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,280
I mentioned the clues of the Mingyue Villa.

390
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,480
Since they didn't want others to know the truth,

391
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:13,080
in the past,

392
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,280
they might have hidden the key to finding the Soul Bead.

393
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:19,080
I was still young at that time.

394
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,080
I couldn't remember everything.

395
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,280
And my father never allowed me to go to my mother's room.

396
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,480
Then we can only go to the Mingyue Villa to investigate.

397
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:29,680
We have to hurry up.

398
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,480
I sneaked out of the Palace of Pure Flower.

399
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,680
If Master finds it,

400
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,280
he will send someone to find me.

401
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,080
You don't need to...

402
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,480
I will go to the Mingyue Villa with you.

403
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,080
Maybe it's dangerous.

404
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,080
I don't know if there will be any changes in the Soul Bead in your body.

405
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,680
The Soul Bead has been sealed.

406
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,280
Besides, I've learned the Yuchue Skill.

407
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,080
If there's any danger,

408
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:51,280
I should fight with you.

409
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,280
Besides, Nan Xun Yue is not here now.

410
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,080
If anything happens to the Soul Bead,

411
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,080
who can control me except you?

412
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,480
I'm sorry.

413
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:07,080
You don't want me to cause more trouble, right?

415
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
Let's go.

416
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,680
What's going on?

417
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,080
When did Mu Xuan Ling learn the Yuchue Skill?

418
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,480
Isn't that Xie Xue Chen's skill?

419
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,480
And what's the danger of the Soul Bead?

420
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Wait for me.

421
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,880
Can't you explain it to me?

422
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,080
Brother, can you hurry up?

423
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:33,480
Hurry up.

424
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,280
A'bao, I've been eating for days.

425
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,280
Can I have a rest?

426
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,480
But I haven't seen my father for a long time.

427
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,480
I've forgotten his face after I eat.

428
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,880
Didn't you say you haven't seen your father?

429
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,480
I've forgotten his face after I eat.

430
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,080
Okay, okay, okay.

431
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,680
A'bao, don't cry.

432
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,280
I'll help you find him, okay?

433
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
Next one.

434
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,280
I'm hungry.

435
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,680
Brother, can you help me find my father?

436
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,080
A'bao, look.

437
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:41,880
I've been looking for him every night.

438
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:46,480
Bi Xiao Kong didn't hide you.

439
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,880
Where's my father?

440
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,680
I want to find my father.

441
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
I want to find my father.

442
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,880
A'bao, I'm sorry.

443
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,280
I'm sorry.

444
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,680
I'm sorry.

445
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,880
I want to find my father.

446
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,880
A'bao, listen to me.

447
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:04,680
Can you help me find my father?

448
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,280
A'bao.

449
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,280
I want to find my father.

450
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,280
Or there's another way.

451
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,080
Father, I'm begging you.

452
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,880
Just give me the snow sword.

453
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,280
I'll return it to you after I find A'bao.

454
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,080
You don't care about the business in the family.

455
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,880
You don't practice hard.

456
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,880
You're the young master of Yi Gong.

457
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
You surround this girl every day.

458
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,480
How ungrateful.

459
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,480
A'bao is a little girl.

460
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,280
She came all the way to find her father.

461
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,680
I promised her.

462
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,280
I must do it.

463
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,680
What's wrong with finding your father?

464
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,480
She even came to my Bi Xiao Kong.

465
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,880
Really.

466
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:55,880
Her father is Fu Cang Li.

467
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,280
He's the richest man in the world.

468
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,880
I think he might have something to do with our Bi Xiao Kong.

469
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,280
What's his father's name?

470
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,880
Fu Cang Li.

471
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,880
Father, do you know him?

472
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:16,680
No.

473
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,280
I've never heard of him.

474
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,480
You've been reading the ancestral books and the list recently.

475
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
You're looking for his father again?

476
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,080
That girl is from the Lin family.

477
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,480
Her father is Ren Xiu.

478
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,480
Apparently, she married a Lin family's wife.

479
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,480
Do you know where their family lives?

480
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,880
How would I know?

481
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,280
I didn't ask that much.

482
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
A'bao said his father had been gone for years.

483
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,680
He hasn't been home.

484
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
So, father, we have to help him.

485
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,080
We can't find Bi Xiao Kong.

486
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,880
Then you give me the snow sword. I'll go out and find him.

487
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
No.

488
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,280
Why not?

489
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,080
It's just a snow sword.

490
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,680
I'll borrow it.

491
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,280
Yes.

492
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,080
Madam.

493
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,880
Take it out.

494
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,680
Take it out.

495
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:08,880
Snow sword.

496
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,280
Thank you, mother.

497
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,680
You know how to love someone.

498
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,880
This way.

499
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,080
How is it?

500
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Is it comfortable?

501
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,080
I'll teach you again.

502
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
Snow sword.

503
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,680
Thank you.

504
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
A'bao.

505
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,480
Madam.

506
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Why did you borrow it from him?

507
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,880
You used the snow sword too.

508
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,280
Except for what Lan Shen saw,

509
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
he couldn't see anything else.

510
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
The snow sword

511
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,680
needs to be made of pure blood.

512
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,080
So, this fate,

513
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,480
if you can't find it, you can't find it.

514
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,480
What should come back

515
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,480
is destined to be unstoppable.

516
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,680
Let them go.

517
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,280
Maybe

518
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,680
there will be a result.

519
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,680
My dear.

520
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,280
Really help me find my father?

521
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,080
This mirror is called a snow sword.

522
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,880
My father got it from a evil monk.

523
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,480
The evil monk studied the books of blood.

524
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,280
He used his blood as a shadow.

525
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,280
After someone else drank it,

526
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
he could use the snow sword

527
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:43,480
to get the feeling of being connected with his blood.

528
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,080
He can see what he sees.

529
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
I was curious before.

530
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,480
I dropped my blood.

531
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,880
Then I found it.

532
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,280
I dropped my blood.

533
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,680
Then I saw what my mother saw.

534
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,880
Then I dropped my blood.

535
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:01,280
Can I see my father?

536
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,680
No.

537
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,480
You can only see what he is looking at.

538
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,080
Come on.

539
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,080
Who are the three of them?

540
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,480
I can't see clearly.

541
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,680
Why do I feel like I'm losing?

542
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:54,280
So I think...

543
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,480
Your father doesn't want to follow them, right?

544
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,480
Does he want to get the Tao?

545
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
My father has many treasures.

546
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,480
How can he get the Tao?

547
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,280
This kind of forest grass is not common.

548
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:15,080
I heard that it's only near the Mingyue Villa.

549
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,480
I don't know why.

550
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:17,880
I don't know why.

551
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,280
I don't know why.

552
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,680
I heard that it's only near the Mingyue Villa.

553
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,280
Mingyue Villa?

554
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,080
Take the blood sword.

555
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,080
Let's go and see your father.

556
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,280
We're selling vegetables.

557
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,080
We're selling vegetables.

558
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,280
Bun.

559
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,080
Bun.

560
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,280
It wasn't this quiet before.

561
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:44,080
Bun.

562
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,080
Hot buns.

563
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,480
Sir.

564
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,480
I want to ask

565
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:54,480
why the town is so quiet?

566
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:59,480
Do you know that there was a Mingyue Villa here?

567
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,680
It's said that in the past,

568
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,680
there were a group of demons

569
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,880
who cleaned up the entire village.

570
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,880
The repairmen there were all dead.

571
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,080
The town was also affected.

572
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,880
Everyone said that this was an ominous place.

573
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,680
Too many people died.

574
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,080
No one will come to protect us anymore.

575
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,480
If we can leave, we'll leave.

576
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,880
Sir.

577
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,480
Why are you still staying here?

578
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,080
I was born here.

579
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,680
Where can I go if I want to leave?

580
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:37,880
Give me some.

581
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,680
No need.

582
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,480
Okay.

583
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,080
Okay.

584
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
Take care.

585
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,880
After my master was taken away,

586
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,880
I never came back here.

587
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:46,880
I didn't expect...

588
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,480
You didn't kill him.

589
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,480
You should take revenge, not be sad.

590
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,880
He's comforting me.

591
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,480
It's a waste of time to be sad.

592
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:03,680
Let's go.

593
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,480
Let's go to the Mingyue Villa first.

594
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:06,680
Three of you.

595
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,480
Sister.

596
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,480
Long time no see.

597
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,480
The repairman.

598
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,280
Fu Lanshou.

599
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,280
Sister.

600
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,880
I miss you so much.

601
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,680
You're finally back.

602
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:17,680
Sister.

603
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,080
I miss you too.

604
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,480
It would be better if you could show us where the chaos is.

605
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,480
Why does the repairman know we're here?

606
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,880
He's not saying anything.

607
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,680
Brother, I found something.

608
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,480
Come here.

609
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,880
We found that A'bao's father was following you with the blood sword.

610
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,680
So we came with you.

611
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,480
Why did A'bao's father follow us?

612
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,280
We don't know.

613
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,280
We couldn't see anything with the blood sword.

614
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:47,480
I guess he used some method to block the investigation of the magic weapon.

615
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Your father is quite mysterious.

616
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:55,680
So what's your plan next?

617
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,280
We can't use the blood sword.

618
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:01,880
We can only follow you and find A'bao's father.

619
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,880
You haven't found him yet?

620
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,080
No.

621
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,280
I've asked them to send more people

622
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,680
to search along the path to the Mingyue Villa.

623
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,280
If I knew it,

624
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,280
I should have locked him in the room.

625
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,880
Can you lock him to death?

626
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Once he's dead, he won't be at peace.

627
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
I went to the back hill.

628
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,680
The villagers have seen Miao Hua.

629
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,080
He's been more disobedient lately.

630
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,280
Let him see her.

631
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:44,480
The most important thing for a woman is to be in the palace.

632
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
She won't tell him anything.

633
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,880
The most important thing now is not to find the villagers.

634
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
Forget it.

635
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
We can't stay there.

636
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:09,280
Send someone to take the magic weapon to the Mingyue Villa.

637
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Destroy the whole house where my sister lived.

638
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Okay.

639
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,080
Why do you have to be curious about the past?

640
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,680
There are things

641
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,280
that shouldn't be rebuilt.

642
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,080
Go.

643
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
Go!

644
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,480
Gao Shun Shi.

645
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
Gao Shun Shi.

646
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:27,080
What's the matter?

647
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,080
Nothing.

648
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,480
I just thought about some things from the past.

649
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,680
Let's go to my mother's room.

650
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
There might be a clue there.

651
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,280
I didn't expect it to be like this.

652
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,920
You've also experienced the past.

653
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,920
Aren't you afraid of seeing these?

654
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,960
I can't remember

655
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,880
the past.

656
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,600
You can't remember?

657
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,560
You used to be very worried about it.

658
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,560
Isn't it good

659
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,400
that you can't remember?

660
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
This is my mother's room.

661
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,480
This is my first time

662
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,680
coming to my mother's room.

663
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:32,280
A'bao,

664
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,280
this is the reception area.

665
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
Please wait a moment.

666
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
I'll go and check.

667
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:35,880
Okay.

668
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,880
I'll go and check.

669
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:37,480
Okay.

670
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,080
Okay.

671
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,680
Okay.

672
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,280
Okay.

673
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,880
Okay.

674
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:40,480
Okay.

675
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,080
Okay.

676
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:41,680
Okay.

677
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:42,280
Okay.

678
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,880
A'bao,

679
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,680
it's a big room.

680
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,480
Please wait for me outside.

681
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,280
Okay.

682
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:50,880
Let's split up.

683
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,480
It's strange.

684
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:04,680
It doesn't look like

685
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,880
someone has lived here.

686
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:08,080
Could it be that someone

687
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,680
has kept your mother's things?

688
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,080
Impossible.

689
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,280
When I was little,

690
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,880
my father always stayed here all afternoon.

691
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,880
He never let anyone

692
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,280
come close to my mother's room.

693
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,080
This magic array was built by everyone.

694
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,080
We, Bixiao Palace,

695
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,480
also have similar mirror system

696
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,280
to protect

697
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,080
precious magic weapons and spiritual medicine.

698
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,680
Unless we know how to

699
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,080
break this mirror system,

700
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,080
otherwise,

701
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,280
it's impossible to open the gate.

702
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:52,280
I...

703
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,280
I don't know.

704
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,480
Move aside.

705
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,280
I...

706
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,280
I...

707
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I...

708
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,480
The secret is right in front of us.

709
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,880
Let's go and check it.

710
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,480
My mother hid a secret path

711
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:37,280
so deep under the room.

712
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,280
Let's go.

713
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,480
The secret is right in front of us.

714
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:12,480
I'm willing to stay by your side.

715
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,680
I'm willing to stay by your side.

716
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,880
The flowers are blooming,

717
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,680
I'm willing to stay by your side.

718
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:51,680
I'm willing to stay by your side.

719
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:54,280
I'm willing to stay by your side.

720
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,480
I'm willing to stay by your side.
