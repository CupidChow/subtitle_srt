1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,780
The

2
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,780
The

3
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,780
The

4
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:14,780
The

5
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,780
The

6
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,780
The

7
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,780
The

8
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,780
The

9
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,780
The

10
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,780
The

11
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,900
The

12
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,900
The

13
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,900
The

14
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,920
The

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
The

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
The

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
The

18
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
Side

19
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Of

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
The

21
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
Didn't

22
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
To

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
What are you doing?

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,160
Didn't they say they wouldn't help me?

25
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,800
I am chewy.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,920
It's just a movie.

27
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,520
There's no need to be so serious.

28
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,920
He's really going to find his accomplice?

29
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
He's determined to die.

30
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,920
He can't ask for anything by force.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,520
Now he knows he's exposed.

32
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,920
He can't leave the city or heal his wounds.

33
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,120
He can only find his accomplice

34
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,320
and find another chance to send the jade seal out.

35
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,320
How do you know he has accomplices?

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,320
The location of the jade seal is secret.

37
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,920
There are many defenses outside the Palace of Flower.

38
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,920
It's impossible to be easily stolen.

39
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,900
If it wasn't for Su Ning Zhen's

40
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,400
shouting and catching the thief,

41
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,400
then there's only one possibility.

42
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,000
In the Palace of Flower,

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
someone is colluding with the snake forest.

44
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,000
Is there anyone suspicious?

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Right now,

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we'll see if we can catch up with Xu Yue.

47
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,600
You must find a chance to bring the jade seal out.

48
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,600
My wounds can't be healed.

49
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,600
You must help the Chief accomplish his great cause.

50
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
This isn't just the Chief's wish.

51
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
It's the hope of our entire clan.

52
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,600
Go back to the Palace of Flower.

53
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
You go first.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,600
What do you want?

55
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Are you going to summon me to the Palace of Flower

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
or to the Spirit Hall?

57
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,600
Are you threatening me or threatening me?

58
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I won't let you go.

59
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
I'm useless.

60
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,600
When the snake forest died,

61
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,600
his accomplices ran away.

62
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,600
They only brought back the snake forest's spirit elixir.

63
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,600
No way.

64
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
At least you've proved to us

65
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
that he has accomplices.

66
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
What did they say when they met?

67
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,600
The snake forest asked his accomplices

68
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,600
to bring out the jade seal.

69
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,600
They even mentioned the Chief.

70
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
They said it was for the sake of the entire clan.

71
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
They said it was for the sake of the entire clan.

72
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,680
Why are you looking at me?

73
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,680
I don't know anything.

74
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
Chief.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,680
Have you heard of the Immortal Pavilion?

76
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,680
This is the most important place

77
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,680
in the mortal world in recent years.

78
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,680
It's the most important place in the mortal world.

79
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,760
This is a mysterious organization

80
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:21,760
that has been rising in the mortal world for years.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,760
Their behavior is mysterious.

82
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,760
The personnel in the Pavilion are mysterious.

83
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,760
No one has ever really found their traces.

84
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,760
But over time,

85
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,760
there will always be some news leaked out.

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,760
I heard that if you want to join the Immortal Pavilion,

87
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,760
you need to put on a special seal

88
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:38,760
to declare loyalty forever.

89
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:41,760
The Human Clan will print the spiritual stage in the body.

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,760
And the Spirit Clan

91
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,760
will print it on this elixir.

92
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,760
The Immortal Pavilion?

93
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:53,760
The name sounds like it has an enmity with the Immortal Pavilion.

94
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,760
So the Immortal Pavilion has been in the Pavilion for many years

95
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,760
just to join hands with the Dark Clan to get the elixir.

96
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,760
Do you think that the Immortal Pavilion

97
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
is the same group of people

98
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,760
who betrayed your Immortal Pavilion?

99
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,760
According to what the snake forest said,

100
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,760
the reason why they do these things

101
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,760
is also because of the conflict between the Human Clan and the Spirit Clan.

102
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,760
If this matter is not resolved,

103
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
I'm afraid that in the future

104
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,840
the human clan will be in danger.

105
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,840
Let's wait for the news from the Gao Xiu clan.

106
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
We'll return to the jade mausoleum

107
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,840
and wait for the next step of the plan.

108
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
No matter what,

109
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,840
the Soul Bead can't be damaged.

110
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,840
What's going on?

111
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,840
What's going on?

112
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
What's going on?

113
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
What's going on?

114
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
What's going on?

115
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,840
Search carefully.

116
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,840
Yes.

117
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,840
Search.

118
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,840
Yes.

119
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,840
Go over there.

120
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,840
Yes.

121
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,840
What about the snake forest?

122
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,840
Search carefully.

123
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:07,840
It ran away.

124
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,840
It ran away?

125
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,840
With you around,

126
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,840
the snake forest can run away?

127
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
I was badly injured in the dark.

128
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,920
The spirit energy is very strong.

129
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
If it wasn't for Miss Mu's help,

130
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I'm afraid

131
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I would have died in the hands of the snake forest.

132
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Yes.

133
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
It was very dangerous just now.

134
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,920
Thanks to me.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
If I knew you two were like this,

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I wouldn't let you two investigate.

137
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
There is one thing

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
that needs Miss Gao to investigate.

139
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
What is it?

140
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,920
I don't know.

141
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I don't know.

142
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,920
Gongsun Qing.

143
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Come here.

144
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:53,920
Come.

145
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,920
There are hundreds of people left.

146
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,920
How many are left?

147
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
Only twenty left.

148
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,920
Okay.

149
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
Next.

150
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
The disciples are all...

151
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,920
all... all... all right.

152
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
They are all right.

153
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
They... they fell asleep early.

154
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
No one can prove it.

155
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I got you.

156
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
No...

157
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
It wasn't me.

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
If it wasn't you, why are you so nervous?

159
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You can't even speak properly.

160
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I... I...

161
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I was just...

162
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I was just talking.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Everyone in the palace can prove it.

164
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
No one can prove

165
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
your whereabouts last night.

166
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I...

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It was you

168
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
who slept with her last night?

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I...

170
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I am her sister.

171
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I received a letter from home the other day

172
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
saying that my mother was seriously ill.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
So I went to my brother

174
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
to discuss this matter.

175
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Then... then... then...

176
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What about last night?

177
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
What did you two do last night?

178
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I went to the kitchen to steal something

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
and wanted to send it back to my home.

180
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I was found out

181
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
and I was punished for a whole night.

182
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I was punished for a whole night.

183
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,080
Then... you can leave.

184
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,080
Yes.

185
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,080
No.

186
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Next.

187
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,080
The fourth, Zhang Yun's mother,

188
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,080
is the one who slept with her last night.

189
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,080
I am her sister.

190
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
I slept with her last night.

191
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,080
Next.

192
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,080
She slept with her last night.

193
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,080
Next.

194
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,080
You can prove it.

195
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,080
Your Highness.

196
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,080
Thank you.

197
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,080
You are welcome.

198
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,080
I am her sister.

199
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,080
I am her sister.

200
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,080
I am her sister.

201
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,080
I am her sister.

202
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,080
I am her sister.

203
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
How is Xie Xuechen?

204
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
There was some noise in the Hall of Warmth

205
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,160
and the snake spirit of the Sword-Wing Order has died.

206
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
But we didn't find what we should find.

207
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,160
Let them keep watching.

208
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Okay.

209
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,160
What about Qiu Min?

210
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,160
The Young Princess summoned all the disciples in the palace

211
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,160
and is asking about the whereabouts of the day before last night.

212
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,160
She is suspecting that there is a mole in the palace.

213
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,160
Yes.

214
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,160
But there are many disciples in the palace.

215
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,160
The noise is really big.

216
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
The noise is really big.

217
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Do you want me to go to the sedan chair?

218
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,240
No need.

219
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,240
Let her investigate.

220
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
The Palace of Pure Flower hasn't been cleaned for a long time.

221
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,240
It's good to clean it up.

222
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
You go tell Qiu Min

223
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
to search every room

224
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,240
and see where the jade seal is.

225
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
Search every room?

226
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,240
Will it make disciples feel uncomfortable?

227
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Uncomfortable?

228
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,240
I don't just search the room.

229
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
I also have to search the body.

230
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,240
Do they dare to feel uncomfortable?

231
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,240
Of course not.

232
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I'll go tell them.

233
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,240
Zai Xi.

234
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
Princess.

235
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,240
What have you been doing

236
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
all night?

237
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,240
I've been searching the palace.

238
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:15,240
Princess, you suspect me?

239
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
How come?

240
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,240
I just asked randomly.

241
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Zai Xi developed drugs the other day and encountered an ancestral disease.

242
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,240
He went to the bookshop to check the books and books.

243
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,240
Until midnight, he heard the alarm in the palace.

244
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
He knew that the spiritual clan had a jade seal.

245
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,240
When he arrived, the princess had injured it.

246
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,240
The spiritual clan had escaped.

247
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,320
Until today,

248
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I've been practicing medicine in the single room.

249
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
I came out half an hour ago

250
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
to find out what the young princess was doing.

251
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
These can be proven by the disciples

252
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
guarding the bookshop and the single room.

253
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,320
I know.

254
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Go.

255
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,320
Go.

256
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,200
Your

257
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
What are you doing here?

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
It's windy here.

259
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm here to give you some anti-cold medicine.

260
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
I don't drink.

261
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
Then I'll drink it myself.

262
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
This wine is not bad.

263
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
When I was in the dark,

264
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I didn't see the sun.

265
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
Although there were flowers and grass,

266
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
I was in the evil spirit all day long.

267
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
The wine they made

268
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,200
was also poisoned.

269
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,200
We always

270
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,200
drink the poisoned wine with the antidote.

271
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,200
We know it's dangerous,

272
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
but we still can't beat the desire in our hearts.

273
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,200
To get rid of the meat and things.

274
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Now it's good.

275
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Drink as you want.

276
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,200
I heard the highest building in front

277
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,200
is the sword spirit temple.

278
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,200
The nightmare of countless spirits.

279
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,200
If there is no such place as the sword spirit temple,

280
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,200
if the city leader of the flower city is not Song Ningzhen,

281
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:57,200
it looks like a human fairyland.

282
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,200
Why did you lie to Gao Qiangming today

283
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,200
that you can't beat the snake spirit?

284
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,200
I didn't lie to you.

285
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
I didn't lie to him.

286
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
You lied to Song Ningzhen?

287
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
No.

288
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Not only Song Ningzhen.

289
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,160
It's the whole fairy alliance.

290
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,160
I don't know who the mole is.

291
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,160
I can only hide it from everyone.

292
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
Only if I'm weak,

293
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:33,160
the other party will think it's possible.

294
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,120
Our Young Master Xie

295
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,120
has learned to lie.

296
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,120
What is this?

297
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:44,120
The mole is the mole.

298
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,120
Yes, yes, yes.

299
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
I brought you bad luck.

300
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,120
But if they really believe it,

301
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,120
what if they really come to kill you?

302
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,120
Then come.

303
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,120
I'm not going to lie to you.

304
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
What's wrong?

305
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,080
You're not any better.

306
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,080
Our Young Master Xie

307
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,080
is so selfish.

308
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,080
But it's right.

309
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,080
In the face of absolute strength,

310
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:26,080
all the conspiracy is useless.

311
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
So many things to worry about?

312
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
It's very fresh.

313
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,000
What?

314
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,880
Are you curious about how I write yours?

315
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,840
Do you want to see?

316
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,840
I'm not curious.

317
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,560
Po Ao Jiao.

318
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:58,520
Auto верх

319
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,040
The sixth day of the trial

320
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,760
You have to take your medicine in this morning.

321
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
Oh, I'llbox it later.

322
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,360
The tenth day of the trial

323
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,120
I've had no choice.

324
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,000
Apart from you kinderen,

325
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,400
I haven't even touched and held hands

326
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,040
with elements who shaking a nest

327
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,160
along Xiaotian River.

328
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,080
It's really OK.

329
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,240
The protects the pig from inspector Wei's smoke.

330
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,680
Since Tong USDA said

331
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,280
if any unhappy people,

332
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,680
we don't keep the snake in the house.

333
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,560
OK?

334
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,480
But Your Highness,

335
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,400
thank you for giving us the opportunity

336
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,560
Rather than saying it's for someone else,

337
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,560
it's better to say it's for yourself.

338
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,560
You want to make it interesting.

339
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,560
I've been bored for so many years.

340
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
Finally, an interesting person appeared.

341
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,600
And some interesting things happened.

342
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,800
I also want to see what the ending of this story is.

343
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,240
Oh, right.

344
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,640
The night before, when you sent someone back to the Palace of Flowers,

345
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,840
the imperial edict was already sent, right?

346
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,200
Yes.

347
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,360
When you saw Su Ning Zhen,

348
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,680
did you find anything strange?

349
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,320
At that time, the Palace of Flowers was busy searching.

350
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
I also asked Su Ning Zhen a few questions.

351
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:30,600
When I knew the truth, I left.

352
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,720
I didn't find anything strange.

353
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
Are you suspecting Su Ning Zhen?

354
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,360
We came here to investigate.

355
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,480
There were many things that happened in the dark.

356
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,520
She didn't stop us.

357
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,560
It doesn't seem like her.

358
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,000
I saw Princess Su's expression.

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,600
That kind of anger wasn't fake.

360
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,440
Speaking of strange things,

361
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,840
it seems that something is wrong.

362
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,840
I've interrogated everyone in the Palace of Flowers.

363
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,440
I've checked everything.

364
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,920
I didn't find anything suspicious.

365
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,920
And I've searched thoroughly.

366
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:22,560
I've checked the room, but I didn't find the imperial edict.

367
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,720
Xie Xue Chen, did you guess wrong?

368
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,640
There's no eunuch in the Palace of Flowers.

369
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,200
Are you sure that everyone in the Palace of Flowers has been investigated?

370
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,880
I'm sure that everyone of us has been thoroughly investigated.

371
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,080
I even investigated Elder Zai Xi.

372
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,000
Except for my master, my master is impossible.

373
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
There's one more person that you've investigated.

374
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,440
Who else?

375
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
Cui Wan Wan.

376
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,840
That night, when I sent Cui Wan Wan back to the Palace of Flowers,

377
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,760
I went to visit Princess Su.

378
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,800
When I left, I saw a green leaves of the hook.

379
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,880
I don't know much about plants.

380
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
The reason I remember it is because that leaves of the hook

381
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,080
looked quite strange.

382
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,840
And I didn't see any leaves of the hook around here.

383
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,680
I'm curious about where it came from.

384
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,680
But I just thought of it.

385
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,360
I didn't care.

386
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,360
So what?

387
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
Gao Xiu grew up in the Flower City.

388
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
He's familiar with the plants.

389
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
You should know better than us that

390
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,080
there are no leaves of the hook in the Flower City.

391
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,640
So he can only come from outside the city.

392
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,960
There are many hook of the hook on the leaves of the hook.

393
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,360
It's very likely to be on the clothes of people.

394
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,600
The hook is green when it's not removed.

395
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,040
Once it's removed,

396
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,280
it turns into a color in two hours.

397
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:47,120
The crazy man said that the hook is green.

398
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,560
It means that someone came in from outside the city.

399
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,160
Even if there's this leaf,

400
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,840
it might be left by the snake.

401
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
We've investigated.

402
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,640
The snake entered the city four days ago.

403
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,560
If it was him,

404
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
the hook would have changed color.

405
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,040
There are many protective items in the jade seal.

406
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,880
The snake's spirit can't break the formation.

407
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,080
So Cui Wanwan must come back to help.

408
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,680
Gao Xiu Shi.

409
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,400
You didn't come by accident.

410
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
You planned it.

411
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,880
You were taken to the mountain villa by the dark clan.

412
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
Cui Wanwan

413
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,200
took the opportunity to go back to the jade seal.

414
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,040
He wanted to make a proof that he wasn't there.

415
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:35,040
To get rid of the suspicion.

416
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
These are all your words.

417
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,040
Where's the evidence?

418
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,000
Where's the leaf?

419
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,240
I told you that Feng Yao didn't care.

420
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,480
So she didn't bring the leaf back.

421
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,960
Besides, even if she brought the leaf back,

422
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,960
the leaf would have changed color.

423
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,960
It can't prove the time.

424
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
You don't have evidence.

425
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,480
You're just talking nonsense.

426
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Wanwan has been in the flower valley for ten years.

427
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
Everything is fine in these ten years.

428
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,680
It can't be him.

429
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,680
You've asked for the search.

430
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,680
And you've ruled out all other possibilities.

431
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
So the rest

432
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
is the truth

433
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
no matter how hard it is to accept.

434
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
It can't be him.

435
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,320
Why are you so modest?

436
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
I want to believe him.

437
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
You want to believe?

438
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,920
Now the jade seal is lost in the flower palace.

439
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,920
The young princess doesn't want to find the jade seal.

440
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,920
To make up for the fault of the flower palace.

441
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,920
Instead, she wants to use the whole clan's safety

442
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,920
to make a bet.

443
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,920
It's really a way to resist others.

444
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:47,920
We're here busy.

445
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,920
To play with you.

446
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,920
It seems that Miss Mu

447
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
has a lot of hostile feelings for Gao Xiu.

448
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,920
Yes.

449
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,920
I don't like him.

450
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,920
I don't like him at all.

451
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,920
Senior sister, you're here.

452
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,920
Why didn't you open the door and you knew it was me?

453
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,560
You're always the only one who knocks.

454
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
What's this?

455
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,560
This? I just went to the first-come, first-served inn.

456
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,560
I brought it for you when I came back.

457
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
It looks delicious.

458
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
You told me that you suffered a lot when you were young.

459
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Your favorite food is sweet food when you grow up.

460
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,560
Thank you, senior sister.

461
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
By the way, thank you, young master.

462
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
I didn't know that we didn't find anything.

463
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,200
I didn't say anything, right?

464
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,200
They said that the previous investigation was wrong.

465
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
So they have to think about it again.

466
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,200
It's really delicious.

467
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,200
Wanwan.

468
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
You said that the people who colluded with the spiritual clan

469
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
and the Taoist jade order

470
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
will really be the people around us?

471
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,840
What do they want?

472
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,840
It's going to be that the Palace of Pure Flower can't give it to us.

473
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
They have to betray us.

474
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,840
Senior sister,

475
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,840
knowing people, knowing faces, not knowing the heart,

476
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,840
people in this world are all living for themselves.

477
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Are you the same?

478
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,840
You have something in your heart, too.

479
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
Of course.

480
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,840
Everyone has what they want in their heart.

481
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,840
Like me, I don't want to suffer anymore.

482
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,840
I want to be like now.

483
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
I want to be like now.

484
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,840
I want to be like now.

485
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
I want to be like now.

486
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,480
I don't need to be that great.

487
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,480
I just want to be a normal cultivator.

488
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,480
I just want to live my life normally.

489
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,480
Also,

490
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
I want to be by Senior sister's side.

491
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,480
I want to see Senior sister

492
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,480
become the most powerful cultivator of the Human Clan.

493
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I want to see Senior sister

494
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
take the top of the Human Clan.

495
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,480
Senior sister,

496
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
why am I

497
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
so fast?

498
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Wanwan, I believe you.

499
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,480
But I can't use the whole Palace of Pure Flower

500
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,480
and the Human Clan as a pillar.

501
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
It's really good to be able

502
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
to be together.

503
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,680
Wanwan,

504
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
fortunately, it's not you.

505
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,680
Sleep well.

506
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,680
When you wake up,

507
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,680
everything will be fine.

508
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
I'm here.

509
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,360
I found it.

510
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:08,440
Let's go.

511
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,120
Yan Si.

512
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,000
Take the jade bell back to the Chief immediately.

513
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,840
What about you?

514
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,880
I have a task.

515
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,680
I must hide here.

516
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,720
I can't be exposed.

517
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,600
I'll pretend to be back from outside the city.

518
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,640
They won't suspect me.

519
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,640
Go.

520
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,320
Be careful.

521
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,080
Who is it?

522
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,040
How dare you come to the Palace of Mirror Flower?

523
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,640
The Spirit Clan?

524
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:55,920
Your Highness.

525
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,000
Block the whole city.

526
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,360
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

527
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,960
The whole city is advised to check the Spirit Clan

528
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,440
and keep all the medicine shops under control.

529
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,360
No one is allowed to take the medicine.

530
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,320
Yes.

531
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,640
Did you find it?

532
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,440
No.

533
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,840
Keep searching.

534
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,640
Yes.

535
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,880
Is it Cui Wanwan from the Palace of Mirror Flower?

536
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,160
Yes.

537
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,160
She's my daughter.

538
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,160
She's my daughter.

539
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
She's my daughter.

540
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,160
She's my daughter.

541
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,160
She's my daughter.

542
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,160
She's my daughter.

543
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,160
She's my daughter.

544
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,160
She's my daughter.

545
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
Don't be afraid, Miss.

546
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,560
I'm here to help you

547
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,560
because of Gao Xiu's request.

548
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
You're injured.

549
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,360
It's not far from the city of Mirror Flower.

550
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
I'll send you back to the city to heal.

551
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,360
Thank you.

552
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:16,960
Yansi.

553
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,760
The plan has been worked out.

554
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,360
The plan has been worked out.

555
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,560
I won't let you die in vain.

556
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,360
Young Princess.

557
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,360
Young Master Xie is here.

558
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,360
Why are you here?

559
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,360
Are you here to find that leaf?

560
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,760
I've searched carefully.

561
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,560
There's no leaf.

562
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,160
And Wanwan's room.

563
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,360
I've searched it too.

564
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,160
There's no leaf.

565
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,560
Don't suspect her again.

566
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,160
We're here

567
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,160
to pay our respects to Princess Su.

568
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,960
No. You don't have any evidence.

569
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,360
Don't talk nonsense to my master.

570
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,960
Master is suspicious.

571
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,160
Don't hurt Wanwan.

572
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,760
Gao Xiu is too worried.

573
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,960
We caught the snake spirit this time

574
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,560
and exposed the whereabouts.

575
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,960
It's not good to investigate in secret.

576
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:15,160
In this case,

577
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,160
there's no need to hide.

578
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Xuyue and I have been in the city for a while.

579
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
As a junior,

580
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,160
I should pay my respects to Princess Su.

581
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,560
What about your

582
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,160
sharp-tongued cousin

583
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,560
and the female guard?

584
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,160
They're protecting the formation in the inn.

585
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,760
Protect the formation?

586
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,560
Protect what formation?

587
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,960
Although the snake spirit has committed suicide,

588
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,960
Feng Yao left her spirit elixir.

589
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,960
I thought about it.

590
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:39,960
Suddenly I thought

591
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,560
there's a formation in ancient books

592
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,560
called the Fast King.

593
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,160
It can be activated in two hours.

594
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,560
When the spirit elixir is placed in the formation,

595
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,360
we can know

596
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,760
the memory of the snake spirit.

597
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:49,960
We can find out soon

598
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,760
who is the mole in the Palace of Mirror Flower.

599
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,560
Who is behind it?

600
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,960
And their plan.

601
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,160
We can know everything clearly.

602
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,960
Gao Xiu seems unhappy.

603
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,360
Are you worried about the formation?

604
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,360
Or are you afraid of finding out who it is?

605
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,360
Find out who it is.

606
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Never give up.

607
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,360
Come out.

608
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
You're here.

609
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,560
Why are you so shy?

610
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,360
Why don't you be honest

611
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,360
and show your face to the world?

612
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,560
I'm here.

613
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,760
I'm here.

614
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,960
I'm here.

615
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,160
I'm here.

616
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,360
I'm here.

617
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
I'm here.

618
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,760
I'm here.

619
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,960
I'm here.

620
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,160
I'm here.

621
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm here.

622
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,560
It's useless to destroy the formation.

623
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,160
As long as the spirit elixir of the snake spirit is still here,

624
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,560
we can restart the second and the third.

625
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
Don't waste your energy.

626
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,160
You guys

627
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,960
are really just watching the show outside

628
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
and not doing anything.

629
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:22,360
Right?

630
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,160
The cash is on the spirit elixir.

631
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,560
We should let it grab the spirit elixir.

632
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
Why is it you?

633
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,960
Why?

634
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
I said

635
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,960
everyone has what they want.

636
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,760
What do you want?

637
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:48,160
What do you want?

638
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,160
I told you

639
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,960
about my birth.

640
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,560
But it's not true.

641
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,560
Do you want to hear the truth?

642
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,960
When I was very young,

643
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,360
my parents

644
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,360
sold me to a human trafficker

645
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,360
who made snake song.

646
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,160
Do you know what snake song is?

647
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,560
Do you know how cruel it is?

648
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,760
You don't know.

649
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,760
But my parents know.

650
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,360
But they still sold me

651
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,760
to get the coins

652
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,760
and continue to gamble.

653
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,560
They've already paid so much debt.

654
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
Why are they still greedy?

655
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,760
They want to turn the tables

656
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,760
and get a big win and a big loss.

657
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,160
But luckily,

658
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,960
the two monkeys of the snake spirit saved me

659
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,360
and took me back to their residence

660
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,560
to raise me.

661
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,960
They are grateful to me.

662
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:55,360
I also treat them as my real family.

663
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,560
But one day,

664
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,560
a few injured people

665
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,160
passed by this place.

666
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:13,760
They were taken away by the red-bellied spring mountain.

667
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,360
They worked so hard to find the spiritual medicine

668
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,160
and heal them.

669
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,360
But that night,

670
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,360
they set up the Zhu Ling Town

671
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:36,560
to kill all the red-bellied spirits.

672
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:40,160
They set up the Zhu Ling Town

673
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,160
just to get their spiritual medicine

674
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
and reward them.

675
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,160
Senior sister, you've been a good girl since you were little.

676
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,560
Everyone is supporting you and letting you go.

677
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,560
Have you seen the real humanity?

678
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,560
Do you know how shameless and difficult it is

679
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,560
to be a human?

680
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,360
The real evil spirit is not in the dark jade.

681
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,360
In the mortal world,

682
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,160
since the world doesn't give the spirit clan a way to live,

683
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:16,360
then I'll find a new way for them.

684
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
You said finding a new way

685
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,360
is to cooperate with the dark jade

686
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,360
and let the dark clan destroy the human clan?

687
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,160
Why not? But you're a human too!

688
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,360
If I could, I wouldn't be a human!

689
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,160
You knew we had suspected you.

690
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:42,160
Why did you jump into such a obvious trap?

691
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,560
You should know it very well.

692
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,360
It's like you want to believe me,

693
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,960
but you dare not block the Jin Hua Palace and the human clan.

694
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,360
I'm the same.

695
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,160
I'm not a human.

696
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,160
I have something more important to protect than life.

697
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,760
Yan Si can die, and so can I.

698
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,760
But our plan can't be exposed.

699
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,360
Our business must go on.

700
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:11,160
Luckily, it's just a trap.

701
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,360
Who is that young lord?

702
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,160
He made you all so self-righteous.

703
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,360
It seems he's not going to confess.

704
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,160
Wan Wan, although you lied to me,

705
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,760
it's true.

706
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,160
For so many years,

707
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,760
there were so many sisters and sisters in the Jin Hua Palace.

708
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,960
Only you were by my side.

709
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,560
I didn't want you to be hurt,

710
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,360
nor did I want you to die.

711
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,160
As long as you hand over the jade seal,

712
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,560
and tell me who the person behind the scene is,

713
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,960
I'll beg my master to spare your life.

714
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,160
I'll beg my master to spare your life.

715
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,360
Okay?

716
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,160
Now,

717
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,760
you still believe me?

718
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,360
Of course I believe you.

719
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,760
Turn around.

720
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,760
You... You want to save the spirit clan.

721
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,760
You can tell me.

722
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
We'll figure something out together, right?

723
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,160
Okay.

724
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,360
I'll give you the jade seal.

725
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,360
Don't move.

726
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
Senior sister,

727
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,960
you're too naive.

728
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,760
You're crazy.

729
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:38,960
Go.

730
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,160
Go.

731
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,760
Gao Jiumei, you're a fool.

732
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,760
All these years,

733
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,360
do you think everyone respects you

734
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,560
because they like you?

735
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,560
It's just because of your identity.

736
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm no different from them.

737
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,360
I hate you, too.

738
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,960
And Su Ning Zhen,

739
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,160
he controls you everywhere.

740
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,760
You don't know how to resist.

741
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,360
People like you still want to help me.

742
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
You're not only naive, but also stupid.

743
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Have you said enough?

744
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,160
I've said enough.

745
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,360
So we'll go our separate ways.

746
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,360
Wanwan!

747
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:30,160
You'll be a nobleman in the future.

748
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,560
You'll live a normal life.

749
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,360
You'll be by my side all the time.

750
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,360
I'll see you

751
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,560
become the best Human Clan's nobleman.

752
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:40,560
I'll see you become the Human Clan's father.

753
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,280
I will be a nun

754
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,800
and live a normal life

755
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,800
I will be by your side

756
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I will see you

757
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,120
become the best nun

758
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,480
and see you take the top of the human race

759
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,000
Damn it

760
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,000
Search

761
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,000
It's okay

762
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,000
I will do what you don't dare to do

763
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,000
What's wrong?

764
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It seems that it went too smoothly

765
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,000
It's not good

766
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,000
Thank you, Young City Leader

767
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Thank you for your help

768
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
This time, the Palace of Mirror Flowers will be famous

769
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,000
You're welcome

770
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I also invite you to visit the Palace of Mirror Flowers tonight

771
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
so that I can ask the owner

772
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Don't refuse, Young City Leader

773
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
Since the Princess invited me, I should accept it

774
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,000
That's great

775
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
I will go back to the Palace to arrange it

776
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Are you sure you are the Alliance?

777
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
Su Ning Zhen is so handsome

778
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Why is he more handsome than Sang Qi?

779
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,000
Don't talk nonsense

780
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
Why do you look so upset?

781
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,000
Is it because of Cuiwen Wan?

782
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I thought you were just standing on the human race

783
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
I didn't expect you to sympathize with the forest tribe

784
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,000
Then why did you stop me from killing Gao Qiulming?

785
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,000
I made the right choice, it has nothing to do with the tribe

786
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Gao Qiulming is not wrong to die

787
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
I will stop you from killing him

788
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,000
I will stop you from killing him

789
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
That means if I stand on the right side

790
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
you will stand on my side too

791
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
You stand out

792
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Why?

793
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
The reason you stand out is mostly the reason

794
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,000
What's wrong with the reason?

795
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,000
The reason is also the reason

796
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,000
This time, the mole was eliminated and the order was returned

797
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
Thank you for your help

798
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
I will propose a toast to you

799
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
I don't drink, I will treat it with tea

800
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,000
That's good

801
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,000
Please

802
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
Please

803
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
This time, Young City Leader Xie was in danger in the dark

804
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
The descendants of the Empress of the Palace of Flower and Flower didn't save him in time

805
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
Instead, you came here with the wound

806
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I feel ashamed

807
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,000
You are right

808
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
It's just that Young City Leader Xie and Master Nan

809
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
came to see me this afternoon

810
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,000
Why didn't you tell me first?

811
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,000
The so-called Suwang Town is just your bait

812
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:26,000
Could it be that you two don't trust me?

813
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
How could it be?

814
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,000
It's just that there are many people in the Palace of Flower and Flower

815
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:34,000
Since they are my enemies, the less people know, the better

816
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,000
Speaking of which, we only told Young Princess after the bad situation

817
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Master

818
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,000
I don't think all the spiritual clans are...

819
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Enough

820
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
Today's banquet cannot save those unhappy people

821
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
There is self-brewed wine in the Palace of Flower and Flower

822
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
with the existing spiritual flowers as the drink

823
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
Except for Young City Leader Xie, you can try it

824
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,000
I have ordered someone to bring it, and it will be delivered soon

825
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,000
Please

826
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
What are you doing?

827
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,000
Zai Xi?

828
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Why is it him?

829
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,000
It's him

830
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
It's the Red Valley

831
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,000
Xie Yichen

832
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Elder Zai Xi

833
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Don't touch him, it will infect someone

834
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,000
The legendary Dark Jade Blood Valley

835
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,000
Why did it appear here?

836
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,000
Dark Jade Blood Valley

837
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,000
Master

838
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,000
Master

839
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:58,000
Master
