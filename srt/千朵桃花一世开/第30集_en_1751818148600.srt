1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,740
The

2
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:08,740
The

3
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,740
The

4
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,740
The

5
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,740
The

6
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:20,740
The

7
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:23,740
The

8
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,740
The

9
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,740
The

10
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,240
The

11
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,240
The

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:42,240
The

13
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,240
The

14
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,240
The

15
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,740
The

16
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,740
The

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,580
It's crazy to marry Sang Li.

18
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,500
Isn't it good?

19
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,580
I can do what she wants,

20
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,740
and I can do what I want.

21
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,780
Do you really think

22
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,940
you can do what she wants?

23
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,140
Listen,

24
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,300
you don't love each other.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,340
You're torturing each other.

26
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,140
Who says only lovers can get married?

27
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,820
And the one who gets married will love each other.

28
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,860
Love is short and fragile.

29
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,460
Time can defeat it.

30
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:33,900
Money can defeat it.

31
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,900
Life and death can also defeat it.

32
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,820
If you want to pursue eternity,

33
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,060
don't fall in love.

34
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,060
Feng Yao,

35
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,020
are you willing to be my personal maid?

36
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:51,460
I'm not interested in it.

37
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,100
You once told me

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,900
that I can't change my fate.

39
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,460
Don't force me.

40
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,140
But now,

41
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,220
you're forcing me.

42
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,380
But how do you know

43
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:09,260
it's not in your fate?

44
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,340
You insist on it.

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,420
I can't stop you.

46
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,420
But it's ridiculous.

47
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,180
I won't take part in it.

48
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,940
It's up to you.

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,060
ты

50
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,980
ты

51
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,060
ты

52
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,060
You've been kneeling here for three days and nights.

53
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,060
Why are you so persistent?

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
I beg you to grant me the medicine this time.

55
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,060
Save my brother's life.

56
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,060
It's not that I won't give it to you.

57
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,060
It's just that it's useless to give it to you.

58
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:39,060
I've made up a knot for you.

59
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,060
The knot shows that your love has been sealed.

60
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,060
This is the fate.

61
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,060
You said that this fate was on you.

62
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,060
Can you accept it?

63
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:57,060
My fate has been calculated.

64
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,060
One day after the wedding,

65
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I will lose everything.

66
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,060
But I don't plan to escape.

67
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Because escaping is also part of fate.

68
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,060
Even so, I still want to experience it.

69
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:20,060
I still want to experience it and beg you to grant me the medicine.

70
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,060
Ten years.

71
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,060
I will die and be loyal to you for ten years.

72
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,060
Say that you really lost everything.

73
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
I will also be by your side.

74
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
I will never leave you.

75
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,060
It's been half a year since we met.

76
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
You don't seem to be well.

77
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
Xiao Yuan is dead.

78
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
It's been half a year.

79
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,060
The medicine cured his illness.

80
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,060
But it attracted the blood of Xie Xiu to take the medicine.

81
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,060
He died from the blood of Xie Xiu.

82
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,060
I killed Xie Xiu to avenge him.

83
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,060
But I couldn't save my brother.

84
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,060
If I didn't come to beg for the medicine,

85
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,060
I wouldn't have attracted Xie Xiu.

86
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:14,060
Then my brother wouldn't have died.

87
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,060
Am I right?

88
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,060
You are still the same.

89
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
You must be like this.

90
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,060
It seems that your fate is also hard.

91
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,060
A month ago,

92
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,060
my father killed my stepmother.

93
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,060
But he left my brother.

94
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Do you hate it?

95
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,060
Their fate,

96
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,060
the fate of Yun Xiu Villa,

97
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,060
is coming soon.

98
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,060
So today is the first day of ten years.

99
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,060
My name is Feng Yao.

100
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
The wind of the morning wind,

101
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,060
the distant waist.

102
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,060
Ten years have passed.

103
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,060
The past is not the past.

104
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,060
Feng Yao,

105
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,060
why don't you leave?

106
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,060
I don't want to leave.

107
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Feng Yao,

108
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
why don't you leave?

109
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,060
The new demon is so strong.

110
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,060
With one's strength,

111
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:42,060
he can break through the Immortality Formation.

112
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:44,060
If there is such a good person in the dark,

113
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,060
why did Sang Qi cooperate with the Xiu Xian Pavilion?

114
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Xue Chen?

115
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
This is not so simple.

116
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,060
Although the soul is completely absorbed by the demon,

117
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,060
it doesn't look like it's being absorbed by the dark.

118
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,060
Xue Chen,

119
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,060
why did you come out of the dark?

120
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
What happened?

121
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
Xie Xue Chen's Qin Yi is useless.

122
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,060
He deserves to be compared with me.

123
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,060
Once Xie Chengzhu died,

124
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
then,

125
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:24,060
who is he?

126
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,060
My senior brother was born with a strong will.

127
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
He is the strongest of the human clan.

128
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,060
Who can kill him?

129
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
No one in the world can kill him.

130
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,060
This new demon has the ability to break through the Immortality Formation.

131
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:37,060
Maybe he is the one who killed the Xie Chengzhu

132
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:38,060
and took the body of Xie Chengzhu.

133
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,060
Stupid.

134
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,060
No.

135
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,060
This is Xue Chen's skill.

136
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,060
You are Xue Chen.

137
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,060
Xie Xue Chen is just a broken piece of my sword.

138
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:51,060
I can't kill him.

139
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,060
I can't kill him.

140
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:54,060
Xie Xue Chen is just a broken piece of my sword.

141
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,060
He has been absorbed by me.

142
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,060
It's not difficult to use his martial arts.

143
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,060
But I want to try

144
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:06,060
how strong the human clan you are talking about is.

145
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,060
Start.

146
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,060
Attack.

147
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,060
Xue Chen is useless.

148
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:28,060
The immortal clan is even worse than useless.

149
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,060
Just you?

150
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,060
What do you use to protect the human clan?

151
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Do you rely on your weak power?

152
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
The crown prince who ended the game

153
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
is always very poor.

154
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,060
I will keep you alive today.

155
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
But remember,

156
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,060
Xue Chen is dead.

157
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,060
Xue Chen is dead.

158
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,060
Now the immortal clan is even worse.

159
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
Listen.

160
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
The immortal clan said

161
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,060
that the audience may fall in love with your martial skills.

162
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:42,060
Sectlaughs aren't full of power

163
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,060
when you forget how many Republicans are there.

164
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:48,060
Why?

165
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,460
But everything is born in chaos.

166
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,020
We are not noble.

167
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,300
It doesn't matter if we don't lose.

168
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,100
Only when we lose

169
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,660
is the promise we make to each other forever.

170
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,540
Don't make me hate you more.

171
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,140
I hate you more than you hate me.

172
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,780
Actually, you've already hated me.

173
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,820
But you don't even remember

174
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,940
the hatred.

175
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,860
Come on.

176
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,860
You are already Hasta Hunting.

177
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Because of you,

178
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:49,900
the North After EffectsWill be so selling that

179
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,860
we can make an rejecting attack.

180
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,460
In addition,

181
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,660
Cassiopeia,

182
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,780
Otherwise, I will kill you.

183
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,020
Stop.

184
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,380
Stop.

185
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,800
Why don't you

186
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,380
come with us on that medieval journey?

187
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,980
I knew you'd do so.

188
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,180
I still want to try

189
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,240
with you on this Great Soul��

190
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,460
A person who is greedy

191
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,780
will pay the price.

192
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,460
I lied to you.

193
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,060
I hurt you.

194
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,940
This is for you.

195
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,580
Do you dare punish me?

196
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,940
Do you think you can kill me this way?

197
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:22,660
Thisiek's

198
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,620
No.

199
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,860
But I can't nitpick you igen and again

200
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,740
It's a pity she's won't BORN today.

201
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:02,940
You two...

202
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,660
I was finally able to find you.

203
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,660
Xie Xue Chen.

204
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Isn't this the Divine Decay of Heaven?

205
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,660
I didn't expect you to fall into the mortal world too.

206
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
Being surrounded by the common people and the common people.

207
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,660
It's really ridiculous.

208
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,660
It seems that Xie Xue Chen's

209
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,660
that moment has already

210
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,660
returned to your body.

211
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,660
What did you say?

212
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Why are you so nervous?

213
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,660
I told you

214
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,660
that Xie Xue Chen

215
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,660
is just a part of me.

216
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,660
I have lost him.

217
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,660
It's his honor

218
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,660
to be able to be integrated with me.

219
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,660
And now, what you should

220
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
worry about is not him.

221
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
It's yourself.

222
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:23,660
You look like this now.

223
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,660
Who else do you want to protect?

224
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Even though I have fallen into the mortal world,

225
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,660
I am still the Divine Decay of Heaven.

226
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
It's really ridiculous.

227
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,660
What is a mortal god?

228
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
A god who is in the form of a god and has the power to defeat the evil.

229
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,660
You are no longer the Divine Decay of Heaven.

230
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,660
For the sake of our ten thousand years of old history,

231
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:18,060
I will give you a

232
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,460
You.

233
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,460
You saved him?

234
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,460
You dared to save him?

235
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:46,460
I didn't save him.

236
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,460
If you can't do it,

237
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,460
if you touch the Immortal Blood Formation,

238
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:52,460
I will never let you go.

239
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:56,460
The existence of the Heavenly Order is your threat.

240
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,460
What you want to do,

241
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,460
I will never let you go.

242
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,460
Then I will let you see

243
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,460
how I can make it happen.

244
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,460
You...

245
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,460
Xie Xuechen,

246
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:32,460
you dare to set the Immortal Blood Formation

247
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
in the sacred pool.

248
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,460
Do you think you can be

249
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
unruly like this?

250
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,460
After a thousand years,

251
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,460
you still

252
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:46,460
have come to the end with the Heavenly Order.

253
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
But now,

254
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,460
I will not be soft-hearted anymore.

255
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,460
Sleep.

256
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Sleep well.

257
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:10,460
When you wake up,

258
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
I will tell you everything.

259
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,460
Sleep.

260
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
This is the price of your marriage.

261
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,460
I will take you to apply the medicine.

262
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,460
No need.

263
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,460
The profit of the Immortal Blood Formation

264
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,460
is useless.

265
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,460
The medicine is useless.

266
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,460
What can cure you?

267
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,460
I will find it.

268
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Didn't you say you were not involved?

269
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,460
I didn't say I didn't care about your life.

270
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
Don't worry.

271
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:12,460
I can't die.

272
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,460
I can't heal.

273
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,460
You are the head of the country.

274
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,460
You are a man of your word.

275
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,460
Why do you still have a deep obsession with him?

276
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,460
Feng Yao,

277
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,460
do you know

278
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,460
how long it has been?

279
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,460
People live in the world.

280
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,460
There are very few people over a hundred years old.

281
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,460
The most cultivators are just

282
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
a thousand years old.

283
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,460
I can't answer your question.

284
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,460
Even for the gods,

285
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,460
it's a long time

286
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,460
for thousands of years.

287
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,460
I have been in the world

288
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,460
for many times.

289
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,460
The gods talk about loneliness.

290
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,460
In those years,

291
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,460
there are only

292
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,460
me and him.

293
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,460
Anyway, you are by my side.

294
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Sun, moon, and silver.

295
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,460
The universe is bright.

296
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,460
We will be together

297
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,460
forever.

298
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,460
I just want to go back to the past.

299
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,460
It's been too long.

300
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:22,460
Time goes by.

301
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,460
Mu Xuan Ling and the chaos

302
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,460
are different.

303
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,460
What about you?

304
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,460
You may be

305
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,460
different from the moon

306
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,460
and the destiny.

307
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Since you can't let go of him,

308
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,460
why don't you use the destiny book

309
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,460
to change his destiny?

310
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:48,460
Let him fall in love with you.

311
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,460
Because the gods are in love,

312
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,460
the sky is not clear.

313
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,460
The sky?

314
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,460
The destiny.

315
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:12,460
The retake the Live-oshness for thousands of years.

316
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:14,460
There was no punishment.

317
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,460
Do you know it's just a mistake?

318
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,460
If the item belongs to destiny,

319
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:28,460
it shouldn't have

320
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:30,460
left the whole world so in 60 years,

321
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,460
This ten thousand years of the Night Deity

322
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:35,460
is all because of the Qi State.

323
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,460
Everything is in order.

324
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,460
Because of the law of Hao Tian.

325
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,460
You are the God's weapon.

326
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:44,460
Things like bleeding and injury

327
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,460
shouldn't happen to you.

328
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Thank you, Hao Tian.

329
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,460
The new Demon Lord suddenly appeared.

330
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,460
The law of Hao Tian has changed.

331
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,460
The world will be in a bad state.

332
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,460
But the Heaven's order

333
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
can't change the fate of the same person twice.

334
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:12,460
I can't directly change the fate of the world.

335
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,460
The Heaven's order requires you to follow Hao Tian's will.

336
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,460
Continue to complete what you couldn't do ten thousand years ago.

337
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:23,460
But this time, don't let anything disappoint you.

338
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,460
I only follow Hao Tian's will.

339
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,460
Chief, I've arranged all the injured disciples

340
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,460
to be treated in the sleeping room.

341
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:35,460
They are using the best medicine.

342
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:37,460
Thank you, Elder Cang.

343
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,460
I've transferred the lotus seed from the Flower Palace to here.

344
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:43,460
I hope I can help.

345
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,460
Although the two tribes of the Human Realm have allied,

346
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,460
it seems that they still don't mention the new Demon Lord.

347
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:51,460
Everyone, the new Demon Lord

348
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,460
looks like Chief Xie.

349
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:57,460
After Chief Xie left this place, he hasn't returned yet.

350
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:02,460
If so, then the new Demon Lord is telling the truth.

351
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,460
No! Don't make a mess.

352
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:08,460
Yes, the urgent task is to deal with it.

353
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:11,460
No matter what the new Demon Lord is,

354
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,460
it's a fact that the Immortal Formation has been torn up.

355
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,460
It's to prevent the Dark Clan from attacking the Human Clan.

356
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:19,460
From today, I will lead the disciples of the Heaven's Order

357
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:21,460
to develop the Demon-slaying Formation.

358
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,460
Please strengthen the kitchen.

359
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,460
Yes.

360
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:36,460
Elder Cang, this is the Soul-slaying Bone of the Dragon Abyss.

361
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:38,460
Soul-slaying Bone?

362
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,460
Isn't it the thing that He Xianwu made the cultivators of the Flower Palace

363
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
turn into puppets?

364
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:46,460
The ancient insect at that time was at the cost of the lives of the deceased.

365
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,460
Only the deceased can be born after death.

366
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,460
Elder Cang, this ancient butterfly looks different.

367
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,460
An ancient butterfly can make everyone into a demon

368
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,460
at no cost.

369
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,460
How can a small butterfly be so powerful?

370
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:06,460
Elder Cang, when will we kill the cultivators of the Immortal Alliance?

371
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,460
Letting the Immortal Alliance die

372
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,460
is like dying a ant.

373
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:16,460
It's more interesting to be tortured than to be slaughtered.

374
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
Xie Xuechen,

375
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,460
what's the point of keeping the Golden Thread?

376
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,460
I will destroy the Human Realm you want to protect.

377
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,460
It's really cold.

378
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:51,460
Go and sleep a little longer.

379
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
I helped you yesterday.

380
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,460
It's just that I wanted to deal with the Demon Lord.

381
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,460
It doesn't mean that I forgive you.

382
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:04,460
I hate the Demon Lord and I hate you.

383
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,460
I know that you won't forgive me.

384
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,460
But I also know that

385
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,460
I will never forgive you.

386
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,460
But I also know that

387
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:21,460
you don't want to let everything that Xie Xuechen protected be destroyed by the Demon Lord.

388
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:25,460
I have a ten thousand year old wish with the Demon Lord.

389
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,460
Since our goals are the same,

390
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,460
why can't we work together?

391
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,460
Why?

392
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,460
Because I know the weak points of the Demon Lord

393
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:40,460
and how to deal with it.

394
00:25:40,460 --> 00:25:42,460
Weak points?

395
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,460
Zhu.

396
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,460
What happened ten thousand years ago?

397
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,460
Everything has changed.

398
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,460
You and Xie Xuechen,

399
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,460
Zhu and the Demon Lord,

400
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:03,460
all have their own fate ten thousand years ago.

401
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,460
If you want to know the truth

402
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:07,460
and find the way to break the situation,

403
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:10,460
why don't you experience it yourself?

404
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:15,460
I can open the God's will for you.

405
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:18,460
Let the things that happened ten thousand years ago appear again.

406
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:22,460
Let you experience the weak points of Zhu again.

407
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,460
Do you dare?

408
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,460
Why not?

409
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,460
I don't have the memories of the Chaos Bead.

410
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:35,460
The only thing I believe in

411
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,460
is the time when you were together for ten thousand years.

412
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,460
Ten thousand years is not what ordinary people can imagine.

413
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
It's not you.

414
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
It's us.

415
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:06,460
I'll wait for you to come to me with the memories.

416
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:15,460
The God of War

417
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,460
When the Red Alliance was founded,

418
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
Hao Tian founded

419
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
the two magical weapons of the Ice-Ball.

420
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:28,460
The Chaos Bead and the Book of Destiny.

421
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,460
The Chaos Bead controls time and space.

422
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:34,460
The Book of Destiny controls the Yin State.

423
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,460
The two of them are controlled by Hao Tian.

424
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:41,460
They control the time together.

425
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:46,460
Then, they have their own things.

426
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:52,460
Everything in the world is looking for Hao Tian's methods.

427
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,460
The Book of Destiny

428
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,460
Ten thousand years ago, in the battle of the gods,

429
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,460
the evil god Junyu led the rebels

430
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
to kill the kind old god Huang Yi Sect

431
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,460
and take the formation of the Heaven Realm.

432
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
Due to the impact of the battle of gods,

433
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,460
the formation of the Heaven Realm was broken.

434
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,460
The three worlds collapsed.

435
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:40,460
The history is known as the killing of the god.

436
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,460
Hao Tian's Chaos Bead was ancient.

437
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,460
The Soul of the Chaos Bead was later created.

438
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,460
It's been passed down to the human world.

439
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:52,460
The Book of Destiny reflects the change of the Chaos Bead.

440
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:55,460
Half of the gods were chased to the human world.

441
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,460
Only half of the gods were left.

442
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:00,460
A prophecy of fate appeared in the Book of Destiny.

443
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,460
The gods are weak.

444
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,460
The new god Huang Junyu didn't know what a god was.

445
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,460
He asked the Book of Destiny to provide more information.

446
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,460
The Book of Destiny didn't answer.

447
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Junyu ordered Yu, Zhan, Chi,

448
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,460
the three gods to stir up the human world to find the god.

449
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,460
The Book of Destiny finally found the Chaos Bead in the human world.

450
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,460
It was placed in the human palace pond

451
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
to be used to feed the human king.

452
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:31,460
Waiting for it to transform again.

453
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,460
The Book of Destiny

454
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,460
The Book of Destiny

455
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:36,460
This bead is quite amusing.

456
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:38,460
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

457
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,460
What is it?

458
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,460
A Yan is back. He's waiting at Changming Hall.

459
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,460
The disaster relief is in the West Shrine.

460
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:49,460
The West Shrine army sent 100 young girls to the West River.

461
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,460
They are grateful to the gods.

462
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:54,460
The disaster relief is to remove the seven ghosts.

463
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:57,460
The investigation is all related to the divine jade.

464
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,460
The gods are loyal to their masters.

465
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:05,460
They create fear first, then they give grace.

466
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,460
They command everyone to bow to the heavens and worship the gods.

467
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,460
They use this to gain power of faith.

468
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,460
These so-called divine jades

469
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,460
are just the means of the gods.

470
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,460
Our king is the world's leader.

471
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:20,460
The divine jade, the West Shrine wouldn't dare to report it.

472
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,460
The king has always opposed the use of human traps.

473
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,460
The West Shrine army wouldn't dare to report it.

474
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,460
Although the West Shrine has been replaced,

475
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,460
it has lost its farming and has been robbed by the people.

476
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:31,460
The border is not broken.

477
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:36,460
The people and the king still need to be separated.

478
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,460
Everything must be prepared in advance.

479
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,460
I will consider the West Shrine again.

480
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
Thank you, Yan.

481
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,460
Go back and rest.

482
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:47,460
If we talk about hard work, it's still our king's hard work.

483
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,460
You have been busy with work for days and you haven't slept well.

484
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,460
You want to sleep well, right?

485
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,460
Enough.

486
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,460
I don't need anyone here.

487
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,460
Go.

488
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

489
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Thank you, Your Majesty.

490
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,460
Yan, wait for me.

491
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,460
It's been a long time since we last met.

492
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,460
You treat me like this?

493
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:08,460
Although you are from West Shrine,

494
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,460
I am from East Shrine,

495
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,460
I'd rather be a brother than a brother.

496
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,460
By the way,

497
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:15,460
did you see anything interesting this time?

498
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:17,460
You always think about something interesting.

499
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,460
Did you notice that

500
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,460
our king has been under too much pressure recently?

501
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,460
He has started to climb the pillars.

502
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:27,460
What does it have to do with you?

503
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,460
Besides facing the emperor,

504
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,460
you are just a big fool.

505
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:01,460
The time has passed for so long.

506
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,460
It's finally here.

507
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,460
State Preceptor.

508
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,460
State Preceptor, you are just in time.

509
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,460
The situation has been turbulent recently.

510
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:35,460
Yan went to the neighboring state to collect some divine jade.

511
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,460
Please instruct me.

512
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:42,460
I am here to congratulate you.

513
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,460
Congratulations on your ancient magic

514
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,460
and revenge on Jiang City.

515
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,460
Magic?

516
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:53,460
The pearl in your hand

517
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,460
is the ancient magic

518
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:56,460
the Chaos Pearl.

519
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,460
The power of Chaos can open up the sky and earth.

520
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,460
If it can be successfully practiced,

521
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,460
then the fight against the gods

522
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,460
will not be in vain.

523
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,460
This is the Chaos Pearl?

524
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Please instruct me.

525
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,460
The Holy Ruler has always been the only one

526
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:16,460
who has been a rebel.

527
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:19,460
So the Holy Ruler's blood can be used to repair this magic.

528
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:22,460
But if the Holy Ruler is not able to do it,

529
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:25,460
then the Holy Ruler will not be able to do it.

530
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
If the Holy Ruler loses one step, then...

531
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,460
It's fine.

532
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,460
State Preceptor, can you help me complete it?

533
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,460
State Preceptor, please.

534
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,460
Holy Ruler, the magic...

535
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:42,460
After ten years of magic,

536
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,460
you have finally returned.

537
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,460
Holy Ruler, please.

538
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,460
Holy Ruler, please.

539
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:58,460
Who are you?

540
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,460
I am Zhao Min.

541
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,460
I remember you.

542
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:18,460
The smell on your body

543
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,460
is very familiar.

544
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:22,460
What else do you remember?

545
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,460
I remember

546
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,460
that I am like a pearl.

547
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:30,460
I was often held by you.

548
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,460
Other things...

549
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,460
I don't remember.

550
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,460
If you can't remember, then you won't remember.

551
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,460
Since you are a pearl,

552
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:47,460
how about calling you Zhu in the future?

553
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,460
Zhu?

554
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:54,460
I like this name.

555
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,460
What are your plans in the future?

556
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,460
Am I not your pearl?

557
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,460
Just like before.

558
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Since you have been transformed into a human,

559
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,460
it's not a pity to go to the palace.

560
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
Do you want to travel around the world

561
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,460
and see the great He Mountain?

562
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,460
Will you go with me?

563
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,460
I'm afraid I can't.

564
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,460
I have to stay here.

565
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,460
If you don't go, I won't go either.

566
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,460
In this world, I only know you.

567
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,460
I just want to stay with you.

568
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,460
Moreover, you have spiritual power.

569
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,460
By your side, I won't be transformed into a pearl.

570
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,460
If you want to change your mind,

571
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,460
you can leave anytime.

572
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
I won't change my mind.

573
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,460
I won't let you go.

574
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,460
Please.

575
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,460
It's very late.

576
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,460
Yes.

577
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,460
It's very late.

578
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,460
I have ordered people to pack up the Linglong Hall.

579
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,460
You can rest now.

580
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,460
Let's rest together.

581
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:43,460
We can't sleep together.

582
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,460
Why?

583
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,460
We used to sleep together.

584
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:49,460
You are human now.

585
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:53,460
I can.

586
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,460
I can.

587
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,460
But I can't.

588
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
I am not human.

589
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,460
But you are not with me.

590
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,460
I am not used to it.

591
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,460
I can't sleep.

592
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,460
It's late.

593
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,460
You sleep here.

594
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,460
I have a lot of official documents.

595
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,460
I won't leave.

596
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,460
I will stay here.

597
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,460
Okay.

598
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,460
Go.

599
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,460
State Preceptor.

600
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,460
If you want to go to the garden tonight,

601
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,460
remember to add a cloak.

602
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:24,660
I won't go after that.

603
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:27,780
You said

604
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,380
in the garden pond,

605
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,820
you gather the sun, moon and light

606
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:32,460
and collect spiritual energy there.

607
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,020
It helps you to make the West Spirit Pill.

608
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,060
You used to go there every night,

609
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,260
but you don't go now.

610
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,460
But your Spirit Pill is already made.

611
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,180
Sun, moon and light

612
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,460
are beneficial to make the Spirit Pill.

613
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,060
But they last for a long time.

614
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,780
Recently, I found

615
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,300
there is another essence in the world

616
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,780
that can help the Spirit Pill to be made quickly.

617
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:59,180
There is such a magical effect?

618
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,940
But the skill of making the Pill

619
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,380
is in balance.

620
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,580
If you are too hurry,

621
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,620
it will only make the Spirit Pill fail.

622
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,180
Thank you for your advice.

623
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:15,780
Yes.

624
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,380
The Pill is indeed in balance.

625
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,260
State Preceptor.

626
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,980
I'll go to the single room.

627
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,500
The aura of the human is better than the sun and light.

628
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:30,780
Soon,

629
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,500
you will recover.

630
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:22,620
I'm here.

631
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:23,420
I'm here.

632
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:24,420
I'm here.

633
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:25,420
I'm here.

634
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,420
I'm here.

635
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,420
I'm here.

636
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I'm here.

00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:29,420
I'm here.

638
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:30,420

I'm here.

640
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:32,420
I'm here.

641
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,420
I'm here.

642
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,420
I'm here.

643
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:35,420
I'm here.

644
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I'm here.

645
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:37,420
I'm here.

646
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:38,420
I'm here.

647
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,420
I'm here.

648
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
I'm here.

649
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
I'm here.

650
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,420
I'm here.

651
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,420
I'm here.

652
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,420
I'm here.

653
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:45,420
I'm here.

654
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,420

655
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
I'm here.

656
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:48,420
I'm here.

657
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:49,420
I'm here.

658
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,420
I'm here.

659
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,420
I'm here.

660
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm here.

661
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,420
I'm here.

662
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,420
I'm here.

663
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,420

I'm here.

674
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,420
I'm here.

675
00:44:06,420 --> 00:44:07,420
