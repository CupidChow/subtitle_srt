5
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't catch a cold.

6
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I suddenly remember the first time I went back to Yongxue City with you.

7
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You brought me back at that time to monitor me, right?

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
What if the先蒙 people know?

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Know what?

10
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The先蒙 leader fell in love with the cunning dark jade saintess.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
This is a big deal.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Or do you plan to tell them directly that I am a wonton pig?

13
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
You are still hiding the identity of the wonton pig.

14
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Otherwise, everything will point to you.

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then how do you plan to introduce me to Yong Xuechen?

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can you introduce me?

17
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Indeed, once our relationship is known by the先蒙 people,

18
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
it will still make him feel embarrassed.

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In fact, it's good that we hide it from them and secretly touch it.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:44,000
That feeling of being discovered at any time is more exciting than directly attacking the public.

21
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I really don't know what your little brain is thinking about every day.

22
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Thinking about what?

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Thinking about...

24
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
You look uncomfortable.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why do you have to follow me?

27
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It's better to be invisible.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Who says I'm uncomfortable?

29
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
The ending is fixed.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The destiny cannot be changed.

31
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The light of the front can't be changed.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
They can't change either.

33
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Chief.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Chief.

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Chief Nan.

36
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Mu Xuanling?

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why are you here?

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I...

39
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He...

40
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
He caught me back to atone for my sins.

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Atone for sins?

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
He caught you back to atone for your sins?

43
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He caught me back to atone for your sins?

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He...

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
He wasn't caught by me.

46
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I let him go home with me.

47
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Chief.

48
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You won't really...

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
It's a long story.

50
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's snowy and windy.

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Let's not talk here.

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Let's go.

53
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I slept all the way to the bed.

55
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
But this bed is comfortable.

56
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
He kept it for me for so long.

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I wonder if Xie Xuechen peeked.

58
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
He squeezed his own fart.

59
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
What brought you here?

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Have a seat.

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I heard Xuechen was coming back.

62
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I've sent people to wait.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I have to tell them about the piggery,

64
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
why don't you go with them?

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Piggery?

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
No thanks.

67
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,800
I can't stand the look of Elder Cang's heartbroken eyes.

68
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,000
I won't go and irritate him.

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Fine. I'll stay here with you.

70
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,200
Just like before, two outsiders,

71
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,800
we'll hug and warm each other.

72
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:07,800
I can give you what you want, including...

73
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,600
that little bit of love.

74
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:15,000
Maybe we can become closer friends.

75
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Nanxu, I was just...

76
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I know.

77
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Just kidding.

78
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You don't mind?

79
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Mind what?

80
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Mind that you two are in a relationship?

81
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If you don't mind at all,

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm sure I was lying.

83
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Since you know,

84
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
why are you willing to go back to Snowblade City with us?

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Although your choice makes me a little displeased,

86
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
as long as you're happy, that's enough.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,000
You really don't want to go and listen?

88
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No.

89
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Since you don't want to go,

90
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I won't go and have fun.

91
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Have a good rest.

92
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'm leaving.

93
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Wait.

94
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I've been looking for a chance to return this jade token to you.

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Why?

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I only have Xie Xuechen in my heart.

97
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I won't have anyone else in the future.

98
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So I can't let you go.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm leaving.

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm leaving.

101
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm accepting your kindness.

102
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
So that you won't be able to pay me back.

103
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I didn't want you to return it.

104
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Instead, I hope you can owe me a little bit of kindness.

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Maybe you can think of me as a friend.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
That's true.

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But a friend...

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
can't be touched.

109
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Keep it.

110
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
It's just a normal relationship.

111
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
One last question.

112
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What does Xie Xuechen mean to you?

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
What does he mean?

114
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
What do you think?

115
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You lied to him because of me.

116
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You lied to him.

117
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It doesn't seem like a friend would do that.

118
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Or do you always pretend to be friends?

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Lan Xiyue.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How sincere are you to him?

121
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
If I'm not sincere,

122
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I would be willing to watch him die in Yunxiu Villa,

123
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Yongxue City, and Jinghua Palace.

124
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I would be willing to watch him die in Yunxue Village,

125
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
and I wouldn't need to help him.

126
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
But, Xuan Ling,

127
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
you're just taking it too seriously.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I've been used to not trusting you for ten years.

129
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Lan Xiyue,

130
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I want to treat you as an old friend,

131
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
but your actions are making me hesitate.

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Xie Xuechen is my bottom line.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
If I continue,

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
you won't move, and I won't move.

135
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
If one day, you want to hurt Xie Xuechen,

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I won't show mercy.

137
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Okay.

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
If one day,

139
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I hurt him,

140
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
you can come and kill me.

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Aiyo...

142
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
me?

143
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Are you a cryesome?

144
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Evidence is evidence.

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
But can it be the same as truth?

146
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Is it your most subsequent contact?

147
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm still in love with you

148
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,440
Listen to the twinkling of time with me

149
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,200
Young Master

150
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,840
Do you think he believes you completely?

151
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,880
As he said

152
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,000
these ten years of dark jade

153
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,120
won't make him believe anyone

154
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,480
It's because of these experiences

155
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,120
he understood the principle better than everyone

156
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,560
It would be congenial

157
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
to accainst anyone

158
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,000
he could be cared for

159
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,880
That it from there

160
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,040
will come to the last

161
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,960
Where is she?

162
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,640
You still don't know her name?

163
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:49,380
Have a seat.

164
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:57,280
Do we really lose the Phantom Ribbon?

165
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,920
When there's the phantom ribbon,

166
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,120
just as I promised, I'll keep it.

167
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,800
I pray you can rest assured.

168
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Okay.

169
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,920
Xiao Chen, I watched you grow up.

170
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,720
I also watched you become so calm and steady since you were young.

171
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,080
I also watched you pay for your past mistakes.

172
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,000
You asked for seven years in the Snow Gorge.

173
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:29,680
Actually, I also hope that you can find a way to stay with you forever.

174
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
So that you won't have to face the difficulties alone.

175
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,640
But the more difficult it is to fall in love,

176
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,880
the more you will fall in love and be too self-reliant.

177
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:48,520
Eventually, your obsession will become a demon in your heart.

178
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:51,480
It will make your heart beat again.

179
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,640
But I don't want to escape from love anymore.

180
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,840
Because I have seen my inner self clearly.

181
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,560
To protect a person's wish,

182
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,680
I can make my Taoism stronger and more firm.

183
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,840
Don't worry. I won't repeat my mistakes.

184
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:13,120
Even so, that person should be a righteous and kind person.

185
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,240
And shouldn't be like Mu Xuan Ling, who is cunning and good at changing.

186
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,560
How can I be at ease if you are like this? How can I face Senior Dao Cheng?

187
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,200
He has already escaped from the dark moon. He will never harm the Alliance again.

188
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,520
Silly child.

189
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,600
I am not worried that he will harm the Alliance.

190
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:32,200
I am worried that he will harm you.

191
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:37,320
I hope that you really know what kind of person you are in love with.

192
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,240
And not being deceived by his lies.

193
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:45,320
Eventually, you will be sad and disappointed.

194
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,440
Elder Cang, I know that what you said today is all for my own good.

195
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,800
But I think...

196
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:01,320
I don't have a moment that I know what I am doing more than now.

197
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,800
I believe in his feelings for me.

198
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,520
I also believe in my judgment of him.

199
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,960
Looks like I was overthinking.

200
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,080
I hope that Mu Xuan Ling won't let you down.

201
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,720
From what I see, you still did gain.

202
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,040
Mu Xuan Ling.

203
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,880
This is...

204
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,680
Thank you

205
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,760
In Snowblade City

206
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,840
I fell into a curse

207
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,120
I woke up here

208
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,480
I thought you are Supreme

209
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,440
so I gave you a lot of flowers

210
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,840
Then I was hypnotized

211
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,880
You have no time

212
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,760
And you are forced to kill

213
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,680
I was so angry

214
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,200
That I lost all the flowers in this room

215
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,360
Now that you are back

216
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,360
I want to show you something

217
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:32,840
I remember that day

218
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,040
I brought you a lot of snacks

219
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,960
But I found you had left

220
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,320
I thought you were angry with me for coming back too late

221
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,000
I didn't expect you to suffer so much at that time

222
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,080
It won't happen again

223
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:01,080
Actually, I don't mean to make you feel sorry for me

224
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,760
I just want to tell you

225
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,560
As long as I am here

226
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,640
I won't let you live such a cold life

227
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,840
But you have to be prepared

228
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,440
Because there may be these things in this room

229
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,840
That you didn't expect

230
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,440
I will leave everything in this room to you

231
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:21,360
Really?

232
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,160
What about you in this room?

233
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,200
Whatever

234
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
You are easy to talk to now

235
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,360
I touched you at that time

236
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,960
You beat me so hard

237
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,840
And you said

238
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,400
The one who respects the devil is black

239
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,600
Now it's different

240
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,280
Now it's the one who respects the pig is black

241
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,320
Then do I need to learn from you?

242
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,760
If you are really worried

243
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,240
I will teach you

244
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:05,680
No

245
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,880
I like to know what I can't do

246
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,680
The more Mr. Cang doesn't like me

247
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,680
I will make him like me

248
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:17,920
Yes

249
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:22,440
You always like to force me

250
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,840
The more you force me, the sweeter it is

251
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:38,640
Wily

252
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:43,360
You don't believe me?

253
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,520
Then let me eat this melon

254
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,200
I want to see if it's sweet

255
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,320
I am very busy tonight

256
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,200
Busy with what?

257
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,280
Busy with the official business

258
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,080
So you are going to use the good time

259
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,800
To do the official business?

260
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,600
I can be with you

261
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,360
what else

262
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,200
You should go back to sleep

263
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:27,920
Or sleep here

264
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,200
good

265
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,160
I'll wait for you here

266
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:37,960
I'm sorry.

267
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:50,960
Xie Xue Chen.

268
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,600
Your bed is too big.

269
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,160
I'm so scared to sleep alone.

270
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,560
I, Mu Xuan Ling,

271
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,960
will do such a boring thing with others.

272
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,160
Boring?

273
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,440
Then why are you so happy?

274
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,480
Yeah.

275
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,400
I don't know.

276
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,760
Doing such a boring thing,

277
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,360
I can be so happy.

278
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,560
What's the matter?

279
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,640
This...

280
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Love means brigand,

281
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,600
or motivation?

282
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,560
When the sun and moon Arise Shhower professionalize each other,

283
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,560
the universe sways,

284
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,080
we will stay together forever.

285
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,600
How are you now?

286
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,880
I'm fine

287
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,160
You look carrotsogged

288
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,360
in my eyes

289
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,640
It's so delicious

290
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,640
You can't I-

291
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,520
You've been in the palace for years.

292
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,440
Do you still want to find it?

293
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:27,760
It's so uncomfortable

294
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,480
that I can't control it anymore.

295
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:42,880
Feng Yao.

296
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,200
You stay here.

297
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,640
Don't let anyone find out that I'm leaving.

298
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,000
Yes.

299
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
I don't want to kill anyone tonight.

300
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
I don't want to die.

301
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,040
Leave.

302
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:19,120
Master Nan.

303
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,480
You sound like

304
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,560
you're in a bad mood today.

305
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,160
I happen to

306
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,280
have some new tea here.

307
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,320
Would you like to have a taste?

308
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,720
I've received

309
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,400
what you asked me to bring.

310
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,880
Don't worry.

311
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,840
I won't touch the wood.

312
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,400
I'm here

313
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,280
not for this.

314
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,360
I'm a little curious.

315
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,080
Besides Mu Xuan Ling and Xie Xue Chen,

316
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,880
what else

317
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,080
can make you so sad?

318
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,720
You've been

319
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,080
drinking this tea for so many years.

320
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,760
Aren't you tired of it?

321
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,120
The mortal world.

322
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,320
The words you used

323
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,800
seem to have a different meaning.

324
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,120
I know what you want to do.

325
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,080
I can help you.

326
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:31,960
For example,

327
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,080
open the ladder.

328
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,880
You have your own death.

329
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,120
I have my own spy.

330
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,320
In recent years, you've been looking for

331
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
the ladder that fell ten thousand years ago

332
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,360
except for the Soul-guarding Bead.

333
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,440
You've been looking for the ladder

334
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,680
that fell ten thousand years ago

335
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,280
except for the Soul-guarding Bead.

336
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,080
I've known you for so many years.

337
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:00,800
I don't want to

338
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,440
say something,

339
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,880
but it doesn't mean I don't know.

340
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,520
You may be a little clumsy,

341
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,560
but you're better than anyone in the world.

342
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,920
I understand you better.

343
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,360
I don't doubt your ability.

344
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,440
But since we're going to cooperate,

345
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:29,840
I have to know

346
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,040
what you want.

347
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,160
A place

348
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,360
I've been looking for

349
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,880
and no one has ever found.

350
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,720
I'm thinking

351
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,800
maybe it's in the Heaven Realm.

352
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,840
Why don't you sleep at night?

353
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,640
Why did you pull us here?

354
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,360
Don't you think

355
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,160
since Sang Qi practiced the Jade-Bird Skill,

356
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,320
he has been more familiar with the demon aura?

357
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,240
Even the face has changed.

358
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,840
You mean

359
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,240
the one below?

360
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,280
Does it mean

361
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,800
God Duosan is going to wake up?

362
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,240
What if

363
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,920
he's already awake?

364
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,960
Xie Xuechen.

365
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
Xie Xuechen.

366
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,960
Xie Xuechen.

367
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,800
Xie Xuechen.

368
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,880
Xie Xuechen.

369
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,240
Xie Xuechen

370
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,640
Xue Xuechen

371
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,720
Xie Xuechen

372
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,240
We'll meet soon

373
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,640
Master

374
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,080
How was the talk going?

375
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,400
As it goes well, so does it

376
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,080
Say no

377
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,240
I will take the body as my enemy.

378
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Yan Xiu Shi.

379
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
I'm here to inform you that

380
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,240
something happened to you.

381
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
It's not a wound.

382
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,240
It's not a disease.

383
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,240
From the pulse,

384
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,240
there's no problem.

385
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,240
No problem?

386
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
No problem is the biggest problem.

387
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Xie Xue Chen, you're awake.

388
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,240
What's wrong with me?

389
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,240
You were unconscious for an hour.

390
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,240
An hour?

391
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,240
Just now,

392
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
I seemed to hear someone

393
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
calling my name.

394
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Who?

395
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I don't know.

396
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
This disease

397
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
sounds more like a soul entering the body.

398
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,240
A soul entering the body?

399
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Do you remember

400
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,240
I was once resurrected by the Dark Clan?

401
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
You mean

402
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,240
there was a link between you and the Dark Clan?

403
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,240
I'm not sure.

404
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
But I don't know why

405
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:06,240
I seem

406
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
to be very familiar with that god.

407
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,240
I'm familiar with him?

408
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
Familiar?

409
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Xue Chen,

410
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,240
with a call,

411
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,240
we can't make a decision.

412
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,240
The Dark Clan is in a state of destruction.

413
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,240
It's all in the Sky Sea.

414
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Maybe the answer

415
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,240
is in the dark.

416
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Could it be

417
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,240
he's back?

418
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,240
Chief,

419
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,240
the war between the Spirit Clan

420
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
has been gathering in all seas.

421
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,240
As soon as the Heavens are open,

422
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
we can join hands with the Dark Clan

423
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
to wipe out the evil plans.

424
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,240
I'll take care of it.

425
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,240
I'll take care of

426
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,240
the rest.

427
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,240
You should do your duty.

428
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
I've paved the way

429
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,240
for you.

430
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,240
Chief Xue.

431
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Are you still thinking about last night?

432
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,240
Or are you thinking about

433
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,240
your elder brother?

434
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,240
Are you thinking about

435
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
your elder brother?

436
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,240
I am.

437
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,240
But I'm thinking about one thing.

438
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,240
You are you.

439
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,240
Your elder brother is your elder brother.

440
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,240
And now,

441
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,240
I'm full of thoughts

442
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
and only you are there.

443
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,240
I'm sorry.

444
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,240
Chief,

445
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
we have a message.

446
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Chief told me

447
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,240
to send my disciples to check the other sects

448
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,240
in case there's something wrong with the Dark Clan.

449
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
Then I found out

450
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,240
that the leader and the Magistrate

451
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
are never on the island.

452
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,240
He knows too much.

453
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
Where could he go?

454
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,240
Xue Chen.

455
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,240
Xue Chen.

456
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
Xue Chen.

457
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
Xue Chen.

458
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Xue Chen.

459
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
Xue Chen.

460
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,240
Xue Chen.

461
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:49,240
Xue Chen.

462
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Xue Chen.

463
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
Are you okay?

464
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,240
Why

465
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
are you staring at me?

466
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,240
Xue Chen.

467
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
Xue Ling.

468
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,240
Xue Ling.

469
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
Xue Ling.

470
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I won't let you

471
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,240
be in danger again.

472
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
I don't want to lose you again.

473
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
Xie Xue Chen,

474
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,240
what's wrong with you?

475
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
What happened?

476
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
I'm the leader of the Xiu Xing Pavilion.

477
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
He's going to break through the Dark Palace to the Wen Xian Town.

478
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,240
What?

479
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
How do you know?

480
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,240
It's too late to explain.

481
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,240
I have to send it over immediately.

482
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Where is Nan Xu Yue?

483
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,240
Should I call you the leader of the Pavilion

484
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,240
or the leader of the Xiu Xing Pavilion?

485
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
If I remember correctly,

486
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
you only saw my face once.

487
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,240
Did I make any mistakes?

488
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
Or

489
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
who told you?

490
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Let me go.

491
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Uncle said to wait for him to come back.

492
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,240
He's here.

493
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,240
He's here.

494
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
He's here.

495
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,240
He's alone over there.

496
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,240
What if there's any danger?

497
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Xue Chen is determined.

498
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,240
If you don't go,

499
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,240
he'll be less worried

500
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
and less dangerous.

501
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,240
So how did Xie Xue Chen

502
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,240
know that He Xian was the leader of the Pavilion?

503
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
How did he know that

504
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
He Xian was going to the Dark Palace?

505
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
Your spirit is steady.

506
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,240
You're not a young man.

507
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,240
There are many Taoists in the world.

508
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,240
Except for Yi Rong Shu,

509
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,240
you're the only one who can change the form and skin.

510
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,240
Who are you?

511
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,240
I asked you but you didn't answer.

512
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,240
You want to get back to me?

513
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
It doesn't matter.

514
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
Whether you answer or not,

515
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
I won't kill you today.

516
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
It happens that

517
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I have the same idea.

518
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,240
In a short time,

519
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
Xie Chen's power has increased.

520
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,240
It's impressive.

521
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,240
What's going on?

522
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,240
Xie Xue Chen is strong,

523
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,240
but he shouldn't be so strong.

524
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Why did he see

525
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,240
the same thing as Gu Zhu?

526
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,240
Give me a little more time.

527
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
One day is enough.

528
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
Why is it that at this time,

529
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,240
you can change?

530
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
You know him.

531
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,240
Don't you think he was weird just now?

532
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,240
What do you mean?

533
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,240
It's just that

534
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,240
he used to be like that.

535
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Suddenly like a different person.

536
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,240
Do some strange things.

537
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,240
Say some strange words.

538
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
Brother sometimes really love to walk.

539
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Isn't it strange?

540
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,240
Really?

541
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
My intuition is always very accurate.

542
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,240
What's wrong?

543
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Xie Xue Chen is strange today.

544
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,240
He doesn't have the ability to calculate.

545
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,240
In theory,

546
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,240
he can't know where He Xian Wu is.

547
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
Maybe

548
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
it's related to last night's incident.

549
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
But

550
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
aren't you afraid that He Xian Wu

551
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:57,240
will tell Xie Xue Chen about you?

552
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
I know it.

553
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Sooner or later.

554
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
It's tiring

555
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
to pretend for a long time.

556
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
If I change all of this,

557
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,240
it's also a new thing.

558
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
You asked me to wait for you to come back.

559
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,240
But that day,

560
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
you didn't come.

561
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
But that day,

562
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
I didn't wait for you.

563
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
This time,

564
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,240
I'll wait for you to come back.

565
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,240
This is really not like you.

566
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,240
Ling Xi,

567
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,240
I will soon

568
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
come back to you.

569
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
This time,

570
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
we will never be apart again.

571
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,240
You really don't want to revenge?

572
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,240
I didn't expect that the master of dark jade

573
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,240
would lose his soul

574
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,240
and wait for the body to be exhausted.

575
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,240
No matter how much you tell him,

576
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
he won't hear it.

577
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,240
Ling Xi

578
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,240
is a rare guest.

579
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Don't worry.

580
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
I'll let him leave soon.

581
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,240
You've made a scene with Ling Xi.

582
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Are you going to do it yourself

583
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
or do you want me to send you away?

584
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,240
Su Ning Xi is dead.

585
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,240
She's dead completely.

586
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,240
No matter how you lie to her now,

587
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
she won't come back to life.

588
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
Your words

589
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,240
are very unreasonable.

590
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
You will be angry by what I said,

591
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,240
which means you also admit that

592
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
what I said is true.

593
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
So you shouldn't hate me,

594
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
but the person who killed her.

595
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,240
You're right.

596
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
Those people are dead.

597
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:38,240
That's not it.

598
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,240
You've been bullied by the Human Clan since you were a child.

599
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,240
You should have hated the Human Clan.

600
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,240
But you gave up revenge for the Human Clan for her.

601
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
But in the end, the Human Clan killed her.

602
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,240
It was the decision to give up revenge

603
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,240
that caused the tragedy today.

604
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Are you really satisfied?

605
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Yes.

606
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,240
Do you want me to live in hatred?

607
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
So what's the result of letting go of hatred?

608
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,240
You love her forever

609
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,240
and become a ghost or not.

610
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,240
You're suffering here.

611
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,240
And the Alliance and the Human Clan

612
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,240
didn't reflect on their mistakes,

613
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
but they laughed at your failure

614
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
as the winner.

615
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
It's so embarrassing.

616
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
I think if Su Ningxi knew it,

617
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,240
she would feel bad for you.

618
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
Look at you now.

619
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,240
Do you think she will still like you?

620
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
You're here

621
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
to talk to me about this nonsense?

622
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,240
I'm here to feel unfair for you.

623
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,240
Those people you forgave

624
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,240
didn't choose to forgive you.

625
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
You lost your beloved.

626
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Then why do they

627
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,240
have to live on?

628
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
You're the one who lost your beloved.

629
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
Why do they have to live on?

630
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
What do you want?

631
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,240
I'll open the Immortality Formation for you

632
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
and let the Human Clan

633
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
receive the punishment they deserve.

634
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
But as an exchange,

635
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,240
I hope you can tell me

636
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
where the Chaos Bead is.

637
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,240
We can't wait any longer.

638
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
If the Immortality Formation is opened,

639
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
the Human Clan will be in trouble.

640
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
Don't be in trouble.

641
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,240
I have to send a message to the other clans

642
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,240
and ask them to prepare for it.

643
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
Master Nan,

644
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,240
I have something important to do with Tong'er.

645
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Please take care of Mu Xuanling.

646
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,240
Don't let her act recklessly.

647
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,240
Thank you.

648
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
I want you to know me.

649
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
I will act recklessly.

650
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Xie Xuechen is on the Mount Liangjie.

651
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,240
I can't let her be alone.

652
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
You must go.

653
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
I must go.

654
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
Just because she's here.

655
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
Just because she's here.

656
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
Okay.

657
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,240
I will go.

658
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
According to my instruction,

659
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,240
you can go.

660
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,240
Nan Xun.

661
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,240
Thank you.

662
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
