00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Episode 16

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
There's a secret passage

4
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
hidden under my mother's room.

5
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
My father never told me about it.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It seems that Gao Feng Xu

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
has also hidden many secrets

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
from you as his daughter.

9
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Legend of Chusen

10
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Legend of Chusen

11
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This poem is on the bed of Qu Ling Zhen.

12
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The only use

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
is to absorb the spirit energy of the Heaven and Earth Realm

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and use it to cultivate.

15
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
So,

16
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
my father locked my mother here

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
to let her nourish the Soul Bead.

18
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I think

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the truth is more cruel than this.

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
What truth?

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
The truth is

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
that I'm not a child.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm not a child.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm a little uncle.

25
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A child

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
is just a little child

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
without a lock.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Take her away.

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
We have to complete the task

30
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
set by the princess.

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Prepare the sword formation

32
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
and destroy this place.

33
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
There's no window here.

34
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
The sun can't shine in.

35
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
We can't hear the sound of the outside world.

36
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The only traces of the spirit energy

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
that can be found here

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
are the windows of the Spirit Formation.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
This elephant

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
is not allowed to move.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So...

42
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
So

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
it's not used to lock people here.

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
It's used to put people to death.

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Goddess of Hope.

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm fine.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Go on.

48
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The reason is the Goddess of the Mystic.

49
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
There's no limit to the inner world.

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
No one knows if this spirit energy

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
will dissipate

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
after her death.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
After your mother passed away,

54
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
your father

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
still came here often.

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He's still here.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He's still here.

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He's still here.

59
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
He's still here.

60
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
He's still here.

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
I think

62
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
he's still in the dark

63
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
with your mother's body.

64
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And the Spirit Formation

65
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
is used to maintain the vitality of his body.

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
It won't be broken.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Mother.

68
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Mother.

69
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Let me go.

70
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Let me go.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Go away.

72
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Let me go.

73
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Don't kill me.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Go.

75
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Please.

76
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Come here.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Don't kill me.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Please.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Please.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mother.

81
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Father.

82
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Father, did you save me?

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Father.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Where are you?

85
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Come out and pick me up,

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
okay?

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Father.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Father.

89
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I want to see you.

90
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Father.

91
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Father.

92
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Don't touch me.

93
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Father, please.

94
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Father.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Father.

96
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Father.

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Lord Gao was once the leader of the Alliance.

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Would he really do such a thing?

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I heard from Gao Xiu Shi

100
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
that Miao Hua Zun was imprisoned by Princess Su

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
and tortured for many years.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I find it very strange.

103
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
If Lord Gao Zun

104
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
only married Su Ning Xi to Lord Gao,

105
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
and forced her to keep the Soul Bead,

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
why would Princess Su hate her so much?

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I want to go to my mother's tomb.

108
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Master said that my mother and father were buried together.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I must see for myself

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
whether she was buried there or not.

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
If the Golden Flower Palace still has the Soul Bead,

112
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
then...

113
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
No matter what,

114
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
the truth shouldn't be buried.

115
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Those who are evil for the Soul Bead

116
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
should all get what they deserve.

117
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The formation is about to be completed.

118
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Why hasn't he come back yet?

119
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Leave him alone.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes.

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Hurry up and get back here.

122
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You...

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
What's going on?

124
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hurry up.

125
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's going to collapse here.

126
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Let's go.

127
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Be careful.

128
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hurry up.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You should leave after you've done your makeup.

130
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You'll be repaid here.

131
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Don't think of leaving alive.

132
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I don't have time to waste with you here.

133
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
You...

134
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You're not under the control of Ling Xi.

135
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
It's really hard to kill you.

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I wanted to take this chance to escape.

137
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I didn't expect to be fooled by these two mortals.

138
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Then why did you want to go with me from the beginning?

139
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've been telling you this

140
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to find the Soul Bead.

141
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You haven't found the Soul Bead yet.

142
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Why don't you keep lying to me?

143
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I've already got the clues I want.

144
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'll handle the rest

145
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
with my master.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
As for you,

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
you might as well die here.

148
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Even if you're lying,

149
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you still can't bear to kill me,

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
can you?

151
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Mu Xuan Ling, you want to kill us?

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
What's going on?

153
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Where's A Bao?

154
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A Bao!

155
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
A Bao!

156
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Sister!

157
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
A Bao!

158
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why are you bleeding?

159
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
You're hurt.

160
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
This isn't my blood.

161
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
It's from the Palace of Cultivation.

162
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
They wanted to kill me.

163
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It was my father who saved me.

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Your father?

165
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
You saw him?

166
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
He didn't want to come out to see me,

167
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
so he ran away again.

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
It seems that this little guy's father

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
isn't an easy man.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Sister!

171
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Sister, why are you tied up?

172
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
He's a bad guy.

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Of course he's tied up.

174
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
But I'm not a bad guy.

175
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Sister, you're not a bad guy, right?

176
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Yes, A Bao.

177
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm not a bad guy.

178
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Can you save me?

179
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Miss Mu,

180
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
no matter what you want,

181
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
don't cheat on a child.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The Xiuhua Palace has died.

183
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
We can't go back to the palace.

184
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Princess Su will be in doubt soon.

185
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
It's not too late.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Let's go to the tomb first.

187
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
What about her?

188
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll take care of her.

189
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
There's no one in the coffin.

190
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It's getting late.

191
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's find a room to rest for the night.

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Master Xie seems to have underestimated

193
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
the power of your Yuchue Palace.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I'm going back to report to the order

195
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
for the great harvest today.

196
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Sister!

197
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Look, he's a bad guy.

198
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Step aside.

199
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I won't let you go back to Sang Qi.

200
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Mu Xuan Ling,

201
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
you can find a new way.

202
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Xie Xue Chen,

203
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
stop lying to yourself.

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm the same as Master.

205
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
You and I are not on the same path.

206
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You love your people and life.

207
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm a spirit.

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
No one in this world has ever treated me well.

209
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
And I

210
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
have never loved this life.

211
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
And you,

212
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I've been lying to you

213
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
since the beginning.

214
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I once saw a ghost

215
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
who was like you.

216
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Don't do anything that will make you regret.

217
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
You really can't bear to leave me?

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
How about this?

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
You go back to the dark prison with me.

220
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
With your intelligence,

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
you can kill Sang Qi

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
and become the new master of the dark prison.

223
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
It's not difficult.

224
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
In this way,

225
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
you can be my companion

226
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
even if you don't have Sang Qi's care.

227
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
What do you think, Master Xie?

228
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You shouldn't live like that.

229
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You're so stubborn.

230
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I know.

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
You can't run away.

232
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Give up.

233
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Leave me alone.

234
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't come over.

235
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Sister.

236
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
You're bleeding.

237
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
A'bao.

238
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Master Xie.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The blood on it

240
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is yours.

241
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The blood of the blood relatives

242
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
can trigger the blood vessels.

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The blood of Miss Mu

244
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
is seen by the Gao Xiu clan.

245
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're blood relatives.

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You're actually sisters.

247
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
How is it possible?

248
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Who said we're sisters?

249
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Miss Mu,

250
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
are you still going?

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
No.

252
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I haven't figured it out.

253
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Don't go.

254
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You do it.

255
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Fine.

256
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I don't believe

257
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
such a ridiculous thing.

258
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Who's afraid of who?

259
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Look.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
How...

261
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
How could this happen?

262
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This...

263
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
This is impossible.

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
It's ridiculous.

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
It's impossible.

266
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm the spirit clan.

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
She's the human clan.

268
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
How could she be blood relatives?

269
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Could it be

270
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
the mother and father?

271
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Don't talk nonsense.

272
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
If my mother had two children,

273
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
how could I not know?

274
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
How could the others not know?

275
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The only explanation is

276
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Fu Lansheng,

277
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
your blood vessels are unreliable.

278
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
They're definitely unreliable.

279
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You can say I'm unreliable,

280
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
but you can't say my magic weapon is bad.

281
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Bi Xiao Gong has been

282
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
practicing magic for thousands of years.

283
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
How could it be wrong?

284
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'll show you.

285
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
What's this?

286
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Don't look, kid.

287
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
What are you doing?

288
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I didn't see it clearly.

289
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's that?

290
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
What's that?

291
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Let me go.

292
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Let me go.

293
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
What's that?

294
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What's that?

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Please don't spread it out.

297
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Please leave some respect to your father.

298
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Now,

299
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
we can only go to the Jin Hua Palace

300
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
and ask Princess Su about everything.

301
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Yes.

302
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
They've been to the tomb of the Mingyue Villa.

303
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
The coffin of Su Ning Xi

304
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
is empty.

305
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
They're going to the Jin Hua Palace

306
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
next.

307
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No matter how smart Xie Xue Chen is,

308
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
he probably didn't expect

309
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
you to leave the two mountains.

310
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm sorry.

311
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I'm sorry.

312
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I'm sorry.

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I'm sorry.

314
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I'm sorry.

315
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I'm sorry.

316
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I'm sorry.

317
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I'm sorry.

318
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
I'm sorry.

319
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I'm sorry.

320
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You left the two mountains

321
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
and came to me.

322
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Isn't that what you mean?

323
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The medicine

324
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
is delivered on the first day of the month.

325
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's the eighth day of the month.

326
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
You still don't see the medicine?

327
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
You just want to

328
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
come here in person, don't you?

329
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
People say that the south master is like a spring breeze.

330
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Why are you here

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
with a thorn in your mouth?

332
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
No matter what,

333
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm your savior, aren't I?

334
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Back then,

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
you were killed by the Ji Mu clan

336
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
and tortured by the evil sect.

337
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I saved you

338
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
with a knife.

339
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Sometimes I think

340
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
it's better not to save you

341
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,000
but to live

342
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
is your own choice.

343
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm not forcing you.

344
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
In the world,

345
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
there are only two people

346
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,000
born to be wise.

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Xie Xue Chen lived a carefree life.

348
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Why are you so down?

349
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
You have a long life.

350
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The rest

351
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
are just rumors.

352
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
I choose for you.

353
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
If you want to die,

354
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
you have to kill yourself with a sword.

355
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I

356
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
take this medicine.

357
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
But there's a bad thing about this medicine.

358
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Once you take it,

359
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
you have to use it every month.

360
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
This way,

361
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,000
you can save your life.

362
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
If you stop using it,

363
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
in less than a year,

364
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
you will be burned to death

365
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and your family will die of pain.

366
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
If you only avenge yourself,

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,000
you die,

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
I can still help you.

369
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Have you thought it over?

370
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm sorry.

388
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,000
I'm sorry.

389
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm sorry.

390
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Lingzu

391
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,480
You hate me and Xing Yi.

392
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,040
So,

393
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,600
you saved the Spirit Clan and came to revenge.

394
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,160
Xue and my brother hate me.

395
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,760
So they conspired with others to destroy my temple.

396
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,440
You took the disciples to suppress the Spirit Clan.

397
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,160
So you led the Spirit Clan to revenge.

398
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
This is my fate.

399
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,160
It's also your fate.

400
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,400
It's our fate to build the temple.

401
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,440
Father.

402
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,120
You want to destroy a living spirit

403
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,720
for a dead concubine.

404
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,720
Right?

405
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,160
You didn't disappoint me.

406
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,600
From now on,

407
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,640
you are the

408
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,000
master of the Cloud Bear Villa.

409
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,120
You've avenged yourself.

410
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,840
You've met the one you want to see.

411
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,160
Master Nan,

412
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,880
where is the Soul Bead I want?

413
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,120
Master Nan.

414
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,800
I promised you

415
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,600
to do three things for you to repay your kindness.

416
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,600
The first thing you mentioned

417
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,880
was to kill the formation in the Cloud Bear Villa

418
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,000
and drag Xie Xue Chen back to the city.

419
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,240
The second thing

420
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,680
was to break the barrier between the two sides of Snow Tower

421
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,280
and let Chi Ying enter the city.

422
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,000
The third thing

423
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,840
was to shoot the Nine-Side Jade Dragon Formation

424
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,560
to save the entrance of the Spirit Clan.

425
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,920
I've done all three things.

426
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,800
As for the fact that you didn't get the Soul Bead,

427
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,160
it's your fault.

428
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,600
It has nothing to do with me.

429
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,440
But Master Nan helped the Nine-Side Jade Dragon Formation

430
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,320
and dragged Xie Xue Chen to deal with the Nine-Side Jade Dragon Formation.

431
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,960
It's really hard for me.

432
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,800
It's your fault.

433
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm not your subordinate.

434
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,800
I don't need to listen to you.

435
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
As for the medicine,

436
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,240
you gave it to me.

437
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,040
Actually, you gave it to me or not,

438
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,600
it's the same for me.

439
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,920
Master Nan is famous all over the world.

440
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,640
How can I believe it?

441
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,400
But I have one thing that I don't understand.

442
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,920
You've waited for many years.

443
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,880
You finally meet your old friend.

444
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,760
Can you really let go of her?

445
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
You really don't want to be her best friend?

446
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,760
Do you want me to kill Xie Xue Chen for you?

447
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,680
It's my own business.

448
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,520
It has nothing to do with you.

449
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,960
I've said it before.

450
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,360
I just want to ask you about your cooperation with An Yu.

451
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,760
And you

452
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,680
can't interfere with my business.

453
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,840
Master Nan, don't be angry.

454
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,680
I understand what you said.

455
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
The next thing

456
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,960
won't bother you.

457
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,680
I'll give you the medicine every month

458
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,120
to make up for the past friendship.

459
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,400
There's one thing I'm really curious about.

460
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,720
More than ten years ago, more than ten years later,

461
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,640
you haven't changed at all.

462
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,000
You have

463
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,840
the thousand-year-old ancient relic of phoenix-leaf grass and the flower-shade elixir.

464
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,720
May I ask you

465
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,400
how old I am?

466
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,400
My age.

467
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,480
I stopped calculating

468
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,800
a long time ago.

469
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,640
Because it's meaningless.

470
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,520
Living long

471
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,480
may not be a good thing.

472
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,000
Because the price to pay

473
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,760
is too much.

474
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,840
Too much.

475
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,280
Princess,

476
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,720
the Alliance has sent people to check on the world.

477
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,360
We haven't found Qiu Min yet.

478
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,680
You know his identity.

479
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,760
Even if he goes to An Yu,

480
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,680
he'll kill thousands of people.

481
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,240
You have to find him back for me.

482
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,120
Yes.

483
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,720
Sister,

484
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,200
I'm afraid I'll be confused for a long time.

485
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,560
If I meet you underground,

486
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,160
will you blame me?

487
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,360
Sister.

488
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,480
People are like pigs and dogs.

489
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,000
If I knew they were going to be my food,

490
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,680
why would I give birth to them?

491
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,400
You're wrong.

492
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,600
Sister, run!

493
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,360
Sister.

494
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,240
Sister, I'm so tired.

495
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,800
I can't run anymore.

496
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,600
Then you rest here.

497
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,320
I'll go find you food.

498
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:25,960
Here.

499
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,240
How did you do it?

500
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,720
I'm a little tired.

501
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,880
I'm going to sleep.

502
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll go to sleep.

503
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,160
I'll go to sleep.

504
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,200
I'll go to sleep.

505
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,200
I'll go to sleep.

506
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,200
I'll go to sleep.

507
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:37,480
I don't know either.

508
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,360
I can only feel his life.

509
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,040
I'll do it after I eat it.

510
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:42,800
Great.

511
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,680
You don't have to starve anymore.

512
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,720
They don't know that

513
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,120
Sister has the ability to eat us like this.

514
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,600
It's so stupid.

515
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,040
If others know about this,

516
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,720
I'll die a terrible death.

517
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:56,880
Princess,

518
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,680
there's a very strong spirit in this forest.

519
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,360
I'm afraid there's someone else here.

520
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,560
Sister, I'm so scared.

521
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,280
What... what do you want?

522
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,240
The place where the fairy is.

523
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,680
The legend is true.

524
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,280
The world is so mysterious.

525
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,400
Good child,

526
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:20,960
how old are you?

527
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,640
What's your name?

528
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,600
My name is Xi.

529
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,880
I'm eight years old.

530
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,840
Xi?

531
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,560
I'm the princess of the Palace of Pure Flower.

532
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,360
Will you go back to the Palace of Pure Flower with me?

533
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,280
I'll take you as my disciple

534
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,120
and teach you Taoism and magic.

535
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,800
You can live a long life

536
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,560
and even live a long life.

537
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,080
You'll be a blessing.

538
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,280
I want to be with my sister, Ah Zhen.

539
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,800
Sister, I'm not afraid.

540
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,520
I'll always protect you.

541
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,880
We'll never be apart.

542
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,800
I didn't protect Jiuying well.

543
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
You've been gone for so many years.

544
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,560
I didn't do anything well.

545
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,280
You go to the dark prison with me

546
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,560
and search for the young princess.

547
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,920
Elder, are we really going to the dark prison?

548
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,760
That's Sang Qi's territory.

549
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,760
Elder, it's the young princess.

550
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,560
She's back.

551
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,760
Young... young princess.

552
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:24,160
Young princess.

553
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,160
Princess, Qiu Ming is back.

554
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,160
Qiu Ming is back.

555
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:41,760
Master.

556
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,760
What's wrong with your hair?

557
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,160
Nothing.

558
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,760
Thank you, City Leader.

559
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,160
You actually came out of the dark prison.

560
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,760
Thanks to the princess,

561
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,360
I won't die in a short time.

562
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,160
What's the matter with you

563
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,560
coming here this time?

564
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,960
Is there a change in the dark prison?

565
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,960
This may be related to Sang Qi.

566
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
Please, Princess Su,

567
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,960
withdraw from the case.

568
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,760
Princess Su,

569
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,560
how many children did your sister, Su Ning Xi,

570
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
have?

571
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:34,760
Thank you, City Leader.

572
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,160
What do you mean by that?

573
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,560
Everyone knows

574
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,160
that my sister married Gao Feng Xu.

575
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,960
She was pregnant in October and had a daughter.

576
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,360
She then died in the process.

577
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,160
I have no intention of offending you.

578
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
I just got a magic weapon from Fulan Sheng Na.

579
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,760
I accidentally tested that Gao Xiu's family

580
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,360
has blood relations with Mu Xuan Ling.

581
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
I'm sorry.

582
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
I'm sorry.

583
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
I'm sorry.

584
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
I'm sorry.

585
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:57,960
I'm sorry.

586
00:31:58,960 --> 00:31:59,960
Thank you, City Leader.

587
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,760
This is really ridiculous.

588
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,560
You mean

589
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,960
they are sisters?

590
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:12,360
My sister only had one child,

591
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,760
and that is Qiu Min.

592
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,560
When she was in her sleep,

593
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,560
did you see it with your own eyes?

594
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,160
Of course I saw it with my own eyes.

595
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,960
When Qiu Min was born,

596
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,960
she was born with a strange appearance.

597
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,360
Her whole body was full of smoothness and smoothness,

598
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,560
so that people couldn't see it with their own eyes.

599
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,760
Couldn't see it with their own eyes?

600
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,160
That means you didn't see it with your own eyes.

601
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
Thank you, City Leader.

602
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,360
Are you trying to prove my sister's innocence?

603
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,760
My sister did have a fight with Sang Qi.

604
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,960
But she and Sang Qi can never have a child.

605
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Because my sister was already...

606
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,960
Master, don't be angry.

607
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,160
We just want to find out the truth.

608
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,960
We don't want to be like Mother's sister.

609
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,760
Master Su, forgive me for being straightforward.

610
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,100
With the

611
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,960
talent of Gao Qiu Min,

612
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,560
he is not worthy of the natural appearance.

613
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,760
Even the born of Xie City Leader and Nan Sect Leader

614
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,960
is not born with this kind of natural appearance.

615
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,160
Can't we talk properly?

616
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,560
Master Su,

617
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
it's not difficult to verify their blood relations.

618
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,960
If you don't believe our magic,

619
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,160
we can use the method of the Flower Palace

620
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:23,360
to verify it again.

621
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,760
You just want to know the truth.

622
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,560
I know your sister's situation.

623
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,160
That's why I'm asking for your opinion in private.

624
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,960
Don't you really want to know

625
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
if your sister has another daughter?

626
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,760
Okay, I'll give you the answer tomorrow.

627
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,560
But don't let anyone else know about this matter.

628
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
Okay.

629
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,560
Su Ning Zhen

630
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,560
really agreed to verify the blood relations.

631
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
It seems that when Su Ning Xi was in the hospital,

632
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,960
something strange must have happened

633
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:05,160
and made her suspect.

634
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,760
There will be a result for this matter tomorrow.

635
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,160
You don't need to think too much.

636
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
Think?

637
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,560
I have no parents since I was a child.

638
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,160
I've been used to being alone.

639
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:18,160
I never thought about getting married.

640
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
It's just related to Gao Qiu Min.

641
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
It's just related to Gao Qiu Min.

642
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,760
I'm not happy about it.

643
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,960
It's best to verify that I have no relationship with Su Ning Xi.

644
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,160
So,

645
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,360
when I kill Gao Qiu Min in the future,

646
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,960
I don't have to worry about it.

647
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,960
If you really don't have any expectations for your relatives,

648
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,960
if you don't want to know who your parents are,

649
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,760
how can you risk your life

650
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,160
to come to the most ruthless Flower Palace?

651
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,560
Isn't this because you're protecting me?

652
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:50,760
You're so stubborn.

653
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,160
Leave me alone.

654
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,560
Blood relations?

655
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,360
Why does it have blood relations?

656
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,160
Why?

657
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,360
Master,

658
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,160
what are you looking for?

659
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,160
How about I help you find it?

660
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,760
I...

661
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,960
Could it be him?

662
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,360
Back then in Yongxue City,

663
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:46,160
Mu Xuan Ling said he was a slave of Mingyue Villa, right?

664
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,360
He even said that before Gao Feng Xu died, he wanted to kill him.

665
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,560
Right?

666
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,160
They all said he was a slave.

667
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,560
But has anyone seen his real body?

668
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,160
He said his spiritual bridge was broken.

669
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,760
He couldn't draw his real body because he didn't have the spiritual elixir.

670
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,360
Then how can you be sure that he's a slave?

671
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:09,160
When he was little, he had a demon mark on his face.

672
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,360
It was like a talisman.

673
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,360
It was a golden mark.

674
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,160
It's impossible for a human to have a face wound.

675
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,360
What demon mark?

676
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,360
Change it.

677
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,760
Change it and show me.

678
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,560
Change it.

679
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,560
That's right.

680
00:36:51,760 --> 00:37:09,700
That's how that

681
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,160
Master, what's wrong with you?

682
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,160
Master.

683
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,160
Master.

684
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,560
Master.

685
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,760
Master.

686
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,860
Master.

687
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,960
Master.

688
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,060
Master.

689
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,160
Master.

690
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,960
Master.

691
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,560
I'm sleeping.

692
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,760
I'll get in after the noon prayer.

693
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,560
I said I was asleep.

694
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,760
Five.

695
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,160
Four.

696
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,760
Three.

697
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,160
Two.

698
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,200
What's up?

699
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,760
This is the Di Festival in the Qinghua Palace.

700
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,640
I'm afraid you'll cause trouble.

701
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,160
So?

702
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,640
So I have to keep an eye on you.

703
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,320
Now that you're not close to the God,

704
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,920
I'd better keep an eye on you.

705
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,840
I'll stay in the room.

706
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,760
You broke into the room at midnight.

707
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,560
Between us,

708
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,440
you and I

709
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
are more like God.

710
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,360
Of course it's you.

711
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:25,240
Are you still going to reason with me?

712
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,480
I've told you a lot of reasons.

713
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:30,280
Does it work?

714
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,080
Why not?

715
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,160
The reasons you told me

716
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,080
really make me happy.

717
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,560
It makes me want to be a good person.

718
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,080
What's the most important thing about being a good person?

719
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,560
Don't lie.

720
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,400
I'm not lying.

721
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:52,120
Fine.

722
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,040
Maybe I'm not that sincere

723
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,040
in being a good person.

724
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,360
What about you?

725
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,160
You came to my room at midnight

726
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,280
and you deserve to be a gentleman.

727
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,120
I'm not a gentleman.

728
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,440
I can be cruel and harsh.

729
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,400
If you don't want to be beaten up by me,

730
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,480
just stay here.

731
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,520
Xie Xue Chen.

732
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,920
You know I'm not a good person.

733
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,520
Why do you have to like me?

734
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,320
I don't want to tell you now.

735
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,760
If you want to know,

736
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,920
just stay with me.

737
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:42,840
Don't go anywhere.

738
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,640
If one day,

739
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,440
I do something terrible,

740
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,520
will you still like me?

741
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,440
Yes.

742
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:01,920
But I'll watch you

743
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,520
and not let you have that chance.

744
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,160
He's like a monk.

745
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,360
Why does he sound like a monk?

746
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,240
But he's so determined.

747
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,160
It's really strange.

748
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,320
When tomorrow comes,

749
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,600
many truths will be exposed.

750
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,840
Whether it's the Chaos Lord Su Ning Xi

751
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,360
or your background.

752
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,360
So tonight,

753
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:34,680
you should be more at ease.

754
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:20,800
What does Master mean by what he said today?

755
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,680
He was supposed to investigate the Chaos Bead.

756
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,280
Why is the mystery getting bigger and bigger?

757
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,640
If all the truths are exposed,

758
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,080
I don't know if it's good or bad.

759
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,880
Mr. Gao.

760
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:43,960
I'm sorry.

761
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
I didn't mean to hurt you.

762
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
Why are you here?

763
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,640
Didn't you say you were waiting outside?

764
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,040
You came to see me laugh.

765
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,680
Of course not.

766
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,360
I prepared some snacks for you.

767
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm afraid that

768
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,280
you'll be sad about what happened recently.

769
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:17,840
I don't know

770
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,040
which thing I should be sad about.

771
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,840
About my mother,

772
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,200
I have so many things to figure out.

773
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,000
Does she love Sang Qi

774
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,480
or my father?

775
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,120
If she gives up what she loves

776
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,640
and marries into Mingyue Villa,

777
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,280
will she be happy?

778
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:49,080
Did she expect me to have a child?

779
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,400
My father used to tell me

780
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,800
that he loved my mother very much.

781
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,200
But my mother gave birth to me.

782
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,920
She died early.

783
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,640
Now it seems

784
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,640
that it's all a lie.

785
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,920
I miss you.

786
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:16,840
I still can't stop loving you.

787
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:19,640
How long has it been?

788
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:24,600
I go through the years of love.

789
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,000
I can't help but meet you.

790
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:33,400
I look back at the days when we spent together.

791
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,480
I look at you and dream of you.

792
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,920
You are in my heart.

793
00:44:39,960 --> 00:44:46,720
I want to stay with you forever.

794
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:49,720
I want to stay with you forever.

795
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:22,280
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

796
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:28,720
I look back at the days when we spent together.

797
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:35,720
I want to stay with you forever.
