Episode 38

14
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
narcissists

15
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,160
type

16
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,260
J 1500

17
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:44,280
Why is it him?

18
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,920
Havana

19
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,220
Why is the dark jade valley in the legend here?

20
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Master!

21
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Master!

22
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Xue Chen,

23
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
let's go!

24
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,520
Hurry!

25
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,920
Why did Princess Su suddenly get hit?

26
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,920
Maybe she got hit long ago.

27
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,920
It's just that she has a high level of cultivation,

28
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:43,420
so she's still in a state of

29
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,920
How much of your spiritual power have you recovered?

30
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Not enough to kill.

31
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:47,920
Lan Xuyue,

32
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,920
the Dark Soul Valley is in danger.

33
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,920
The Dark Soul Valley is in danger.

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,920
The Dark Soul Valley is in danger.

35
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,920
The Dark Soul Valley is in danger.

36
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Lan Xuyue,

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,920
how long can the Dark Soul Valley last?

38
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Three hours.

39
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,920
It will be out of effect after three hours.

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,920
You guys go first.

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:00,920
They all go.

42
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,920
I'll accompany you.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,920
This is the Jin Hua Palace.

44
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
I can't leave no matter what.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
No one can go.

46
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
We can't kill them.

47
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
They're still alive.

48
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,920
They don't know how to fight.

49
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,920
They don't know how to hurt.

50
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,920
They don't know how to be tired.

51
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,920
They will kill us.

52
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,920
This waist hurts.

53
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,920
Master!

54
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Master!

55
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,920
What do you want?

56
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
You won't let me kill anyone.

57
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,920
I have to do this.

58
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,920
To deal with the Evil Valley,

59
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
I can only use the Evil Valley

60
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,920
to fight the poison.

61
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,920
Enough!

62
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,920
Stop!

63
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,920
You still care about me?

64
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Stop!

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:02,920
Master!

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,920
Master!

67
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,920
Master!

68
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
Master, wake up!

69
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Master!

70
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,920
It's enough now.

71
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,920
Mu Xue Ling.

72
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:23,920
Master.

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Mu Xue Ling!

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
How is it?

75
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,920
Did you get hurt before?

76
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,920
What do you mean?

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,920
According to the pulse,

78
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,920
he's injured from old injuries.

79
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
He used blood as a needle

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
to dissipate the evil aura.

81
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,920
It's really a wound.

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,920
What's wrong?

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,920
His spiritual energy is broken.

84
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,920
Yes.

85
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,920
He told me.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
His spiritual energy is broken.

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,920
It means that

88
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,920
he can't practice spiritual power

89
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,920
like ordinary spirits.

90
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,920
He can't get the spiritual elixir.

91
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,920
He can only use the evil aura

92
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,920
to practice the evil power.

93
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
But whether the evil aura is dissipated

94
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
or the evil aura is used,

95
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
for a spirit,

96
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,920
it's a life-or-death situation.

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
You're good at medical skills.

98
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
Is there any way

99
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,920
to help him recover?

100
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,920
Make a wish.

101
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
I don't know much about the evil aura.

102
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I can only go to the pharmacy in Jinghua Palace

103
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:14,920
and see if there's any medicine he can use.

104
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,920
I'll go with you.

105
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,920
I'll go with you.

106
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Miss Mu, have you ever been injured before?

107
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,920
I've been injured.

108
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,920
Dongyang,

109
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:09,920
do you know

110
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,920
what it feels like to be afraid?

111
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
Fear?

112
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Why are you asking me this?

113
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,920
I was afraid

114
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,920
that he would die

115
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,920
just like that.

116
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I'm not sure if I'm afraid.

117
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,920
I just know

118
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
that I don't want him to die.

119
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You don't spend much time with him.

120
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Why do you care so much about this old friend?

121
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,920
It's just a feeling

122
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
if I'm not telling the truth.

123
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,920
It's like

124
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
everything should be like this.

125
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,920
Do you think

126
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,920
he's the person I'm looking for in my dream?

127
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,920
He often appears in my dreams.

128
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,920
But I can't see his face

129
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,920
or the place in my dream.

130
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,920
It feels like

131
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Mu Xuanling

132
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,920
is him.

133
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
Since you're not sure,

134
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,920
then spend more time

135
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,920
to see

136
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,920
if he's the one.

137
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
I'm afraid

138
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
he's not the one.

139
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
I'm afraid

140
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
he's not the one.

141
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:28,920
I'm afraid

142
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
he's not the one.

143
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,920
Xuanling,

144
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Master.

145
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Come here.

146
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,920
It's time to practice martial arts.

147
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Master.

148
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Do you want power?

149
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Do you want revenge?

150
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,920
You should be possessed by the demon.

151
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Don't let it get into your body.

152
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
Don't let it get into your body.

153
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
Remember,

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,920
the demon is the source of power.

155
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Love will betray you.

156
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
Love will betray you.

157
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:23,920
The only thing you can rely on

158
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,920
is power.

159
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Master,

160
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,920
why is our practice

161
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
so painful?

162
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,920
Because

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
we were born with sins.

164
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,920
Mu Xuanling.

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,920
It hurts.

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,920
It hurts.

167
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
Mu Xuanling.

168
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,920
It hurts.

169
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,920
You've got so many notes.

170
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
You may be used to reading it.

171
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
I think you are very fresh.

172
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,040
What?

173
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
Are you curious about how I write you?

174
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,120
Do you want to read it?

175
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,320
I'm not curious.

176
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,160
Facing my kindness,

177
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,280
I can do something that is not easy to do.

178
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,080
It's hard to think of.

179
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:15,920
I'm not good at writing.

180
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
But after killing 1800 dark clans,

181
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,040
I dare to play the big game.

182
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:21,720
This is the monitor.

183
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,720
It's a little bit exaggerated.

184
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,680
It's a very big piece.

185
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,640
It's very sharp.

186
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,640
It's a little bit arrogant.

187
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:28,560
He actually trapped me in this formation.

188
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm so angry.

189
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,760
Xie Xuechen, you bastard.

190
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,200
Today, he enjoyed the moon with me.

191
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Of course.

192
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,480
To be precise,

193
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,720
I had to enjoy the moon with him.

194
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,400
In fact, the moon is not round and not bright.

195
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,200
There's nothing to see.

196
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,800
But he stood there alone

197
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,840
and looked at the ancient tube.

198
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,160
He said,

199
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,200
I can't see it.

200
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I can't see it.

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I can't see it.

202
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
I can't see it.

203
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I can't see it.

204
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I can't see it.

205
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I can't see it.

206
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I can't see it.

207
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I can't see it.

208
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I can't see it.

209
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,360
I'll just talk to him

210
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,640
as I don't have to.

211
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,560
I talked to him about the dark jade.

212
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,520
He didn't comment on my life.

213
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,200
He didn't mention his life to me.

214
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,160
Sometimes I feel

215
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,240
I'm like the blood moon in the dark jade.

216
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,520
And he

217
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,680
is like the moon in the human world.

218
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,680
Each has its own position.

219
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,080
Never taught.

220
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,480
But if it can,

221
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,160
I want him to know

222
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,960
even if he's alive,

223
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,120
he can be not so lonely.

224
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,160
Thank you, Young Master.

225
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,280
I blocked one for you.

226
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
Even if it's your sword,

227
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
it's painful to be stabbed.

228
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,520
Why don't you care about me?

229
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:10,520
How about

230
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,000
you make the demon elixir

231
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,040
that the jade shadow just drew

232
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,040
and let me eat it?

233
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,360
I can also increase my power.

234
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,040
I'm sorry for not rushing you.

235
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,160
Xuan Ling.

236
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,320
You're awake.

237
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,800
Thank you, Chen.

238
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,680
I'm fine.

239
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,680
Are you feeling unwell?

240
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,680
My body hurts.

241
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,200
It hurts.

242
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,160
My head hurts.

243
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,880
My heart hurts.

244
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,080
My hands and feet hurt.

245
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,960
It hurts.

246
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,160
The clothes you put on me are like a knife.

247
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,160
You're using your power to absorb the demon energy.

248
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:10,160
It won't hurt anymore.

249
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,680
Xuan Xun Chen.

250
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,160
Am I being poisoned?

251
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Why?

252
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,160
Why am I feeling so bad?

253
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,440
You're not being poisoned.

254
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,240
You just ate the demon elixir from the jade seal.

255
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Now the demon energy is re-entering your body.

256
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
It needs your power to solve it.

257
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,240
The demon elixir from the jade seal.

258
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Okay.

259
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
I'll try it then.

260
00:16:57,240 --> 00:17:02,620
I'm willing to go through all the

261
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,620
hardships in this world.

262
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:10,620
I'm willing to go through all the hardships in this world.

263
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
You've been through hardships and hardships,

264
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:14,620
I'm willing to be humble.

265
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,620
I'm willing to be humble.

266
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,620
I'm willing to be humble.

267
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:18,620
I'm willing to be humble.

268
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,620
I'm willing to be humble.

269
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:20,620
I'm willing to be humble.

270
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,620
I'm willing to be humble.

271
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,620
I'm willing to be humble.

272
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:23,620
I'm willing to be humble.

273
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:24,620
I'm willing to be humble.

274
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:25,620
I'm willing to be humble.

275
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
I'm willing to be humble.

276
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I'm willing to be humble.

277
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm willing to be humble.

278
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'm willing to be humble.

279
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'm willing to be humble.

280
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I'm willing to be humble.

281
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm willing to be humble.

282
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
I'm willing to be humble.

283
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm willing to be humble.

284
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
I'm willing to be humble.

285
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'm willing to be humble.

286
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I'm willing to be humble.

287
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm willing to be humble.

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
I'm willing to be humble.

289
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm willing to be humble.

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
I'm willing to be humble.

291
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm willing to be humble.

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
I'm willing to be humble.

293
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm willing to be humble.

294
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
I'm willing to be humble.

295
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm willing to be humble.

296
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm willing to be humble.

297
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm willing to be humble.

298
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'm willing to be humble.

299
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
I'm willing to be humble.

300
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,380
I'm willing to be humble.

301
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,380
I'm willing to be humble.

302
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,380
I'm willing to be humble.

303
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,380
I'm willing to be humble.

304
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:58,380
Wu Tong.

305
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Wu Rong.

306
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,380
Wu Qi.

307
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:02,380
Oh, no.

308
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,380
Leng Jing?

309
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,380
Leng Jing.

310
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:07,380
Xie Xiu Chen, what are you doing?

311
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Gao Xiu Shi, what's the matter?

312
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Mu Xuan Ling's Demon Palace has broken the Soul-saving Valley.

313
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The evil aura that is left behind

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I have used the Spirit-ghost list to clear it.

315
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Everyone will wake up tomorrow.

316
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I came to hear you tell me

317
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
what's going on with Mu Xuan Ling.

318
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
That's right. She is a spirit.

319
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because of the broken spirit, she had to rest in the Demon Palace.

320
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The one who fought with you in the first battle that day

321
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
was me and her.

322
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It was just a mask covered with magic.

323
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
I said that her backache was so severe.

324
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You two lied to me for so long.

325
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
She was going to kill me that day.

326
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
That day's truth was indeed just a misunderstanding.

327
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Moreover, in terms of the cause,

328
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
you also caught the embroidered rat

329
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
and hurt people.

330
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You should have seen clearly these two days.

331
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Mu Xuan Ling has no evil intentions.

332
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
You are now talking for the spiritual group.

333
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Gao Xiu Shi is the same.

334
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:20,000
You can also show mercy to the spiritual group.

335
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I didn't show mercy. I won't.

336
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
You know Mu Xuan Ling is practicing the Demon Palace

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
and know that she is weak.

338
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
If you really want to deal with her,

339
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
you can just send a sword to the Spirit-ghost to catch her.

340
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
How can you let her rest in the Xinhua Palace

341
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:37,000
and ask me why I lost my love?

342
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I don't want others to say that I'm not different.

343
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Moreover, you trust her so much now.

344
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Aren't you afraid that she will bite you?

345
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Is Gao Xiu Shi talking about Mu Xuan Ling

346
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
or Cui Wan Wan?

347
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
I believe that Gao Xiu Shi

348
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
won't tell you about Mu Xuan Ling.

349
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
My mouth is not that big.

350
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You can just take care of your own people.

351
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Sect Leader Nan, you came at the right time.

352
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I want to ask what is going on with the Soul-dead Valley.

353
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Why is everyone infected?

354
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
It's a type of blood that is recorded in ancient books.

355
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
The dead need to take the Dark Jade Blood Valley

356
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
to nourish their own blood.

357
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
Once they have been nourished,

358
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
they will be crushed and put on the qi object.

359
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Whoever has touched this qi object

360
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
will become its puppet after the death of the dead.

361
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
They will forget everything

362
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
and only remember to complete the will of the dead.

363
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
They will be defeated in one go.

364
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What kind of hidden qi object is this?

365
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Even my master can't find it.

366
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
It might not be hidden.

367
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's just a small thing.

368
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
It's obvious that people won't suspect it.

369
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
What do you mean?

370
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
It's Cui Wan Wan.

371
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
She knew that the Su Wang Formation might be a trap.

372
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
She used her life as a barrier to destroy it.

373
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
And she kept a backup.

374
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
She put the Soul-dead Valley on the jade seal.

375
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
If she wins the bet,

376
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
she can destroy the formation and destroy the spirit elixir.

377
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,000
If she doesn't,

378
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
she can't be able to get the Soul-dead Valley back.

379
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
She can destroy the formation and destroy the spirit elixir

380
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
to keep the secret behind it.

381
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If she loses the bet,

382
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
she will die.

383
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
But she will also activate the Soul-dead Valley.

384
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
In this way,

385
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
someone will come to kill Xie Xue Chen for her.

386
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
But what she wants is to destroy the Human Clan and protect the Spirit Clan.

387
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
Why would she kill Xie Xue Chen?

388
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
She is guilty of being a victim of the bane.

389
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Xue Chen is deeply involved in the Qu Palace.

390
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
She is the strongest of the Human Clan.

391
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
She is also the future of the Immortal Alliance.

392
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,000
The Human Clan

393
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
will destroy the hope of the Human Clan first.

394
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
In order to complete the mission,

395
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
she lost her own life.

396
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
How bad is that?

397
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
I'm a little tired.

398
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'll leave you now.

399
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Why are you here?

400
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'm here to learn a new skill

401
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
to ease the pain on Miss Mu.

402
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Let's go.

403
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Go and give her a try.

404
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
No need.

405
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
She is already well.

406
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Well?

407
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Maybe she is more experienced.

408
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
She is already asleep.

409
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
It's better not to go.

410
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
You should know

411
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
that you are not good at lying.

412
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Why would I lie to you?

413
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
She is really asleep.

414
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
I'm not talking about Miss Mu.

415
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
The innocent Princess Xie

416
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
who was innocent before

417
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
is now saying

418
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
that she doesn't drink.

419
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Your lie

420
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
is too obvious.

421
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
I'm sorry.

422
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Xie Xuechen, Xie Xuechen.

423
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You don't even think about it.

424
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
Why is Yu Ying called Yu Ying?

425
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You dare to feed her

426
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
the peony you gave her.

427
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm not bullying you.

428
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
How dare you!

429
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You are so stubborn.

430
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
You let her die like that.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
You really gave her a good chance.

432
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
If she had been so vicious,

433
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
she would have been broken into pieces.

434
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Master, Cui Wanwan is dead.

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
The chaos in the Palace of Jin has been calmed.

436
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
You don't have to worry about your health

437
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
because of her.

438
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm just angry with others.

439
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
You don't have to be afraid.

440
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
But, Qiong Ming,

441
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
after this,

442
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
you should see clearly

443
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
that there are fewer people

444
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
and things you can trust in this world.

445
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,000
You can only rely on yourself.

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
So you have to become stronger

447
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
and have no weaknesses.

448
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Do you understand?

449
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
I understand.

450
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
I don't remember what happened last night.

451
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
But I have a slight impression.

452
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
Xie Xuechen's spiritual power has not recovered yet.

453
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I don't know what happened last night.

454
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Xie Xuechen's spiritual power has not recovered yet.

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
The chaos in the puppet is so fierce.

456
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You five alone

457
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
can calm down the chaos.

458
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Although Xie Xuechen's spiritual power has not recovered yet,

459
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
she has observed the crisis

460
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
and found the flaw of the puppet.

461
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
In addition, Nan Xue's magic array is the best in the world.

462
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,000
If she and her team work together,

463
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
she will break the evil bone.

464
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
I don't know when I will be able to

465
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
return the affection

466
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
between Yongxue City and the Jade Embroidery Manor.

467
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
This kind of uncertain thing

468
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,000
is really hard to calm down.

469
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
If we work together,

470
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
try to help each other,

471
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:11,000
we will not ask for these favors.

472
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
Try to help each other?

473
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Try to help each other?

474
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Try to help each other?

475
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Do you really think so?

476
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
I heard that the immortal alliance has started to build up.

477
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
It seems that Young Master Xie has got up a little late today.

478
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Could it be that he is thinking about what kind of person and what kind of thing

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,000
and is coming back to his position repeatedly and can't sleep at night?

480
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
So he got up late?

481
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
Don't talk nonsense.

482
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
Did I talk nonsense

483
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
or did someone take advantage of someone's power last night

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
and do something wrong and make a bad person innocent?

485
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Last night, you...

486
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
What about me?

487
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
You fed me the elixir.

488
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
How would I know if you did it on purpose or not?

489
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
Maybe someone is just saying what they want

490
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
and saying no.

491
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
But in their heart...

492
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
I am doing this to save you.

493
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,000
You are admitting it?

494
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
You are just caring about me.

495
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
Me?

496
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
You even care about going to peek at my little book?

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I told you to look at it.

498
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
But you are peeking.

499
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Do you think that it is more exciting to peek?

500
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
Who said that I peeked?

501
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I put it by your pillow last night.

502
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
You will see it when you wake up and you will think of me.

503
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
So I didn't hide it.

504
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
I didn't peek.

505
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Xie Xuechen, do you think it is very strange?

506
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
You are just a stubborn person.

507
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:29,000
No. I know if you are stubborn or not.

508
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Actually, you are quite soft.

509
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,000
So you can hide. Then why didn't you hide?

510
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
Can you stop hiding?

511
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
Kiss me.

512
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
Miss Mu, you were very exhausted last night.

513
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You woke up so early. Is it good?

514
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,000
Thanks to Young Master Xie's help last night.

515
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
I am almost recovered.

516
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I came to thank him.

517
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The time is now.

518
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It is already late to stay in Jinghua Palace.

519
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You should go back to Yinxiu Villa as soon as possible.

520
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
And send me back to Yongxue City.

521
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
I have ordered them to prepare the materials needed for the formation.

522
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Go now. Go to say goodbye to Princess Su.

523
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Why does she go so fast?

524
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
I won't eat her.

525
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Wait for me.

526
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Princess Su, the situation in Jinghua Palace has been settled.

527
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
There is another important thing in Yongxue City.

528
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I came to say goodbye to you.

529
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Since there is an important thing, I won't keep you.

530
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
But Young Master's spiritual power hasn't recovered yet.

531
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
It is not as good as sending my disciples to escort you.

532
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Yinxiu Villa will help Young Master Xie.

533
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
You can rest assured.

534
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
Besides, Jinghua Palace has just experienced a battle.

535
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
It takes time to recuperate.

536
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I won't bother you.

537
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
Qiu Ming, escort some people for me.

538
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Yes.

539
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Goodbye.

540
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
Everyone, please.

541
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Gao Xiu Shi sent you here.

542
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Mu Xian Ling, let me tell you.

543
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
I didn't tell my master about you because of Xie Xue Chen.

544
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
You must be happy and be a new person.

545
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
A new person?

546
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
It is a little difficult.

547
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
Stop playing with me.

548
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
If I see you do evil again, I will arrest you to the Sword Spirit Division.

549
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Thank you for your forgiveness.

550
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
As a reward, I won't arrest you to force the children to protect you.

551
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
And tell others that you can't beat me.

552
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
There are so many people here.

553
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,000
You can't be so quiet.

554
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,000
How can you...

555
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
What?

556
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Since you two are in agreement...

557
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
That's not what I meant.

558
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Fool.

559
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
I shouldn't be here, making a fuss.

560
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I have important matters to attend to.

561
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Don't bother me.

562
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
Slow down.

563
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Where did you get your hostile feelings for Gao Qiu Ming from?

564
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
Do you have an old grudge against him?

565
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,000
You are so forgetful.

566
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
You won't remember even if I tell you.

567
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Should I go and forget?

568
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
A'bao, how is this one?

569
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
The golden age of the gold is wrong.

570
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
It's not 300 years.

571
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
At most, it's only 70 years.

572
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Only 70 years?

573
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Look.

574
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
The color is quite old.

575
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
A'bao, why don't you embroider it more carefully?

576
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,000
All right.

577
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,000
A'bao is a embroidered bag.

578
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
He is most sensitive to jewelry.

579
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
How can he be wrong to embroider for a year?

580
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
A'bao, take a break.

581
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
If there is anything you want to eat, tell us.

582
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
A'bao, why don't you eat some snacks first?

583
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Okay.

584
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,000
Sister.

585
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Sister.

586
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
A'bao.

587
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
It's only three days.

588
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Is it that exaggerated?

589
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
If I knew it earlier, I should have brought you to see Gao Qiu Ming.

590
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
It's not necessary.

591
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,000
Brother Xie.

592
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
Master Nan.

593
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,000
Sister Bai Yao.

594
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Master.

595
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
How is the material preparation for the equipment?

596
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,000
The material is ready.

597
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,000
It's being trained.

598
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,000
It will be completed after noon.

599
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
After noon?

600
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It seems that you have to wait for another half day.

601
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Why don't you go back to your room and rest?

602
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
When you have recovered, the material will be ready.

603
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Xu Yue.

604
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,000
Thank you.

605
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,000
Go and rest.

606
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:44,000
You will be busy when you return to Yongxue City and the four prefectures.

607
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,000
Xie Yue Chen.

608
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,000
What is it?

609
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I said that you are being arrogant.

610
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
You still owe me an answer.

611
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Then I will ask you again.

612
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
I will go back to Yongxue City with you.

613
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
Okay?

614
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Mu Xuan Ling.

615
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,000
I have a question.

616
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
I hope that you can answer me seriously.

617
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
Okay.

618
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Do you really want to start over?

619
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,000
Don't move.

620
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
Don't you want to hear my sincere words?

621
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
Do you think that

622
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:57,000
I always speak the truth and not the truth?

623
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,000
Xie Yue Chen.

624
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
I was not born like this.

625
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
I have been very sincere.

626
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
I was very sincere in bringing people.

627
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Do you believe it?

628
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,000
But in the dark,

629
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:19,000
you can't live on the basis of sincerity and kindness.

630
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,000
There is no pity in the dark.

631
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
Only respect the strong.

632
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
I have only been killed and disguised.

633
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,000
To survive.

634
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,000
To survive.

635
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
To meet the person I want to see.

636
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
To return the favor I should return.

637
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
I am very serious now.

638
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I am very serious now.

639
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I am very serious now.

640
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
I don't want to return to the dark.

641
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
I want to live under the sun.

642
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Are you willing to take me away?

643
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:21,000
Your temperament is not compatible with Yong Xue City.

644
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,000
So when you arrive at Yong Xue City,

645
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
you have to start from the most advanced outer disciples.

646
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
Cultivate your body and mind.

647
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Come back.

648
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
Okay.

649
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Don't use the devil's power again.

650
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,000
Okay.

651
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
I have already told you.

652
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
I have already told you.

653
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
I have already told you.

654
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,000
I have already told you.

655
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,000
I have already told you.

656
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,000
I have already told you.

657
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
I have already told you.

658
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,000
Don't bother me.

659
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Okay.

660
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This is a bit difficult.

661
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
Okay.

662
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
I will try to control it.

663
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Sister.

664
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Did you really agree to it?

665
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,000
Why did you come to the eavesdropper?

666
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
Sister.

667
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
It's a bit tiring.

668
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,000
Are you really not going to bother me anymore?

669
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,000
Obviously, I can't.

670
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Then you are lying again.

671
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
I am not lying.

672
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
I said I will try to control it.

673
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:38,000
But it's hard to say if I can control it.

674
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,000
Brother just met you.

675
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
He will be very angry sooner or later.

676
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
I will be responsible for him.

677
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Don't you plan to keep your old friend?

678
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
He has already made a decision.

679
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
He can't keep her.

680
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
Whether it's in the past or now,

681
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
he can't keep her.

682
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
Such a big plate of candy.

683
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
But he only drew a little bit of love.

684
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
He is really a timid little girl.

685
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
I like at this time.

686
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
I like when you are angry.

687
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000
But first,

688
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,000
tell me the reason why you chose this person.

689
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Father.

690
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Just then,

691
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
who were you talking to?

692
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
A little spirit earthamız.

693
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:46,680
I am not feeling bad

694
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,240
as I am parts of the stars.

695
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,280
Really?

696
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,360
Actually, it's not a big deal

697
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,500
for me to lose key five lanks on time.

698
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,080
I can still do a lot of things,

699
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,620
such as

700
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,720
railing woodenenezuwen.

701
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,320
Not a big deal?

702
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,680
You are saying it's not a big deal?

703
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,500
Do you know

704
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,320
with ten Overorned Storm Wells,

705
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,360
the power they have

706
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,400
and the glory they have,

707
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,800
at the scale of a railing woodenenezuwen's collapse

708
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,240
Now you're a useless person.

709
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,240
How dare you tell me it's okay?

710
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:31,360
Gao Feng Xu won't borrow the Soul Bead.

711
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:32,520
Let's go.

712
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,240
Father.

713
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,640
Then...

714
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,800
Can I take away that little spirit slave?

715
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,480
Are you kidding me?

716
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,240
You ruined the Three Gorges.

717
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,440
You're a useless person.

718
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,680
A useless person.

719
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,640
How dare you tell the late king about it?

720
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,000
You...

721
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:16,840
This...

722
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,440
I was in a hurry that afternoon.

723
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,440
For him,

724
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm just a regular passerby.

725
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,960
I couldn't take him away before.

726
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,120
Now I can't keep him.

727
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,640
I'm afraid that

728
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,000
everything will be wrong

729
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,240
if I don't do it now.

730
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,880
Are you going to leave now?

731
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,680
Leave?

732
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,120
I haven't figured out

733
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,000
if he's the one in my dream.

734
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,600
If he doesn't stay,

735
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,280
I'll leave with him.

736
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:13,960
So what?

737
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,600
I want to look for your face

738
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,080
between the reincarnations.

739
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,520
If no one finds the tears in my heart,

740
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,560
will I still be unconscious

741
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,800
and have something on my mind?

742
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,680
I'm still a young woman.

743
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,600
How far have I gone?

744
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,760
I go through the six years of love

745
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,800
and I never fail to meet you.

746
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:24,160
I look back at the days when we spent together.

747
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,280
I look at you and dream about you.

748
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,720
I don't have any regrets.

749
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,640
I'll stay by your side forever.

750
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,160
I want to look for your face

751
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,960
between the reincarnations.

752
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:52,600
If no one finds the tears in my heart,

753
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,120
will I still be unconscious

754
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:59,960
and have something on my mind?

755
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:01,480
I'm still a young woman.

756
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,600
How far have I gone?

757
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,680
I go through the six years of love

758
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,800
and I never fail to meet you.

759
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,400
I look back at the days when we spent together.

760
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,040
I look at you and dream about you.

761
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:19,480
I don't have any regrets.

762
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:26,520
I'll stay by your side forever.

763
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,280
How far have I gone?

764
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:19,680
I go through the six years of love

765
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,800
and I never fail to meet you.

766
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:30,240
I look back at the days when we spent together.

767
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,280
I look at you and dream about you.

768
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,720
I don't have any regrets.

769
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:43,320
I'll stay by your side forever.

770
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:45,800
I want to look for your face

771
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,120
between the reincarnations.

772
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:52,240
If no one finds the tears in my heart,

773
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,720
will I still be unconscious

774
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,400
and have something on my mind?

775
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,600
I'm still a young woman.

776
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:04,400
How far have I gone?

777
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,280
I go through the six years of love

778
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:10,400
and I never fail to meet you.

779
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:16,400
I look back at the days when we spent together.

780
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,600
I look at you and dream about you.

781
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,800
I don't have any regrets.

782
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,600
I'll stay by your side forever.
