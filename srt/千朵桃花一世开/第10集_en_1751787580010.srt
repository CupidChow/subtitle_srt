Mu Xuan Ling

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
Mu Xuan Ling

7
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Mu Xuan Ling

8
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,240
Mu Xuan Ling

9
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,800
Mu Xuan Ling

10
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,440
Xue... Xue Zhi

11
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I'm so...

12
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:14,720
I know

13
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,040
Stop talking

14
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,520
Gao Qiang Min

15
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,880
You didn't do it on purpose

16
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,200
What's your problem?

17
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,600
Yes

18
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,320
He wanted to marry Ming Yue

19
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,200
But Ming Yue was seduced

20
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,880
Gao Xiu Shi and Master Xie had a engagement

21
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:43,320
Now it seems

22
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,920
Master Xie is having an affair with Miss Mu

23
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:49,880
It's a sin

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Gao Xiu Shi

25
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
Gao Xiu Shi

26
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,040
I heard there's a spy in the city

27
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,520
I'm here to help

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,320
Is Gao Xiu Shi all right?

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,800
It's impossible to see someone in love

30
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,200
How can it be good?

31
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,360
Fu Lan Shang, what nonsense are you talking about?

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,360
Did he see me report the spy?

33
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,240
It's so embarrassing

34
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,840
I can't let him tell anyone

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,840
Thank you for your concern

36
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:35,040
I didn't expect it to be like this

37
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,400
Please don't tell others

38
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,360
He doesn't want others to know

39
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,360
that he was betrayed by a married man

40
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,440
It's okay

41
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,240
Don't worry

42
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,920
I can keep secrets

43
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,720
But I have to thank Master Xie

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,400
and Miss Mu

45
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,240
for their help

46
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,200
He means

47
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,760
I should stop Mu Xuan Ling

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,240
from seeing him

49
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,720
and Xie Xue Chen

50
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,680
I understand what you mean

51
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,920
Thank you for your concern

52
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,840
It's good that you understand

53
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,640
Because it's not easy

54
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,560
to stop crying and making trouble

55
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,920
You're a strong girl

56
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,960
He ran away

57
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,280
Then make her dumping

58
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:10,480
No

59
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,800
If she can do that

60
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,080
she should have left

61
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,160
She didn't fall prison for too long

62
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,920
Someone stopped him

63
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,200
Yeah

64
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,520
Xiburst

65
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,840
What are you doing?

66
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,160
I'm checking

67
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,760
this out

68
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,960
Okay

69
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm here

70
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,560
Just be good

71
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,280
and do what you wanna do

72
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,160
Bye

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,240
Not only can't you cultivate your spiritual power,

74
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,240
but you can't absorb it either.

75
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
It really hurts.

76
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,240
The pain that the Mo Palace brought you.

77
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,240
How many years have you endured it?

78
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
How many times?

79
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Transfer the damage of the Yan State to yourself.

80
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,240
Thank you, God.

81
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
I gave you this bracelet

82
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,240
not to let you use it like this.

83
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,240
I have the Jade-Winged Fox Iron

84
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
to recover quickly.

85
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,240
But it can't stand it.

86
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,240
You actually have a time when you can't bear to be hurt by someone.

87
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,240
What do you think about him?

88
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
I brought him to Yongxue City.

89
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,240
Let him become a disciple of Yongxue City.

90
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
He should be responsible for it.

91
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Should I be responsible for it or should I want to be responsible for it?

92
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,240
Take good care of him for me.

93
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,240
He would want you to stay here.

94
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,240
But I...

95
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
can't just stay here for him.

96
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,240
Can't just stay here for him.

97
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Isn't it tiring

98
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,240
to fall in love with someone like this?

99
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
If you don't want to fall in love with her,

100
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
then you can stay here.

101
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
I can't just stay here.

102
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
I can't do this.

103
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,240
I can't do this.

104
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
I can't.

105
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,240
I can't.

106
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
I can't.

107
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
I can't.

108
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
I can't.

109
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,240
I can't.

110
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,240
What do you think about him?

111
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
He's a good person.

112
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,240
He doesn't follow the rules.

113
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,240
The time is almost up.

114
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
I think

115
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
he's not suitable to be a disciple of Yongxue City.

116
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
Send him in.

117
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm leaving.

118
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,240
Senior, you're...

119
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,240
I told you to keep an eye on him.

120
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
I didn't want to record this.

121
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
The official needs to be concerned.

122
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,240
But he's a spiritual being.

123
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
There's no difference.

124
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,240
Maybe from the beginning,

125
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,040
there will be more and more spiritual fellows.

126
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,440
There have been a thousand years of conflict between the gods and spirits.

127
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,880
What you want to do

128
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,720
may not be so easy.

129
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,160
But it's possible.

130
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,160
Isn't it?

131
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,040
Yes.

132
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
The dark clan has invaded the Qing Dynasty and escaped the Five Sons.

133
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,080
Order the whole city to search.

134
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,360
Don't let go of any place.

135
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,040
Yes.

136
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,200
The

137
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,920
This is Xie Xuechen's room.

138
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,200
Mu Xuanling.

139
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,280
Xie Xuechen.

140
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,280
He...

141
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,160
I know.

142
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,800
So I'm right.

143
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,200
So he really brought me back.

144
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
So I have to die once

145
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
to have this treatment.

146
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,440
Xie Xuechen

147
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
You led a family

148
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,920
and performed a loyal service here.

149
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,080
It's you who touched this culture of satisfying people.

150
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,080
YouUp.

151
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,040
What are you doing, Mu?

152
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:37,840
Mu.

153
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,560
What are you doing?

154
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:47,240
I thought you would be unhappy if he was not here.

155
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,240
What's there to be unhappy about?

156
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,240
I don't think he should be guarding me.

157
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,240
Where's A'Bao?

158
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,240
He's sent back to the cellar.

159
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm afraid he might be scared and use the Le Xi spell.

160
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,240
He went to sleep.

161
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,240
I told him this road is dangerous.

162
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
I told him not to follow me.

163
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
He wouldn't listen.

164
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Thank you.

165
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,240
The Le Xi spell is not that bad.

166
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,240
You don't have to be in pain so quickly.

167
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,240
You don't have to be in pain because someone is taking your place.

168
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,240
Xue Chen has transferred all your wounds to him.

169
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,240
My wounds? I can take them myself.

170
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,240
Who wants him to do it?

171
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I'll go find him.

172
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,240
Although the wound has healed, the Le Xi spell still hurts your internal energy.

173
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,240
You still need to rest.

174
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,240
Besides, even if you go find him now, it won't change anything.

175
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:04,240
I haven't paid off what I owe him.

176
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,240
He's got a new heart.

177
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,240
He didn't do it on purpose, right?

178
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,240
Forget it. I'll pay him back.

179
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:19,240
He's got connections.

180
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,240
Maybe he'll be like this forever.

181
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,240
Love is really so important.

182
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,240
It can make you be killed by you.

183
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:49,240
For me, living is meaningless.

184
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:53,240
I don't think it's a pity to die.

185
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Anyway, no one cares.

186
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:05,240
But he spent a day teaching me how to be happy and painful.

187
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,240
I won't let you get hurt again.

188
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,240
Don't say you're not in pain anymore.

189
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,240
I'll take you away.

190
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,240
Every four-day festival in the future, you can see the brilliant fireworks.

191
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:30,240
When you open your eyes, everything will be fine.

192
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,240
He made me understand the meaning of life and death.

193
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,240
Eldest Brother!

194
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:48,240
Although it's only a day, it's enough to support me to spend ten years in the dark.

195
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,240
To live a life without seeing the sun and pain.

196
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:58,240
If you're doing it for that day,

197
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:05,240
but now ten years have passed, he doesn't care anymore.

198
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,240
Are you really in love with him?

199
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Do you care about him or her?

200
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:18,240
Is it a favor or a love?

201
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Why should we be separated?

202
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:32,240
We're all Xie Xuechen. That's enough.

203
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,240
If you treat me as an old friend,

204
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:39,240
isn't it for the past day?

205
00:16:53,240 --> 00:17:01,240
I'm so jealous that you're living a life without seeing the sun and pain.

206
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,240
I'm really jealous of the life and death without seeing the sun and pain.

207
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,240
It's a pity that we couldn't get rid of that dark clan.

208
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,240
When Xuanxin arrived, she disappeared.

209
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,240
Maybe someone saved her.

210
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,240
Not necessarily. Maybe that dark clan

211
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,240
was able to get someone else back in time and escaped from the curse.

212
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,240
That dark clan wants to escape from the curse.

213
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,240
They must hide in the heart of the cultivation master.

214
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,240
If they're in the dark clan,

215
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
who will they be?

216
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,240
The new disciples of each sect,

217
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,240
the elders,

218
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,240
and even the masters.

219
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,240
The defense barrier of Yongxue City has no reaction.

220
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:18,240
How did the dark clan sneak in without a sound?

221
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
The defense barrier of Yongxue City

222
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,240
can't enter the single-way formation.

223
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:32,240
Unless someone is inside the formation and opens the double-way formation outside the formation.

224
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,240
Then it's possible for the dark clan to enter.

225
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:44,240
What you mean is that someone in the city is in cahoots with the dark clan?

226
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,240
Do you have a way to find out about that dark clan?

227
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,240
I do have a way.

228
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:53,240
The dark clan has been revived by the Star Demon.

229
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:56,240
The Xuan Tian Sect also has a法門可觀道心.

230
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,240
We can perhaps check one by one

231
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,240
and find out the person who gave birth to the Star Demon.

232
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,240
Why don't you leave this matter to Xuanxin?

233
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,240
She has been very clear and bright since she was young.

234
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:15,240
Then I'll leave this matter to you.

235
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,240
I'm afraid that we'll be in a big trouble if we check one by one.

236
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,240
I'll use the dark clan to enter

237
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,240
and recommend the leader in advance.

238
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
Please send the righteous and the evil to listen to it.

239
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,240
At that time, I'll leave it to you

240
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:38,240
to secretly use the Taoist law to investigate the person who has the Star Demon.

241
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Then I'll do it.

242
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:49,240
Sect Leader, I'd like to discuss the tea banquet with City Leader Xie.

243
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,240
Junior Brother has something to say.

244
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,240
Yes, City Leader Xie.

245
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,240
The dark clan was discovered by Yan Zhou.

246
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,240
When I went to look for it, he disappeared.

247
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,240
When Sect Leader mentioned this,

248
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
I thought that City Leader Xie was very wise.

249
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,240
I wonder if this matter is related to you.

250
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,240
Why didn't you ask me earlier?

251
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,240
Since you don't want Sect Leader to know,

252
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,240
I'll ask Qingyuan first.

253
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
Yes.

254
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,240
This matter is indeed related to me.

255
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,240
I took away a spiritual ancestor.

256
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,240
He had practiced the Demon Palace, so he was hurt by Yan Zhou.

257
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,240
But he is not the dark clan we are looking for.

258
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,240
So that's the case.

259
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,240
Does City Leader Xie trust him?

260
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Yes. I trust him.

261
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Since that's the case, I know.

262
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,240
Junior Brother doesn't plan to eliminate the demon?

263
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,240
This is different from the other cultivation methods of the Dark Clan.

264
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:08,240
It's just related to good and evil.

265
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,240
Junior Brother is smart.

266
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,240
This room is cold.

267
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,240
It's just like him.

268
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,240
How about I add some surprises for you?

269
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,240
This is more beautiful.

270
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
When Xie Xuechen comes back, he will be shocked.

271
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
Ling'er.

272
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,240
Ling'er.

273
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,240
Ling'er.

274
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Dark prison?

275
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,240
How is that possible?

276
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,240
I was in the Snowblade City.

277
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,240
It's just a fantasy.

278
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:45,240
Don't be surprised.

279
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,240
Teacher.

280
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,240
Teacher, you were in the dark prison.

281
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,240
I was in the Snowblade City.

282
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:03,240
How did you get me into the fantasy

283
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,240
by moving away from the Snowblade City?

284
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,240
You are always in a mess.

285
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,240
I just wanted to help you.

286
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,240
So I planted a spell on your heart.

287
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:19,240
There is a beautiful spell.

288
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,240
It's called Spirit Seed.

289
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,240
It's easy to connect with your heart.

290
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:28,240
It's not difficult to bring you into the fantasy.

291
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,240
So you moved your hands and feet on me

292
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:34,240
when I didn't know.

293
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,240
Teacher.

294
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,240
Can you trust me a little bit?

295
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:50,240
I think you are the reason for my trust.

296
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,240
I believe you.

297
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:57,240
I remember the plan you made that day.

298
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,240
It's useless to imprison a person who is not afraid of death.

299
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,240
Teacher.

300
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,240
Why don't you try my method?

301
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:11,240
Save him, follow him, kiss him,

302
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,240
and help him put down his guard.

303
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,240
Take the chance to take the Soul Bead

304
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,240
and destroy the fairy alliance.

305
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:22,240
Take half of the plan.

306
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:27,240
What have you done now?

307
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,240
Save him, follow him, kiss him,

308
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,240
and help him put down his guard.

309
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:37,240
Haven't you done it?

310
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,240
You are so good at talking.

311
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,240
Don't use it on me.

312
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,240
You spend too much time on Xie Xuechen.

313
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
It makes me doubt

314
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,240
if you don't want me.

315
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
How could it be?

316
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:12,240
You saved me with the fairy alliance.

317
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,240
You passed on the magic power to me.

318
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,240
You gave me power.

319
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,240
You allowed me to do the dark jade.

320
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,240
How could I not want you?

321
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:29,240
Okay.

322
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,240
Prove it to me.

323
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,240
How do you want me to prove it?

324
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Take the Soul Bead back

325
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,240
and kill Xie Xuechen.

326
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,240
I feel sad

327
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,240
when I see your expression.

328
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Maybe I should remind you

329
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
that you are very domineering.

330
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
You must use the magic power

331
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,240
to strengthen yourself every month.

332
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
You can't stop on the way.

333
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
Otherwise, you will be punished by the magic power.

334
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,240
You are so clever.

335
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
You can't stand it.

336
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,240
You will die in the end.

337
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
No wonder you agreed

338
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,240
to my plan so easily.

339
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,240
You are the one who will be the last.

340
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:28,240
The bottom line is my life.

341
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
What?

342
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,240
You don't want your own life

343
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,240
for Xie Xuechen's life?

344
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
How could it be?

345
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,240
The spirit clan has been living for thousands of years.

346
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,240
There are many men in the world.

347
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:49,240
How could I die for a mere Xie Xuechen?

348
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,240
But I just want to play with him.

349
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,240
Don't worry, master.

350
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,240
I will complete the task

351
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,240
and take the Soul Bead back

352
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,240
and kill Xie Xuechen.

353
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Okay.

354
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:03,240
I will wait and see.

355
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,240
But I can't do it alone.

356
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,240
Master, are Chiying and the people of Xiu Xian Pavilion

357
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,240
all in Yongxue City?

358
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,240
Where are they?

359
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Let them help me.

360
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,240
Do you want them to help you

361
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:22,240
or to kill them?

362
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,240
If you don't believe me,

363
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,240
you can take my life.

364
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:30,240
Don't be angry.

365
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
We have been master and disciple for ten years.

366
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,240
As long as you complete the task,

367
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,240
nothing will change.

368
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Remember,

369
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,240
we are in the dark.

370
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:46,240
Don't think about the light.

371
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:52,240
I understood this

372
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
twenty years ago

373
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,240
at the cost of my life.

374
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
Ling'er,

375
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,240
I hope you can understand.

376
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
Go ahead.

377
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
I will wait for you

378
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
when you complete the task.

379
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
I will wait for you.

380
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
It's fake to play the role of a playboy.

381
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
Then play ten points.

382
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
It's a good day.

383
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Take it.

384
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,240
You are also fooled by the score.

385
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
Master,

386
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
I have to thank you for catching him back.

387
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
Then I can know

388
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
he is still alive.

389
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,240
It's been ten years.

390
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Hello,

391
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
big brother.

392
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,240
This is Young Master of Snow City,

393
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
Xie Xuechen.

394
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Young Master's appearance

395
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,240
is so beautiful

396
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,240
that it's unforgettable.

397
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,240
Have we met before?

398
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,240
Unfortunately,

399
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,240
it's not a good start.

400
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
But it's okay.

401
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,240
This time,

402
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,240
I will protect you.

403
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Everything

404
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,240
is my wishful thinking.

405
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,240
You turn your finger

406
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,240
to find your face.

407
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
If no one

408
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,240
finds the tears in my heart,

409
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,240
can I still be unconscious

410
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,240
and have some thoughts?

411
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,240
I don't need to ask

412
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,240
how far the journey is.

413
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,240
I will fight for love

414
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,240
and fight for love.

415
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,240
I will not give up

416
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,240
and fight for love.

417
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
I will not give up

418
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:46,240
and fight for love.

419
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
Mu Xingling,

420
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,240
I brought you...

421
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
What?

422
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
He left?

423
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Did I come back too late?

424
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,240
Is he in there?

425
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
Mu Xingling,

426
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I'm here to apologize to you.

427
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,240
Mu Xingling,

428
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,240
I'm here to apologize to you.

429
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,240
No.

430
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
You will be beaten if you are so arrogant.

431
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,240
I misunderstood you

432
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,240
about the case today.

433
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,240
I'm sorry for hurting you.

434
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
No.

435
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Mu Xingling is so arrogant.

436
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,240
If he sees me being so soft,

437
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
he will laugh at me.

438
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
Mu Xingling,

439
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
I let you catch the target today.

440
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,240
But,

441
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
I let you catch the target.

442
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
But don't forget,

443
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,240
you have the target in my hand.

444
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,240
If you don't tell me about it today,

445
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,240
I won't tell you either.

446
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,240
What do you think?

447
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,240
What do you think?

448
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,240
Why are you so late?

449
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
I've been waiting for you here for a long time.

450
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Why don't you ask me

451
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,240
why I've been waiting for you for so long?

452
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,240
I'm in a bad mood now.

453
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,240
I want to find someone to vent my anger.

454
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
If you don't leave,

455
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,240
I'll kill you.

456
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Why are you like this, Mu Xingling?

457
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm here to apologize to you.

458
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
I misunderstood you

459
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,240
about the case today.

460
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,240
This is my favorite hairpin.

461
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,240
It can change into a beautiful dream.

462
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
It's for you.

463
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,240
And this.

464
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,240
I got your sword back.

465
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Just turn the page about today.

466
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,240
Don't tell anyone about it.

467
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,240
You're afraid that I'll say something

468
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:05,240
that I'm afraid of you.

469
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
What apology?

470
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,240
It's for yourself.

471
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,240
Mu Xingling, I tell you.

472
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
I have a target in my hand.

473
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Believe it or not,

474
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:21,240
I'll tell you about the Lin family's

475
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,240
You're crazy. You don't want to die.

476
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
It's good to end it earlier.

477
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
Are you done?

478
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,240
Let's go.

479
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,240
Don't stay here and talk.

480
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,240
Mu Xingling, I'm just worried about you.

481
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Sister,

482
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
that bad woman

483
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,240
waited for an hour at the door.

484
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,240
She kept talking about friendship.

485
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,240
How can she apologize to you in practice?

486
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,240
She's really angry.

487
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,240
Sister, what's wrong with you?

488
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,240
I'm sorry.

489
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
I'm sorry.

490
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
What's wrong?

491
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,240
A'bao,

492
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,240
if I die one day,

493
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:13,240
can you go to Bixiao Palace with Fulansheng?

494
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
How can I die?

495
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:17,240
Are you hurt by that case today?

496
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I'll find you a medicine now.

497
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,240
No, I'm kidding.

498
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I'm thinking about Bixiao Palace's surname Fu.

499
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Maybe your father is there.

500
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Father wants to find me, but I can't die.

501
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,240
I can't die.

502
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:34,240
A'bao,

503
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
Lin family has a long life.

504
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,240
But when you die,

505
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,240
you have to learn to separate.

506
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,240
That's a long time to go.

507
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,240
I don't want to talk about this now.

508
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,240
I can't do it.

509
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
Okay.

510
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,240
It's been a day.

511
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
I'm tired.

512
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
Go to sleep.

513
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
I can't talk about death.

514
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,240
I'm tired.

515
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
Go to sleep.

516
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
Okay.

517
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
Mu Xuanling is so kind.

518
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
She is being treated as a donkey.

519
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
She is so hot-tempered.

520
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,240
What's wrong, Gao?

521
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:07,240
Did anyone make you unhappy?

522
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:08,240
Of course not.

523
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,240
I'm the young princess of Jinghua Palace.

524
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,240
Don't be so mean.

525
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,240
Yes, you're right.

526
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,240
It's late now.

527
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,240
You should go to bed.

528
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,240
She is so angry all day.

529
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,240
She really treats herself as a princess.

530
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
Right.

531
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,240
After all,

532
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,240
she is just an orphan

533
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,240
who has no parents

534
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,240
and is destroyed.

535
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,240
If it weren't for the favor of the master,

536
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
who would look after her?

537
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,240
Let's go.

538
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:57,240
You're a disciple of Yongxue City.

539
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,240
You can dance like this.

540
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Teach me then.

541
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,240
Okay.

542
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Xuanling Tree is blooming.

543
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,240
Xuanling Tree can bloom in the mortal world.

544
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:32,240
Mu Xuanling,

545
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,240
you can do it too.

546
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Thank you, Chen.

547
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I'm afraid I can't see it.

548
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,240
It's okay.

549
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I'll wait for you.

550
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,240
Okay.

551
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,240
Bye.

552
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,240
Xuanling Tree.

553
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
You can do it.

554
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Xuanling Tree.

555
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,240
Xuanling Tree.

556
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,240
Xuanling Tree.

557
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
Xuanling Tree.

558
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,240
Xuanling Tree.

559
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Xuanling Tree.

560
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,240
Xuanling Tree.

561
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
Xuanling Tree.

562
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Which one is more important,

563
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,240
the Soul Bead or me?

564
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
Of course it's you.

565
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,240
What if one day

566
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,240
I grab the Soul Bead

567
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
and help Sang Qi

568
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
release the Dark Clan into the mortal world?

569
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,240
Will you kill me?

570
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
No.

571
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,240
My sword friend is not like you.

572
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,240
What if the Alliance wants to kill me?

573
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
I won't let them kill you.

574
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,240
You want to be enemies with the Alliance?

575
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,240
Then be enemies with the Alliance.

576
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,240
Qi Xuechen,

577
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,240
do you like me?

578
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Yes.

579
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
I like you very much.

580
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,240
The real Xue Chen

581
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,240
won't say such words.

582
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
One happiness, one loss.

583
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
The sky

584
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,240
is always

585
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,240
a dark dream.

586
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Master.

587
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,240
It's late.

588
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,240
I don't know why you came.

589
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,240
I'm here.

590
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,240
I just talked to you about Tao.

591
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
I know you will be

592
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
in the righteous hall tomorrow

593
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,240
to watch the Taoist heart.

594
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,240
Yes.

595
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Using the Taoist door

596
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
will damage a lot of spiritual power.

597
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
This is the hairpin I developed.

598
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,240
It can help you to watch the heart.

599
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Take it.

600
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
But if I do this,

601
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,240
it will damage your spiritual power.

602
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:48,240
You are my

603
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,240
most important disciple.

604
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:51,240
I will protect you.

605
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Who else can I protect?

606
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,240
Now the Dark Clan is in the Snow City.

607
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,240
You should take care of yourself.

608
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Don't let the Dark Clan

609
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
have a chance to win.

610
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,240
Thank you, Master.

611
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
Thief.

612
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,240
Piglet.

613
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,240
I'm sure

614
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
you know

615
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,240
last night there was an attack

616
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
I don't want to keep delaying it

617
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,160
I invite you all here today

618
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,520
to hope that you can

619
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,480
recommend the new leader in advance

620
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,560
I wonder if you have

621
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,560
a choice

622
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,760
My idea hasn't changed yet

623
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:01,960
I think

624
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,720
the Palace of Pure Flower is the best

625
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,080
to be the leader

626
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,960
Send the Soul Bead to the Palace of Pure Flower

627
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,360
It's better to save some things

628
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,440
and send it directly to the dark jade

629
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,000
Is it possible that Lord Bi Xiao

630
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,520
also has a good intention to be the leader?

631
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,920
What else does Lord Bi Xiao have

632
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,680
besides the treasure?

633
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,960
Is it possible that

634
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,120
he wants to spend money to buy through the funeral?

635
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,760
I wonder who you want to choose?

636
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,120
I think

637
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,200
the one who has the highest honor in the legal world

638
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,200
is the best choice

639
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,160
I and my пож popping

640
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,000
Thanks for the recommendation

641
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,600
But I am not removed from the multi-channel

642
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,480
Please make Akamatsu offer

643
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,200
Don't have any idea

644
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:09,840
No one in the Alliance

645
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,080
is suitable as you

646
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,360
please accept the title of Chief of the Alliance

647
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,480
If it is a high-ranking Chief of the Alliance

648
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,200
I will be very happy

649
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,720
Please accept the title of Chief

650
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,160
It's not easy to be a member of the Palace

651
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:44,440
Besides, I can never return to the book

652
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,200
Now that everyone likes it

653
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:53,920
I won't refuse

654
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:00,680
The Chief of the Alliance

655
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,560
If no one can find the tears in my heart

656
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,960
Can I still not know how to avoid it

657
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,560
I have thoughts in my heart

658
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:59,960
I know love is still a dream, but it has become a long distance

659
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:06,560
For love, I go through the snow and the wind, I will not fail to meet you

660
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:13,160
Looking back at the days of the peach blossoms and the days I spent with you

661
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:19,560
Looking at the person I love, a dream is no longer attached to me

662
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:26,560
I have no regrets in this life, I will stay by your side

663
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,560
I have thoughts in my heart

664
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:44,560
I know love is still a dream, but it has become a long distance

665
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:51,560
For love, I go through the snow and the wind, I will not fail to meet you

666
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,560
Looking back at the days of the peach blossoms and the days I spent with you

667
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:03,560
Looking at the person I love, a dream is no longer attached to me

668
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:08,560
I have no regrets in this life, I will stay by your side

669
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,560
