5
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
A'bao

6
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Come here, good boy

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
How do you know my name is A'bao

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
How do I know

9
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Your brother Lan Sheng often reminds you in front of me

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You are a strange girl

11
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
So I know

12
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Lan Sheng often reminds you

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
He said he has the best father in the world

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If only my father was here

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Oh, right

16
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Lan Sheng borrowed my blood sword

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Said to go with you to find your father

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
This trip can be a success

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Can be a success

20
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Dad saved me in secret

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
But won't come out to see me

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Is it because Dad doesn't like A'bao

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
So I don't want to go home

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I don't want to see A'bao

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
No, no

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Good boy

27
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There is no father in this world

28
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Don't like your own child

29
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Maybe

30
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Your father has more important things to do

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
When he is done

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Will definitely come back to see A'bao

33
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Mom also said so

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
She said Dad is the best person in the world

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
And said we will be reunited

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Correct

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There will be a reunion that day

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The bustle of Bixiao Palace is really good

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But I think you need some quiet

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
This is my secret space

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
This tree is the relief tree that helped me grow up since childhood

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Relief tree

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
There are so many red strips on it

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You have so many worries

45
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Not worry, happiness

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Happy

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Then why is it called a relief tree?

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Before

49
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Every time I meet something particularly happy

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I will throw a red strip on the tree

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
This can keep the happiness at present

52
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then I met something that didn't go well

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I came to walk under this tree

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Look at the happiness of this full tree

55
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I will feel that the worries in front of me seem to be nothing

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Actually think about it

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
People live for a while

58
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Is it pain for pleasure or pleasure for pain

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:10,000
It depends on what you remember

60
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Yes

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
What can be left in life

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Depends on what you remember

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes yes

64
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I haven't had anything particularly happy lately

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Wait for the next time

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Next time I have a suitable opportunity

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll come with you

68
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can hang up if you have something unhappy

69
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
From today

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The ending is not a big deal

71
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
You can hang up

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
From today

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The rules of the relief tree have been changed

74
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
He can not only hang up my happiness

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Can also blame your sorrow

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Hope my happiness can be a source of your sorrow

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You can share with me whatever worries you have

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Whether it is joy or sorrow

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Two people together

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's better than one person

81
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Hang up

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Fulansheng

83
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you for sharing your happiness with me

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I said don't always say thank you

85
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Come on, continue

86
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
The higher the burden, the more annoying

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Give you one, let's throw it together

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
One two three

89
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Hang up

90
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
By the way

91
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You can tell him whatever worries or wishes you have

92
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sing it after you finish

93
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
This is the secret between you and uncle

94
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I won't listen

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
You can rest assured

96
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I hope

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I hope

98
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I can live for myself in the future

99
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Live for myself

100
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I hope those who are not by my side

101
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And those who are still by my side

102
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Can see a brand new Gao Qiangmi

103
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
A Gao Qiangmi that makes them proud

104
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And makes me proud

105
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I still hope one day

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Can be a sword for each person

107
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
In the heaven of the human race

108
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
To fulfill the unfulfilled wish

109
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Fulansheng

110
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's so nice to have you

111
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Sang Qi has been in the East Sea for a while

112
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
But the human race and the spirit race

113
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Are very hostile to him

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He is bullied by the world

115
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
And has nowhere to settle

116
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Finally he fell into the dark jade

117
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
And took a rest in the devil's palace

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He gradually gained the trust of the original demon lord

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
And finally he was killed

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Qu'er Dai Zhi

121
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Became the new master of the dark jade

122
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
I heard that the devil's palace

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Is the most powerful place in the world

124
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I heard that the devil's palace

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Is the most powerful place in the world

126
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
In a place like the dark jade

127
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Without power, you can't even live

128
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
How can someone like you understand?

129
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
If I could have met you earlier

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Maybe everything would be different

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I am the saintess of the dark jade

132
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
To save you from the abyss

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
If I am just a little spirit

134
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
You wouldn't know who I am

135
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Don't be too far from me

136
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I have said

137
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Please don't fool me

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
It's dangerous here

139
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't leave with me

140
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Life and death are up to fate

141
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Xie Xue Chen

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Come here

143
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The one beside you is fake

144
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
What are you?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I should be the one asking you

146
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You are so beautiful

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How dare you draw me

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
And lie to Xie Xue Chen

149
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are so good at fighting

150
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You are like me

151
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But who is the real one?

152
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You are the real one

153
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
You are the real one

154
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
You are the real one

155
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You will know who is the real one

156
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
After a fight

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Yes

158
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You will know who is the real one

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
After a fight

160
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You are a devil

161
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
How could it be?

162
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Duan Nian was trained by Sang Qi

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
There can't be another one

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Xie Xue Chen

165
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Are you fascinated by him?

166
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I am the real one

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
It's exactly the same

168
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You don't believe me?

169
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You are willing to play

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I won't let you go

171
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I told you I am the real one

172
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This is the fruit of the golden plum in the forest

173
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The smell of it

174
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Is also a sign of a dream

175
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
So in your fantasy

176
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I am always a person who loves you

177
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Although we are the same

178
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
But I know

179
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
The one who is cruel to me

180
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Is the real you

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
What do you mean?

182
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
This thing is called a thread

183
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
The two people who are involved

184
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Can't be more than three

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I know what is a thread

186
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
What do you mean?

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I am worried that you will be distracted by me

188
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
And I want to prevent

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
You to be distracted by me

190
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
A monster can be killed but not humiliated

191
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Are you calling me a dog?

192
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Of course not

193
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Dogs

194
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Are usually tied around the neck

195
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You

196
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Let's go

197
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Xuan Ling

198
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Xuan Ling

199
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Xuan Ling

200
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
You are awake

201
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I

202
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The gas in the forest is poisonous

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I gave you the antidote

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
But during the process of detoxification

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
It will temporarily lose its name

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Lose its name?

207
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Are you saving me or taking revenge on me?

208
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Mo Xuan Ling

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
I am sorry

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I did something before

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
To make you sad

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I feel guilty

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I am also trying to make up for it

214
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But I don't know where to start

215
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
In the past, I always feel

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I bear the responsibility of Yongxue City

217
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
There are many things I have to do

218
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But after this reunion

219
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I gradually understand

220
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
I am not only the city leader of Yongxue City

221
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I am also myself

222
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
You are a fake Xie Xuechen

223
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
I am real

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
This jade plaque

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Nan Xu Yue gave you

226
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
You

227
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
She gave you such a precious artifact

228
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Did she say anything to you?

229
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
What's your business?

230
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you doing?

231
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Nothing

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
It smells good

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Is there a lot of peach blossoms here?

234
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Yes

235
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
But not the fragrance of the flowers and trees

236
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
But the poison of the gas

237
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Poisoned

238
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
There will be many peach blossom jade plaque on the body

239
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
During the detoxification process

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
There will be a strong peach blossom fragrance on the body

241
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
When the peach blossom jade plaque is gone

242
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
The poison is completely resolved

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Did the jade plaque grow a lot?

244
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Is it on the face?

245
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Is it ugly?

246
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
No

247
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
On the face

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
It seems not

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
There are some on the neck

250
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And this

251
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Where else

252
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
You don't have to worry too much

253
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Not ugly at all

254
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Just

255
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Just what?

256
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Just

257
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
This fragrance is relaxing

258
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
The jade plaque

259
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Easily lose consciousness

260
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
For the sake of the gods

261
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'll go to the cave to guard it

262
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
It's funny

263
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
When I was in the dark prison

264
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Always wearing an egg

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Sometimes even nothing

266
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I can't sleep all night

267
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
It's normal

268
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But last night

269
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You were by my side

270
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I fell asleep very quickly

271
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I dreamed of the sky

272
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
It seems that the image of Mr. Xie

273
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
The image of a man

274
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Is indeed deep in people's hearts

275
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Xie Xuechen

276
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Do you feel

277
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
The taste of this peach blossom

278
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It seems to be getting stronger

279
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Make people a little

280
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Can't breathe

281
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You

282
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Your heart is very hard

283
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Cui Shan is really soft

284
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You

285
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
You are really taking revenge

286
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
If I say no

287
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Do you believe

288
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I believe

289
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You better let me go

290
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
The previous thing was my fault

291
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I shouldn't have hit you

292
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you, City Leader

293
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
As a righteous person

294
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Valuable and noble

295
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Shouldn't use this way

296
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Revenge me

297
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
How wronged you are

298
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
First

299
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You didn't do anything wrong

300
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I did wrong

301
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Second

302
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm not a person who is noble

303
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
It's just a trick

304
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Just an ordinary man who loves love

305
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Third

306
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I'm not taking revenge

307
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Fourth

308
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm not wronged

309
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,000
Fifth

310
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I will not let go

311
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Mo Xueling

312
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Who am I

313
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Sorry

314
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I shouldn't have taken the position

315
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Apologize now

316
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
You know you're wrong

317
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Yes

318
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
I should be when you can see

319
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Please

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
You

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
I'll go to the cave to keep it

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You have a good rest

323
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Mo Xueling

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
What's wrong with you

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
There's no power at all

326
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Good heart

327
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Young Master seems to be a little restless tonight

328
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I gave him a jade pendant

329
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
It has my defense formation on it

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
But I just felt that

331
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
This formation was touched

332
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Dangerous

333
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Just touched

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,000
Formation has not been destroyed

335
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
It doesn't seem to be a big deal

336
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Young Master, rest early

337
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'll set out tomorrow morning

338
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Did I say where to go

339
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,000
You have a obsession

340
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,000
If you can't let go

341
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You will go eventually

342
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
The Qiongju Island is a place of the spirit tribe

343
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,000
It's not safe

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'll go with you

345
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
There is one thing

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
You didn't mention

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I never asked

348
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
But I'm a little curious tonight

349
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What is it

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Eleven years ago

351
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You came to Yunxiu Villa with all your body

352
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
With ten years of filial piety

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
To exchange for Yunxiu Lingyao to save your brother

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Now the ten-year contract has been completed

355
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
With your ability

356
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,000
High and low

357
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Why don't you go

358
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
how

359
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What

360
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Young Master wants to drive me away

361
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Feng Yao

362
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I'm not a good person

363
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
I know

364
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The day the spirit tribe wanted to transport the embroidery

365
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I am also

366
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
In line with the dealings of the first master

367
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I have always

368
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Speaking of

369
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
I'm not a good person

370
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
If you are a bad person

371
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Why not

372
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Maybe because

373
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
I have nowhere to go

374
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
And there is nothing to do

375
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Since you want to stay

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
Then continue to travel

377
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Along the way

378
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Let's see

379
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
This end is clear and peaceful

380
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The master still doesn't want to see the guest

381
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Please go back

382
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Since it is like this

383
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Then goodbye

384
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
You

385
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Hey

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
A Su Ningxi who died for twenty years

387
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Can make the Honorable God die

388
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
This heroic and short play

389
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Not just looking at it

390
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
He is dying

391
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Now I'm holding my breath

392
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Just want to see Su Ningxi more

393
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Chiying

394
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
What do you mean

395
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
Nothing

396
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
But the master of dark jade is a common thing

397
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
The former king of dark jade is not Sang Qi, right?

398
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Master

399
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,000
How is it

400
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Sang Qi still dare not see me

401
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
To be precise

402
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Sang Qi took Su Ningxi from the Jin Hua Palace

403
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
After he went back

404
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
He never saw anyone again

405
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Sang Qi is not reliable

406
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
That day

407
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Su Ning was setting a barrier in Xingcheng Valley

408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,000
I failed to sneak in

409
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
So I don't know what happened inside

410
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,000
What happened

411
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
According to Sang Qi's current situation

412
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
They must have talked about something very important that day

413
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
It is likely

414
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,000
It's a clue to the chaos

415
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It seems that the master has to go to the dark jade in person

416
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
One more thing

417
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
Xie Shui Chen and Mu Xuanling arrived in Qiongju Island

418
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Entered Qifeng Forest

419
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Do you want to go to Fushang

420
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Qifeng Forest

421
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:17,960
Jing Mei was

422
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Send someone to set up a trap outside Qifeng Forest

423
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
If they come out by chance

424
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
Take advantage of their weakness

425
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Immediately kill

426
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,000
Can't stop

427
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Your heart is still hard

428
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I want to know

429
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,000
What happened

430
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I want to know

431
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
What happened

432
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
What happened

433
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
I don't know

434
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Yes

435
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
What happened

436
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
I don't know

437
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
What happened

438
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I don't know

439
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
What happened

440
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,000
The mountain is hard, but the water is soft.

441
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
There are many petals here.

442
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,200
I planted the medicine petals.

443
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Why didn't you wake up?

444
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Didn't you have the energy to get up?

445
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,200
I'm fine.

446
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,200
I'm fine.

447
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,200
I'm fine.

448
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,200
I'm fine.

449
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I'm fine.

450
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I'm fine.

451
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,200
I'm fine.

452
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
I'm fine.

453
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
I can do it myself.

454
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Can you see?

455
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,200
What are you doing?

456
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200
If you can't see,

457
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,200
I can carry you.

458
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
If you can see...

459
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
Then...

460
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Then what?

461
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,200
Then what?

462
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,200
Of course I have to go.

463
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,200
What do you think?

464
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,200
I'll go by myself.

465
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,200
I'll go by myself.

466
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
I'll go by myself.

467
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,200
I'll go by myself.

468
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,200
I can hear you talking about the distance

469
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
between the three tents.

470
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,200
It seems that all the spiritual energy

471
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,200
is moving in one direction.

472
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I heard that the growth of the Longevity Lotus

473
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
needs to swallow the spiritual energy of the earth and the sky.

474
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,200
There is another possibility.

475
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
There are people with very deep cultivation there.

476
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,200
Swallowing the spiritual energy

477
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,200
will also cause this kind of fluctuation.

478
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,200
There are enough magical weapons and magical medicine here.

479
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,200
It's enough to get you out of the dense forest.

480
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Wait.

481
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
You're not going to go?

482
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,200
Are you really going to choose the Longevity Lotus

483
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,200
and ask for something that's not old?

484
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,200
It's more important than the Longevity Lotus.

485
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
I've extended the distance of the One-Line Green.

486
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,200
If it's dangerous,

487
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
you can leave quickly.

488
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Don't worry about me.

489
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,200
I heard that Snowblade City is very poor.

490
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
It's really a rumor.

491
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,200
The family is so rich.

492
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Then...

493
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,200
Or...

494
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,200
I'll take advantage of this moment

495
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,200
to run away with his ring.

496
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,200
This is the place of no water.

497
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
The water in this pond

498
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
is not real water.

499
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,200
It's the spiritual energy of the spiritual energy.

500
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,200
No wonder it's so waterless.

501
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,200
You're not the one who created this.

502
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,200
How can you be so waterless?

503
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I'm not.

504
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
You're not.

505
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,200
I'm not.

506
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
You're not.

507
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,200
You're not.

508
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
You're not.

509
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
You're not.

510
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
You're not.

511
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
You're not.

512
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
You're not.

513
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
You're not.

514
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
You're not.

515
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
You're not.

516
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
You're not.

517
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
You're not.

518
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
You're not.

519
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
You're not.

520
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
You're not.

521
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
You're not.

522
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,200
You're not.

523
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,200
You're not.

524
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,200
You're not.

525
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
Is this the Longevity Ridge?

526
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
There is such a thing, really in this world?

527
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,200
I'm Xie Xuechen.

528
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,800
I'm not looking for the secret

529
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,920
for the Longevity Lotus.

530
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,400
I'm looking for the Lotus Heart.

531
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,440
Xie Xuechen?

532
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,920
I've never heard of you.

533
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,800
You're just a nobody.

534
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,920
How dare you come to Luo Wushan to die?

535
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,120
I've been waiting for this flower to bloom.

536
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,800
The most precious thing about the Longevity Lotus

537
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,320
is the petals and the root essence.

538
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,920
I have no intention of taking it.

539
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,720
I only want the Lotus Heart.

540
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,320
Everyone knows

541
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,920
that the Longevity Lotus is the most precious thing in the world.

542
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,120
The Lotus Heart is the most precious thing

543
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,920
in the world.

544
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,240
What do you want?

545
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,440
I have a friend

546
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,680
who took the poison of the Longevity Lotus.

547
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,040
He's in danger now.

548
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:14,120
He's asking for the Lotus Heart to detoxify.

549
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,040
Liar.

550
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,560
I don't believe that someone would find it

551
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,920
for the sake of the Longevity Lotus.

552
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,840
Fire Phoenix.

553
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,380
It seems that you are not skilled enough.

554
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,680
You won't be able to defeat me easily.

555
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,360
This sincereode...

556
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:02,840
Why are you here?

557
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,360
Give it back.

558
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,080
If you die,

559
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,480
I'll take these things

560
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,000
and it'll be a waste.

561
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,440
If I knew it was so strong,

562
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:22,920
I wouldn't have come.

563
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
My Lord,

564
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,320
we have no objection.

565
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:36,600
Why are you so aggressive?

566
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,280
The Jun Tian Sword.

567
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,440
The Jun Tian Sword is a weapon

568
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:46,680
that can kill people in ancient times.

569
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,760
It can kill people in ancient times.

570
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,280
Who are you

571
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,080
to have the Jun Tian Sword?

572
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,880
He is the leader of the Alliance.

573
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,800
He is born with a sharp sense of taste and a high level of magic.

574
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,760
What's so strange about having the Jun Tian Sword?

575
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,080
If you're afraid,

576
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,520
just leave.

577
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,720
Nonsense.

578
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,520
Qian Guang Jun is the leader of the Alliance.

579
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,160
Qian Guang Jun?

580
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,920
Isn't he your first leader?

581
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,680
What first leader?

582
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,120
I've only been gone for a year.

583
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,920
The leader of the Alliance has changed?

584
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,920
My Lord,

585
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,840
Qian Guang Jun was the leader of the Alliance

586
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,840
6,000 years ago.

587
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,040
6,000 years?

588
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,640
I've only been in Mount Luo Wu for less than three days.

589
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,720
How come it's been 6,000 years?

590
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,000
What does he mean?

591
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,480
Is he from 6,000 years ago?

592
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,680
But the Human Clan can't live for 6,000 years.

593
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
Who sent you here?

594
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,440
Why did you lie to me?

595
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,320
6,000 years ago,

596
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,960
the Fire Phoenix was born.

597
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,960
I seem to know who he is.

598
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,280
I think the respected one

599
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,920
is the founder of the neighboring island,

600
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,560
Feng Xiang.

601
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,240
The founder of the neighboring island?

602
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,160
That's also from 6,000 years ago.

603
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Could it be that

604
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,640
something is strange here?

605
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Did we come back 6,000 years ago

606
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
or did he come back 6,000 years later?

607
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:10,920
6,000 years?

608
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,160
6,000 years?

609
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,240
6,000 years?

610
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,840
Then where is Qian Guang Jun now?

611
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,240
It's said that

612
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,040
after you returned to the Mountain Ridge,

613
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:28,720
Qian Guang Jun left the position of leader and left with you.

614
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,240
Now he's nowhere to be found.

615
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,040
Impossible.

616
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,360
Impossible.

617
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:40,040
Impossible.

618
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,520
This is impossible.

619
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,320
Impossible.

620
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,960
Impossible.

621
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
Liar.

622
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Liar.

623
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,400
You're liars!

624
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,120
How come?

625
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
It seems to be going crazy.

626
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,640
It's a trick to break the spell. Let's go.

627
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,640
Xuan Ling, are you okay?

628
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
Come.

629
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:35,240
It was an explosion that wouldn't have caused the statue to explode.

630
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,840
Feng Xiang may have fainted.

631
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,840
His statue is a fire phoenix.

632
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,040
No wonder it's called Seven Phoenix Feather.

633
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,040
But the human race is not long-lived.

634
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,840
He's from 6,000 years ago.

635
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
He's a human.

636
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
He's a human.

637
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,240
He's a human.

638
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,240
He's a human.

639
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,240
He's a human.

640
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,240
He's a human.

641
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,240
He's a human.

642
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,240
He's a human.

643
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
He's a human.

644
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,240
He's a human.

645
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
How did he get to this place?

646
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
He's a human.

647
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,440
He's a human.

648
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,440
How could he be alive?

649
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,440
It is possible that the time here is different from the outside?

650
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,840
Six thousand years is only six days away.

651
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:17,640
We must...

652
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,640
Not necessarily.

653
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,840
Even though it's strange,

654
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,040
When I went to see it just now, the Longevity Lotus wasn't fully mature.

655
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,640
If we want to obtain the lotus seed, I'm afraid we need to wait for a few more days.

656
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,040
I hope that the explosion just now didn't hurt the Longevity Lotus.

657
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,840
So what you want is the lotus seed.

658
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,640
Why must you get it?

659
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,440
Do you know that we almost died there just now?

660
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,640
I must get the lotus seed.

661
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,240
This is a matter of life and death to me.

662
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:50,040
Look at how nervous you are.

663
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:54,640
If you wait here for ten years or eight years, I won't be able to accompany you.

664
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm just afraid that I won't be able to wait.

665
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:11,440
This lotus seed...

666
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,640
was it you who wanted it?

667
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,640
Or was it for someone else?

668
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
For someone else.

669
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
How important is that person?

670
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,040
It's worth your life to fight for.

671
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,640
You still can't wait?

672
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,040
You're afraid that you're going to die, right?

673
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,040
What's the use of just keeping your distance?

674
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,040
Untie it while it's still early.

675
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,640
Don't think of dragging me to die with you!

676
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,040
Then why did you go to see me just now?

677
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,240
I don't believe that you did it to return my things.

678
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,240
I... I... I...

679
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,440
You just stay here.

680
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:59,240
After the dark fog disappears, I'll go in and take a look.

681
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:09,040
After the dark fog disappears, it's getting dark.

682
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,240
And you just said that the Longevity Lotus hasn't grown yet.

683
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,840
You can't get the lotus seed even if you go.

684
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
You can't get the lotus seed even if you go.

685
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Why are you in such a hurry?

686
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
I'm listening to you.

687
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
I'll go and take a look tomorrow morning.

688
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,240
Wait!

689
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,440
I've seen the formation.

690
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,640
Are you all going to the Seven Phoenix Forest?

691
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,040
I like to do things in full.

692
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,440
You all are not lucky enough to have stepped into the formation I set up on the Island of Qiongju.

693
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,440
What's even more unfortunate is that

694
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:11,840
the four directions of the formation are困,守,殺,棋.

695
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,440
I've come to the court with a lot of effort today.

696
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,640
I won't let you kill me.

697
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,840
Protect the formation!

698
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,440
Let's go!

699
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,640
Don't be anxious.

700
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,840
I still have something to tell you two.

701
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:41,640
Tell your Master that I'm the one who wants to protect the Longevity Lotus.

702
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,840
If he dares to move,

703
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,840
I don't mind destroying the Longevity Lotus first.

704
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,840
There are too many traps in the forest.

705
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,440
It might be hard to find them.

706
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,840
It's fine.

707
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,440
Let's clean this place first.

708
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,040
Yes.

709
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,040
There is indeed a weird thing in the forest.

710
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,240
There are no stars or moon in the forest.

711
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,840
It's hard to find the direction.

712
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,640
Let's find a place to rest first.

713
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,240
Okay.

714
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,840
Young Master, this fog is too big.

715
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,240
It's easy to get scattered.

716
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
How about we...

717
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,840
Young Master!

718
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,040
Young Master.

719
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,240
Young Master.

720
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:01,640
I've been walking around with Xie Xuechen for a long time.

721
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,640
I'm glad to meet you.

722
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,640
Why did you come?

723
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,840
Is it for me?

724
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,640
It's hard to find the way.

725
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,840
I'll take you to a place to rest.

726
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,640
Is that okay?

727
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,640
No one can replace her.

728
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:42,640
There is nothing that can fake her.

729
00:40:57,240 --> 00:40:59,040
Sister.

730
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,640
Xiao Yuan!

731
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,640
Sister, this place is so scary.

732
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,440
I've been looking for a way out.

733
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:13,240
But I can't find it.

734
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,840
Why don't you speak?

735
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,040
Don't you want Xiao Yuan anymore?

736
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,840
Just like before?

737
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,240
No.

738
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,040
I never thought of abandoning you.

739
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,440
Never.

740
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,040
But when Xie Xiu came,

741
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,440
why wasn't you there?

742
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,240
I'm sorry.

743
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,040
I didn't protect you well.

744
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,440
I don't blame you.

745
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,440
But I'm so scared.

746
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,240
It's so cold here.

747
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Can you stay and stay with me?

748
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,640
You said you would stay with Xiao Yuan forever.

749
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,240
Did you forget?

750
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,840
Stay and stay with me, okay?

751
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,440
No. You can't stay here.

752
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,040
I'll take you away.

753
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,240
You want to abandon me!

754
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,640
You don't want me anymore. I don't want you!

755
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,840
Xiao Yuan!

756
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,440
Xiao Yuan!

757
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,040
He's not your brother.

758
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,840
You know it well.

759
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,840
He died 11 years ago.

760
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,840
I didn't protect him well.

761
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:34,040
Xie Xiu killed him, not you.

762
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:35,840
Get up.

763
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,240
Stand up.

764
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:54,040
I thought I should protect you.

765
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,040
They say the Seven-Winds Forest is dangerous.

766
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,040
This danger is not worth being strong or weak.

767
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:05,640
It's a heart attack.

768
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,240
Did you meet anyone you want to see?

769
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,240
I saw him.

770
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,040
And then?

771
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:18,040
Killed him.

772
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:20,440
It seems you know it well.

773
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:24,840
You'd rather destroy it than have a fake one.

774
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,640
Let's rest for a night.

775
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,240
I'll leave after the fog is gone.

776
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,640
I'm still not sure

777
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:24,440
what I want to do

778
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:27,240
I'm still not sure

779
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,840
how far I can go

780
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:33,240
I'll go through six years of love

781
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:37,440
I'll go through six years of love

782
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,840
I'll look back at the days when we spent together

783
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,840
I looked at the dream I had

784
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,840
I don't want to be with you anymore

785
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,440
I don't want to be with you anymore

786
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:23,240
I'll go through six years of love

787
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:25,640
I'll go through six years of love

788
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:31,840
I'll look back at the days when we spent together

789
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:36,040
I looked at the dream I had

790
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:38,440
I don't want to be with you anymore

791
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:45,440
I don't want to be with you anymore

792
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,840
I'll go through six years of love

793
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:57,840
I'll look back at the days when we spent together

794
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:02,840
I'll look back at the days when we spent together
