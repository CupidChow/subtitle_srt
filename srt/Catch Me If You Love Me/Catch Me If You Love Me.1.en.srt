00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
[Catch Me If You Love Me]

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,410
Ah.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,670
Damn it.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,400
You damn cop.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,600
If today

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:17,600
you don't tell me something useful,

7
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,230
you're dead.

8
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,300
If I die,

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,270
you'll all end up in prison anyway.

10
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:24,600
Fine.

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:26,430
I'd also like to see

12
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,830
how long you can keep talking tough.

13
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:36,870
Jack.

14
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:39,270
Isn't this a bit too cruel?

15
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,900
Such a perfect body.

16
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,800
Be gentler with him.

17
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,600
Not hurt him.

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,500
What are you trying to do?

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,100
How could it be him?

20
00:01:04,050 --> 00:01:05,000
You bastard, Daniel.

21
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,030
Why are you getting sentimental now?

22
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,670
This bastard is a cop.

23
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,100
If we can't get anything out of him,

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:12,730
then kill him.

25
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,400
So what if he's a cop?

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,800
Can't cops be played with too?

27
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,930
Maybe the taste of a cop

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,200
is even better.

29
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:25,600
Kill me.

30
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:26,900
Jack.

31
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,470
This cop.

32
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:30,900
I want him.

33
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:32,530
What are you doing, Daniel?

34
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:34,500
Daniel!

35
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,800
If you want to live,

36
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,400
kiss me.

37
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Daniel.

38
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,300
Luke hates cops to the bone.

39
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,200
You want to challenge the boss?

40
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:02,000
Then go ask

41
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,300
my godfather first.

42
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,100
If I want a man,

43
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,200
I've never failed.

44
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,830
When I get tired of this cop,

45
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,500
I'll deal with him myself.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,600
I think you're trying to help him.

47
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,270
Stop him.

48
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,370
If you block me again,

49
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:24,800
the next shot won't hit a knife.

50
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,800
Kill me.

51
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,250
Sure.

52
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,100
But you'd better be lucky.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,230
If you don't want to die,

54
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,700
trust me.

55
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,300
Be more passionate, Officer.

56
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,700
Someone's watching us.

57
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,430
Is he helping me?

58
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,730
He's a drug dealer.

59
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:15,970
How would he dare help a cop?

60
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,600
Moan.

61
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:22,630
Ouch.

62
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,330
Hey, Officer.

63
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,100
Is this your first time with a man?

64
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,030
Don't worry.

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,130
I won't let you hurt.

66
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:33,700
Scream.

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,830
Oh, ah.

68
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:35,930
Oh, ah.

69
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:36,500
Damn it.

70
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,500
Oh, ah.

71
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:40,630
Should we tell Mr. Luke?

72
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,970
It wouldn't matter if we did.

73
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,000
His precious son

74
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,100
and this cop

75
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:47,900
are just sleeping together.

76
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:48,900
It's nothing.

77
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:49,970
Leave it.

78
00:03:51,330 --> 00:03:51,870
Let's go.

79
00:03:58,830 --> 00:03:59,900
Hey, Officer.

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,030
You're burning bridges a bit too fast.

81
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,230
What do you really want?

82
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,930
Louis.

83
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,730
At least

84
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,800
we once

85
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,930
went to the same school.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't think I'm completely a bad guy.

87
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,600
You remember?

88
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,100
We once went to police academy together.

89
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,400
Look at you now.

90
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,600
Have you already forgotten

91
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,030
the oath you swore to the badge?

92
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,270
Have you forgotten?

93
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,130
You're a cop.

94
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:38,400
I'm a criminal.

95
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,130
You and I

96
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,300
stand on opposite sides.

97
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:42,630
But today,

98
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,330
I don't want you to die miserably.

99
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,300
But today,

100
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:51,970
I don't want you to die miserably.

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,870
Less than thirty seconds left.

102
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,570
You can't catch up to my score anymore.

103
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,000
Hey.

104
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:03,230
You win.

105
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,370
I know you didn't go all out.

106
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,170
If I went all out,

107
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,970
I'd beat you to death.

108
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,200
Just wait.

109
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:12,830
Next time I'll definitely beat you.

110
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,570
And I'll become
an even better cop than you.

111
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:17,930
I'll wait and see.

112
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,670
He said you were fired

113
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,170
because you got into a fight

114
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,170
and seriously hurt someone.

115
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,570
But I don't believe it.

116
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,600
Not bad.

117
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:34,070
But instead of

118
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,930
using psychology

119
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:37,030
to provoke me,

120
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,670
why not think first

121
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,270
about whether you can survive tonight?

122
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,300
Do you really want to help me?

123
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:44,370
Three days from now,

124
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,970
my adoptive father Luke will come personally.

125
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,270
If you don't want to die yet,

126
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,170
listen to me.

127
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,900
Can you...

128
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,730
What are you doing?

129
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,000
Be my boyfriend for three days.

130
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,930
Make it count.

131
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,030
Damn it.

132
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,770
This is infuriating.

133
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:17,230
You brought a cop to our hideout.

134
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,700
Your relationship is developing

135
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:23,470
pretty fast, huh?

136
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:24,770
What?

137
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:26,530
Are you jealous?

138
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:34,230
To celebrate you getting

139
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,600
a new favorite,

140
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,230
let him have a try.

141
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,330
You're helping him

142
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,130
a bit too much, Daniel.

143
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,430
If the boss finds out,

144
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,630
how long do you think you'll still be able

145
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,130
to sit in the deputy leader's seat?

146
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,030
What right do you have to order me around?

147
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:10,470
Huh?

148
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,430
Hey, grab the gun from his hand!

149
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,430
This bastard has gone crazy.

150
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,000
Bastard!

151
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:15,930
Get a grip.

152
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,530
Let's go.

153
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:18,730
You queer.

154
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,730
Bastard!

155
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,430
Wake up!

156
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,730
Is this how you repay me?

157
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,830
You know very well

158
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,170
how dangerous drugs are,

159
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,730
yet you still mess with them.

160
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,830
Are you really that stupid?

161
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,130
I'm the boss of the gang now.

162
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:49,000
Drugs are part of me,

163
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,270
just like how I feel about you.

164
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:52,870
Damn it.

165
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,730
I'm extremely disappointed in you.

166
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,500
Louis.

167
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,070
Actually,

168
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,330
there's something I've kept in my heart

169
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:06,430
for a long time.

170
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:07,530
What is it?

171
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,030
It's about...

172
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,470
Bastard!

173
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,930
Why are there

174
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,400
so many things here for drug rehabilitation?

175
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,700
Did he really join this gang?

176
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,200
Hey.

177
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:03,530
Did we have

178
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,430
that much fun last night?

179
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,130
My back's sore from sleeping.

180
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,830
I got bitten by a mad dog last night.

181
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:11,800
Was it a big dog?

182
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,630
Hello.

183
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,230
The delivery has been postponed to tonight.

184
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,270
Get ready first.

185
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:26,270
Yes.
