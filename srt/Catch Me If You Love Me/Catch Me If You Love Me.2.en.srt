1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,630
It's time, boss.

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,260
Mm.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:09,460
Let's go.

4
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,000
Hello, Father.

5
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,300
Daniel.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:24,000
I heard

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:25,660
you brought your new favorite along too.

8
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,430
Are you crazy?

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,030
Calm down, Father.

10
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,860
Shut up.

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,130
If the person behind me gets caught,

12
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,130
it's all over.

13
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,730
The reason I brought him

14
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,760
is because I didn't want the deal to get messed up.

15
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,100
And also...

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:43,830
Also...

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,560
I can't kill him.

18
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:47,930
Why?

19
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:49,800
He was my first love

20
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:50,830
back in my student days.

21
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,230
What?

22
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,030
So that's the secret

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,130
he's been keeping all this time?

24
00:00:58,120 --> 00:00:58,460
Ah!

25
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,760
Bastard!

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,230
Do you think I have the leisure

27
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,230
to listen to your love story?

28
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,260
Get him out of here, now.

29
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:06,400
Yes.

30
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,530
Hey.

31
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:13,530
Cop.

32
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,800
Damn it.

33
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,230
Luke.

34
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,720
So you never had any sincerity about this deal

35
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
from the beginning, did you?

36
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:20,800
Hey.

37
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,630
What do you

38
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,130
mean by doing this?

39
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,460
Calm down.

40
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,230
This isn't what you think.

41
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,260
Run!

42
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:31,400
You.

43
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,560
Go!

44
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,030
Calm down, huh?

45
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,430
Don't move.

46
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,700
I don't want to slit your throat.

47
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,660
Message confirmed.

48
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,500
The person Luke brought is not Philip.

49
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:46,320
The undercover mission

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,630
must continue.

51
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,900
Hey, don't move.

52
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,000
Move aside.

53
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,200
Drop the gun.

54
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:56,100
I told you to drop the gun.

55
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,900
Drop the gun!

56
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:07,500
Father, run!

57
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,030
Shoot me!

58
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,060
Shoot me!

59
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,130
Shoot!

60
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,660
I need you to conduct an investigation

61
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,400
and identify

62
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,730
the drug dealer behind Luke,

63
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,200
then bring him

64
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,600
to justice.

65
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,900
Can you do it?

66
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:41,700
Yes, sir.

67
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,330
I will complete the mission.

68
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,300
Very good.

69
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:45,460
Please.

70
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,500
This guy really has some nerve,

71
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,100
delivering the goods straight into the cat's den.

72
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,730
Yes.

73
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,630
He thinks we wouldn't dare arrest him, right?

74
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,360
A gift for you.

75
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,230
Is there something wrong with your head?

76
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,060
I need you

77
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,260
to infiltrate Luke's organization

78
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,100
and find out

79
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:31,300
who's really behind

80
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,530
this drug trafficking ring.

81
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,460
Yes, sir.

82
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,260
You don't need to worry.

83
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,060
I will complete this mission.

84
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,000
After being lovers for three days,

85
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,900
I feel it's still not enough.

86
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,400
So

87
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,300
I hereby announce

88
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,360
that from today on,

89
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,730
whether in the underworld

90
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:57,960
or the legitimate world,

91
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,000
within one month,

92
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,100
I will win you over

93
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,700
and make you my wife.

94
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,030
Louis,

95
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:16,830
I think

96
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,500
I fell in love with you at first sight.

97
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:20,600
I...

98
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,330
Let go.

99
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:23,130
Do you want to get arrested?

100
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,830
Then arrest me.

101
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,700
But

102
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,830
if you're going to arrest me,

103
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,260
can you use cuffs

104
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,000
to lock the two of us together?

105
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:32,760
The kind where

106
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,930
we stay together 24 hours a day.

107
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,200
Hey,

108
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,300
Officer,

109
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,760
dragging me to such a secluded place...

110
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,530
Do you have something secret?

111
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:51,930
Oh.

112
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,060
Ah.

113
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:54,630
Get a grip.

114
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,060
Hey.

115
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,130
Is it really necessary

116
00:04:58,130 --> 00:04:59,500
to hurt someone who's pursuing you?

117
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,700
Or SM is fine too.

118
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,000
I'm up for anything.

119
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,060
Hey.

120
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,130
No fun today.

121
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,860
I was just punished by Luke, and you're still

122
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,630
treating me like this.

123
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,500
Will even Father's precious son

124
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:23,630
get punished?

125
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,130
Aren't you good at acting?

126
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,700
Exactly.

127
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,530
Otherwise, how could I still be alive today?

128
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,600
Oh.

129
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:35,730
Oh.

130
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:36,500
Wow.

131
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,660
Hmmm.

132
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,200
Today's deal failed...

133
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,400
It must have something to do with you.

134
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:44,800
Boss,

135
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,300
our plan failed.

136
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,800
Some cop showed up out of nowhere,

137
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,000
then a clash broke out.

138
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,330
I managed to escape,

139
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:51,330
but

140
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:53,830
all our goods

141
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:54,960
were confiscated by the police.

142
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,430
You useless pieces of trash.

143
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,460
I'll get our stuff back.

144
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:01,500
What did you say?

145
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:03,000
Father,

146
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,230
can you give me a chance to make up for my mistake?

147
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,400
I'll only give you

148
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,730
one month.

149
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,300
You said you'd win me over within one month.

150
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:19,430
What are you thinking?

151
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:24,830
Didn't I already tell you?

152
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,830
I really do like you.

153
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,700
Good luck.

154
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,500
Daniel, what are you doing here?

155
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:25,330
I'm delivering coffee.

156
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't accept bribes.

157
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,760
If it's just one cup,

158
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:32,300
maybe it counts as a bribe.

159
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,900
But if it's for the whole team,

160
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,530
that's called

161
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,930
a good citizen.

162
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:40,760
Oh.

163
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:41,400
Or

164
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,700
a kind-hearted person.

165
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,330
Will you drink it yourself, or do you want me to feed you?

166
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,830
What exactly do you want?

167
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,930
I'm pursuing you.

168
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,300
Where are you going?

169
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,160
Can you stop bothering me?

170
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,260
I have an urgent mission.

171
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:06,660
An urgent mission?

172
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:07,930
Why don't I know about it?

173
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,430
In that case,

174
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,830
please allow me today

175
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,030
to be your bodyguard, Officer.

176
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,900
Unit Two, Louis.

177
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:17,060
Unit Two, Louis.

178
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,560
A chemical factory has clues to a drug trafficking ring.

179
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,730
Immediate action required.

180
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:23,130
Roger.

181
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,200
Don't follow me.

182
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:27,130
Okay.

183
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,030
I told you not to follow me.

184
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:37,960
Follow me.

185
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:38,930
We'll split up later.

186
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,700
Okay.

187
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,230
Ah.

188
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:43,960
There's no time. Follow me.

189
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:47,800
Surround him!

190
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,530
Don't move,

191
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,700
or I'll shoot.

192
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,100
Don't come any closer,

193
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:57,000
or I'll shoot.

194
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:58,560
Let him go,

195
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:00,330
and let me take his place.

196
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,160
Sir,

197
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,000
let the child go.

198
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:17,260
Let me take his place.

199
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,400
He's just a child.

200
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,100
I'm a cop.

201
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,600
I'd be far more useful.

202
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:22,900
Hahaha.

203
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,100
Put the gun down.

204
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:27,460
Put it down.

205
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:32,060
Taking a child hostage.

206
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:34,730
Isn't that a bit weak?

207
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,900
Take me instead.

208
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm much more useful.

209
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm his.

210
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:42,960
What are you doing?

211
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:44,930
Are you trying to provoke me?

212
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,560
Daniel,

213
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:47,830
what are you doing?

214
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,330
Darling.

215
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,500
Darling, you should keep

216
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,700
your public and private matters separate,

217
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,060
especially right now.

218
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,430
I'm fulfilling my duty as a citizen,

219
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,030
helping you with your work.

220
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:58,930
You want to see what I'm capable of?

221
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,660
Hey.

222
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:01,100
No, bro.

223
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,530
Oh...

224
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,130
I didn't mean to provoke you.

225
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,930
I swear I didn't lie to you.

226
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,430
I don't have any weapons on me.

227
00:10:13,690 --> 00:10:14,330
Let go of me!

228
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,160
Let go!

229
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:16,560
Bastard, let go of me!

230
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,460
Let go!

231
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,230
Stay still.

232
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:19,960
Sir,

233
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:22,060
we'll take it from here.

234
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:25,500
Come on, move.

235
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,360
Are you okay?

236
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,460
Ouch.

237
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,530
I think my arm's broken.

238
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,230
Ouch.

239
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,030
Let me take a look.

240
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,130
Don't move.

241
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:35,760
Officer,

242
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:38,030
I helped catch this criminal today.

243
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,460
Does that make me a model citizen?

244
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:43,660
If your arm really is broken,

245
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:45,000
I'll award you

246
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,530
a Good Citizen Medal.

247
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,560
Ouch, ouch.

248
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,160
Ah!

249
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:49,960
Oh.

250
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:54,330
I don't need any award.

251
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,160
Just let me stand like this for ten minutes.

252
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:58,860
That's enough.

253
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:12,960
Boss,

254
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,660
I've been really busy lately,

255
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,260
so I haven't come to see you much.

256
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,960
Back then, you scolded me every day,

257
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,530
said I was always causing trouble.

258
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:24,960
Now…

259
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,030
I actually miss that voice.

260
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,830
All these years,

261
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,030
I've had to lie to everyone.

262
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,830
Even when I sleep,

263
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,630
I have to keep one eye open.

264
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,000
I'm almost forgetting

265
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,460
who I really am.

266
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:51,600
Sometimes,

267
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,360
I wish someone could scold me

268
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,960
the way you used to, Master.

269
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,030
But now, every day,

270
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,160
there's someone

271
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,360
constantly lecturing me in my ear.

272
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,130
And the more he scolds me,

273
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,230
the more I like him.

274
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:09,660
Anyway,

275
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,560
I hope the mission can be completed soon,

276
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:16,560
so that I can...

277
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,860
so that I can be

278
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,860
with the one I love.

279
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,930
Master…

280
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,930
Do you still remember Louis?

281
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,360
Ever since I met him,

282
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,560
my life

283
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,200
can no longer be without him.

284
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,400
If you can see us

285
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,460
from heaven,

286
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:42,950
please pray for me...

287
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,960
Pray that I can successfully win his heart.

288
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:48,330
It's so noisy.

289
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,330
Even the living are about to be annoyed to death.

290
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,260
I'm afraid Master wouldn't hear me.

291
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,630
In what capacity are you coming to pay respects to Master?

292
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,060
As the disciple who disappointed him.

293
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,200
Daniel,

294
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,830
between the cat and the mouse,

295
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,960
which role are you, really?

296
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,460
Louis.

297
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:22,060
Louis.

298
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:22,560
Uh.

299
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,130
Yes, yes.

300
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,060
What is it?

301
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,160
There's a mission. Hurry up.

302
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:25,600
Go.

303
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,160
Go, go.

304
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,360
The informant said

305
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:38,630
the middleman

306
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,330
has a dragon tattoo on his neck.

307
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:41,730
Be especially careful.

308
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,230
Copy that, Louis.

309
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:49,530
Gay bar.

310
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,360
New here?

311
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,570
Come have a drink with me.

312
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,660
New here?

313
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,630
Come have a drink with me.

314
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,700
It's okay.

315
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm just

316
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,400
looking around.

317
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,760
Just looking around.

318
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,100
What fun is that?

319
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,460
Let's do something

320
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,630
more exciting.

321
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,230
Then…

322
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,330
that depends on what you want to play.

323
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:33,860
This is a place to have fun.

324
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,860
What do you want?

325
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:37,600
Come on.

326
00:14:38,090 --> 00:14:39,560
Let's find a quiet place and talk.

327
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,130
That way we can chat properly.

328
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,300
Sure.

329
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,560
I have to buy the team more time.

330
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:54,730
What's wrong?

331
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,730
Nervous?

332
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,060
I was just thinking

333
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,430
where are you taking me?

334
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,130
About that,

335
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:04,830
you don't need to worry.

336
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,600
About where I'm taking you. I promise

337
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,500
you'll thank me.

338
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,930
Really?

339
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:15,830
Then how do you want me to thank you?

340
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,030
Very simple.

341
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,860
Just get me drunk.

342
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,730
After that,

343
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,530
what we do

344
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,660
we'll talk about later.

345
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,730
My man.

346
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,030
Don't touch him.

347
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,400
Oh, darling.

348
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:49,930
Mm.

349
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,030
You're here too.

350
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:52,230
Let's go.

351
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,330
Okay.

352
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,230
Why did you come here?

353
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,630
To step in for you.

354
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,430
Just one look in your eyes

355
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,760
and I knew you wanted to kill him.

356
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,700
I'm on a mission.

357
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,130
If you do this,

358
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,230
my whole plan is ruined.

359
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,930
Everyone,

360
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,400
tonight,

361
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,130
at our event,

362
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,460
we've got an amazing on-screen couple here.

363
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,830
Our screen couple.

364
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,800
Show us your love.

365
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,400
Kiss!

366
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,200
Kiss! Kiss!

367
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,030
Officer,

368
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,530
if we want the mission to succeed,

369
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,530
I'm willing to make a sacrifice.

370
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:43,900
Kiss!

371
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:45,100
Kiss!

372
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,130
Kiss!

373
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:48,060
Kiss!

374
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:48,560
Kiss!

375
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:49,200
Kiss!

376
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,500
Boss, someone has infiltrated.

377
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,700
They're together.

378
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,130
Requesting backup.

379
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,600
Daniel.

380
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:30,130
Are you okay?

381
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,100
Hang in there.

382
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:36,500
Hang in there.

383
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,230
I think…

384
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,600
I can't hold on much longer.

385
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:41,560
If…

386
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,030
something happens to me,

387
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,800
please scatter my ashes

388
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,300
into the sea.

389
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,130
Whenever it rains,

390
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,200
I'll feel like

391
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,800
I'm right by your side.

392
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:54,900
Damn it, stop talking.

393
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,330
If anything happens to you now,

394
00:17:56,790 --> 00:17:58,200
I'll haunt you for the rest of your life.

395
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,600
Go to the hospital.

396
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:00,860
He…

397
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:03,100
Is he really that worried about me?

398
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:09,860
Here.

399
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,160
Take your medicine.

400
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,460
Are you that worried about me?

401
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:15,400
Afraid I'll die?

402
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm not worried you'll die.

403
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm more worried the hospital will turn into chaos.

404
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:21,200
Well...

405
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,960
If Luke sees my wound,

406
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,230
I'll be in serious trouble.

407
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:30,060
If there's some kind soul nearby

408
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:33,160
willing to let me stay at their place to recover,

409
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:34,760
that would be great.

410
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:35,830
Stop making excuses.

411
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,060
But it really hurts.

412
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:39,930
Then…

413
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:40,960
you can stay at my place for now.

414
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:42,260
Once you're better, you have to move out.

415
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:46,300
Ouch.

416
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:47,760
It hurts so much.

417
00:18:49,090 --> 00:18:50,400
Stop playing pitiful.

418
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,300
Fried eggs are ready.

419
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:57,660
Ouch.

420
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,560
Ah, it hurts.

421
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,900
Ouch.

422
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,100
What's wrong? Let me see.

423
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,660
The wound really hurts.

424
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:07,200
It really hurts.

425
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,030
So painful.

426
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,860
Meet at the usual place tonight.

427
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:30,760
The weapons

428
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:32,360
will arrive at the station at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

429
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:34,260
That's all I know.

430
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,260
That's more than enough.

431
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:38,960
Thanks.

432
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:47,900
Where did you go?

433
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,730
I just…

434
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,560
went to take care of something.

435
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:52,830
It's nothing.

436
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,460
I'm asking seriously.

437
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,430
Are you planning to keep living like this?

438
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,330
Being Luke's right-hand man,

439
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,030
and helping him do evil?

440
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,030
So what?

441
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:07,930
You can choose not to do this.

442
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:11,060
Now I have money,

443
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,530
power,

444
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,360
I can do whatever I want,

445
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,100
and get anything I desire.

446
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:17,630
Great.

447
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,530
So you're going to let yourself keep being a terrible person?

448
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:20,460
Huh?

449
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,060
Who would want to be with someone like me?

450
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:23,900
Hands stained with blood,

451
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,730
doing drugs?

452
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:26,730
You?

453
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,830
It's not too late to turn back now.

454
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,160
Think it through carefully.

455
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:34,760
Turn back?

456
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,930
If you try kissing me once first,

457
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:38,930
maybe

458
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,560
I'll go back and think about it again.

459
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,100
What I said.

460
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:03,600
I hope you'll seriously think it over.

461
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:16,900
Let's go, move in!

462
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,530
You're a police officer.

463
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,160
How could you let

464
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,230
the evidence

465
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,200
get hijacked?

466
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,390
Or is it that you and Daniel

467
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,330
have some kind of relationship?

468
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,260
But

469
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,330
I didn't...

470
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,300
That's enough.

471
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:34,060
Then

472
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,330
how did he

473
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,430
know government secrets?

474
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:38,000
From now on,

475
00:21:39,490 --> 00:21:40,800
you are suspended from duty.

476
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,500
Yes, sir.

477
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,230
I know, Officer, you're a good kid.

478
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,830
You've never written a disciplinary report.

479
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,230
So I helped you write an extra one.

480
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,300
I'll write this

481
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,200
report myself later.

482
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,560
Why?

483
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:04,920
Oh.

484
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,000
Because I was the one who invited you out.

485
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,630
Hey, we went together, no big deal.

486
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,230
Hand it over, hand it over.

487
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,330
This report.

488
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,460
I'll take care of it.

489
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,800
I was the one who dragged you out,

490
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,100
so of course I'll take responsibility.

491
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,630
I won't let a future model student like you

492
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,760
get points deducted.

493
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,530
Officer,

494
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,330
no matter how busy work gets,

495
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,330
don't forget

496
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,400
to eat on time.

497
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,200
Worried I'll die?

498
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,200
Daniel.

499
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:48,630
Damn it.

500
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,560
Our Brother Daniel

501
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,360
really did something

502
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,830
incredible this time.

503
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:57,830
Hey, is that true?

504
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:58,630
Of course it is.

505
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,760
Look at that police car transporting drugs.

506
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,930
Brother Daniel

507
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,430
still managed to hijack it with ease.

508
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,660
So this time,

509
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:05,960
which side do you think

510
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:08,630
we should stand on?

511
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:09,730
Hey.

512
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,730
Yeah.

513
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,260
The one most fit to be the boss

514
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,330
can only be Brother Daniel.

515
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,100
Come on, come on,

516
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,230
let's celebrate.

517
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,860
Hey!

518
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:20,200
Well.

519
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:21,430
Tonight,

520
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:22,730
Brother Daniel is treating

521
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,860
everyone here.

522
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:25,830
Let's cheer for him!

523
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:26,900
Daniel!

524
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:27,860
Daniel!

525
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:28,800
Daniel!

526
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,730
Daniel!

527
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,260
Oh, Daniel, you came just in time.

528
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:34,530
Sit here.

529
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,730
How about it?

530
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:36,530
Sit here, sit here.

531
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,160
Thanks, thanks.

532
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,260
I'll drink a bit less today.

533
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,000
Alright.

534
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:42,630
Daniel,

535
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:43,660
I heard Luke

536
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,560
wants you to take over

537
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,860
the business of those two bars in the east, right?

538
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:48,800
Hey,

539
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,330
rumors are flying everywhere.

540
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,330
I'm not that capable yet.

541
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,930
Brother, don't be so modest.

542
00:23:53,690 --> 00:23:55,560
Because the one most suitable to be the boss

543
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,460
is you and only you.

544
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,530
So what do you think?

545
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,600
Go on, keep talking.

546
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,730
Why did you stop?

547
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:05,960
Keep talking.

548
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,260
I think

549
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:09,060
if you're drunk,

550
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:10,830
you'd better go home and sleep.

551
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,030
You can barely even walk straight anymore.

552
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:13,600
Hey.

553
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,430
Did you pour the alcohol out on the way?

554
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,930
Are you drunk?

555
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,030
Did you get drunk?

556
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,660
If you're drunk, go home and sleep.

557
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:44,560
Stop.

558
00:24:45,390 --> 00:24:46,530
You two.

559
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:48,560
Come with me to the ancestral hall,

560
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,160
right now.

561
00:24:51,070 --> 00:24:52,490
[Lin Ancestral Hall]

562
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,230
Do you remember?

563
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,400
Who is this?

564
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,660
The boss's younger brother.

565
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,130
Yes.

566
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:01,960
My own younger brother

567
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,360
and I killed him with my own hands.

568
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,830
Brother,

569
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:09,330
are you really going to shoot me dead?

570
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,760
I'm your brother!

571
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,030
Do you know

572
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,430
why I did that?

573
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,660
Because that bastard.

574
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,030
He betrayed me.

575
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:22,460
Sean.

576
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:24,600
He was the one who persuaded my brother

577
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,800
to stand on the cops' side.

578
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,630
Betrayal.

579
00:25:27,950 --> 00:25:29,630
The only thing waiting for you

580
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:30,630
is death.

581
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,460
I think

582
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,430
about that last deal,

583
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:37,530
the cops on your side were messing

584
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,860
things up behind the scenes.

585
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,460
The informant said

586
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,230
the police arrived ten minutes

587
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,030
earlier than us.

588
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:49,300
That means

589
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:50,560
there's a

590
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,760
mole in here.

591
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:56,860
You.

592
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:57,900
Who do you think it is?

593
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,330
Who's the mole among us?

594
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:05,260
The mole?

595
00:26:05,290 --> 00:26:06,400
It has to be Daniel.

596
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,530
He's lost his head,

597
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:09,620
drugged by that little cop,

598
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,430
and he's completely off now.

599
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,060
I swear,

600
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,630
no matter who it is,

601
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:21,360
I'll drag that mole out.

602
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,130
I'll bring

603
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,930
him to Godfather

604
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,100
and kill him myself

605
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,760
with this gun.

606
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:29,930
Good.

607
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:31,260
Very good.

608
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,530
I'll give you

609
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,160
two weeks.

610
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,530
Whoever

611
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,830
gets information on the police undercover agent

612
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,560
and kills Sean.

613
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,160
I'll make him the heir.

614
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,360
The heir

615
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:54,660
will inherit

616
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,360
all my businesses.

617
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,530
I'll take him to meet

618
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,160
all my agents.

619
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,430
I must become the heir.

620
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,860
That's the only chance

621
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,230
for me to meet Peter.

622
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,230
Go.

623
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:12,160
Go dig out the moles one by one.

624
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,260
Yes.

625
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,450
The heir

626
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,530
will only be me.

627
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:30,830
A traitor like you?

628
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,060
Don't even think about it.

629
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,660
In that case,

630
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:37,260
let's see who's more capable.

631
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:45,230
Boss,

632
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:47,430
isn't this task

633
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,230
a bit too harsh?

634
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:51,530
Dogs

635
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,660
are the fiercest

636
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,060
when they're fighting over food.

637
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,460
Hey.

638
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,530
You looking for me?

639
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,430
My boss is waiting for you at the warehouse.

640
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,660
I heard there's a lead on

641
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,660
a new undercover agent.

642
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,330
Now?

643
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:12,060
Yes.

644
00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,360
Got it.

645
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:39,360
Can't hold back anymore, huh?

646
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,360
You're really sly, you know that?

647
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,560
Daniel,

648
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,360
you never learn your lesson.

649
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:50,760
I just got a batch of new stuff.

650
00:28:51,550 --> 00:28:52,900
Top quality.

651
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:54,460
So I wanted you

652
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,560
to have a taste first.

653
00:29:05,550 --> 00:29:06,560
Same old trick.

654
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,660
Oh.

655
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:13,130
Ah.

656
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,960
A junkie like you.

657
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,460
Don't even think about

658
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,800
going back to being a cop.

659
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,130
Traitors

660
00:29:46,450 --> 00:29:47,930
only have one ending, death.

661
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,460
Hahaha.

662
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:53,460
Louis,

663
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,800
can you come see me?

664
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,330
Louis,

665
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,660
can you come see me?

666
00:30:03,250 --> 00:30:05,130
Sorry, I can't.

667
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:15,560
You want to work under me, huh?

668
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,160
Then prove it.

669
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,460
Prove it to me.

670
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,230
Is that all you've got?

671
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:41,360
You bastard.

672
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,330
Turns out you're just a little wolf cub.

673
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:45,930
Hahaha.

674
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:46,960
Follow me.

675
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,060
Daniel.

676
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,230
Daniel.

677
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,160
Daniel.

678
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,160
Daniel.

679
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:03,960
Daniel.

680
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,260
Louis.

681
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:10,730
Save me.

682
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:49,360
Are you still mad at me?

683
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,260
About the suspension?

684
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,130
Can you help me quit drugs?

685
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:59,200
Just stay with me every night

686
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,600
until I get better,

687
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,830
okay?

688
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,500
If you let me go

689
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,960
and my addiction flares up again,

690
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,560
I don't know

691
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:13,460
what bad things I might do.

692
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,660
You're an upright cop.

693
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,060
You wouldn't want to see that happen, right?

694
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:22,200
Help me, please.

695
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,360
Why are you calling now?

696
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,530
About your

697
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,460
reinstatement...

698
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,630
You'll have to wait a bit longer.

699
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,160
That's not it, sir.

700
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:49,560
It's that

701
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,730
I think a new drug

702
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,760
is circulating now.

703
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,020
This time,

704
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,160
it seems even stronger than before.

705
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:56,530
Something this dangerous

706
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,230
must be the work

707
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,730
of that drug dealer.

708
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,130
We have to catch him as soon as possible.

709
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,830
The effects of this drug

710
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,530
are several times stronger than before.

711
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,860
No wonder

712
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,530
Luke is eager to work with Peter.

713
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:10,860
Looks like we need to move fast.

714
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:12,760
We must not let

715
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:14,260
this drug spread.

716
00:34:01,950 --> 00:34:02,800
Can you stay with me?

717
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:04,860
Even if it's just tonight.

718
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:07,200
Daniel,

719
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm a cop.

720
00:34:10,290 --> 00:34:11,300
Cats and mice

721
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,960
were never meant to be together.

722
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:14,660
One day,

723
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,260
I will hold you while we sleep,

724
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,260
until a new day arrives.

725
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:23,660
Hey.

726
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:25,060
I can be reinstated now, right?

727
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,830
Hello, this is the insurance company.

728
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:28,800
We'd like to contact you about something.

729
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,000
It's about a new insurance policy.

730
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,200
May I ask, sir...

731
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,830
Louis.

732
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:41,060
Anyway,

733
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,000
thank you

734
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,460
for helping me quit drugs.

735
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,260
If I get the chance in the future,

736
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:50,000
I'll repay you.

737
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,400
You just need to

738
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:53,800
stop doing stupid things, that'll be repayment.

739
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:11,860
I've got information

740
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,160
on their next drug shipment.

741
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:14,860
I thought you'd definitely need it.

742
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:16,960
Is the information reliable?

743
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:18,160
Of course it is.

744
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,300
Time and place?

745
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,960
The docks in half an hour.

746
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,000
Okay.

747
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,700
This is urgent.

748
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,600
I have to go.

749
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,530
Sorry, Jack,

750
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,030
I'm a bit late.

751
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:42,860
Hey.

752
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:52,230
Jack, you've really got guts.

753
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,430
Doing something like this

754
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:54,560
behind Mr. Luke's back.

755
00:35:55,050 --> 00:35:55,600
I truly admire you.

756
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,130
That's enough.

757
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,930
Take the money and leave.

758
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,200
Don't worry.

759
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:04,160
I know the rules.

760
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:07,960
Pleasure doing business.

761
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,730
Hurry up and go.

762
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,900
Okay.

763
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:15,630
Oh.

764
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,630
Boss, you go first.

765
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:19,260
Hey,

766
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:20,300
what's going on?

767
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,630
Boss,

768
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,930
this way.

769
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:25,830
Drop the gun!

770
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,660
The cops are here, boss, run!

771
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,700
You again?

772
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,660
Just wait, you'll pay for this.

773
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,660
What a shame.

774
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,360
Jack and his people got away.

775
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,100
Those guys

776
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,860
know how to deal with the police.

777
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,060
Looks like we'll have to observe first.

778
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,160
Mm, understood.

779
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:55,900
But speaking of that,

780
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,660
how did you know

781
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,460
they were dealing there?

782
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,730
An informant.

783
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,800
What,

784
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,200
do you think I'm a useless cop?

785
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,160
Jack got away.

786
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:13,860
He won't let this go.

787
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,030
Where did you get this from?

788
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:16,560
Is that all?

789
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:17,660
That's all.

790
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,600
I'm just a poor guy.

791
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,060
You know the person who gave me the info.

792
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:22,230
I see.

793
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,300
No wonder

794
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,960
you could time it so precisely.

795
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:26,330
But then again,

796
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:28,930
maybe my informant

797
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:31,130
isn't that reliable.

798
00:37:41,950 --> 00:37:43,960
Damn, this is getting more and more chaotic.

799
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,700
I used to rely on no one,

800
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,560
and I still lived just fine.

801
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:57,450
I didn't call you here.

802
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:58,800
You gave the information, weren't you?

803
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,460
What?

804
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,700
I don't understand.

805
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,400
Stop playing dumb.

806
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,030
Are you sure?

807
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:15,530
Interrogating someone in the middle of drug withdrawal.

808
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:18,500
Do you know

809
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,230
how dangerous that is?

810
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm just a junkie,

811
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,760
a worthless life.

812
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,460
I won't die.

813
00:38:27,490 --> 00:38:28,660
Look at you.

814
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,630
You're still so worried about me.

815
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,860
This is already good enough.

816
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,200
Crazy.

817
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:47,160
This madness.

818
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,700
Only you

819
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,560
can cure it.

820
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:01,160
Please come in.

821
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:06,200
Have a seat.

822
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,530
Through this “1-2-1”

823
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,230
anti-drug investigation and special crackdown operation,

824
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:20,130
the police successfully seized

825
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:21,660
three kilograms of heroin.

826
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,360
This can be said to be

827
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,300
a highly

828
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,430
commendable achievement.

829
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:28,760
Louis,

830
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:31,060
from today on,

831
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:34,160
you are reinstated to your position,

832
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,160
just as before.

833
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:36,830
Uh, sir.

834
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,460
Do you have any objections?

835
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:40,160
He did so well.

836
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,360
Shouldn't he get some reward?

837
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,200
Hey.

838
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:46,160
Come back together.

839
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,100
Heh heh.

840
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,460
The fight against drugs

841
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,200
is an endless war.

842
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,000
I

843
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,730
will fight side by side with you all

844
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,030
until the very last moment.

845
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:07,000
Congratulations, Louis.

846
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,130
You're back.

847
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:17,000
Hey.

848
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,360
Officer.

849
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,930
I heard you were reinstated.

850
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,230
Congratulations.

851
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,360
You're well informed.

852
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,960
I told you

853
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,130
I would pursue you.

854
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,530
This little bit of concern

855
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:31,660
isn't too much, right?

856
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:32,930
Daniel.

857
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,130
If your addiction flares up,

858
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,160
go see a doctor.

859
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,660
I can't keep helping you forever.

860
00:40:56,620 --> 00:40:57,330
Daniel.

861
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:05,830
Daniel.

862
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:06,860
Daniel.

863
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:12,160
Daniel.

864
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,530
Daniel.

865
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,460
What are you doing here?

866
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:21,930
When I'm not around,

867
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:23,360
is this how you quit drugs?

868
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:25,960
Don't move.

869
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,430
What the hell...

870
00:41:30,550 --> 00:41:31,260
Officer?

871
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:34,930
You've only been back at work for a short while

872
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:36,800
and now throwing your weight around?

873
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:47,560
Go back.

874
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:57,000
Go take care of your wound.

875
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:03,600
Ah.

876
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:04,130
Ouch.

877
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:04,930
It hurts.

878
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:07,330
You idiot.

879
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,030
You're always so reckless.

880
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:14,230
After this,

881
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,430
I'll come look for you until you quit drugs.

882
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,400
Hey.

883
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:23,760
Why are you being so nice to me?

884
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,600
Could it be…

885
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,130
you've already fallen hopelessly in love with me?

886
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,630
Shut up.

887
00:42:31,350 --> 00:42:32,360
Ouch, ouch.

888
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,000
That hurts.

889
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:33,860
Serves you right.

890
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:38,700
Hmph.

891
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:40,860
And you told me to shut up.

892
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,760
Your heartbeat

893
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,560
is pounding so hard it's about to jump out.

894
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,160
Damn it.

895
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,030
Have I really

896
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:53,030
fallen for him?

897
00:42:58,850 --> 00:42:59,960
Well… it doesn't seem so bad.

898
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:04,260
Alright, I'm leaving first.

899
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:18,930
You don't have to move.

900
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:20,560
I'll do it myself.

901
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,300
Oh, impressive.

902
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:32,800
Daniel, hello there.

903
00:43:33,190 --> 00:43:34,400
Hey.

904
00:43:34,690 --> 00:43:36,300
You're in an especially good mood today.

905
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:37,430
Something good happen?

906
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,930
Maybe.

907
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:39,860
Oh?

908
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:41,800
Probably because Manchester United is going to win.

909
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,630
If you say so.

910
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,530
When you throw,

911
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:47,760
keep your hand steady,

912
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,100
your mind calm,

913
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,030
and then

914
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,000
throw...

915
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:54,460
Oh.

916
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,730
Perfect score.

917
00:43:56,890 --> 00:43:57,530
Hahaha.

918
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,830
You, come here.

919
00:43:59,450 --> 00:44:01,260
Hey.

920
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,000
Jack,

921
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:03,400
I think

922
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,200
you'd better spend your time

923
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,200
explaining things clearly to Luke.

924
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,060
Coming to me

925
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,560
is just a waste of time.

926
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,430
The cops know all our routes,

927
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:13,900
and that new subordinate of yours

928
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,500
just happened to show up on time to mess things up.

929
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:16,500
Daniel,

930
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:18,600
don't say it has nothing to do with you.

931
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:19,800
Jack,

932
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:22,400
what are you talking about?

933
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,300
You need evidence when you speak.

934
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,560
Bastard.

935
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:26,000
Hey.

936
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:27,130
Stop!

937
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:29,530
You two,

938
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:30,530
come with me.

939
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:39,930
Boss,

940
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,660
about that

941
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,000
undercover matter...

942
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:43,000
Put it aside for now.

943
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,130
There's something more urgent.

944
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,030
Elaine

945
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,230
will be arriving soon.

946
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,260
The wife of the drug lord Pete.

947
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:50,900
Really?

948
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:53,100
I heard she's extremely ruthless.

949
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,060
Anyone who gets in her way

950
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,630
never ends well.

951
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:58,100
Exactly.

952
00:44:58,320 --> 00:44:59,930
Then we must give her a grand welcome.

953
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:01,500
You.

954
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:02,390
You.

955
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:04,100
Don't cause trouble.

956
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:05,760
Okay.

957
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,050
Okay.

958
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,630
From here to here, Sergeant,

959
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,000
pull up the surveillance footage for me.

960
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:17,800
Okay.

961
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:19,230
Please wait, Lieutenant.

962
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:19,660
Alright.

963
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:23,560
What's going on?

964
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,830
Did the computer freeze?

965
00:45:25,390 --> 00:45:26,530
Not sure.

966
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:27,900
I don't know what's wrong with it.

967
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:29,900
Hey, don't open it.

968
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:32,530
It's already too late.

969
00:45:33,290 --> 00:45:34,260
The Babel Club

970
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,900
is officially open.

971
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:38,600
Unlimited free drinks.

972
00:45:39,290 --> 00:45:40,630
Officer Louis

973
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,230
and other officers

974
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:43,700
are cordially invited to come and have fun.

975
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:44,930
Use this email

976
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:46,960
to receive a free VIP private room.

977
00:45:47,620 --> 00:45:49,330
Signed, Officer Louis's

978
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:50,800
sweetheart.

979
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:00,230
Louis,

980
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:02,060
are you sure

981
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:03,030
this is the place?

982
00:46:04,150 --> 00:46:05,630
Do you really think a shop run by criminals

983
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:07,130
would

984
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:07,800
follow the law?

985
00:46:09,050 --> 00:46:10,630
I think this place is definitely

986
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:11,830
a drug den.

987
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:12,930
Yes.

988
00:46:14,050 --> 00:46:14,400
Let's go.

989
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,360
Go down and take a look.

990
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,060
Please show your invitation.

991
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:22,130
What invitation, man?

992
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:23,530
We're just here to have some fun.

993
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,530
Please be respectful.

994
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,630
That should get us in, right?

995
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:32,060
Please come in.

996
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:34,800
Bro.

997
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:36,760
I'm telling you, the stuff inside is amazing.

998
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:37,860
Give it a try.

999
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:39,760
Oh my God.

1000
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:40,930
Look at this mess.

1001
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:41,960
You can tell he's high.

1002
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:44,660
Notify Team B immediately. Prepare to move.

1003
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:46,060
Copy that, Louis.

1004
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:51,730
Hey.

1005
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:53,430
Am I seeing things?

1006
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,630
Focus on your fingertips

1007
00:46:58,390 --> 00:46:59,800
and imagine

1008
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:01,460
the air

1009
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,760
circling around them.

1010
00:47:04,590 --> 00:47:05,460
Oh my God.

1011
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:06,760
Breathe in,

1012
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,860
then slowly breathe out.

1013
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:10,860
Hello, Officer.

1014
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:12,660
You finally made it.

1015
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,030
Our shop's new protein powder formula.

1016
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:32,160
Interested in trying it?

1017
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:33,560
Daniel, you bastard.

1018
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,460
Shh, shh.

1019
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,700
Please follow the rules, okay?

1020
00:47:44,050 --> 00:47:45,930
What if I'm not here to have fun?

1021
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,000
Then feel free.

1022
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:51,530
Because

1023
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,630
if it's you, Officer,

1024
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,200
I'm always at your service.

1025
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:00,660
Check the surroundings carefully.

1026
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,960
If you spot anything unusual,

1027
00:48:02,290 --> 00:48:03,060
notify me immediately.

1028
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:04,460
Understood, Louis.

1029
00:48:06,490 --> 00:48:07,260
Want to try it?

1030
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,660
You emailed an invitation like that.

1031
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:12,200
How can you be sure I wouldn't come arrest you?

1032
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,660
You've got it wrong, Officer.

1033
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:15,900
What?

1034
00:48:16,590 --> 00:48:17,900
I just wanted to see you.

1035
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:19,960
Help!

1036
00:48:21,390 --> 00:48:22,130
What's going on?

1037
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:23,160
Help me.

1038
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:24,860
Someone's harassing me.

1039
00:48:25,650 --> 00:48:26,360
Watch her.

1040
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:27,660
I'll go search inside.

1041
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:37,760
Madam,

1042
00:48:38,090 --> 00:48:38,900
I think

1043
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:40,800
your little performance

1044
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:42,960
wasn't very convincing.

1045
00:48:42,990 --> 00:48:44,530
Even if you hate me,

1046
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,460
there's no need

1047
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,860
to be this cruel.

1048
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:50,700
Is this the man

1049
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:51,900
who harassed you, mad'am?

1050
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:52,860
Yes.

1051
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:53,630
It's him.

1052
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:56,560
You should know him pretty well, right,

1053
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,860
Danial?

1054
00:48:58,250 --> 00:48:59,100
Save me, bro.

1055
00:48:59,390 --> 00:49:00,360
I work for Jack.

1056
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:01,360
We've met before.

1057
00:49:01,650 --> 00:49:03,230
You stole goods to sell privately.

1058
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,460
That broke gang rules.

1059
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,730
And you still have the nerve to say that?

1060
00:49:05,850 --> 00:49:06,860
Even if Jack showed up,

1061
00:49:07,490 --> 00:49:08,460
he couldn't save you.

1062
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:09,360
Officer,

1063
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,130
are you arresting him or fining him?

1064
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:12,330
Either way.

1065
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:13,800
Go ahead.

1066
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:15,860
I'm happy to cooperate.

1067
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:16,800
Take him away.

1068
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:17,200
Yes.

1069
00:49:17,690 --> 00:49:18,230
It was him.

1070
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,600
All the drugs are his.

1071
00:49:20,190 --> 00:49:21,730
You should arrest him, not me.

1072
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:22,760
Enough.

1073
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:24,960
Take them all away.

1074
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:26,160
Move.

1075
00:49:34,050 --> 00:49:35,760
Even though you're not the buyer,

1076
00:49:35,950 --> 00:49:36,660
you'll need to assist

1077
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:37,630
with a statement.

1078
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,060
As for you,

1079
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:41,030
your bar

1080
00:49:41,030 --> 00:49:41,900
needs to be shut down.

1081
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,030
Someone will contact you later.

1082
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:45,260
No problem.

1083
00:49:46,390 --> 00:49:47,460
You may leave now.

1084
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:49,530
Please keep your phone

1085
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:50,600
reachable at all times.

1086
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,560
That day, you stood me up.

1087
00:49:59,550 --> 00:50:01,730
I waited for you at the docks for a long time,

1088
00:50:02,190 --> 00:50:03,260
but you never came.

1089
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,330
That day, you stood me up.

1090
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,460
I waited for you at the docks,

1091
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,060
but you never came.

1092
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,160
I thought

1093
00:50:15,290 --> 00:50:16,430
you probably really wanted

1094
00:50:16,450 --> 00:50:17,760
to be a good cop.

1095
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:19,450
So when you looked at someone like me,

1096
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,060
it was like looking at trash.

1097
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:24,130
And back

1098
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:25,260
at the police academy,

1099
00:50:25,750 --> 00:50:27,560
you even accepted my love letter.

1100
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,060
That letter...

1101
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:30,830
Why did you never

1102
00:50:30,850 --> 00:50:31,800
reply to me?

1103
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:35,860
Madam,

1104
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:37,460
those are old things...

1105
00:50:38,050 --> 00:50:39,160
I can't be bothered to remember.

1106
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:40,460
I've forgotten them all.

1107
00:50:42,950 --> 00:50:43,800
Here he comes.

1108
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:45,750
This is the woman who ruined my business.

1109
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:46,460
Arrest her.

1110
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,160
Jack.

1111
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,530
This is a police station.

1112
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:50,860
Our matters

1113
00:50:50,950 --> 00:50:51,960
can be discussed later.

1114
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,160
But this bitch.

1115
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:54,400
Today she must give me an explanation.

1116
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:56,000
I won't let you take her.

1117
00:50:57,950 --> 00:50:59,730
The later it gets, the livelier it becomes.

1118
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:02,520
Oh.

1119
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,750
If this is how Luke told you

1120
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,160
to entertain guests,

1121
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:09,550
then I can tell you directly,

1122
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,100
the relationship between our two gangs

1123
00:51:11,690 --> 00:51:12,930
ends here.

1124
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,460
Ah.

1125
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:18,500
Sorry, madam.

1126
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,930
Were we late?

1127
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,000
You are…

1128
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:23,300
Mrs. Elaine, right?

1129
00:51:23,620 --> 00:51:25,060
I've heard

1130
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:27,400
you like dragging people into interrogation rooms.

1131
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,230
What a coincidence.

1132
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:30,930
I happen to have

1133
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,730
a clean room at home too.

1134
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:34,230
Want to try it?

1135
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:36,230
I'm sorry, madam.

1136
00:51:37,790 --> 00:51:38,460
Ah.

1137
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,730
Your subordinate

1138
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:41,930
secretly sold drugs.

1139
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,760
That already violates gang rules.

1140
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:46,360
On top of that, you embezzled the payment,

1141
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:47,730
causing major losses.

1142
00:51:48,250 --> 00:51:49,560
If Luke finds out,

1143
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,630
he'll never spare you.

1144
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:52,830
Madam,

1145
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:54,200
I was wrong.

1146
00:51:54,450 --> 00:51:55,260
Whatever you want me to do,

1147
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:56,230
I'll do it.

1148
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,360
Just don't tell Luke.

1149
00:51:57,360 --> 00:51:58,160
Please.

1150
00:51:58,920 --> 00:51:59,530
Madam,

1151
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:00,630
this way.

1152
00:52:09,050 --> 00:52:09,730
Madam,

1153
00:52:11,750 --> 00:52:12,700
are you okay?

1154
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,930
I'm fine, Daniel.

1155
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:17,130
As for Officer Louis,

1156
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,230
thank you for today.

1157
00:52:21,750 --> 00:52:22,630
And you.

1158
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:24,960
Don't forget what I told you.

1159
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,900
No matter what you and they are planning,

1160
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,930
as a police officer,

1161
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,200
I will never let you succeed.

1162
00:52:46,390 --> 00:52:47,500
I'll be watching.

1163
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:48,600
Danial,

1164
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:50,600
you're colluding with this cop, aren't you?

1165
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:51,630
Jack,

1166
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,300
you're exaggerating.

1167
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,900
I just wanted

1168
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:56,200
to see you get angry.

1169
00:52:57,190 --> 00:52:57,900
It's hilarious.

1170
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:00,360
Does it hurt?

1171
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:01,360
Danial, you bastard.

1172
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:03,700
Go back.

1173
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:18,100
Just now

1174
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:19,460
you were with…

1175
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,030
Oh.

1176
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:20,700
Oh.

1177
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,330
My whole body hurts.

1178
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:24,130
Feels like

1179
00:53:24,390 --> 00:53:25,530
my addiction is about to flare up.

1180
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,560
Can I go to your place tonight?

1181
00:53:28,390 --> 00:53:28,900
Okay?

1182
00:53:37,990 --> 00:53:39,590
That girl who chased Daniel back

1183
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:40,430
at the police academy.

1184
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,800
She actually became Mrs. Elaine.

1185
00:53:45,450 --> 00:53:46,060
Hey.

1186
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,030
I told you to relax, don't tense up.

1187
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,230
Like this.

1188
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:50,660
Yeah, don't tense up, just take it easy.

1189
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:51,300
Daniel,

1190
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,100
wait a second.

1191
00:53:55,390 --> 00:53:57,000
I told you not to come.

1192
00:53:57,190 --> 00:53:57,930
Why did you anyway?

1193
00:53:58,150 --> 00:53:59,530
You're practically getting sunburned.

1194
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:00,500
It's not hot at all.

1195
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,660
Don't forget what I told you,

1196
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,630
Mrs. Elaine.

1197
00:54:06,890 --> 00:54:07,490
She must be

1198
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:09,000
connected to that recent drug deal.

1199
00:54:09,490 --> 00:54:10,860
I have to keep investigating.

1200
00:54:13,790 --> 00:54:14,800
Why are you standing here?

1201
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:16,500
I have something to ask you.

1202
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:17,900
About you.

1203
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:20,130
You go first.

1204
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:21,930
That woman.

1205
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:24,100
She wrote me a love letter.

1206
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:25,200
Did you know that?

1207
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:26,530
Huh?

1208
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,130
What do you mean?

1209
00:54:29,020 --> 00:54:29,830
Back in school,

1210
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,400
we were always together,

1211
00:54:31,590 --> 00:54:32,200
but she said

1212
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,600
she wrote me a love letter

1213
00:54:33,990 --> 00:54:35,000
and I never

1214
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:36,260
received it.

1215
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:37,860
You

1216
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,330
received so many love letters,

1217
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,660
it wouldn't be strange to forget one, right?

1218
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:45,530
Hey.

1219
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:48,330
Is there anything you're hiding from me?

1220
00:54:57,550 --> 00:54:58,060
Louis.

1221
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:02,360
Today,

1222
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,450
Mrs. Elaine

1223
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:04,760
will be paying an official visit.

1224
00:55:05,550 --> 00:55:06,860
You and Jack must be present.

1225
00:55:13,790 --> 00:55:15,300
Later, take good care of

1226
00:55:15,690 --> 00:55:16,900
the new guests.

1227
00:55:16,950 --> 00:55:18,360
All the dishes I ordered,

1228
00:55:18,590 --> 00:55:19,400
no chili.

1229
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:20,630
Okay.

1230
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,130
Are you blind?

1231
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:26,730
Get out.

1232
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:27,660
Sorry.

1233
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:33,730
I never knew that some people

1234
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:34,760
don't eat spicy food.

1235
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:37,060
And how are you so

1236
00:55:37,060 --> 00:55:38,460
close with Mrs. Elaine?

1237
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:40,060
What?

1238
00:55:40,390 --> 00:55:41,160
So men are fine,

1239
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:42,760
and women too?

1240
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:46,300
Daniel,

1241
00:55:47,790 --> 00:55:49,530
don't get too carried away.

1242
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,690
Your godfather

1243
00:55:51,690 --> 00:55:53,160
won't be able to protect you for much longer.

1244
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:54,660
So you've

1245
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:56,730
known all along

1246
00:55:57,050 --> 00:55:58,360
that Luke has been backing me.

1247
00:55:58,650 --> 00:56:00,260
Just wait until I become the boss,

1248
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,100
you'll suffer for it.

1249
00:56:03,290 --> 00:56:04,500
Who gave you the right?

1250
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:07,470
Madam,

1251
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:09,060
did you know each other before?

1252
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:10,960
Yes.

1253
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,860
You know,

1254
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:17,230
the day I first arrived here,

1255
00:56:17,550 --> 00:56:18,750
your men tried

1256
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,260
to drag me into an interrogation room

1257
00:56:20,790 --> 00:56:22,600
and even threatened to kill me.

1258
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,700
Idiot.

1259
00:56:26,690 --> 00:56:27,760
Hurry up and apologize to the lady.

1260
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:28,660
Madam,

1261
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:29,760
I'm sorry.

1262
00:56:30,050 --> 00:56:30,900
It was my fault.

1263
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,200
Luke,

1264
00:56:34,050 --> 00:56:35,400
if I were you,

1265
00:56:36,090 --> 00:56:37,460
I wouldn't keep

1266
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:39,530
such an idiot around.

1267
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:42,100
Luckily,

1268
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:44,000
you still have Daniel.

1269
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,650
At least he can make up

1270
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:48,030
for some of the losses that idiot caused.

1271
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:49,860
I've always treated Daniel

1272
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:52,300
like my own

1273
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,060
son.

1274
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:57,660
Wow.

1275
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,030
Jack got slapped hard,

1276
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:00,600
and Luke even kicked him afterward.

1277
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,500
Serves him right.

1278
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,160
Daring to go against the boss like that.

1279
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:04,630
He probably won't have the face to show up.

1280
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,630
Daniel,

1281
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,130
I'm leaving now.

1282
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,830
Can you walk me out?

1283
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:12,200
Sure.

1284
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:15,900
Hey, Danial.

1285
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,360
Danial.

1286
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,100
Sit, sit, sit.

1287
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,260
Oh right, Danial,

1288
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:22,330
I heard you're going to

1289
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:23,260
take over as the boss.

1290
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:24,330
Is that true, bro?

1291
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:27,530
If you keep spreading that,

1292
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:29,030
it might

1293
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:31,630
actually come true.

1294
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:33,530
Danial, don't forget about me.

1295
00:57:33,870 --> 00:57:34,610
Okay.

1296
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,830
The successor, huh?

1297
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:42,930
Daniel,

1298
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,660
your good days are numbered.

1299
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,530
Daniel.

1300
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:00,530
Miss.

1301
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:01,200
Oh.

1302
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:02,530
No, wait.

1303
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:04,000
Madam.

1304
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:06,230
Long time no see.

1305
00:58:07,020 --> 00:58:07,830
Are you okay?

1306
00:58:08,320 --> 00:58:09,130
Of course I am.

1307
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,460
Ouch.

1308
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:11,930
It's been years.

1309
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,430
You've changed so much.

1310
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:15,560
That day at the docks,

1311
00:58:15,850 --> 00:58:17,360
I waited for you for a long time,

1312
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,130
but you never came.

1313
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:20,830
And also,

1314
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,560
that love letter.

1315
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:23,530
Why wouldn't you

1316
00:58:23,530 --> 00:58:24,430
write back to me?

1317
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:26,760
Madam,

1318
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:28,600
I think

1319
00:58:29,950 --> 00:58:30,830
what's between us

1320
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:32,830
is impossible.

1321
00:58:34,950 --> 00:58:36,730
Is that so?

1322
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:39,160
Or is it that

1323
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,100
you're actually

1324
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,830
secretly in love

1325
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,760
with that police officer?

1326
00:58:48,620 --> 00:58:49,760
Do you like him?

1327
00:59:00,690 --> 00:59:01,500
Yes.

1328
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,600
I like him

1329
00:59:04,590 --> 00:59:05,460
very much.

1330
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:08,300
Then

1331
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:09,660
I hope

1332
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:11,200
you won't regret

1333
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:12,330
what you just said.

1334
00:59:15,790 --> 00:59:16,960
Madam, please get in the car.

1335
00:59:30,490 --> 00:59:32,100
Grandma fell and broke a bone.

1336
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:33,100
I took a long leave

1337
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:34,300
to stay at her place for a while.

1338
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,200
I won't be able to come see you during this time.

1339
00:59:49,220 --> 00:59:50,100
Hello, Grandma.

1340
00:59:50,290 --> 00:59:51,430
Oh, you're here.

1341
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,330
Sit, sit.

1342
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,100
Sit down.

1343
00:59:55,990 --> 00:59:57,400
You bought so many things.

1344
00:59:57,820 --> 00:59:59,560
Who could possibly eat all this?

1345
01:00:00,390 --> 01:00:01,400
It's not that much,

1346
01:00:01,490 --> 01:00:03,000
just some supplements.

1347
01:00:03,090 --> 01:00:03,500
Oh dear.

1348
01:00:04,290 --> 01:00:05,960
I forgot to buy your favorite

1349
01:00:05,990 --> 01:00:07,200
nine-layer cake from that shop.

1350
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:09,600
Oh my,

1351
01:00:09,890 --> 01:00:11,700
then wasn't this trip for nothing?

1352
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,800
Huh.

1353
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:14,560
In Grandma's eyes,

1354
01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:15,600
are pastries more important than me?

1355
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:20,360
I'm here, Grandma.

1356
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:22,100
Oh, my good boy.

1357
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,560
For Grandma?

1358
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:26,060
Are you serious?

1359
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,000
Grandma, do you still remember me?

1360
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:37,230
Of course I do.

1361
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,260
He only ever brought one person

1362
01:00:39,490 --> 01:00:41,460
back to this house. You.

1363
01:00:42,020 --> 01:00:43,660
Louis once told me

1364
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:44,530
that you, Grandma,

1365
01:00:44,590 --> 01:00:46,100
really love the pastries from that shop,

1366
01:00:46,250 --> 01:00:47,360
especially the nine-layer cake.

1367
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:48,160
So I bought

1368
01:00:48,190 --> 01:00:49,430
you lots.

1369
01:00:50,390 --> 01:00:51,830
After all these years,

1370
01:00:52,190 --> 01:00:53,060
you still remember

1371
01:00:53,090 --> 01:00:55,600
everything Louis

1372
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,460
ever said?

1373
01:00:58,890 --> 01:00:59,800
I won't forget.

1374
01:01:02,420 --> 01:01:03,800
It was the same back then,

1375
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:05,360
and it's still the same now.

1376
01:01:05,690 --> 01:01:07,000
Back then, you two

1377
01:01:07,220 --> 01:01:08,900
slept in the same bed

1378
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,900
and it's still the same now.

1379
01:01:11,190 --> 01:01:12,930
Roll around however you like,

1380
01:01:13,390 --> 01:01:15,560
it's fine. The bed is big enough.

1381
01:01:15,620 --> 01:01:16,330
Grandma,

1382
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,530
what are you talking about?

1383
01:01:18,490 --> 01:01:19,500
Alright, alright,

1384
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:20,960
I won't say any more.

1385
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:23,300
You two just keep rolling around.

1386
01:01:24,120 --> 01:01:24,630
Oh.

1387
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,830
Carry on chatting.

1388
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:27,860
Hahaha.

1389
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:30,850
I'm off.

1390
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:37,130
Hey.

1391
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:38,260
What are you doing?

1392
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:39,000
Let go.

1393
01:01:39,390 --> 01:01:39,860
I just

1394
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:41,200
wanted to try it

1395
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:43,230
to see if this bed really is big enough to roll around.

1396
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:44,930
Hey.

1397
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:50,930
Hey.

1398
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:53,000
That's enough.

1399
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:55,500
It's broad daylight.

1400
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:56,530
Besides,

1401
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:58,800
you're not having withdrawal symptoms.

1402
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:00,830
Then can't it be

1403
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:02,160
because I'm obsessed with you?

1404
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:05,530
In that case,

1405
01:02:05,820 --> 01:02:06,930
we can do it at night instead.

1406
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:08,600
You're insane.

1407
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:09,360
Get out.

1408
01:02:09,650 --> 01:02:10,060
Come on.

1409
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:14,460
Come.

1410
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:17,700
I'll take you to do something

1411
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:19,300
even more exciting than this.

1412
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:24,700
Keep up.

1413
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:37,370
This

1414
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:38,000
is it?

1415
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:39,800
Your idea of something exciting?

1416
01:02:40,920 --> 01:02:42,400
Thanks for running with me.

1417
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,300
No.

1418
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,430
I should be thanking you.

1419
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,400
It's been a long time

1420
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:48,830
since I've gone for a run like this.

1421
01:02:50,390 --> 01:02:51,300
Do you remember?

1422
01:02:51,420 --> 01:02:52,530
That time

1423
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,960
at the color sports day.

1424
01:02:54,920 --> 01:02:55,600
You mean

1425
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,400
the time I got first place

1426
01:02:58,690 --> 01:02:59,800
and someone else came second?

1427
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:02,760
If I remember correctly,

1428
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:04,430
I've never lost to anyone.

1429
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:07,730
Really, never lost?

1430
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:08,730
Yes.

1431
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,760
I still have the medal at home.

1432
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,500
I'll show it to you later.

1433
01:03:19,820 --> 01:03:20,400
Help me grab that.

1434
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:23,500
What is it?

1435
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:24,200
Just some things

1436
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:26,000
from our school days.

1437
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:27,700
Let me take a look.

1438
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:28,800
Hey, don't open it.

1439
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,430
“To my dear Daniel.”

1440
01:03:31,990 --> 01:03:33,100
From Elaine.

1441
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:39,700
“To my dear Daniel.”

1442
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,500
From Elaine.

1443
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:42,400
Hey.

1444
01:03:43,220 --> 01:03:44,260
So it really was you.

1445
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:45,700
You hid Elaine's

1446
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:46,630
love letter.

1447
01:03:46,630 --> 01:03:46,960
Give me.

1448
01:03:47,820 --> 01:03:48,600
What did she write inside?

1449
01:03:49,620 --> 01:03:50,260
I don't know.

1450
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:51,130
Hmph.

1451
01:03:55,420 --> 01:03:56,700
Why didn't you tell me?

1452
01:03:57,420 --> 01:03:58,500
It's so heavy, get off me.

1453
01:03:59,650 --> 01:04:00,130
Hmph.

1454
01:04:00,650 --> 01:04:02,360
I didn't want you getting close to Elaine.

1455
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:04,260
If she were

1456
01:04:04,490 --> 01:04:05,600
just an ordinary person,

1457
01:04:05,690 --> 01:04:06,600
that would be one thing,

1458
01:04:07,890 --> 01:04:08,800
but she…

1459
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:10,960
I wanted a real reason.

1460
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,500
I'm sorry.

1461
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:15,300
I was being

1462
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,360
a bit selfish.

1463
01:04:18,650 --> 01:04:19,060
Someone

1464
01:04:22,490 --> 01:04:24,530
as decisive as you, a police officer...

1465
01:04:26,390 --> 01:04:26,960
Why didn't you dare

1466
01:04:27,020 --> 01:04:28,130
tell me the truth?

1467
01:04:28,790 --> 01:04:29,600
I like you.

1468
01:04:31,390 --> 01:04:32,200
What did you say?

1469
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:34,330
I...

1470
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:37,060
I've never liked anyone before.

1471
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,300
You were

1472
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:40,360
the first,

1473
01:04:40,620 --> 01:04:41,260
and

1474
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,130
the only one I've ever liked.

1475
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:46,860
In that case,

1476
01:04:48,550 --> 01:04:50,100
I'm your first love, right?

1477
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,500
Do you really have to say something so cheesy?

1478
01:05:08,390 --> 01:05:09,400
No need to apologize.

1479
01:05:11,450 --> 01:05:13,400
Even without Elaine's letter,

1480
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:15,930
I

1481
01:05:16,220 --> 01:05:17,400
would still choose you first.

1482
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:25,860
My turn.

1483
01:05:31,250 --> 01:05:31,860
Wait.

1484
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:34,860
I've wanted to do this for a long time.

1485
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,000
Can you hold on?

1486
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:55,600
Yes.

1487
01:05:56,020 --> 01:05:56,700
I can.

1488
01:05:57,600 --> 01:05:58,150
But

1489
01:05:58,590 --> 01:05:59,600
it feels a little strange.

1490
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:27,960
You're awake.

1491
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:29,400
I've been calling you for a while.

1492
01:06:30,550 --> 01:06:31,500
Let's go eat.

1493
01:06:31,950 --> 01:06:32,760
You go first.

1494
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:33,600
I'll come in a bit.

1495
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:35,200
Okay.

1496
01:06:49,790 --> 01:06:50,500
Come sit here.

1497
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:56,530
Hurry up.

1498
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:57,410
Don't be stubborn.

1499
01:07:05,950 --> 01:07:06,700
Grandma.

1500
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:07,920
It's okay, it's okay.

1501
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:09,530
Grandma will sit by herself.

1502
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,500
Daniel,

1503
01:07:12,590 --> 01:07:14,000
eat more.

1504
01:07:14,090 --> 01:07:16,200
It'll help you recover.

1505
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,200
Thank you, Grandma.

1506
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:23,130
I noticed it long ago.

1507
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:25,060
There was something

1508
01:07:25,290 --> 01:07:26,800
a bit off between

1509
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,260
you two.

1510
01:07:30,220 --> 01:07:31,460
Grandma.

1511
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,260
Why be shy in front of Grandma?

1512
01:07:40,950 --> 01:07:42,560
These are Teacher Tom's class notes.

1513
01:07:42,620 --> 01:07:43,700
Stop skipping classes.

1514
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,260
And I'm taking your soda.

1515
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:46,500
Drink water instead.

1516
01:07:47,850 --> 01:07:48,630
If Grandma had been

1517
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:50,000
a detective when she was young,

1518
01:07:50,350 --> 01:07:51,630
she would've been famous.

1519
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:54,100
Actually, I knew it long ago.

1520
01:07:54,750 --> 01:07:55,560
Louis has had

1521
01:07:55,750 --> 01:07:57,900
a crush on me since school days.

1522
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:58,930
But now,

1523
01:07:59,020 --> 01:07:59,900
I think Louis

1524
01:07:59,990 --> 01:08:01,460
likes me even more than before,

1525
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,930
because the two of us

1526
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:05,000
feel the same way,

1527
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:05,960
right?

1528
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:06,560
Oh dear.

1529
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,060
Grandma, please stop exposing my past.

1530
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,960
Alright, alright, I won't say any more.

1531
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:16,760
Grandma's

1532
01:08:16,820 --> 01:08:18,530
much better now.

1533
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,330
You two

1534
01:08:20,690 --> 01:08:23,560
go take care of your own things.

1535
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,460
And don't forget.

1536
01:08:27,820 --> 01:08:30,130
Go together holding hands.

1537
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:40,130
What are you doing?

1538
01:08:43,350 --> 01:08:44,460
Looking at the stars.

1539
01:08:46,850 --> 01:08:47,330
I can't

1540
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:49,360
even remember

1541
01:08:50,190 --> 01:08:52,330
the last time I saw

1542
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:53,430
so many stars.

1543
01:08:55,150 --> 01:08:56,830
But I remember

1544
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,160
it was with you.

1545
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:00,830
At the police academy, right?

1546
01:09:02,450 --> 01:09:03,060
Yes.

1547
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,460
I remember back then

1548
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:08,230
I got punished

1549
01:09:08,590 --> 01:09:10,000
and had to run laps on the field.

1550
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:11,800
That was the only time

1551
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,360
you were punished with me.

1552
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:16,460
Yeah.

1553
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,460
Back then,

1554
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:21,160
Sean was still at the academy

1555
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,160
as an instructor, right?

1556
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:23,600
Yes.

1557
01:09:24,190 --> 01:09:24,930
He was

1558
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:26,260
really strict then.

1559
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,060
I was just one minute late

1560
01:09:29,520 --> 01:09:30,660
and got punished.

1561
01:09:34,390 --> 01:09:34,860
Can you

1562
01:09:35,490 --> 01:09:36,630
become who you used to be again?

1563
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:41,660
What?

1564
01:09:45,290 --> 01:09:46,100
Nothing.

1565
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:47,860
Let's go.

1566
01:09:58,250 --> 01:09:59,100
I'm sorry.

1567
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:00,400
I can't do it.

1568
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:03,230
What are you looking for?

1569
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:04,530
Just

1570
01:10:04,690 --> 01:10:05,600
your thing.

1571
01:10:14,150 --> 01:10:15,300
A Buddhist amulet?

1572
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:17,930
This was blessed by a high monk.

1573
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:19,330
I heard

1574
01:10:19,490 --> 01:10:20,130
this model

1575
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:21,330
is bulletproof.

1576
01:10:23,590 --> 01:10:24,000
Hey.

1577
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:25,900
When did a cop like you

1578
01:10:26,150 --> 01:10:27,460
start believing in this stuff?

1579
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:31,000
Hey.

1580
01:10:31,390 --> 01:10:33,000
Are you really that afraid I'll die?

1581
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:35,630
For someone like you,

1582
01:10:36,650 --> 01:10:38,030
dying wouldn't be much of a pity.

1583
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:51,930
Hey.

1584
01:10:58,920 --> 01:10:59,800
Shall we continue?

1585
01:11:01,550 --> 01:11:02,330
Of course.

1586
01:11:13,490 --> 01:11:14,600
Louis.

1587
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:18,460
Louis, sweetheart,

1588
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:19,930
time to get up.

1589
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:22,160
Time to get up, baby.

1590
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,400
What about Daniel, Grandma?

1591
01:11:26,720 --> 01:11:27,060
Oh,

1592
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:29,200
he went out early this morning.

1593
01:11:29,450 --> 01:11:31,230
Then why didn't you go together?

1594
01:11:38,990 --> 01:11:39,460
Hey.

1595
01:11:43,790 --> 01:11:44,260
He probably

1596
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,130
had something to do, Grandma.

1597
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:47,900
Then let's go.

1598
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:48,890
Take a shower

1599
01:11:48,890 --> 01:11:50,330
and find something to eat.

1600
01:11:50,650 --> 01:11:51,130
Okay.

1601
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:02,260
Is Sean not around, Sergeant?

1602
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:03,330
Yes.

1603
01:12:03,950 --> 01:12:05,260
I heard he went out.

1604
01:12:05,260 --> 01:12:05,860
No idea

1605
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:07,030
to see whom.

1606
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:10,400
To see whom?

1607
01:12:10,990 --> 01:12:11,460
Yes.

1608
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:15,000
Notify the police team immediately.

1609
01:12:15,050 --> 01:12:15,860
I'll head there first.

1610
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:16,700
Send you the address later.

1611
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:17,730
Okay, okay.

1612
01:12:19,350 --> 01:12:20,000
Daniel.

1613
01:12:20,150 --> 01:12:20,830
Deal with him.

1614
01:12:21,690 --> 01:12:22,400
Put the gun down.

1615
01:12:26,950 --> 01:12:27,400
Boss!

1616
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:28,130
Boss!

1617
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:30,030
Take Daniel away.

1618
01:12:35,420 --> 01:12:36,200
Get in, boss.

1619
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:39,860
Crime scene, requesting backup.

1620
01:12:40,150 --> 01:12:41,160
Daniel.

1621
01:12:46,420 --> 01:12:47,200
Looks like

1622
01:12:47,790 --> 01:12:49,200
this thing really works.

1623
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,560
It really saved your life.

1624
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,430
Take good care of yourself.

1625
01:12:55,550 --> 01:12:57,160
From now on, you're my successor.

1626
01:13:12,420 --> 01:13:13,660
This is my husband,

1627
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:14,760
Aman.

1628
01:13:15,150 --> 01:13:16,230
The drug lord you've been

1629
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:17,430
wanting to meet.

1630
01:13:18,250 --> 01:13:19,630
This is Daniel,

1631
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:21,030
my heir.

1632
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:24,100
He killed Sean.

1633
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:26,000
The police chief

1634
01:13:26,690 --> 01:13:27,600
who was always

1635
01:13:27,690 --> 01:13:28,560
causing us trouble.

1636
01:13:29,720 --> 01:13:31,030
That's why

1637
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:32,630
I brought him to meet you today.

1638
01:13:35,220 --> 01:13:36,230
It's an honor

1639
01:13:36,490 --> 01:13:37,200
to meet you.

1640
01:13:38,290 --> 01:13:38,900
Please, sit.

1641
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:45,430
Daniel,

1642
01:13:46,350 --> 01:13:48,060
you've rendered us great service.

1643
01:13:49,390 --> 01:13:50,420
In that case,

1644
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:51,460
we should have a drink.

1645
01:13:51,820 --> 01:13:52,660
Hahaha.

1646
01:13:53,590 --> 01:13:54,130
Come.

1647
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:55,060
Cheers.

1648
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:56,760
Haha.

1649
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:58,330
At first, I thought Daniel

1650
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,760
was an undercover cop,

1651
01:14:00,390 --> 01:14:02,100
but today I see he isn't.

1652
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:04,860
Let this be an apology.

1653
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,960
I'll pour you another drink

1654
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:08,300
as compensation.

1655
01:14:10,650 --> 01:14:12,260
It's nothing, madam.

1656
01:14:14,850 --> 01:14:15,430
Thank you.

1657
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,400
Oh.

1658
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,530
Since we've had drinks,

1659
01:14:20,590 --> 01:14:21,400
how about

1660
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,160
some food to go with it?

1661
01:14:26,720 --> 01:14:27,930
Coming.

1662
01:14:28,490 --> 01:14:29,960
The hot dishes are ready.

1663
01:14:35,190 --> 01:14:37,230
Jack, why are you here?

1664
01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:40,500
He came willingly.

1665
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:42,700
He's not just following you.

1666
01:14:43,620 --> 01:14:45,430
He's working for me too.

1667
01:15:01,920 --> 01:15:03,130
Looks like someone here

1668
01:15:03,390 --> 01:15:04,700
is trying to

1669
01:15:04,720 --> 01:15:05,990
dress a cat up

1670
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:07,700
as a mouse, right, Luke?

1671
01:15:11,050 --> 01:15:12,660
Aren't you going to explain, Daniel?

1672
01:15:13,190 --> 01:15:13,660
No.

1673
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:15,060
Officer Daniel.

1674
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:18,860
What do you want me to explain?

1675
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:21,560
He's my lover.

1676
01:15:23,020 --> 01:15:24,430
When we get intimate,

1677
01:15:24,950 --> 01:15:26,120
you're eavesdropping too,

1678
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:26,560
aren't you?

1679
01:15:28,250 --> 01:15:30,030
Then why do you two meet so often?

1680
01:15:30,190 --> 01:15:31,030
It's not

1681
01:15:31,150 --> 01:15:32,160
just that, is it?

1682
01:15:33,450 --> 01:15:35,060
There's nothing

1683
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:36,030
between us.

1684
01:15:36,150 --> 01:15:37,160
It's you

1685
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:39,530
who's been following us.

1686
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:41,700
Were you trying to frame us

1687
01:15:42,890 --> 01:15:43,830
from the very beginning?

1688
01:15:44,390 --> 01:15:45,630
Frame you?

1689
01:15:46,650 --> 01:15:47,730
You think I'm framing you?

1690
01:15:47,820 --> 01:15:49,260
Do you want to know what your lover

1691
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:50,930
has been telling me?

1692
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:56,260
Go.

1693
01:16:00,400 --> 01:16:01,120
Sit down.

1694
01:16:03,150 --> 01:16:04,530
Go on.

1695
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:06,530
Tell us what you just told me.

1696
01:16:13,220 --> 01:16:15,260
Who are you? What's your name?

1697
01:16:17,350 --> 01:16:18,260
I'm a police officer.

1698
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,760
My name is Louis.

1699
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:23,460
My mission is

1700
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:27,860
to dismantle your drug trafficking network

1701
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:31,160
and arrest the real drug lord.

1702
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:38,360
One last question.s

1703
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:40,200
You.

1704
01:16:40,490 --> 01:16:41,460
Daniel.

1705
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:43,330
What is your relationship?

1706
01:16:48,190 --> 01:16:49,260
I'm his lover.

1707
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:52,900
That's not what you said just now.

1708
01:16:58,050 --> 01:16:59,260
He's an undercover cop.

1709
01:17:02,190 --> 01:17:03,660
I was the one who contacted him first.

1710
01:17:06,150 --> 01:17:07,100
He's an undercover cop.

1711
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:10,630
We went to the police academy together.

1712
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:12,560
I know him.

1713
01:17:14,650 --> 01:17:15,660
His expulsion

1714
01:17:16,290 --> 01:17:17,660
was just part of the arrangement.

1715
01:17:18,050 --> 01:17:19,730
He and I have the same goal

1716
01:17:21,920 --> 01:17:22,830
to completely destroy

1717
01:17:23,190 --> 01:17:24,060
your organization.

1718
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:27,060
Then that photo.

1719
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:28,960
What was that?

1720
01:17:29,290 --> 01:17:30,400
Daniel just said

1721
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:31,960
it was just sex.

1722
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:33,130
Officer,

1723
01:17:33,150 --> 01:17:34,130
what does that mean?

1724
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:35,700
I contacted him for work,

1725
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:39,200
but I was exposed.

1726
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:41,400
So

1727
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:42,930
I had to pretend to be his lover

1728
01:17:45,820 --> 01:17:46,500
so that

1729
01:17:46,790 --> 01:17:47,730
he could keep in contact with me.

1730
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:49,430
Being a cop really

1731
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:50,530
is impressive.

1732
01:17:51,220 --> 01:17:51,930
Sleeping

1733
01:17:52,190 --> 01:17:53,500
with a man.

1734
01:17:53,620 --> 01:17:55,230
That's something else, Officer.

1735
01:18:05,790 --> 01:18:06,600
Louis,

1736
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:10,000
is that all you're capable of?

1737
01:18:11,890 --> 01:18:13,400
I must apologize

1738
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:15,830
for bringing

1739
01:18:16,590 --> 01:18:18,800
private matters into today's dinner.

1740
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:20,430
What do you mean?

1741
01:18:22,150 --> 01:18:23,600
I mean

1742
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:26,830
this unwanted kid

1743
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:30,730
was arranged to be my temporary lover.

1744
01:18:31,950 --> 01:18:33,500
And after I killed Sean,

1745
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,630
who could protect him,

1746
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:37,360
I kicked him aside.

1747
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:40,200
That's why he used such a stupid method

1748
01:18:41,190 --> 01:18:42,330
to get revenge on me.

1749
01:18:43,450 --> 01:18:43,930
Hmph.

1750
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:45,200
Useless trash.

1751
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:46,430
In that case, it's simple.

1752
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:48,830
If you're really innocent,

1753
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:50,400
kill him.

1754
01:18:51,750 --> 01:18:52,860
Then we'll know who's right and wrong.

1755
01:18:53,390 --> 01:18:54,000
Alright.

1756
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:09,730
Hey.

1757
01:19:12,650 --> 01:19:13,060
Ah.

1758
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:46,460
Hey.

1759
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:48,130
Daniel,

1760
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,990
come to

1761
01:19:49,990 --> 01:19:50,800
my office tomorrow.

1762
01:19:52,020 --> 01:19:54,330
I have something important to discuss with you.

1763
01:19:56,620 --> 01:19:57,730
This is information my people

1764
01:19:58,350 --> 01:19:59,930
at the police station

1765
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:00,930
dug up.

1766
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:04,030
Compared with

1767
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:05,460
the photos Jack used to frame me,

1768
01:20:06,350 --> 01:20:07,460
I think

1769
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:09,030
this evidence

1770
01:20:09,050 --> 01:20:10,030
tells the truth better.

1771
01:20:23,320 --> 01:20:23,930
Daniel,

1772
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,030
you've

1773
01:20:26,050 --> 01:20:27,460
killed a cop before.

1774
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,130
Killing one more

1775
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:30,500
makes no difference.

1776
01:20:32,290 --> 01:20:33,500
Kill him and

1777
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:35,830
show me your loyalty.

1778
01:20:37,520 --> 01:20:38,230
Okay.

1779
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,460
Bastard.

1780
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:44,860
Trash.

1781
01:20:46,490 --> 01:20:47,100
Shoot.

1782
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:48,800
Shoot me dead.

1783
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:58,730
Daniel,

1784
01:20:59,250 --> 01:21:00,130
do you even know

1785
01:21:00,130 --> 01:21:01,230
what you're doing?

1786
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:02,730
I'm just

1787
01:21:04,050 --> 01:21:05,030
helping you clean up

1788
01:21:05,390 --> 01:21:06,400
a barking animal,

1789
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:07,700
that's all.

1790
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,800
I think someone like you

1791
01:21:10,620 --> 01:21:12,060
could find ten or even a hundred

1792
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:13,300
husbands without any trouble.

1793
01:21:13,550 --> 01:21:14,460
Ms. Elaine,

1794
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:15,930
oh.

1795
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,430
or should I call you

1796
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:20,060
Mrs. Peter?

1797
01:21:22,890 --> 01:21:24,320
It wasn't a waste

1798
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:25,660
that I once loved you.

1799
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:27,860
Looks like

1800
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,230
some things can't be hidden forever.

1801
01:21:30,650 --> 01:21:31,560
I think

1802
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:33,660
now

1803
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:36,730
you may have to rely

1804
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,020
on our gang

1805
01:21:38,020 --> 01:21:39,230
to help you,

1806
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:41,360
because outside

1807
01:21:42,820 --> 01:21:44,260
there are cops everywhere.

1808
01:21:46,150 --> 01:21:46,930
But no matter what,

1809
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:49,690
he is still

1810
01:21:49,690 --> 01:21:51,130
my legal husband.

1811
01:21:51,850 --> 01:21:53,460
You killed my man.

1812
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,760
How do you plan to compensate?

1813
01:21:56,790 --> 01:21:58,000
Or

1814
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,430
will you repay it with yourself?

1815
01:22:05,490 --> 01:22:08,030
If as a husband

1816
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:10,530
I may not be qualified,

1817
01:22:11,420 --> 01:22:12,760
but

1818
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,960
as someone who truly understands you,

1819
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,430
why don't you give it a try?

1820
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:20,200
Enough, enough.

1821
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:21,830
Today we've invited Officer Louis

1822
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,060
to be our guest.

1823
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:25,760
Why don't we first

1824
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,030
have him join us for a drink?

1825
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:35,830
Luke,

1826
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:37,730
there's no poison

1827
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:39,660
in this glass, right?

1828
01:22:44,620 --> 01:22:45,330
This glass.

1829
01:22:45,820 --> 01:22:47,000
Are you drinking it or not?

1830
01:22:47,250 --> 01:22:47,600
Hey,

1831
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,630
don't scare my new favorite.

1832
01:22:52,420 --> 01:22:53,760
I have a new way

1833
01:22:54,150 --> 01:22:55,260
to clear

1834
01:22:55,350 --> 01:22:57,560
the suspicions about Daniel.

1835
01:22:59,490 --> 01:23:00,830
Are you going to drink it yourself,

1836
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,030
or

1837
01:23:02,420 --> 01:23:04,030
let Officer Louis drink it?

1838
01:23:05,050 --> 01:23:05,860
What should we do?

1839
01:23:07,220 --> 01:23:08,030
Daniel,

1840
01:23:08,950 --> 01:23:10,630
let your lover drink it.

1841
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,200
It's not time yet.

1842
01:23:12,590 --> 01:23:14,330
I can't let Daniel be exposed.

1843
01:23:15,090 --> 01:23:16,030
I still need to stall for time

1844
01:23:16,050 --> 01:23:16,960
to cooperate with the plan.

1845
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,330
I can't worry about that now.

1846
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:21,530
Hey, Louis, don't drink it.

1847
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:23,230
There's poison in the wine.

1848
01:23:26,290 --> 01:23:27,000
Daniel,

1849
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:27,960
look.

1850
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:30,200
This cop

1851
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:31,630
is willing to

1852
01:23:32,390 --> 01:23:33,130
risk his life for you.

1853
01:23:33,920 --> 01:23:34,530
And look at you.

1854
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:36,460
You've truly fallen for him too.

1855
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:39,100
To be honest,

1856
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,530
I really regret what happened today.

1857
01:23:43,050 --> 01:23:43,600
Hey,

1858
01:23:43,890 --> 01:23:44,800
kill him.

1859
01:23:46,350 --> 01:23:47,200
Don't move.

1860
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:50,930
Hey.

1861
01:23:51,290 --> 01:23:52,130
Kill him.

1862
01:23:56,220 --> 01:23:57,700
Hey, why won't the gun fire?

1863
01:23:58,120 --> 01:23:58,930
Mine won't fire either.

1864
01:23:59,390 --> 01:24:00,030
What the hell?

1865
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:05,800
Well.

1866
01:24:05,820 --> 01:24:07,200
Actually,

1867
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,400
all the guns I prepared today

1868
01:24:10,090 --> 01:24:11,430
were faulty

1869
01:24:12,790 --> 01:24:14,200
from the very beginning.

1870
01:24:15,020 --> 01:24:16,000
Impossible.

1871
01:24:21,020 --> 01:24:22,130
Want to try a real one?

1872
01:24:22,690 --> 01:24:23,530
Grab that cop.

1873
01:24:27,090 --> 01:24:27,930
Haven't you thought it?

1874
01:24:28,220 --> 01:24:29,730
Your body right now

1875
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,300
is full of poison.

1876
01:24:31,420 --> 01:24:32,700
Do you really think

1877
01:24:32,720 --> 01:24:34,000
you can go back to being normal?

1878
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,600
You're right

1879
01:24:36,490 --> 01:24:36,900
about that.

1880
01:24:38,020 --> 01:24:38,900
Calm down.

1881
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:40,730
After all, we're brothers.

1882
01:24:40,890 --> 01:24:42,400
You like a cop.

1883
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:43,360
So be it.

1884
01:24:44,290 --> 01:24:45,100
I'll give you status,

1885
01:24:45,320 --> 01:24:46,060
give you everything,

1886
01:24:46,420 --> 01:24:47,630
and that cop

1887
01:24:48,290 --> 01:24:49,500
will naturally follow you.

1888
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,730
Do you remember?

1889
01:24:53,220 --> 01:24:55,100
When you made me try that drug back then,

1890
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:57,000
you already suspected

1891
01:24:57,290 --> 01:24:58,700
I was an undercover cop.

1892
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:01,830
After I tried that damn drug,

1893
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,200
my body was never the same.

1894
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:06,900
Whether I can go back to being a cop, I don't even know.

1895
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,830
So I have absolutely no reason

1896
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:11,700
to keep you alive.

1897
01:25:12,220 --> 01:25:13,460
If you really want to kill me,

1898
01:25:14,020 --> 01:25:15,320
I'll have someone

1899
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:15,930
kill that cop.

1900
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:17,420
Daniel

1901
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,860
was the best cadet of that class.

1902
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:22,130
Do you really think you can threaten him?

1903
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,530
Next time, I'll definitely beat you.

1904
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,020
And I'll become

1905
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:27,000
a better cop than you.

1906
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,430
I'll be waiting.

1907
01:25:36,620 --> 01:25:37,730
What are you trying to do?

1908
01:25:38,350 --> 01:25:39,600
Have your people leave.

1909
01:25:41,850 --> 01:25:42,300
Stop.

1910
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:43,900
Let that cop go.

1911
01:25:47,750 --> 01:25:48,660
Do you know

1912
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:50,900
no undercover

1913
01:25:51,450 --> 01:25:53,360
can stay hidden by my side for this long?

1914
01:25:54,790 --> 01:25:55,700
You think

1915
01:25:56,650 --> 01:25:58,300
you've been disguising yourself well.

1916
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:00,160
You think

1917
01:26:00,620 --> 01:26:02,330
you've hidden your identity.

1918
01:26:04,220 --> 01:26:05,230
Let me tell you.

1919
01:26:05,720 --> 01:26:07,230
Deep down inside,

1920
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:09,230
we're actually no different.

1921
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,060
You're wrong.

1922
01:26:13,650 --> 01:26:15,260
All these years,

1923
01:26:16,290 --> 01:26:17,460
I've been thinking

1924
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:20,400
if the truth were exposed,

1925
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:22,400
what way

1926
01:26:22,420 --> 01:26:23,530
I would die at your hands.

1927
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:24,660
But there's one thing

1928
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:26,300
I never once thought of...

1929
01:26:27,190 --> 01:26:28,260
Giving up.

1930
01:26:38,350 --> 01:26:39,360
If it weren't for you,

1931
01:26:39,550 --> 01:26:41,300
Daniel would have been mine long ago.

1932
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:43,330
Without me,

1933
01:26:44,450 --> 01:26:45,860
he wouldn't have fallen for you either.

1934
01:26:46,990 --> 01:26:47,700
Wake up.

1935
01:26:48,890 --> 01:26:50,200
Cops and criminals

1936
01:26:51,150 --> 01:26:52,160
can never be together.

1937
01:26:53,690 --> 01:26:54,700
What nonsense?

1938
01:26:55,090 --> 01:26:56,100
Pure nonsense.

1939
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,300
Killing me

1940
01:26:58,350 --> 01:26:59,200
won't change anything.

1941
01:27:00,450 --> 01:27:02,160
Fate was decided long ago.

1942
01:27:02,420 --> 01:27:03,500
You are bound to lose.

1943
01:27:06,820 --> 01:27:08,500
You're the one who miscalculated.

1944
01:27:11,490 --> 01:27:12,330
Half an hour ago,

1945
01:27:12,350 --> 01:27:13,360
the police already seized

1946
01:27:13,360 --> 01:27:14,760
all of your goods and took

1947
01:27:16,250 --> 01:27:16,830
everything away.

1948
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:18,230
Was this all part of your plan?

1949
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:19,100
Put the knife down.

1950
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:19,630
Come here.

1951
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:21,530
Sean, you bastard.

1952
01:27:22,050 --> 01:27:23,230
You're still alive?

1953
01:27:24,120 --> 01:27:24,930
Daniel,

1954
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:26,600
bastard.

1955
01:27:27,020 --> 01:27:28,030
I curse you.

1956
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:28,730
I'll make sure

1957
01:27:28,890 --> 01:27:29,930
you can never quit drugs.

1958
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:31,160
I'll turn you into someone just like me.

1959
01:27:31,690 --> 01:27:32,400
Enough talk.

1960
01:27:32,420 --> 01:27:33,230
Take him away.

1961
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:34,230
Let go, bastard.

1962
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:35,300
I can walk myself.

1963
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:36,000
Let go.

1964
01:27:36,020 --> 01:27:36,430
Let me go.

1965
01:27:36,950 --> 01:27:37,530
Let me go.

1966
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:38,660
Yes.

1967
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:43,100
Louis.

1968
01:27:43,990 --> 01:27:44,800
Louis.

1969
01:27:45,190 --> 01:27:45,800
Louis.

1970
01:27:46,920 --> 01:27:48,430
Louis, wake up.

1971
01:27:48,820 --> 01:27:49,330
Louis.

1972
01:27:49,450 --> 01:27:50,260
Send him to the hospital.

1973
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:52,730
Louis.

1974
01:27:53,090 --> 01:27:53,600
[Emergency Room]

1975
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,130
[Louis]

1976
01:27:54,350 --> 01:27:54,800
Louis.

1977
01:27:55,090 --> 01:27:55,500
Louis, wake up.

1978
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:55,930
Louis, Louis.

1979
01:27:55,950 --> 01:27:56,560
You can't go in.

1980
01:27:56,950 --> 01:27:58,460
Family members wait outside.

1981
01:27:58,550 --> 01:27:59,760
Don't worry, Daniel.

1982
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:01,930
The doctor has taken over.

1983
01:28:02,390 --> 01:28:03,900
I believe Louis will be fine.

1984
01:28:17,650 --> 01:28:18,130
Hey.

1985
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:19,430
Louis.

1986
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:20,800
You're awake.

1987
01:28:21,020 --> 01:28:21,930
How do you feel? Does it hurt?

1988
01:28:22,250 --> 01:28:23,400
I'll pour you some water.

1989
01:28:28,520 --> 01:28:29,400
Drink slowly.

1990
01:28:34,490 --> 01:28:35,200
Do you want some fruit?

1991
01:28:35,350 --> 01:28:36,100
I'll peel it for you.

1992
01:28:38,650 --> 01:28:40,460
I'll change the IV.

1993
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:41,460
Okay.

1994
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:46,700
Coming.

1995
01:28:54,050 --> 01:28:54,760
Want some?

1996
01:28:55,890 --> 01:28:56,700
No need.

1997
01:29:03,250 --> 01:29:04,100
Is it good?

1998
01:29:06,190 --> 01:29:06,730
You

1999
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:08,200
look like a househusband.

2000
01:29:13,620 --> 01:29:14,430
I'm not used to it.

2001
01:29:14,890 --> 01:29:16,530
I usually only see you acting like a gangster.

2002
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:20,030
Didn't we agree?

2003
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,830
When carrying out a mission,

2004
01:29:21,850 --> 01:29:22,960
we can't lose ourselves.

2005
01:29:34,220 --> 01:29:35,730
When did you start suspecting me?

2006
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:38,900
Actually,

2007
01:29:40,190 --> 01:29:42,030
it started when I helped you quit drugs.

2008
01:29:42,890 --> 01:29:44,000
But back then I wasn't completely sure.

2009
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,200
Daniel, you.

2010
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:57,230
You're still alive?

2011
01:29:58,990 --> 01:29:59,860
It's okay.

2012
01:30:00,750 --> 01:30:01,730
I'll explain later.

2013
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:04,960
The next mission

2014
01:30:05,820 --> 01:30:07,030
is a siege operation.

2015
01:30:07,590 --> 01:30:08,590
I need

2016
01:30:08,590 --> 01:30:09,500
both of you to work together.

2017
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,260
Judging by your reaction,

2018
01:30:14,720 --> 01:30:15,860
you're not surprised at all

2019
01:30:16,050 --> 01:30:16,960
by my undercover identity.

2020
01:30:17,220 --> 01:30:18,230
Alright, alright.

2021
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:19,860
I had to fake my death back then

2022
01:30:19,950 --> 01:30:21,960
to lower Luke's guard.

2023
01:30:22,550 --> 01:30:23,360
As for you,

2024
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,230
you had to be captured by Jack

2025
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:26,430
and appear

2026
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,930
at their banquet,

2027
01:30:29,750 --> 01:30:30,560
so we could bring

2028
01:30:30,590 --> 01:30:33,100
the real mastermind to justice.

2029
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,860
Ouch.

2030
01:30:39,750 --> 01:30:40,560
That punch

2031
01:30:40,750 --> 01:30:41,760
really hurt,

2032
01:30:41,850 --> 01:30:42,930
Officer Daniel.

2033
01:30:44,450 --> 01:30:45,260
Then go ahead.

2034
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:47,130
Hit me back.

2035
01:30:48,620 --> 01:30:49,160
Ouch.

2036
01:30:49,790 --> 01:30:50,700
That hurts.

2037
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:54,960
If you hit me again, I'll kiss you.

2038
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:01,930
Surprise.

2039
01:31:05,590 --> 01:31:07,200
Surprise.

2040
01:31:07,820 --> 01:31:09,100
Wow.

2041
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:11,630
Oh.

2042
01:31:12,350 --> 01:31:13,130
This is practically

2043
01:31:13,490 --> 01:31:14,530
a cat-and-mouse couple.

2044
01:31:16,220 --> 01:31:17,030
What are you staring at?

2045
01:31:17,590 --> 01:31:18,900
Haven't you ever seen people kiss?

2046
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:20,900
That barely even counts as a kiss.

2047
01:31:21,290 --> 01:31:22,030
Let's go, let's go.

2048
01:31:22,320 --> 01:31:23,730
Don't disturb them.

2049
01:31:30,050 --> 01:31:30,600
Continue?

2050
01:31:31,220 --> 01:31:31,830
Of course.

2051
01:31:43,190 --> 01:31:44,030
Please welcome

2052
01:31:44,250 --> 01:31:45,960
Captain Daniel

2053
01:31:46,120 --> 01:31:47,330
and Captain

2054
01:31:47,620 --> 01:31:48,130
Louis

2055
01:31:48,290 --> 01:31:49,500
to the stage to receive their awards.

2056
01:31:53,920 --> 01:31:54,700
Daniel has

2057
01:31:55,090 --> 01:31:56,630
served undercover for many years.

2058
01:31:57,050 --> 01:31:58,330
Working seamlessly

2059
01:31:58,850 --> 01:31:59,900
with Officer Louis,

2060
01:32:00,390 --> 01:32:01,330
both have shown

2061
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:03,160
outstanding performance.

2062
01:32:04,250 --> 01:32:05,330
Please give them

2063
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:07,330
a round of

2064
01:32:16,450 --> 01:32:17,260
applause.

2065
01:32:21,420 --> 01:32:23,530
I still have one more surprise for everyone.

2066
01:32:24,760 --> 01:32:25,480
Welcome back,

2067
01:32:25,550 --> 01:32:27,660
Director Sean.

2068
01:32:31,820 --> 01:32:32,530
Great.

2069
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:36,230
Thank you, everyone.

2070
01:32:38,990 --> 01:32:40,730
This was all carefully planned.

2071
01:32:41,450 --> 01:32:42,130
As the saying goes,

2072
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:44,400
“You can't catch the tiger without entering its den.”

2073
01:32:48,320 --> 01:32:49,130
Do you remember?

2074
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:51,430
I once said

2075
01:32:52,150 --> 01:32:53,730
I'd win you over within a month.

2076
01:32:56,220 --> 01:32:57,900
It ended up taking three months.

2077
01:32:59,390 --> 01:33:00,330
But

2078
01:33:00,550 --> 01:33:01,400
in the end,

2079
01:33:01,950 --> 01:33:03,400
you're still mine.

2080
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:06,830
Watch what you say. This isn't the place.

2081
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:10,780
Then…

2082
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:14,230
Let's change locations and continue.

2083
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:52,200
Phew.

2084
01:33:52,990 --> 01:33:54,000
I almost forgot

2085
01:33:54,390 --> 01:33:56,130
this place is no longer a den of thieves.

2086
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:59,700
I can finally sleep peacefully until dawn,

2087
01:34:00,490 --> 01:34:01,600
and wake up to see

2088
01:34:01,620 --> 01:34:02,600
Louis's face.

2089
01:34:25,190 --> 01:34:25,730
Hello.

2090
01:34:26,350 --> 01:34:28,130
Good morning.

2091
01:34:28,590 --> 01:34:29,700
Come to the station now.

2092
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:31,100
-- I have a mission. -- Yes.

2093
01:34:31,390 --> 01:34:32,630
I need your help.

2094
01:34:32,690 --> 01:34:33,730
Understood.

2095
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:34,930
Hey, get up.

2096
01:34:35,490 --> 01:34:36,200
What's wrong?

2097
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:48,100
[The End]
