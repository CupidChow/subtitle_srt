Liangliang.

4
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:23,920
What's wrong?

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,000
Where were you?

6
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,400
I...

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,800
I thought you must be hungry.

8
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,920
So I went to the supermarket for food.

9
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,200
I thought I can never see you again.

10
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:47,960
Sorry to make you worry.

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,320
Oh.

12
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,920
How is grandma?

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,000
She's in hospital.

14
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:04,720
Liangliang.

15
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:06,680
I have decided.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,360
I'll stay in your world.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,920
We're going to see grandma tomorrow.

18
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,640
This time,

19
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,400
nothing can separate us

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,760
anymore.

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,920
We'll be together

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,240
forever.

23
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,080
But,

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
now you've left,

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
what about your kingdom

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
and your people?

27
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,800
Good morning, Your Majesty.

28
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,400
Good morning, everyone.

29
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,640
Item 22,

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,640
every seven days is a week

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,920
and is named after the seven luminaries.

32
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,040
Every person, no matter the class,

33
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,840
can arrange the last two
days of a week at will.

34
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,120
The imperial guard troop can
set up a shift work system.

35
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,640
Item 23,

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,040
men and women are equal beings
that have freedom of marriage.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,520
All marriages against
the will of an individual

38
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,360
are forbidden,

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,120
such as trading, forcing, and coercing.

(Mingguang Palace)

41

Fei'er is the Queen at last.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,440
I'm happy for Your Majesty
and Princess Fei'er.

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Yeah.

44
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,480
I can finally take a rest.

45
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,600
Hong Guo'er.

46
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,360
You should find a good man for marriage.

47
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,800
I don't want to get married.

48
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,920
I want to be with Your Majesty forever.

49
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,360
Silly girl.

50
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,440
Your Majesty.

51
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,840
My Queen.

52
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,840
Do you think

53
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,400
my cousin has decided
to go with Liangliang

54
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,480
a long time ago?

55
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,280
I think...

56
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,840
I think he has.

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,880
Otherwise he wouldn't write this book.

58
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,280
Look, he adjusted the laws

59
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,840
and updated the imperial examination.

60
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,680
He made people's life better.

61
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,960
He was such a good king.

62
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:04,880
I wonder if he and Liangliang
are happy over there.

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,640
Of course.

64
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,440
You are not a king in the utopia.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,640
You have to study

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,160
to survive here.

67
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,960
From today on,

68
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,560
you'll study Chinese, Math, and English
every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.

69
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,200
And History, Biology, and Geography
on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday.

70
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,240
And I have my work to do as well.

71
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,240
I will be your teacher.

72
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,280
Miss Yao.

73
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,800
Miss.

74
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,480
What about Sunday?

75
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,160
Sunday?

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
We'll see.

77
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,520
If you are being a good boy,

78
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,840
you can have the day off.

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,400
And if you are not,

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,720
you'll be studying Ethics and The Law.

81
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:01,760
But,

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:03,840
Miss,

83
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,280
I think it might be too easy for me.

84
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,280
Recently,

85
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
(Das Kapital)
I've been reading this.

86
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,120
Oh, I forgot.

87
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,480
It must be very easy
for a king to learn this.

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,320
Yeah.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,280
Don't gloat though.

90
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,120
To survive here,

91
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,800
it's not enough

92
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,960
to study only social sciences.

93
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,800
You need to study
natural sciences as well.

94
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,080
Oh.

95
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,600
Miss.

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,520
(Function of complex variable)
Do you mean this?

97
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,520
(Quantum mechanics)
And this?

98
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,320
I read this too.

99
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,520
This.

100
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,000
This.

101
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:45,920
And this.

102
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,880
That's enough.

103
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,520
You know everything.

104
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,560
I can't teach you.

105
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,640
Bye.

106
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:52,480
Wait.

107
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,840
If

108
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,120
you can't be my teacher,

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,440
well...

110
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,960
I can be yours.

111
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,480
Brother?

112
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,400
Who is your brother?

113
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:27,960
You left the door open.

114
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm here for business.

115
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,560
Statement.

116
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,880
Recently, we have noticed a fake video

117
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,360
of Mr. Wang Zheng and a woman
acting intimately in a karaoke

118
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,480
being widely spread on the internet.

119
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,880
After our thorough investigation,

120
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,320
the man in the video

121
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,160
has also pretended to be Mr. Wang Zheng

122
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,440
to endorse Golden Age

and Fanku Night City.

125
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
The spread of this matter

126
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,000
is extremely harmful to
Mr. Wang Zheng's public image.

Got it?

130
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,040
Oh.

131
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,680
Did you understand?

132
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,040
Was it you who did all of that?
