3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,520
Do you have someone on your mind?

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:16,280
I do.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,000
Who is it?

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,240
One question only.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,800
So you are not drunk at all.

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:26,880
Again.

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,480
Smart guy.

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:29,800
No wonder he's the King.

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,520
He inherited it from his father.

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,400
Inherited wealth counts too.

13
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,120
Are you actually complimenting yourself?

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,480
It's my turn.

15
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,400
I'll spin it.

16
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:43,720
Okay.

17
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:52,760
No.

18
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,320
This...

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:56,160
This can't be me.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:56,920
You.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,440
Make your choice.

22
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,640
Fine.

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:02,760
Truth.

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,360
Who is your crush?

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:08,720
Well.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,600
This...

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,040
Can you ask me something else?

28
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:11,520
No.

29
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,240
No.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,720
Princess Fei'er.

31
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,080
What?

32
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,520
You like Fei'er?

33
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,880
She's so beautiful, graceful,

34
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,640
gentle,

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,080
and perfect.

36
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,000
Especially the soup she cooked.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My mouth starts to water

38
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,600
whenever I think of it.

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,240
And she...

40
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,240
When I first met her...

41
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,240
I'm sorry, miss.

42
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,280
I'll pay for the damage
from the general's palace.

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:10,920
General?

44
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,080
Are you

45
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,640
the invincible,

46
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,840
courageous,

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,760
personable,

48
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,560
and extraordinary General Sa?

49
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,360
It's me.

50
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,040
I'm Princess Fei'er.

51
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
You can call me Fei'er.

52
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,640
Are you

53
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:31,240
the graceful,

54
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,560
stunning,

55
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,800
and beautiful Princess Fei'er?

56
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,680
Yes.

57
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,120
Oh.

58
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:57,680
Another round.

59
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,480
Go.

60
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,320
You can only pick dare.

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,000
Dare it is, then.

62
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,280
Do you know it, General Sa?

63
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,880
Ever since I first met you,

64
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,680
I've fallen for you.

65
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,160
Whenever I couldn't sleep at night,

66
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,760
I would always come here

67
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,040
for a little release.

68
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:48,920
Fei.

69
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,480
Fei.

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,600
Good evening, Princess Fei'er.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,840
G-General Sa.

72
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,320
What is it that brought you here

73
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,840
at this hour?

74
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:05,480
I...

75
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,520
What do you mean by that, General?

76
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,280
This...

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:21,560
This is a small gift

78
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,160
for Your Highness.

79
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,080
Please accept it, Your Highness.

80
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:44,560
Your Highness.

81
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,200
I won't bother you anymore.

82
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:52,560
Sorry.

83
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:53,720
It's okay.

84
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,800
Did you see how they
looked at each other?

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,400
Mr. Li is making her
fall in love with him.

86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,320
My Queen.

87
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,760
Stop worrying about other people.

88
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,600
Worry about yourself for a change.

89
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,240
I've got nothing to worry about.

90
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,480
I like being single.

91
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,200
How dare you, General Sa!

92
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,840
How dare he think of
Your Highness in that way?

93
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,320
Shut up.

94
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,360
If The Queen Mother
finds out about this,

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,600
you'll be in big trouble.

96
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,560
Yes, Your Highness.

97
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,240
(So the Princess likes General Sa.)
