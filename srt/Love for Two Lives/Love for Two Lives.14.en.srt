00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:15,400
Princess.

00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:17,480
We have everything you want here.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,040
Here is a buns store.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
There is a hotel.

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,760
This restaurant you recommended is good.

8
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,280
I'm glad you like it, Princess.

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,400
Are you finished, Princess?

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,800
I'll go take the bill.

11
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:57,000
Wait, Princess.

12
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,240
Princess.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,240
I'll pay.

14
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:03,960
Okay.

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,560
Young lady.

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,760
You look pretty.

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:19,880
Let me go!

18
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,080
What are you doing?

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,480
Come drink with me.

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,120
What are you doing?

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,040
What am I doing?

22
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,680
I want to drink with her.

23
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,000
How dare you!

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,240
You just wait there.

25
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,880
Don't bother, Princess Xiangxiang.

26
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,600
General Sa is here.

27
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,680
He's famous for his Sa's Kungfu.

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,320
This man will get a good thrashing.

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,280
Sit down.

30
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,400
Didn't you hear?

31
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,360
General Sa.

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Go.

33
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:46,760
I will.

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,800
I will.

35
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:49,960
General Sa.

36
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,800
Good luck.

37
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,440
Teach him a lesson that he won't forget.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,400
I'm the general of the court,

39
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,400
General Sa.

40
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,040
Kneel and apologize
before it's too late.

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,040
General Sa.

42
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,320
Use your Kungfu.

43
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,240
Oh.

44
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
The time is calling.

45
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,040
Wow.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,840
The general won.

47
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,960
General Sa.

48
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,840
You won.

49
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,920
I've never seen anything like that.

50
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
Must be a great technique.

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,560
What?

52
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,880
You're taking General Sa with you?

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,600
Yes.

54
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,040
There's a saying in Dongshan Kingdom.
Nothing forcibly done can be agreeable.

55
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,960
Your King does not like me.

56
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,560
So I won't make this hard for you.

57
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,360
If I can marry General Sa,

58
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,960
everything happened can be forgotten.

59
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,000
No way.

60
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,640
You can't take him with you.

61
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,320
Why?

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Because...

63
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,000
Because if you take him away,

64
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,480
my aunt and I
will have no one in this palace.

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,120
That's none of my concern.

66
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,680
There's another saying in Dongshan...

67
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,160
Ay.

68
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,400
I can't remember.

69
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,440
Anyway,

70
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,040
he has to go with me.

71
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:01,840
Okay.

72
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,720
You can have him.

73
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,720
Aunt.

74
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,320
Don't worry.

75
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,160
Here.

76
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
Congratulations on
marrying the princess.

77
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,680
Cheers.

78
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,400
Cheers.

79
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,360
Come on.

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,160
Yao Liangliang.

81
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,080
I...

82
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,920
I'm so sad.

83
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,400
Stop making fun of me.

84
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,200
If that Princess Xiangxiang

85
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,320
is really

86
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
taking me with her

87
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,480
to Dongshan Kingdom...

88
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:43,880
Your Majesty.

89
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,880
I'm telling you.

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,320
Then I won't

91
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,520
stay in your world anymore.

92
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:49,080
I'll come back to mine.

93
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,600
But...

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,040
What about Fei'er?

95
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,800
Fei'er.

96
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,600
Fei'er can stay over there.

97
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:01,120
I've had enough.

98
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,040
Your Majesty.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,680
Take your time.

100
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,080
Queen.

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,600
Take your time.

102
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,920
I'll go for a walk.

103
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,520
See you, General Sa.

104
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,560
Hey!

105
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,560
Don't go.

106
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,920
Come and drink more.

107
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,480
Sorry for disregarding you.

108
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,000
I thought you said you never got drunk.

109
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,120
Your Majesty.

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,720
You look pretty good today.

111
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,360
I always look good.

112
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,640
