00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:13,840
So,

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
you know all about us?

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:16,800
Yes.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:19,000
Mr. Li!

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,760
It's not my fault.

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:23,600
It's your...

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Your cleaning robot
wandered to the palace.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,120
Go back.

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,640
Don't worry.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,640
Fei'er won't tell anyone

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,000
about your secret.

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,560
I don't believe you.

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:38,600
Princess.

16
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,320
The Queen Mother

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,600
made so much trouble for me.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,720
You must've helped her.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,280
Don't say things like that to her.

20
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:47,920
She was used by the Queen Mother.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,040
Men.

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,720
It's true Fei'er did bad things.

23
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,440
But now Fei'er knows it was wrong.

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,960
"It's true Fei'er did bad things."

25
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,520
Do you know

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,720
that those bad things you did

27
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,640
could've cost Xiangxiang
and me our life?

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,560
She didn't mean to.

29
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,760
We should forgive her.

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:19,840
Cousin.

31
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:20,640
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,560
General Sa.

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,000
Fei'er won't do it anymore.

34
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,880
Fine.

35
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,040
Since you promised,

36
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,960
I'll forgive you.

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,720
After all,

38
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
I am

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,800
the kindest,

40
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,920
most generous,

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,880
and most sympathetic Queen.

42
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:47,720
Princess.

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
There's something I don't understand.

44
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,320
Go head, Your Majesty.

45
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,520
Why do you always mention your own name

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,000
when you talk?

47
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,080
Because Fei'er is my name.

48
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,440
Don't laugh at me, cousin.

49
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,034
(Niu)

50
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,280
Niu?

51
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:14,720
Hello, Niu.

52
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,120
Niu.

53
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,960
Where's my grandma?

54
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,280
Liangliang.

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,840
You are back.

56
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,920
Come.

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,480
Grandma.

58
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
Niu said you fainted.

59
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,080
It scared me so much.

60
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm fine.

61
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,080
Why did he have to run his mouth

62
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,240
and make you come all the way back?

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,120
But you did faint.

64
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:17,400
Ercui hasn't come back for a long time.

65
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,840
She should come visit her grandma.

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,000
Ercui.

67
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:23,800
Good name.

68
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,640
And visit me too.

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,960
I don't want to see you.

70
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,440
Young man.

71
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,200
Come sit down.

72
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,640
Come here.

73
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,640
There's no water today.

74
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,960
Niu went to the old well

75
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,160
to bring me some water.

76
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,360
And he helped me air
some winter jackets.

77
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,040
He helped me so much.

78
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,560
What do I do without him?

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,280
Ercui.

80
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,200
Have this.

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm good. You go ahead.

82
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,040
Okay then.

83
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,400
And you...

84
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,240
What do you do?

85
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,360
I'm the King...

86
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm known as a pianist.

87
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,520
Oh.

88
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,160
Your nanny is a pianist.

89
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,840
Grandma.

90
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,200
He is a pianist.

91
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,000
That's right.

92
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,080
A family of pianists.

93
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:25,400
How great.

94
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,120
How great.

95
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,360
Just great.

96
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,360
Mind your own business.

97
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,440
You know I like oranges, Ercui.

98
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,640
You always leave them for me.

99
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
Niu.

100
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
Come with me to the farmland
after the clothes are dried.

101
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,240
Yes, grandma.

102
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,120
Go.

103
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,240
You are our guest.

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,040
You should rest in the house.

105
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,600
Right. Guests can't work in the fields.

106
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,000
I'm going.

107
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,320
Fine. I'm off.

108
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,000
Send me to work right after I came back?

109
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,920
You definitely pretended to be ill.

110
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,560
Ercui.

111
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,720
I'll help you.

112
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,280
Well.

113
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,080

She came back with her boyfriend.

117
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,960
They are helping out in the field.

118
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,560
A very handsome boy.

119

He's a pianist.

120
