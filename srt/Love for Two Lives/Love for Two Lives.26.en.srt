00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:19,320
Liangliang.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:25,960
(Your Majesty.)

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,720
(Maybe we should be parted for a while)

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,520
(and think about our own future.)

7
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,240
Liangliang, you are back.

8
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,600
Grandma.

9
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,520
I haven't knitted with you for years.

10
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,760
I used to fool around when you knitted.

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,560
Was I annoying?

12
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,920
You were.

13
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:48,920
Grandma.

14
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,800
But I

15
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,480
always recall

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,960
when you were little.

17
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,040
How is everything with Zheng?

18
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,760
Pretty good.

19
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm not that easy to be fooled.

20
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,640
You came back alone.

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,000
There must be something
wrong with you two.

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,800
You can tell me.

23
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,000
Grandma.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,440
If I tell you

25
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,440
he's not from our world,

26
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,240
but a parallel world,

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,400
will you believe me?

28
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,640
I will.

29
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,120
Really?

30
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,760
I believe

31
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,520
anything you say.

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,400
Come to grandma.

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,320
Tell me.

34
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,040
He's a king in another world.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,280
The time crack opened in my house.

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,680
That's why we met each other.

37
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,760
Well.

38
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,480
At first,

39
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,800
we didn't get along.

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,520
But a lot of things

41
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,840
happened then,

42
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,640
and we became friends.

43
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,080
And then,

44
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,080
we fell in love with each other.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,680
I thought I could be with him forever.

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,040
But the crack is closing in a few days.

47
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,880
Grandma.

48
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,800
I really want him to come to our world.

49
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,280
I know it's a selfish thought.

50
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:38,920
After all,

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,520
he's a king.

52
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,240
He needs to think about

53
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,400
his people.

54
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,040
So,

55
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,880
we probably won't see each other again.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,400
You can go to his world.

57
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,560
What's the big deal?

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,240
I came all the way here

59
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,720
for your grandpa.

60
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,000
No.

61
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,240
I can't leave you on your own.

62
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,640
I won't hold you back.

63
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,160
I'm all alone after all.

64
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,240
If you don't mind,

65
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,320
I can go to his world too.

66
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,680
Then we can all be together.

67
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,120
Really?

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,360
Have I ever lied to you?

69
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,920
Tell me.

70
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,800
What's it like

71
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,280
over there?

72
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,160
The sky over there is very blue,

73
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,760
the air is fresh,

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,200
and the sunshine is very cozy.

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,760
Their soil is good too.

76
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,000
I've never seen a scallion that big.

77
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,640
The fruits are sweet.

78
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
The flowers smell nice.

79
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,200
How great.

80
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,880
Grandma.

81
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
When we get there,

82
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,480
you can keep working on fields.

83
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,000
You can plant whatever you want.

84
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,240
They have a large field.

85
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,560
Sounds great.

86
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,000
I wonder

87
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,400
what Liangliang is doing now.

88
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:36,920
Your Majesty.

89
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,400
You started without me?

90
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,000
Leave that.

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Let's drink this.

92
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,320
Have you decided?

93
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,400
What will you do?

94
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,080
Yes.

95
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm going to her world.

96
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,960
You are coming to our world?

97
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,160
Then what about your people?

98
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
I'm thinking about

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,720
leaving the throne to Lord Xu.

100
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,960
Lord Xu?

101
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,160
You haven't seen him for so long.

102
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,480
How do you know he's
still the one you knew?

103
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,480
Listen to my story.

104
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,200
I had a secretary surnamed Hao.

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,560
Right?

106
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,520
He's been with me
ever since I started the business.

107
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,680
We went through everything together.

108
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
We laughed and cried together.

109
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,280
I even gave him half of my shares.

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,560
And guess what?

111
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,120
I've been away for just three months,

112
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:44,920
and he took all my money and ran away.

113
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,920
That's enough.

114
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,120
I don't want to hear your story.

115
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,240
I've made my decision.

116
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
I love Liangliang.

117
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,440
I'll be

118
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
wherever she is.

119
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,200
You would do anything just for love?

120
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,240
You are no better than me.

121
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,120
I...

122
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,680
I'm a general in your world.

123
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,840
And here you are just...

124
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,160
You are just cosplaying.

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,000
Cosplaying.
