3
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,120
What's going on?

4
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,040
I wanted

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,480
to wait for the right time to tell you.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,440
But,

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,040
now you've seen it for yourselves.

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:43,600
Fei'er.

9
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,480
Would you like to stay in my world?

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,720
But,

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,520
this world is so scary.

12
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,120
Two days ago,

13
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,960
I went to the seller, Dr. Feng.

14
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,240
And he said...

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,920
Mr. Li.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,120
Some parts of
the time machine are broken.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,520
The time and space are twisted.

18
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,280
That's why you felt the turbulence.

19
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,080
Mr. Li.

20
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,560
You shouldn't go there anymore.

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,080
Why, Dr. Feng?

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:24,800
The time crack

23
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,600
is closing soon.

24
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,080
If you go there again,

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,680
you might not be able to come back.

26
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,400
I can't come back?

27
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
How long do I have?

28
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,360
You mean,

29
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:40,120
in seven days...

30
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:41,600
Yes.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,840
In seven days, at 5:00 PM,

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,360
the crack will close.

33
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,640
What do we do?

34
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,960
Fei'er wants to stay with General Sa.

35
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:52,480
Fei'er.

36
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,760
I know you would get scared

37
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,440
in my world.

38
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,160
So I've decided

39
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,240
to go to yours.

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,720
But you belong to this world.

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
Well...

42
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,480
My company went bankrupt.

43
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:11,440
General Sa.

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
I'll go for a walk.

45
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,400
Let me go with you.

46
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,280
Don't bother.

47
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,640
I'll go alone.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Sister.

49
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,280
Good day.

50
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,880
You are still up?

51
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,480
I can't sleep.

52
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,080
I would see my late mother

53
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,720
whenever I closed my eyes.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,400
Ever since my mother passed away,

55
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,520
I haven't got

56
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,240
one good night of sleep.

57
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,560
Sister.

58
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,480
That's unfortunate.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,280
Tell you what.

60
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,280
You can go running before bedtime,

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,320
and use up all your energy.

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,240
You'll definitely get
some good sleep then.

63
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,120
That's very original, sister.

64
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,360
But as a member of the royal family,

65
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,800
we're forbidden to run.

66
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,240
Oh.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,040
But we have new rules now.

68
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,680
Exercise is very important.

69
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,400
Everyone should start exercising.

70
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,680
Running is not only
good for your health,

71
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,080
and it also makes you stronger

72
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,680
and sleep better.

73
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,400
Sister.

74
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,120
A headache just hit me.

75
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,840
Can you please check

76
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,680
if I'm having a fever?

77
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,480
No. You don't have a fever.

78
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,000
I have another question for you, sister.

79
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,000
Ask away.

80
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,640
What do you think of me, sister?

81
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,120
Well.

82
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Gentle.

83
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Graceful.

84
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,360
Pretty good.

85
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,200
Well,

86
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,200
if you met me before my brother,

87
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,680
would you fall for me instead?

88
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,000
What do you mean by that?

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,360
I fall for you, sister.

90
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,640
What?

91
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,000
Are you serious?

92
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm your sister-in-law.

93
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,240
I'm your brother's wife.

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,800
How can you say that?

95
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,400
The Queen acted
inappropriately with the Lord.

96
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,400
She'll never get away with this.

97
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,400
A tooth for a tooth.

98
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,000
An eye for an eye.

99
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,880
Spread the photo.

100
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,240
And wait.

101
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:46,800
Come on.

102
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,560
- Hurry up.
- Look.

103
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,280
Well.

104
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,320
Let me see.

105
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,760
It looks good.

106
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,200
Which one does Her Majesty like?

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,200
His Majesty or His Highness?

108
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,520
I wonder too.

109
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,480
Didn't you hear that?

110
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,480
After His Highness
came back to the palace,

111
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,280
he follows Her Majesty everywhere.

112
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
They get along well.

113
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,560
I'll say

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,280
that Her Majesty has fallen for him.

115
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,640
That's impossible.

116
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,080
His Majesty and Her Majesty
went through so much.

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,040
They are a great couple,

118
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,680
always staying together.

119
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,280
Don't be ignorant.

120
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,320
Her Majesty is very open-minded.

121
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:27,640
A new one is always better
than the old one, right?

122
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,160
That makes sense.

123
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,800
Yeah.

124
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:32,000
How dare you!

125
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,520
We apologize, Your Majesty.

126
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,320
We won't do it again.

127
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,160
No money for you this month.

128
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,280
If it happens again,

129
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,800
strokes first,

130
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,360
and then you're out of the palace.
