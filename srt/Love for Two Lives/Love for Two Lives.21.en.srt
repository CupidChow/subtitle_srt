3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,480
What a handsome boy.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,560
How old are you?

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,800
Twenty-five.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,440
Are your parents insured?

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,480
My parents passed away.

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,760
You are so young. Do you own a house?

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,920
Hundreds of houses.

10
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,160
That's impressive.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,040
You are much better than my son.

12
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,680
My son worked so hard for a dozen years.

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,360
And all he got is two houses.

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,120
Do you have a car?

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,280
Thousands.

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,560
Thousands?

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,960
Don't brag, young man.

18
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,520
How do you park so many cars?

19
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:01,680
You don't sell cars, do you?

20
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
He is a pianist.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,680
He even won the...

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
He won some prizes.

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,840
Is that so?

24
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
What a coincidence.

25
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,840
My grandson is learning piano.

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,840
He practices for hours a day.

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,040
Sometimes it worries me
to see how hard he's working.

28
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,640
Ms. Lan's grandson

29
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,720
is very good with the piano.

30
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,960
He got to level 10.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,480
Which level did you get?

32
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,120
I...

33
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,120
How about playing something for us?

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,000
Play something.

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,160
That's right.

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,000
Ms. Zhang.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,440
We don't have a piano here.

38
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,640
Ms. Lan has one at home.

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,280
There is one in my villa.

40
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,840
You can go there to play.

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Enough with the piano, Ms. Lan.

42
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,880
Wang Zheng, you are good at calligraphy.

43
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,920
He can perform that for us.

44
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,280
Yes.

45
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
Zheng.

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,240
You know calligraphy?

47
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:05,640
A little.

48
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,600
Great.

49
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,440
You can write the couplets
for this year's spring festival for us.

50
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,960
Is that okay?

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
Of course.

52
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,280
Zheng.

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,000
Help everyone with the couplets.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,560
Please.

55
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
Why are you laughing?

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,480
To show my respect.

57
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm so tired,

58
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,160
and you're still making fun of me?

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:45,200
No.

60
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,360
I think you can make
a living out of this

61
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,800
if you live in this world.

62
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,080
Ten yuan for a couplet.

63
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Come on. Everyone's waiting.

64
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,480
Liangliang.

65
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,160
Such a good boyfriend you got there.

66
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,960
You must let him write
all our couplets in the future.

67
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,320
No problem, Ms. Lan.

68
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,280
Okay. That's enough for today.

69
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,880
Go back to your home.

70
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,920
We're leaving.

71
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,040
On our way now.

72
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,080
Take care.

73
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,280
Bye.

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:28,880
Bye.

75
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,320
These here

76
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,600
are all her favorite food.

77
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:44,800
Grandma.

78
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,880
Can you teach me

79
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,800
how to cook these?

80
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,680
Of course.

81
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,440
I'm old.

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,000
I don't have many chances
to cook for her anymore.

83
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Can you wash these?

84
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:57,880
Okay.

85
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:07,080
Zheng.

86
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,240
What's your plan for the future?

87
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,560
Plan?

88
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,680
You are not kids anymore.

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,680
It's time to think about marriage.

90
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Have someone pick a date.

91
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,880
But...

92
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,200
I don't know if she wants it.

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,840
Liangliang might seem
like a carefree girl.

94
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,400
But on the inside,

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,600
she's very kind and sensitive.

96
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,040
She's a poor kid.

97
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
She lost her parents when little.

98
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
And I'm getting older.

99
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I just hope

100
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,800
that you can take care of her,

101
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,040
and be good to her.

102
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,240
Don't worry, grandma.

103
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,240
You can trust her with me.

104
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,880
This is the first time I see you.

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,240
But from the way you look at her,

106
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,760
I can feel

107
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,560
that you are trustworthy.

108
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,200
I'll leave her to you.

109
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,240
You have to always

110
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,080
be with her.

111
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:26,880
Grandma.

112
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:28,880
I promise.

113
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,040
I'm starving here, grandma!

115
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:57,880
Do you like it?

116
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,640
I do.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,480
What are you doing?

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,240

We are roommates.

So...

You are saying no?

Never mind.

128
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,680
