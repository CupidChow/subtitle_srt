Mr. Li.

Fei'er is just watching
a shadow play with the general.

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,120
It doesn't matter.

Where is Zheng?

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,640
He is...

12

At the garden.

What does this mean, Your Majesty?

22
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,320
I'm going to Liangliang's world.

23
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
I won't be a king anymore

24
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,280
there.

25
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,680
These things should be enough

26
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,640
for the rest of your life.

27
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,920
You should leave

28

today.

29
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,400
Your Majesty.

This is an order from your king.

34
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,040
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,080

Servant.

43
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,040
Your Highness.

44
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,240
Why is it so noisy outside?

45
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,320
Her Majesty fell into a deserted well.

46
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,920
Everyone is rushing to save her.

47
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760

48
00:02:59,160 --> 00:02:59,720

Your Majesty!

51
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,280
Where is my Queen?

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,880
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,920
Her Majesty is at the bottom
of the well.

54
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,280
No need to be worried.

55
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,120
This well has been deserted for years.

56
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,200
It's just fairly deep.

57
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,280
Is my Queen in danger?

58
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,720
Please wait here, Your Majesty.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,640
We'll know soon.

60

Hurry up.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Your Majesty.

62
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,240
Her Majesty is still alive.

63
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,680
Tie it on me.

64
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm going down there.

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,560
No.

66
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,680
You can't put yourself
in danger, Your Majesty.

67
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,520
Say no more. She's my Queen.

68
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,240
Wait!

69
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,280
Brother.

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,320
You are too important.

71
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,120
I should go.

72
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:51,640
No.

73
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,000
I should do this myself.

74
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,160
Hurry up. Tie the rope on me.

75
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
Stop arguing.

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,920
I got out by myself.
