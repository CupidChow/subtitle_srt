3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,440
The stars are beautiful here.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,000
It's also a kind of happiness

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,680
to see these stars every day.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,880
I'm sorry that you have to stay here

7
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,280
to be my Queen.

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,800
Nonsense.

9
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,200
I would never be a Queen without you.

10
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,440
It's not easy to be a Queen.

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,040
You have to keep everything
in order in the palace,

12
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,560
adjust the laws and regulations,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,080
and turn this kingdom into a utopia,

14
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,040
so that everyone is equal

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,160
and lives a happy life.

16
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:50,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,440
Your Majesty.

18
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,280
Look at the fireworks. It's beautiful.

19
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,000
Who would set off fireworks

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,800
at this hour?

21
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:16,760
No!

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,280
Why is it so noisy outside?

23
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,000
Your Majesty!

24
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,600
Your Majesty, Lord Xu started a coup!

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,680
What a sweet couple.

26
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,080
Brother.

27
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,600
Good day.

28
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:55,880
Xu.

29
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,960
What does this mean?

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,120
What does this mean?

31
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,080
Isn't it obvious?

32
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,920
Don't be afraid, Liangliang.

33
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,840
General Sa will protect us.

34
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:17,800
Liangliang.

35
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,400
Told you.

36
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,880
Whoever touches me

37
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,080
will be executed for treason.

38
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,240
I forgot to tell you.

39
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,160
I came back this time

40
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,440
to reclaim what should be mine.

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:37,720
Kill your brother for the throne?

42
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,440
It can never be justified!

43
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
Whoever wins is the king.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,920
Take them away.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,600
Wait!

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,720
Don't be scared, sister.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,040
After I take the throne,

48
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,400
you'll be my Queen.

49
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,480
I don't want to be your Queen.

50
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Free him!

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,240
You are in no position to order me.

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,640
Liangliang!

53
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,400
Free him now!

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,520
I'll kill myself here

55
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,760
if you don't.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Okay.

57
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,840
I promise you I won't kill him.

58
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
Three days later,

59
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,800
I'll marry you.

60
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,160
My brother can share the joy then.

61
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,920
I was so blind!

62
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,760
Let go!

63
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,800
Get your hands off her!

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,720
Let's go.

65
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,080
Liangliang!

66
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,400
Liangliang!

67
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,840
It's okay.

68
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm here.

69
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,080
Servant!

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,960
Let me out!

71
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,360
Be quiet.

72
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,480
Old woman.

73
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,320
What did you call me?

74
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,080
You are not the Queen Mother anymore.

75
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,360
If the Queen didn't
promise to marry Lord Xu

76
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,800
to keep you alive,

77
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,360
you would've been dead long ago.

78
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,920
So stop shouting.

79
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,240
Is that true?

80
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,160
The witch did that for us?

81
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:41,800
Liangliang!

82
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,920
Liangliang!

83
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,720
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,840
His Highness is in a good mood,
so he allows you to see them.

85
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,440
If you have anything to say,
say it quickly.

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Liangliang, are you hurt?

87
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,880
Did they do anything to you?

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,400
I'm fine.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,400
It's okay.

90
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,960
Zheng, don't worry.

91
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,720
I'll find a way to save you.

92
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,000
You saved me many times.

93
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,400
I should return the favor this time.

94
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,400
Time to go, Your Majesty.

95
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,680
- Liangliang!
