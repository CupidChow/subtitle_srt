How is grandma?

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:17,760
Ercui.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,000
You need to be prepared for this.

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,720
Liangliang, you are back.

8
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Grandma.

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,440
Liangliang.

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
I probably can't

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,160
keep my promise.

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,080
Do you blame me?

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,280
Grandma.

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,800
How can I blame you?

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,720
I'm waiting for you to
go to his world with me.

16
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,800
Silly girl.

17
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,280
Grandma

18
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,680
is not going.

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,280
Grandma

20
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,080
is going to your grandpa.

21
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,760
He has been waiting

22
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,960
for so long.

23
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,160
Grandma.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,360
You'll get better.

25
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,040
Liangliang.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,440
You should go.

27
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,840
I've only seen Zheng

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,800
once.

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
But I can tell

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,240
he loves you

31
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,120
from the bottom of his heart.

32
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,480
He will take care of you.

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,280
Grandma

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
can rest assured.

35
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,280
I don't want to leave you.

36
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,560
He's waiting for you.

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,720
Don't keep him waiting

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,880
like I did to your grandpa.

39
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,520
Grandma

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,080
loves Liangliang the most.

41
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,160
I don't want to

42
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,160
see you

43
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,720
unhappy for the rest of your life.

44
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Go.

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,640
Don't leave room for regret.

46
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,640
Niu

47
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,680
will take care of me.

48
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,800
Don't worry.

49
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,800
Why is Liangliang still not back?

50
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,400
The crack is closing soon.

51
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
She will come back.

52
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,120
Your Majesty.

53
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,880
You have to go back now.

54
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,400
That's right, cousin.

55
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:56,800

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,480
