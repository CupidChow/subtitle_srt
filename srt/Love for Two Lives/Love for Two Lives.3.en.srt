That's what a Queen should look like.

Ouch.

What is it?

8
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,760
I practiced too hard

on those tricks.

Yes.

00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:06,880
It's okay.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,840
I have it at my home.

It works better.

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,360
I can just do it at my home.

18

Will it really work?

19
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,080
I need to look for it.

It's been so long. I forgot where it is.

called "hide and seek"?

Is it because

you think I'm pretty?

50

No.

Take a closer look.

The one I was going to marry ran away.

It can be anyone but her.

You need to know

that the Queen Mother
is not my real mother.

Guess it's just my bad luck.

Fine.

73
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,560
I'll do it.

74
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,040
But just this once.

75
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,800
When this is over, we'll be even.

76
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,120
No.

Let's get this straight.

83
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,680
I'll just pretend to be your Queen.

84
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,160
But I won't serve you.

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
Will I get any salary for doing this?

86
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:23,080
Salary?

87
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:24,840
Money.

88
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,440
However much you want.

89
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,000
Okay.

90
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,680
I'll think about that tomorrow.

91
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,160
He looks exactly the same as Wang Zheng.

92

What is it?

93
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,680
I knew you'd want to run away.

94
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,280
Well.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,080
I was just going to the bathroom.

96
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,320
I didn't try to run away.

97
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
But I'm worried about you.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,640
What's your problem?

99
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,080
Just sleep like this.

100
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,480
Put on a good show

101

on Queen Mother's birthday banquet.

102
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,880
I really need to go to the bathroom.

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,480
The Queen is ready

104
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,760
to perform for you, Queen Mother.

105
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
Queen.

106
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,280
I've been looking forward to
your performance.

107
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,840
I'm honored to perform for Your Majesty.

108
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,840
Wish Your Majesty good health

109
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,800
and good fortune.

110
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,120
First, chopping bricks with one hand.

111
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,200
You may start now, Queen.

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,840
Yes.

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Good.

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,360
Bravo.

119

Wait.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,160
Chopping bricks with one hand.

121
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,200
Fetching chestnut from the fire.

122
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,320
Breaking a rock on the chest.

123
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,880
I'm a little tired

124
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,560
of these unimpressive tricks.

125
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,720
I want something new.

126
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,160
The Queen is the bravest and
most skillful lady in Dongshan Kingdom.

127
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:21,400
I know you wouldn't care
for these ordinary tricks either.

128
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,800
Not at all.

129
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,280
It's my honor to be able to
perform for you, Your Majesty.
