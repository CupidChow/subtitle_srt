3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:12,400
You mortals are too blind
to recognize a real fairy.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:18,720
What are you doing here?

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,000
I'm here in the human world to save you.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
Humans.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,240
Why don't you kneel before me?

8
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:26,920
How...?

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,000
How can we know whether
this is magic or witchcraft?

10
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:31,680
Huh.

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,040
Aha!

12
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,560
Avalokitesvara.

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,040
Merciful Avalokitesvara.

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,600
Merciful Avalokitesvara.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,960
Merciful Avalokitesvara.

16
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,760
Can she

17
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,440
really be a fairy?

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,680
I've been in charge of
the palace of concubines

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,240
for thirty years.

20
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,720
But I've never seen any trick like this.

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,320
This fairy is my 36th apprentice,

22
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,520
Fairy Liangliang.

23
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,240
She obeyed my order

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
to come to bless you mortal beings.

25
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,240
If you listen to her,

26
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,720
you'll have good health

27
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,520
and fortune.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,720
If you dare disobey her,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,320
you'll be bothered with misfortune

30
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,960
and illnesses.

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,680
Have mercy, Avalokitesvara.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,040
Have mercy, fairy.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,000
Have mercy, Avalokitesvara.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,320
Have mercy, fairy.

35
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
Zheng.

36
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
This fairy is a good match for you.

37
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,480
When the wedding ceremony is finished,

38
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,920
you'll share one life.

39
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,120
Remember to care for each other

40
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:13,080
until you reach the end of your lives.

41
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,720
Yes.

42
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
Merciful Avalokitesvara.

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,480
The whole court is
enchanted by this witch.

44
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,480
Not only I can't be the Queen,

45
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,560
she even puts you in danger, Aunt.

46
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,600
Shut up.

47
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,440
This is merely a cheap trick.

48
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,400
Tell General Sa to come back.

49
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,960
Hehe.

50
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,280
That was so funny.

51
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:44,280
I can't believe they bought that.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,000
I never thought

53
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
you are so smart.

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,160
You are a pretty loyal friend.

55
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,400
I can't just watch them
doing this to you.

56
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,840
My Queen will have to

57
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,480
pretend to be a fairy
for two more months.

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,080
Not a chance.

59
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,360
I'm getting the minimal wage

60
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,560
for something that can cost my life.

61
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,440
She'll still try anything to kill me.

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,840
Fine.

63
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,400
You got the key.

64
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,640
You may go.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:17,360
For real?

66
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,440
Yes.

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,480
It's not breaching the contract?

68
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,360
No.
