3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,080
I heard

4
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,720
that those bandits are brutal.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,240
Bandits?

6
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,880
Does Your Highness
know their whereabouts?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,960
How would I know?

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,520
You really don't know, Your Highness?

9
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,400
Is it that you don't know

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:37,000
or you just don't want to tell me?

11
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,640
I don't know.

12
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,840
Fine.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,240
Since Your Highness refused to tell,

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,240
let it be, then.

15
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,400
It's late.

16
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,000
I won't bother you anymore.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,920
General.

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:02,880
Your Highness.

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,120
Farewell.

20
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,080
Young Mistress.

21
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,600
Young Master is ill.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,920
I feel sorry for you.

23
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,240
The night of pleasure
is always too short.

24
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,600
I'll leave you alone now.

25
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,720
I'm sorry about this.

26
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,640
This is what they do in all the shows.

27
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:09,720
What's wrong with you?

28
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,480
This room is not windproof at all.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,720
No wonder you're having a fever.

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,280
Thankfully, I always
bring medicine with me.

31
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:36,880
Here.

32
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,200
That's it.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,520
You've taken the medicine.

34
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,080
You'll recover in no time.

35
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:45,960
I'm off now.

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,280
Take care.

37
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,440
It's me.

38
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,080
It's you.

39
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,200
Are you really going
to let me serve you?

40
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,920
Shut up now.

41
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,680
Let's go.

42
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,240
Your Highness.

43
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,760
Didn't you say

44
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,960
you are going to be the future queen.

45
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,160
You shouldn't take
anything from other men.

46
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,400
He's not just some other man.

47
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,000
(Princess Fei'er is
the kindest lady I've ever met.)

48
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,240
(She's as pure as the moon in the sky.)

49
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,840
I'm going to General Sa.

50
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,360
General Sa.

51
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,200
I have something to tell you.

52
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,360
What is it, Your Highness?

53
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,240
General Sa.

54
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,480
I know I'm wrong.

55
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,360
But I don't have other choices.

56
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,320
Your Highness.

57
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,800
I don't think

58
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,200
we have anything to say
to each other anymore.

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,960
General Sa.

60
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,240
I'll tell you where the Queen is.

61
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,240
Good dog.

62
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Good dog.

63
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,560
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,280
I'm so sorry.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:01,880
Please.

66
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,480
Don't bark.

67
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,800
I'm so sorry.

68
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:07,640
Good dog.

69
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,960
Please stop.

70
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:10,960
Oh, no.

71
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,920
We will get caught because of a dog.

72
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,120
You two!

73
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,120
Where do you think you're going?

74
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,440
No, no.

75
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,280
Calm down.

76
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,120
You want to run away?

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,960
Kill them.

78
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,440
Please don't.

79
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,920

Your Majesty.

How are you?

87
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,120
Are you hurt?

Wait.

Wait.

92
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,040
You are the King?

How dare you bring a few minions

and pretend to be the King?
