3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,920
The time has come.

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,080
Here comes the Queen.

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,960
The time has come.

6
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,120
Here comes the Queen.

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,480
Wait.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,160
My Queen

9
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,600
should be chosen by me.

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
(Performer Wang Zheng)

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:39,640
Cheers.

12
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:42,320
Bottoms up for me.

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,360
You drink as you wish.

14
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,520
Zheng, I lost my job.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,040
And I lost my boyfriend.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,240
I lost everything.

17
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:01,760
Liangliang.

18
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,040
I can't live with you anymore.

19
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,680
I'm moving in with my boyfriend.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,360
(He was actually my boyfriend.)

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,920
(Roommate wanted)
I lost my job.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,120
My boyfriend ran away with my bestie.

23
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,280
God.

24
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,880
When will you give me a man

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,240
(Performer Wang Zheng)
like Wang Zheng.

26
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,760
Earthquake?

27
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,080
The time has come.

28
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,280
Here comes the Queen.

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,040
Report!

30
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,520
Your Majesty!

31
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,880
The Queen...

32
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
The Queen ran away with a guard!

33
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,240
What?

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,280
Chancellor.

35
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:30,800
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,360
Is it possible to postpone the wedding?

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:34,920
I'm afraid not, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,320
Choosing the right date
is the work of God, not man.

39
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,920
Missing the right time

40
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,720
can bring bad luck to this land.

41
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,600
Where can we find a new Queen now?

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,280
How about

43
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,400
Princess Feier?

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,280
The Princess is virtuous,

45
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,880
beautiful, and intelligent.

46
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,200
Not to mention Her Highness
is His Majesty's cousin.

47
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:56,160
I can't think of another person
who suits the title better.

48
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,720
They grew up together.

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,800
A marriage within the clan.

50
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,520
Aunt.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,720
I don't want to get married.

52
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,440
I want to be with you forever.

53
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,760
This is the will of God.

54
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,560
Prepare for the wedding.

55
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,040
Yes.

56
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,000
Wait.

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,080
My Queen

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,640
should be chosen by me.

59
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,800
How can that be?

60
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,440
Chosen by His Majesty himself?

61
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,760
The whole country is at stake.

62
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,320
This is a serious matter.

63
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
Please reconsider.

64
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,440
(Mingguang Palace)
Where am I?

65
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,680
Why is no one here?

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,800
No signal?

67
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,720
I can't hear a thing.

68
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,560
Hello? Grandma?

69
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,120
I got no signal.

70
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,160
Ah! It's so noisy here.

71
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm not home. I...

72
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
What's that in your hand?

73
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Look at this, grandma.

74
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,200
Are they cosplaying here?

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
Hold this for me.

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,040
Look.

77
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,760
Why are you hiding?

78
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,040
Excuse me.

79
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,400
(This girl is so special.)

80
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,320
(She can probably get me out of this.)

81
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,640
These NPCs are so old.

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,080
Have you had enough?

83
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,920
Hold her down!

84
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:51,920
Wait.

85
00:05:13,152 --> 00:05:16,160
(Performer Wang Zheng)

86
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,800
Wang Zheng.

87
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,160
You can't do this, Your Majesty.

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,800
This is outrageous!

89
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,520
This is my Queen.

90
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,800
Let's go, Princess Xiangxiang.

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,360
What's this place?

92
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:28,401
♪Traces of time and space,
and forgotten galaxies♪

93
00:06:29,312 --> 00:06:35,385
♪Time alternates our relationship♪

♪The sea of stars is pretty and quiet♪

♪Get close to you♪
