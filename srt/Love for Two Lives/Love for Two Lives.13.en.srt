00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,960
The Princess must've had a rough journey

9
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,320
coming all the way back here.

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,960
She needs more food.

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:21,680
I do.

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,960
I was in the desert alone
when I woke up.

13
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,440
I was starving on the way.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,000
I was worried about you.

15
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,280
I sent out people looking for you.

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,800
Now I can finally rest assured

17
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,160
seeing you are safe.

18
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,160
Oh.

19
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:39,800
Where's your king?

20
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,560
When is he marrying me?

21
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,480
Princess.

22
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,960
I have to tell you the truth.

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,560
His Majesty

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,760
has a new Queen now.

25
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:50,840
What?

26
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,120
Don't be mad, Princess.

27
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,400
How about I send people

28
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,000
to escort you back home?

29
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,000
No.

30
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,120
I have to be the Queen.

31
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,040
I left Dongshan Kingdom to get married.

32
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,040
How can I go back like this?

33
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,320
Hong Guo'er.

34
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,520
Prepare water
for the Princess to clean up.

35
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,480
Your Majesty.

36
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,920
Don't play stupid with me.

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,880
If I can't get married,

38
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,400
the thousands of soldiers
in Dongshan Kingdom

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,360
won't let you off the hook so easily.

40
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,160
Princess.

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,600
The new Queen

42
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,080
is a witch.

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,440
She enchanted His Majesty.

44
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,200
The court failed to convince him.

45
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,360
She's even disrespectful

46
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,160
to Her Majesty.

47
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:32,800
Ay.

48
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,240
I'm getting old.

49
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,360
His Majesty

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,640
won't listen to me anymore.

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,080
Unbelievable!

52
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,240
She enchants my future husband?

53
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:44,360
Where is the witch?

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,440
I'll go see her.

55
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,080
You should finish
your meal first, Princess.

56
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,440
The witch is very strong.

57
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,800
What?

58
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,760
Lv Guo'er, show her the way.

59
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,040
Fei'er.

60
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,040
You are getting better and better.

61
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,800
One day you'll be
the head of this palace

62
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:09,800
and everyone will kneel before you.

63
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,600
It's because I have
you as my teacher, Aunt.

64
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,120
Where is the witch?

65
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
Come out.

66
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,840
Witch.

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,480
Show yourself.

68
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,240
We tried our best to stop her,

69
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,560
but she fought her way in.

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,840
Who are you?

71
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,160
Strong.

72
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,880
Handsome.

73
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,080
I like you.

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,960
You may leave now.

75
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,720
Yes.

76
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,320
Who are you?

77
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,880
How dare you break into
my resting palace?

78
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:56,960
What?

79
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,280
You are the King?

80
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,880
You are not quite good enough

81
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,400
to be my husband.

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,120
Are you Princess Xiangxiang?

83
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,240
So it's you, witch!

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,560
I'll kill you here and now.

85
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,680
Who said you can touch my Queen?

86
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:17,560
Your Majesty.

87
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,600
You are the ones who are unreasonable.

88
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,360
Did you forget about our engagement?

89
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,560
What do you want?

90
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll give you three days

91
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
to get rid of her.

92
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,000
Otherwise,

93
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,760
the soldiers in Dongshan Kingdom

94
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
will tread over your Kingdom.

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,120
She's not kidding.

96
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,120
What a shame.

97
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,040
If I weren't engaged,

98
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,760
you can be my husband.

99
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,800
I'm talking about you.

100
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,840
It's so boring here.

101
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
Give me a tour around your palace.

102
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,760
What are you going to do
three days later?

103
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,800
Are you going to marry her?

104
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,200
Are you worrying about that she'll

105
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:32,960
take your place?

106
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,680
Don't flatter yourself.

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,400
I don't want to be your Queen.

108
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,880
She's so strong.

109
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,400
I'm afraid you can never win her.

110
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
Is that so?

111
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,160
Yeah.

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,520
In your language,

113
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,920
are you jealous?

114
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,880
Jealous?

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,840
I'm not.

116
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,080
No way.

117
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,600
Weird guy. Let's go, Zhenzhen.

118
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,320
You have a good taste,
Princess Xiangxiang.

119
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,720
These are all best of the best.

120
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,520
General Sa, let me take some of them.

121
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,800
I can take it.

122
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,120
Then why are you sweating so much?

123
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
You broke them?

124
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,640
I'm sorry, Princess.

125
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,400
I really like that bracelet.

126
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,880
Princess, I have a lot of bracelets.

127
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,280
You can have them all.

128
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,160
You are a handsome man,

129
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,840
so I'll let it pass.
