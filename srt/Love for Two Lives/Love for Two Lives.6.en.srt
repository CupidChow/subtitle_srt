Aunt.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,280
Let's do it before the King gets here.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,840
Kill her as soon as possible.

6
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,120
The time has come.

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,320
Hang the witch.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,400
Wait!

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:25,720
What is it?

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,960
I'm pregnant with the King's child.

11
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,720
How dare you hang me?

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,360
Don't listen to her nonsense.

13
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,680
This witch can both climb and jump.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,120
And I caught her running
around the palace yesterday.

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,880
It's impossible that she's pregnant.

16
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,200
Don't miss the right hour.

17
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:43,360
Hang the witch.

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,920
You need the right time to hang me?

I shouldn't have got you involved.

Queen Mother.

She's not a witch.

32
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,520
Just let her go.

33
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,000
She's innocent.

34
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,800
Don't, Aunt.

35
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,240
We don't know what will happen
if we let her go.

36
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,360
That's right, Feier.

Guards.

38
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,080
The King is enchanted by the witch.

Kill the witch!

40
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,520
Don't touch her!

41
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,040
Get her!

42
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,720
Wait.

43
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,920
I'll tell you the truth.

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,200
I'm not a witch.

45
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
Actually,

46
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
I'm a fairy.

47
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,480
Fairy?

48
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,720
Fairy?

49
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,880
Fairy?

50
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Ridiculous.

51
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,480
This is ridiculous.

52
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,120
I was roaming around here

53
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
and foresaw

54
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,280
that the new Queen

55
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,440
of this country

56
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,400
would disappear for some reason.

57
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:39,040
For the future of this Kingdom,

58
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,160
I decided to stay and be the new Queen.

59
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,000
She's lying.

60
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,400
Aunt, you should kill her now.

61
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,440
You...

62
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,400
Her Majesty will never kill a fairy

63
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,720
just so you can be the Queen.

64
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,200
I won't

65
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,360
wrong anyone.

66
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,440
As long as you can prove it.

67
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,520
I... I ran out of my power.

68
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,800
Right.

69
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,760
I need time to restore it.

70
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,560
Don't let her go, Aunt.

71
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
She'd run away.

72
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
If she runs away,
it only proves that she's a witch.

73
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,160
She can never come back.

74
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,520
Then,

75
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,200
you'll still be the Queen.

76
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,480
Fine.

77
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,400
I'll give you half an hour.

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,080
This is the key.

79
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:41,760
Take it

80
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,480
and go.

81
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,400
Wait for me.

82
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,320
I'll be back.

83
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,840
Out of my way.

84
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,800
Why is she leaving?

85
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,720
Aunt, the incense is almost burned out.

86
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,760
The witch fled to escape punishment.

87
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,120
We'll choose a new Queen

88
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,680
some other day.

89
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:32,800
But,

90
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,000
where do we get a Queen now?

91
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,640
How about

92
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
Princess Feier?

93
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,760
The Princess is virtuous,

94
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,360
beautiful, and intelligent.

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,640
Not to mention Her Highness
is His Majesty's cousin.

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,640
I can't think of another person
who suits the title better.

97
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,920
That's right.

98
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,640
They grew up together.

99
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,400
A marriage within the clan.

100
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,680
That's right.

101
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:58,920
Aunt.

102
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,360
I don't want to get married.

103
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,120
I want to be with you forever.

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,680
This is the will of God.

105
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,080
Prepare for the wedding.

106
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,840
Yes.

107
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,480
You mortals are too blind
to recognize a real fairy.

108
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,240
She's a fairy?

109
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,000
What are you doing here?

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,600
I'm here in the human world to save you.
