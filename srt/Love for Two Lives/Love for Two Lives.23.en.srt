Why are you so careless?

It's okay.

It'll heal in a minute.

If you want to help,

just stay here.

Zhenzhen, look.

00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Look at that guy over there.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,440
The one who's cooking.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,480
Is he handsome?

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,840
He's my boyfriend.

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,200
Are you hungry, Zhenzhen?

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,760
Does it smell nice?

Here.

Wow.

18
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,800
Where did you learn these?

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,480
Your grandma taught me

20
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,520
last time. Go ahead.

21
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:11,240
I'll try this.

22
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:15,840
Is it good?

23
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
Yes.

24
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,200
I didn't know you are a good cook.

25
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:22,600
You'll be in charge of feeding us then.

26
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,120
Whatever you say,

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,160
my Queen.

28

Wait.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,560
You got something on your mouth.

30
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,160
What are you thinking about?

31
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,200
Nothing.

You had it coming.

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,080
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,360
Lord Xu is here to see you.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,560
Oh.

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,720
My brother Xu just came back
to the palace.

38
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,480
My Queen.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,880
Enjoy your meal.

40
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:33,680
I'll go

41
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,440
see my brother.

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,920
Xu.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,400
Brother.

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,640
Good day.

45
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,560
Enough of the etiquette.

46
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,640
Hi, brother.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,400
Is it right to greet you
like this, brother?

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,360
It is.

49
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,080
Stop making fun of me.

50
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,840
Come. Sit down.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,280
It's been so many years.

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,760
You've grown up a lot.

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You do look like a king now.

54
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,680
You too, Xu.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,600
I still remember
when you left the palace,

56
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,360
you were just a little boy.

57
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,040
Back then,

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,240
I was only about eight years old.

59
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,920
Thanks to you, brother,

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,200
I had a comfortable life
outside the palace.

61
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:35,760
Yes.

62
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,440
A lot have changed

63
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,960
in the palace.

64
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,360
The rules are all new.

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,440
I heard

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,360
it's the Queen's work.

67
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
How great.

68
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,680
She must be a smart lady.

69
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:53,960
Brother,

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
where is the Queen?

71
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,000
Liangliang.

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,200
Liangliang.

73
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,200
Xu.

74
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
This is my Queen.

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:09,520
Liangliang.

76
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,320
This is my little brother, Xu.

77
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,040
Hi, buddy.

78
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,040
Have you eaten?

79
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,160
Good day, sister.

80
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,360
Why didn't you tell me to change?

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:22,680
Go inside.

82
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,000
The Queen

83
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,080
is peculiar indeed.

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,560
Right?

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,560
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,040
Lord Xu is back.

87
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,160
He has been out of the palace for years.

88
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,280
What could've brought him back?

89
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,960
That witch is winning over
more and more people.

90
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,320
Maybe,

91
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,240
Lord Xu can help me.

92
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,560
When did you prepare this?

93
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560
Look here.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,600
Happy birthday.

95
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,360
How did you know it's my birthday?

96
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,320
Your grandma told me

97
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,520
the other day.

98
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,680
How romantic.

99
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Come.

100
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:44,880
Sit down.

101
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,040
How many candles do we need? One?

102
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,760
Make a wish.

103
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,200
What did you wish for?

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,720
It won't come true if I tell you.

105
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:18,720
Liangliang.

106
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,520
Happy birthday.

107
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,120
I'm very happy to meet you
at this point of my life.

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,840
We didn't go through too much hardship.

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,720
I have a surprise for you.

110
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,240
Come.

111
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,160
Close your eyes.

112
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,560
Don't you think it's too soon?

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,840
Close them.

114
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,600
Okay.

115
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,240
I'm not ready yet.

116
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,720
Are you going to propose?

117
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
You must've spent a lot money on it.

118
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,640
Open your eyes.

119
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,240
Do you like it?

120
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,160
Kid's watch?

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,680
I have one too.

122
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,320
It can light up.

123
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,120
Isn't that great?

124
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,480
It really is.

125
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,000
Happy birthday.

126
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,160
Happy birthday.

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Liangliang.

128
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,640
It's you two.

129
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:37,400
Liangliang.

130
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,720
Fei'er made rejuvenation soup for you.

131
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,120
It can make you look
younger and more beautiful.

132
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,440
Are you saying I'm old?

133
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,800
Well. Thanks a lot.

134
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,400
Come sit down.

135
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:52,480

Thank you.

138
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:56,880
Wait.

139
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,800
I have to say something
as the star today.

140
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:00,880
Go ahead.

141
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,040
First of all,

142
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720
I thank the three of you
who are paramount in the palace

143
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,760
for coming here
to celebrate my birthday.

144
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,960
Second, for our friendship.

145
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,200
And last,

What truth?

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,480
What dare?

155

Well,

"Fei'er likes General Sa very much",

159

that's truth.

160
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,320
Don't say that.
