3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:08,680
Ready?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,800
Yes.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,120
(Oh, no.)

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,280
(I'll see how you get away with that.)

7
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,160
(How dare you fight for
the title with my family?)

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,160
(Save me!)

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:24,880
Wait.

10
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,240
Step down.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,400
Queen Mother,

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,280
I have something to tell you.

13
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:49,280
My Queen

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,200
is not Princess Xiangxiang.

15
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,080
She's not?

16
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,840
So who is she?

17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,600
An imposter?

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,200
I asked her to do all of this.

19
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,000
If Queen Mother has to blame someone,

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,000
just blame me.

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,640
(He's a loyal person though.)

22
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:14,400
I see.

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,000
Queen.

24
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,240
Is the King telling the truth?

25
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,040
Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm not Princess Xiangxiang.

27
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,760
But,

28
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,120
Your Majesty.

29
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,040
We really love each other.

30
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,240
The fruit of our love is inside me.

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,600
I beg you, Your Majesty.

32
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,440
Your Majesty.

33
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,440
You are going to be a father soon.

34
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,720
Yes, Queen Mother.

35
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,160
We love each other.

36
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,360
Please allow us to be together.

37
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,600
If you have to punish one of us,

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,000
just punish me.

39
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,000
Since you love each other,

40
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,760
and now she's pregnant,

41
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,160
what can I say?

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll let it pass today.

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,320
Thank you, Queen Mother.

44
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,320
But,

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,560
since you are not Princess Xiangxiang,

46
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,480
we'll have to reconsider

47
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,520
who is more suitable

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,240
to be the Queen.

49
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,480
I'm going to be an intern Queen?

50
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:48,440
Shut up.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
I'm totally beat.

52
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,040
Your Majesty.

53
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,960
Is my job finished?

54
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,800
Can you be the Queen
for two more months?

55
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,960
What? Two more months?

56
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,000
No way.

57
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,080
The Queen Mother would
never let me be the Queen.

58
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,480
I've proposed to
Princess Guzha in Qixi Kingdom.

59
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,200
I need two more months.

60
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,680
During that time,

61
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,200
you don't need to be the real Queen.

62
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,920
You just need to

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,640
pass her tests.

64
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,360
No, no.

65
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,600
I'm not a trainee
working to be the Queen.

66
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,280
Your mom would never choose me.

67
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
She said she'd test me,

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,840
but she'll only try to kill me.

69
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
You don't need to pay for the wall.

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,680
I'll cover that myself, okay?

71
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:40,520
Goodbye.

72
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,000
No, farewell.

75
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:49,720
(Hello.)

I was just kidding.

Our fate led us

79
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,400
where we are now.

80
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,440
I can be your Queen.

81
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
But maybe you can pay me...

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,240
Right?

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,480
6000 Yuan per month,

84
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,040
with housing fund and insurances.

85

And,

86

you take half of my house,

87
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,920
so you need to pay half of the rent.

88
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,640
And water, electricity, internet cost.

89
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,080
Okay.

90
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,040
