3
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,400
What's this place?

4
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,320
I thought Princess Xiangxiang
was left in the desert.

5
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,000
Why did she show up here?

6
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:03,400
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,840
I did send someone to
dump her in the desert.

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,320
I have no idea how she came back.

9
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,480
Our family Quan has
always been the Queen.

10
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,480
If it weren't for your stupidity,

11
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,280
Feier would've already taken the place.

12
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,800
Don't be mad, Aunt.

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,240
In my opinion,

14
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,640
she must be a fake one.

15
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,120
So why don't we just play along?

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
Who are you? Why are you at my home?

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,880
Wang... Wang Zheng?

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,960
Why are you here?

19
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,360
Some kind of surprise for fans?

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,800
Why did you tie me up?

21
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,920
I want you to be my Queen.

22
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,880
What do you mean?

23
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,320
I meant what I said.

24
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,000
Your Majesty.

25
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,960
Princess Feier wants to see you.

26
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,240
Your Majesty.

27
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,680
Your Majesty.

28
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,960
That's fine, Feier.

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
(What's going on?)

30
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,960
(Did I go back in time?)

31
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,600
You must have some of
my childhood playmates soup.

32
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,360
Thank you, Princess Feier.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
Is there anything else?

34
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,880
Three days later, it'll be
the Queen Mother's birthday.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,680
(Why are they talking like that?)

36
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,520
She wants the Queen to show
traditional tricks from Dongshan.

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,640
The Queen has been
practicing those since little.

38
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,000
She is one of the best.

39
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:46,960
The Queen Mother

40
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,280
won't be disappointed three days later.

41
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,560
I'll leave now, Your Majesty.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,440
Huang Guoer.

43
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,120
From now on,

44
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,280
no one gets in my resting palace

45
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,720
without my permission.

46
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,160
Yes.

47
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,640
(At last.)

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,960
(I should leave too.)

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:10,760
Dude.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:11,800
No.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:12,760
Your Majesty.

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,640
I'll leave if you don't need me.

53
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:15,400
Wait.

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,800
You are my Queen.
This is your resting palace.

55
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,600
Where are you going?

56
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,800
I'm telling you.

57
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,720
We are from two different worlds.

58
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,040
I'll call someone

59
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,240
to seal the wall.

60
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,800
Let's pretend that nothing happened.

61
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,520
You have to pay for the cost though.

62
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,240
Stop.

63
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,240
How can the Queen leave at will?

64
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:38,320
Looking like Wang Zheng
doesn't mean you can do anything.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,520
Where are you taking me?

66
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:47,920
Your Majesty.

67
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,400
This man disobeyed His Majesty's order

68
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
and tried to leave the palace.

69
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,680
The guards caught him.

70
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,880
What should we do
about him, Your Majesty?

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,360
Make it quick.

72
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,440
Yes.

73
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,360
That's too much.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,240
That's really too much.

75
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,640
Is that necessary?

76
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:13,360
Shoot.

77
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,560
My Queen.

78
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,600
Time to practice.

79
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
Practice what?

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,360
There are a lot to learn

81
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,360
to be my Queen.

82
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,240
The Queen Mother suspects your identity.

83
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,040
This is a test.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,160
Anyone with eyes would
know I'm not a princess.

85
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
Princess Xiangxiang is
famous for her Iron Palm.

86
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:56,320
She can chop a brick
into half with one hand.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,400
After three days,

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,840
it'll be Queen Mother's birthday.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,280
You have to practice hard,

90
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,280
if you want to stay alive.

91
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,720
I don't think I can do that.

92
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,400
Not only that,

93
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,720
the princess can also

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,040
fetch chestnut from the fire.

95
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,880
Is the princess an acrobat?

96
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,840
What the...?

97
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,840
Breaking a rock on the chest.

98
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,520
It's also one of her tricks.

99
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,600
She must be a tough lady.

100
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
