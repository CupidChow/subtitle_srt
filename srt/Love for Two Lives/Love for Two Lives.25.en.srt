00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,560
Your Majesty, this is the last memorial.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,520
You should go rest after this one.

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,720
I'm not tired.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,320
Your Majesty.

7
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,560
Are you upset because of those rumors?

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,040
No.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,120
I'm not.

10
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,640
Liangliang won't ever do that.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,720
Those are just rumors.

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,120
You love each other so much.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,840
What they said can't be real.

14

Huang Guo'er.

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,040
Do you think

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:56,880
I'm a good king?

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,720
Of course.

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,800
There would never be
so many new policies without you.

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,480
It's you who made people's life better.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,440
Am I really that important?

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,720
You are the blessing of this kingdom.

22
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,240
The people need you.

23

Zheng, are you free now?

24
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
I want to talk to you.

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:34,840
Liangliang.

26
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,160
I still have many memorials
to go through tonight.

27
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,800
I'm afraid I don't have the time.

28
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,280
Your Majesty.

29
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,800
This is the last one.

30
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,840
If you don't want to talk, Your Majesty,
you can just tell me.

31
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,320
There's no need for excuses.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,040
I'll leave you alone.

33
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:05,920
Why did you say that, Your Majesty?

34
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,440
You may leave.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,720
A little to the right, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,520
A little more.

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,640
- Your hand.
- I'll go there.

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,800
Okay, ready.

39
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,040
Hong Guo'er.

40
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:49,240
How do I look today?

41
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,040
You are glowing today,

42
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,280
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,840
This witch's things really worked.

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,160
You really saw His Majesty
got mad at her?

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,840
With my own eyes.

46
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,040
After hearing about her
and His Highness,

47
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,640
His Majesty looked very scary.

48
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,840
At last the god is on my side.

49
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,360
Unfortunately, Fei'er doesn't
want the title anymore.

50
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,200
This could've been my chance.

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,920
But I don't have anyone to use now.

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,280
Your Majesty.

53
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
What about me,

54
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,720
Your Majesty?

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,520
You?

56
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:48,960
Hong Guo'er.

57
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,320
I'll do everything for you,

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,640
even if I have to die for it.

60
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,040

No need.

66
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,960
I'm busy.

67

What are you doing?

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,960
The contract will expire soon.

69
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,160
I'm looking for a job.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,080
You are the Queen.

71
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,200
Why do you need a job?

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,680
Or is it because

73
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,440
you are ready to leave?

74
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,080

I don't know yet.

Can I rely on you forever
if I don't find a job?

You can.
