Why are you here?

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,680
Why can't I be here?

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,320
You are so quiet today, Your Majesty.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
Are you nervous about
the wedding tomorrow?

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:34,120
Why should I be nervous?

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,840
You're about to
be the head of this palace

9
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,040
and rule the whole world.

10
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,280
It's natural

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,880
that you are nervous.

12
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,240
I'm not.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,640
I don't feel anything for you.

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,080
But you are mine nonetheless.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,560
Let me go!

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,320
The whole kingdom knows what you did!

17
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,680
You took your brother's throne.

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,960
And you are stealing his girlfriend!

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,160
You have no conscience!

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,200
You are even worse than a pig!

21
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,120
Whoever disrespects me

22
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,240
will be killed.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:12,760
Kill them, huh?

24
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,000
You can kill one person.

25
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,680
But can you kill all the people?

26
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,200
You can keep one's mouth shut.

27
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,480
But can you keep everyone
from spreading the word?

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:21,480
Shut up!

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,440
You talk just like

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,360
the king.

31
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,000
No.

32
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,400
The former king.

33
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,080
Now you are showing your true color.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,320
Fine.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,960
I'm in no rush.

36
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,480
I'll wait

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,280
until we get married tomorrow.

38

if anything goes wrong.

43
