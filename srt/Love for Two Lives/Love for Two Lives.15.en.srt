3
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,200
Why are you in my bed?

4
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,600
Why are you in my bed?

5
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,000
This is my bed.

6
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,160
What happened?

7
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,480
You drank too much last night.

8
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,280
You put your arms around me

9
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,000
and said something

10
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,000
quite inappropriate.

11
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,480
No way.

12
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,000
W-What did I say?

13
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,080
You said you wanted to kill me,

14
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,160
hug me,

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,200
and marry me.

16
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:11,720
And...

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,560
It's okay.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,200
This thing can't be known

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:22,720
by anyone

20
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:23,760
except the earth,

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,760
the sky,

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:25,760
you,

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,600
and me.

24
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,160
Yeah?

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,480
How long have you been there?

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,120
Me?

27
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,160
Just a while.

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,640
You heard everything?

29
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,640
I'll go get some cigarettes.

30
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,920
How can you do this?

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,880
Do you want breakfast?

32
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,600
Yeah.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,560
Okay.

34
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,280
I'm off.

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,680
Oh.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,600
Huang Guo'er just came to tell you
the Queen Mother asked for you.

37
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,480
Well...

38
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,680
She saw you like that

39
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,920
so she didn't wake you up.

40
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,120
What?

41
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,520
What?

42
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,400
Like what?

43
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,000
Wait.

44
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,880
Like what?

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,320
Hey.

46
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,840
Get this straight.

47
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:09,840
Come back.

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,120
Hey.

49
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,760
Don't run your mouth.

50
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,080
Mr. Li.

51
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,120
Safe journey.

52
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,600
Have a happy life over there.

53
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,120
Try to have two kids in three years,

54
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,040
and six in five.

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,360
Please don't say that.

56
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:31,680
Wait.

57
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,840
Why six?

58
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,160
Twins.

59
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,280
Oh.

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,200
She must have good fertility.

61
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,840
Your Majesty.

62
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,840
When a foreign lady
marries our court member,

63
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,040
she needs to be purified
at the Yima Spring

64
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,640
and worship the goddess.

65
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,680
The fairy Queen has great power.

66
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,040
You should go with the princess.

67
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,120
Me?

68
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,880
Why do I have to go?

69
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
What about the chancellor?

70
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,120
Where is he?

71
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,720
Isn't that his responsibility?

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,520
The Chancellor saw
your great magic power

73
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,880
and felt incompetent.

74
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,040
He went back for more training.

75
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,560
General Sa.

76
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,680
I'll go to the mountain to take a bath.

77
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,760
We'll go home after.

78
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
Wait for me here.

79
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,640
Don't worry, Princess.

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,560
General Sa will wait for you
in the palace after a bath.

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,760
Let's go, Queen.

82
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,360
Right away.

83
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,280
Aunt.

84
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,200
Come back as soon as it's done.

85
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,080
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

86
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,200
I actually look forward to

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,520
a random trip like this.

88
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,760
Be careful on the way, Your Majesty.

89
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,800
I will.

90
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,800
Have fun.

91
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:19,720
Yeah. Let's go.

92
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,760
Princess.

93
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,360
I have a question.

94
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,800
You are so good to General Sa.

95
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,760
Now he's going so far away to marry.

96
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,400
Why do you look so happy?

97
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,720
Because...

98
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,760
None of those people are coming back.

99
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:12,097
♪Traces of time and space,
and forgotten galaxies♪

100
00:06:13,008 --> 00:06:19,081
♪Time alternates our relationship♪

101
00:06:20,529 --> 00:06:23,874
♪The sea of stars is pretty and quiet♪

102
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:27,024
♪The rain touches the breath♪

103
00:06:27,802 --> 00:06:30,563
♪Get close to you♪
