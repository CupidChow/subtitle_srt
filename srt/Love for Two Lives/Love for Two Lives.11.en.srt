3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:14,880
Your Majesty.

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,120
He's my boss!

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:17,480
Your Majesty.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:20,880
No!

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,880
It's broken.

8
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,520
What's going on here?

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,400
Your Majesty.

10
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,440
It's a long story.

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,680
(I'm a technology fanatic.)

12
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,880
(I accidentally triggered
the time machine)

13
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,960
(and ended up here as a general.)

14
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:52,880
(It was a mista...)

15
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,880
(No.)

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,120
(It was fate.)

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:58,720
- Hotpot.
- It's hot.

18
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:02,960
Here.

19
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,320
Let's put these in.

20
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,200
Wait

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,240
until we finish the food in the pot.

22
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:09,600
Hotpot.

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,120
Delicious.

24
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,280
I haven't had it for three months.

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,440
I'll definitely buy this again.

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,480
Here. Have more.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,480
But,

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,280
there's something I don't understand.

29
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
As a businessman in utopia,

30
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,480
how did you win all those battles?

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:29,680
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,200
There's a thing called

33
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,280
technology.

34
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,200
Do you know drones?

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,680
They can fly to the sky.

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,520
Way up to the sky.

37
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,120
They take pictures.

38
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,280
The enemies' lineup can be clearly seen.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,080
Boom.

40
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,680
We can burn all their supplies.

41
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,880
Easy.

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:01:59,600
Technology.

43
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,720
Technology.

44
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:01,760
But,

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:02,560
what about

46
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,800
your Sa's Kungfu

47
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,280
that frightened so many enemies away?

48
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,240
What's that?

49
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,560
Sa's Kungfu?

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:16,680
Yes.

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
You startled me.

52
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,360
The time is calling.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,720
Boss.

54
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,040
Wait.

55
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,040
I can do that too.

56
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Let me join.

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:35,720
Come on.

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,920
You know it too, my Queen?

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,040
That's enough.

60
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:47,760
Hurry up.

61
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,520
Go back.

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:57,560
Is it okay?

63
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,680
Yeah.

64
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,560
I stuck it back up.

65
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,720
Well...

66
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,200
Liangliang.

67
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,160
I might

68
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,200
have to use

69
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,640
your space-time crack for now.

70
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,880
I need to come here to travel.

71
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,600
Do you mind?

72
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,600
It's okay.

73
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,680
It's actually pretty nice
to just leave it there.

74
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:25,880
Here.

75
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,200
Drink.

76
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,360
Cheers.

77
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,480
So, Your Majesty.

78
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,320
Is it good?

79
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,360
It is.

80
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,840
Boss.

81
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,760
I have a question too.

82
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,000
I've always been curious about it.

83
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,600
What question?

84
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,000
You were born rich.

85
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
Why did you leave your life

86
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,720
and come here to be a general?

87
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,440
It's a rough job.

88
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,560
And you'll get none of the nice food.

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,440
I...

90
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,280
Well...

91
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,800
Oh!

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,280
I know it.

93
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,720
You are here for someone.

94
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,440
A woman.

95
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,320
The Queen Mother is getting old.

96
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,360
But she...

97
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,400
The Queen Mother?

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,160
I'm telling you.

99
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,280
Be careful with your words.

100
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,400
You don't know...

101
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,600
You fell in love with an older woman?

102
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,240
This is my secret.

103
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,560
Do you think

104
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,000
I can trust General Sa?

105
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,440
General Sa is the bravest warrior
in the Kingdom.

106
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,000
He's courageous, upright,

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,480
and very loyal to you, Your Majesty.

108
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,280
General Sa will get rid of that witch.

109
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
The bravest warrior.

110
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
I can only count on you

111
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,800
for now.

112
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,200
Truth or dare?

113
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,000
Truth.

114
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,200
Your Majesty.

115
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,200
I'll ask away then.

116
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,000
Do you have someone on your mind?

117
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,000
I do.

118
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:28,840
Who is it?

119
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:38,207
♪Traces of time and space,
and forgotten galaxies♪

120
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:45,191
♪Time alternates our relationship♪

121
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,984
♪The sea of stars is pretty and quiet♪

122
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:53,134
♪The rain touches the breath♪

123
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:56,673
♪Get close to you♪
