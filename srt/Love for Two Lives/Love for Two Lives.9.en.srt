00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,400
Where did you get that suit?

4
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,160
I bought it with my jade.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,400
Thank you so much for doing that for me.

6
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,360
Did you see their faces?

7
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:21,480
You helped me before.

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,000
I should return the favor.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:25,680
Thank you.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,240
Don't.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,840
Not in the car.

12
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,320
Hold it.

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,200
You'll get used to it.

14
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,000
What's that place?

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,400
Just pull over there, mister.

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,440
I'll bring you somewhere.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,120
Let's go.

18
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,480
Your Stinky Tofu.

19
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,440
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,200
This is my favorite food.

21
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
What kind of food is this?

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,600
I can't stand the smell.

23
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,720
Stinky but tasty.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,520
Try it.

25
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,400
I'll never try it.

26
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:47,680
(Beers for cheers)

27
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:11,960
You don't like it?

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,200
No.

29
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:15,560
So,

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,240
what are the ones you don't like?

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,760
This, this, and that one.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,000
I don't like these.

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:23,840
Okay.

34
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,960
We'll take all the rest.

35
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,880
Do you need help?

36
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,840
It's okay, Your Majesty. It's not heavy.

37
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,160
So, Your Majesty.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:50,960
Are you hungry?

39
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,720
I'll make something for you.

40
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,200
But we just ate.

41
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,200
I'll make you something

42
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,640
even better than Stinky Tofu.

43
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,480
This smells even worse than Stinky Tofu.

44
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,280
So it must taste even better.

45
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,160
My boyfriend for five years is gone.

46
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:25,640
My Queen.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,240
Why are you crying?

48
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,360
Ah?

49
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,960
This smell is too strong.

50
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
My Queen,

51
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,280
I won't let you cry

52
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,840
anymore.

53
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,520
It's really the smell.

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Everyone in the court
worships that witch as a fairy.

55
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,160
This witch

56
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,200
is making new rules

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,520
and lying to the court.

58
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,640
I'm afraid she'll be a trouble to us.

59
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,880
Chancellor, do you have any ideas?

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,360
That fairy's magic is very powerful.

61
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,400
There's not much I can do.

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,280
You mean

63
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,840
I should just let her be?

64
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,040
I didn't mean that, Your Majesty.

65
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:21,560
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

66
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,400
General Sa is coming back today.

67
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,520
Soon, the witch won't be
a bother anymore.

68
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:34,760
Jaa!

69
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:36,560
Jaa!

70
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:45,600
Jaa!

71
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,760
General Sa.

72
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,120
You are back at last, General Sa.

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,560
Someone peeps at us bathing lately.

74
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,080
Don't worry.

75
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,240
I'll get him.

76
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,360
General Sa.

77
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,160
The pills you gave me last time.

78
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,600
Are there more?

79
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,760
Right away.

80
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,000
Thank you, General.

81
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:13,880
General Sa.

82
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,360
The spices Xishui Kingdom sent here
taste fairly bitter.

83
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,040
Can you please examine it?

84
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,000
Bring them to me.

85
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,160
General Sa is meeting
the Queen Mother tomorrow.

86
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:21,960
Let him rest, everyone.

87
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:22,560
That's quite enough.

88
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,760
Are you in there?

89
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,000
Open the door.

90
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,080
Are you inside?

91
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,120
Open the door.

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,000
I need the bathroom.

93
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Come out now.

94
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
The door is locked.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,960
What?

96
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,160
I can't get it open.

97
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,720
How can that be?

98
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
I've taught you.

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,680
Just twist it

100
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,720
and press it.

101
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,200
Hurry up.

102
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
No.

103
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,640
The other way.

104
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,560
Twist it.

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,760
It won't open.

106
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,080
Hurry up. I can't hold it any longer.

107
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,120
I need the bathroom.

108
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,000
Liangliang.

109
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:21,640
Liangliang.

110
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,320
How can I get out?
