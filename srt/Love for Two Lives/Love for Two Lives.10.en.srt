3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,360
Your Majesty, General Sa is here.

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,600
Send him in.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,760
Your Majesty, Your Highness.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,200
General.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
Your Highness.

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,240
It's been months
since I last saw Your Majesty.

9
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,080
You don't look too well, Your Majesty.

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,280
Come forward.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,600
General, have you heard about

12
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,880
the witch in the palace?

13
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,320
She cast a spell on His Majesty
and the whole court.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
Not only she's the Queen now,

15
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,320
and she even calls herself a fairy.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
She has more power in the palace

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,000
than I do now.

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,120
The Queen is not Princess Xiangxiang

19
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,160
who is engaged to the His Majesty?

20
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,000
Princess Xiangxiang
went missing in the desert.

21
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,240
The Queen is an unknown woman.

22
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,720
Unknown?

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:20,960
General.

24
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,200
This woman is good at enchanting people

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,640
with her witchcraft.

26
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,120
Please be careful around her.

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,960
I don't believe in
such a thing as witches.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,800
I'll go see her.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:40,760
Please help us, General.

30
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,920
Yes.

31
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,040
Your Majesty.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,280
I'll leave now.

33
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,320
General Sa.

34
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,280
Your Highness.

35
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,400
What is it?

36
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,560
This is a craft she left.

37
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
Rest assured, Your Highness.

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
Thank you, General Sa.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,560
General.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,440
Your Highness.

41
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,680
Is there anything else?

42
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,400
You have to be careful.

43
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
She is evil.

44
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,640
Who are you?

45
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,560
How dare you kidnap the fairy Queen?

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,640
Is this yours?

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,680
This is my craft.

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,120
The holy fire stick.

49
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,040
Are you afraid?

50
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,760
The holy fire stick?

51
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,480
You are...

52
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,320
You are...

53
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,640
From the real world?

54
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,760
You're done pretending?

55
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,160
I am.

56
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
Then I'm done too.

57
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:09,880
Hello.

58
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
Golden Age Culture Corporation.

59
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,600
Li Xiang.

60
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,200
You are my boss?

61
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,400
Which department are you in?

62
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,360
I'm with Director Hui...

63
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,760
Doesn't matter.

64
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,360
It doesn't matter.

65
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,840
Did you take it?

66
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,200
Take what?

67
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:31,960
Well.

68
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,160
This.

69
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,240
A girl?

70
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:41,800
It's green.

71
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,080
A hat?

72
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,040
I've had the same experience.

73
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,120
No.

74
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,680
The time machine.

75
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,360
What's that?

76
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,520
How did you get here?

77
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,040
My boyfriend broke up with me.

78
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:03,840
Okay.

79
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,040
My...

80
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,240
My boyfriend ran away with my bestie.

81
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,840
- I was sad.
- Okay.

82
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,440
I was drinking.

83
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,480
And I was in the bathtub.

84
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,560
The strawberry bath salt
smelt really nice.

85
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,600
I was in the tub with the fan blowing.

86
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,880
Then there was thunder.

87
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,960
And then,

88
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
the wall cracked for some reason.

89
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,480
It cracked,

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,520
and I thought...

91
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,160
Wait.

92
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,360
- The wall cracked?
- Yeah.

93
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,360
Take me to the wall.

94
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,000
Now.

95
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,000
Your Majesty.

96
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,440
General Sa has caught the witch.

97
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,680
This is her craft that we confiscated.

98
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,120
She's not that powerful after all.

99
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
She just had a lot of crafts.

100
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,200
General Sa

101
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,080
will teach her a lesson.

102
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,120
Boss, you haven't paid me
for three months.

103
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,920
How is that possible?

104
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,440
I pay my employees
even when I'm losing money.

105
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:18,920
You don't know?

106
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,360
Your secretary ran away with your money.

107
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,280
Your company went bankrupt.

108
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,320
How is that possible?

109
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,040
My company went bankrupt?

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,400
Yeah.

111
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:28,960
My secretary?

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,840
Yeah.

113
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,400
The one surnamed Hao?

114
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,160
Yeah.

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
My god.

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,560
What's your name?

117
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,600
Yao Liangliang.

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
- Yao Liangliang.
- Yeah.

119
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay.

120
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,640
Find him for me.

121
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,360
I'll give you what I owe you

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,480
and three months more.

123
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,200
For real?

124
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:47,920
For real.

125
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,600
You are a good boss.

126
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,440
Take this off me.

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,400
It hurts a little.

128
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:55,880
No.

129
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,400
Wait until I see the time machine.

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,360
Let's go.

131
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,200
This is the one.

132
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
This is the time machine?

133
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,320
Where did you get it?

134
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,520
Your company went bankrupt.

135
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,320
And there's no money.

136
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,080
They took everything
that was worth a dime.

137
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,920
I took this.

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,880
My god.

139
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,680
Boss, will you take this off?

140
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:26,840
Fine.

141
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:44,920
Your Majesty.

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,120
He's my boss!

143
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,400
