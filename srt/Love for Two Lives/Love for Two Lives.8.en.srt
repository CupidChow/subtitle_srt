18
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,000
We are going to get married.

19
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:46,720
She's the only one I'll marry.

20
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll propose to her very soon.

21
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,360
Propose now.

22
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:50,720

Just say it like that later.

00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,120
Okay.

26
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,760
We can go now.

27
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,560
What an infatuated young man.

28
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,440
Thank you.

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:18,920
Let's go, this way.

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,640
Why are you throwing up?

31
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I feel sick.

32
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:34,920
I need to rest.

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,960
It's all over your clothes.

34
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,560
We can't go like that.

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,440
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,360
Never mind. We are not going then.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,600
I'll just never see them again.

38
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,720
Liangliang, why are you still here?

39
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,760
Everyone's waiting.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,520
I... I'm going up in a minute.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
Hurry up.

00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,520
Well.

44
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,120
I'll go greet them
and I'll come down right after.

45
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,080
You just sit here.

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,280
Wait for me. Don't go anywhere.

47
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,160
Okay.

48
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,280
I'll be right back.

49
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:43,720
Cheers.

50
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,160
Come on.

51
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,720
Enjoy yourselves, everyone.

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,360
Come on, guys.

53
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,520
Let's toast to our reunion.

54
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Come on.

55
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,600
Here.

56
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,160
Best wishes to you guys.

00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,160
You are a perfect match.

58
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,040
Liangliang.

59
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,440
Hehe.

60
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:17,160
You are...

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,720
It's me.

62
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,160
Feng.

63
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,440
Oh.

64
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:23,960
Feng.

65
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,680
Now you remember.

66
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,120
It's been many years.

67
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Let's have a few more drinks.

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,760
They said in the group chat

69
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,520
that you and Qian Jun broke up.

70
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:38,920
Yeah.

71
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,360
Here.

72
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,400
He just got promoted to be a manager

73
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,320
and spent 70,000 on a car.

74
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,880
Now he's got his nose in the air.

75
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,520
He got together with Chen Lin

76
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,000
right after breaking up with you.

77
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Can you believe that?

78
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,720
Anyway,

79
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,320
only you and I are single now

80
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,720
among our classmates.

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,840
My mom kept bugging me about it.

82
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,800
I've been thinking too.

83
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,520
I have decided

84
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,560
to lower my standards.

85
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,320
I think we can make do.

86
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,480
Excuse me.

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,440
Either a match or not,

88
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,480
it's just a matter of time.

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,440
It's okay to live a life making do.

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,360
Right?

91
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,200
Liangliang.

92
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,040
I didn't expect you'd come.

93
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,480
We are

94
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,120
still good friends, right?

95
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,600
Liangliang.

96
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
Tell me,

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:33,920
when did you two

98
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,520
get together?

99
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,280
We are not together.

100
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,120
You...

101
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,080
Come here, Qian Jun.

102
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,920
Liangliang

103
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,480
has a new boyfriend now.

104
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,920
Liangliang.

105
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,040
Congratulations.

106
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,520
I'm happy for you.

107
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
Come on, everyone.

108
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,760
Let's toast to the love of
Liangliang and Feng.

109
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,520
Cheers.

110
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:10,800
Liangliang.

111
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:11,960
I'll be honest with you.

112
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
I really think

113
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,400
you two are a great match.

114
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,560
I know, right?

115
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:28,960
Liangliang.

116
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,600
Where are you going?

117
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
Excuse me, everyone.

118
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,200
Mr. Wang.

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,480
Is there

120
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,240

121
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,920
Move.

122
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,840
Mr. Wang.

123
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,560
Welcome...

It's Wang Zheng.

125
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,800
What's with your clothes?

126
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,800
The guard downstairs
wouldn't let me stay there.

127
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,800
You mean security?

128
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,640
And he told his general.

129
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,640
That's security chief.

130
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,320
Oh.

131
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,600

I love Liangliang.

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,560
We are going to get married.

136
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,520
She's the only one I'll marry.

137
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,520
I'll propose to her very soon.
