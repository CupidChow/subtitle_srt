It's okay.

00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,320
Take it.

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:10,400
Take it.

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,480
It's too much.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,200
Just take it.

00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,120
I'm good.

00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:14,600
There's way too much.

10
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,920
Take it so I can rest assured.

Ercui.

Okay.

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,800
We'll leave now, grandma.

15
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,160
Say goodbye to your aunt and uncle.

Come back often, Zheng.

I'll come back.

Go home.

Why did you take that?

This?

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,240
Grandma gave me this.

25
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,240
These are all from my childhood.

about your arrival?

35
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,320
I want to give him

a surprise.

37

This way, Your Highness.

38

I'll go that way.

39
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,560
Come. This is so special.

40
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,800
I've never seen anything like that.

It's so pretty.

Come. Look.

44
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
It looks so much like you.

45
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,640
Her Majesty taught us last time.

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,000
We can do that too.

47
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,960
Look at this.

48
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,960
It's great.

00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,160
Okay.

52
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,760
This is Lord Xu,
who left the palace years ago.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,640
Hello, Your Highness.

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,240
For real.

55
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,320
Let me tell you.

56
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,640
You...

57
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,760
Why didn't you kneel?

58
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,200
How dare you!

59
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,040
Your Highness.

60
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,200
Your Highness,

61
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,480
this is a new rule Her Majesty made.

62
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,680
We servants

63
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,280
don't have to kneel

64
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,360
before any masters or court members.

65
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,040
Oh.

66
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,560
Get up, then.

67
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

68
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,080
You...

69
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,600
What's that?

70
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,560
Your Highness, I have had
poor eyesight since little.

71
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,320
I can see more clearly
ever since the fairy Queen

72
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,560
gave me these holy glasses.

73
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,720
Well...

74
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,440
What's this?

75
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,760
I've never seen such vivid pictures.

76
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,000
Your Highness,

77
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,360
this is the execution card
Her majesty just promoted.

78
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,440
Everyone in the palace

79
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,760
has to wear it.

80
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,640
Her Majesty drew
the pictures with a little box.

81
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,760
So every person can be identified.

82
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,880
Her Majesty...

83
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,040
Your Highness.

84
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
This is Her Majesty.
