Help!

00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,040
Help!

6
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,120
Be quiet.

7
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,880
Can't you see?

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,040
The Queen Mother set us up.

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,400
Nonsense.

10
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:53,040
The Queen Mother is so good to me.

11
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:54,240
She would never do this to me.

12
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,360
Why are you so loud?

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,080
I'm telling you.

14
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:01,160
She just wants her niece
Fei'er to be the Queen.

15
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,760
We are just her obstacles.

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,480
She couldn't kill us in the palace.

17
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,840
So she tries to get rid of us here.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,080
Oh.

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,280
You are trying to set me against her.

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,040
No wonder they call you a witch.

21
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,880
How dare you play tricks on me?

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,080
Are you stupid?

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:18,840
Can't you see you are tied up?

24
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,120
They want us dead.

25
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,480
Why are you still on their side?

26
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,040
Well.

27
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,480
Hey!

28
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,760
Let me go now.

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,480
I'm Princess Xiangxiang
from Dongshan Kingdom.

30
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
She knows Iron Palm.

31
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,600
Oh.

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,800
I'm tied up now.

33
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,280
We haven't even asked,

34
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:45,480
and you told us everything yourself?

35
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,120
You are exactly the one we wanted.

36
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,480
- That's right.
- Our Master

37
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,640
spent a lot of money

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,480
to buy you as his wife.

39
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,080
What?

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,240
The Queen Mother really...

41
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,240
Take your guess.

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,040
We won't give away
our long-time customer.

43
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:04,240
That's right.

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,080
How much did you pay for me?

45
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,040
You?

46
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,000
One for two hundred liang,

47
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,280
and the other one for free.

48
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,640
Two hundred? That's all?

49
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,080
You are for free.

50
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,480
You...

51
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,680
What?

52
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,680
Listen.

53
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,840
Our Young Master is dying.

54
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,520
He needs a woman for good luck.

55
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,200
None of those before you two worked.

56
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,080
And we killed them all.

57
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,440
Did you hear me?

58
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,360
Well.

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,960
The best chicks

60
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,320
are all from the palace.

61
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:39,840
Go away.

62
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,200
How about this?

63
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,840
This is not my first time
being forced to marry.

64
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,760
We kill that one.

65
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,560
Okay.

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Help!

67
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:50,680
Help!

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:51,720
What is it?

69
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
- Help!
- Can you put the sword away?

70
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
I-I'm afraid of it.

71
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
Well.

72
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,280
Actually,

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,480
when we were in the palace,

74
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,280
this Princess was very mean to me.

75
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,880
She picked on me every day.

76
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,000
It'd be a waste to just kill her.

77
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:13,400
How about leaving her to be my servant?

78
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,440
Servant?

79
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,080
Yeah.

80
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,360
Okay.

81
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,080
Since the Young Mistress requested,

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,680
I'll let you live for a few more days.

83
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:25,520
Thank you.

84
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,520
Put a dirty cloth in her mouth,

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,520
in case she kills herself.

86
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,160
Yeah.

87
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,280
Open.

88
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,120
Open.

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,160
Let's go.

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Shut up.

91
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,080
Your Majesty!

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,240
Bad news!

93
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,480
The Queen was taken by bandits.

94
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,040
What?

95
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:55,800
Huang Guo'er.

96
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,480
Prepare the horse.

97
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,200
Your Majesty.

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,440
His Majesty left with a troop
to look for the Queen.

99
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,200
Let him be.

100
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,440
The way to Qingfeng
Stockaded Village is risky.

101
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,240
That witch would already be dead
when he finds where she is.

102
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,440
Yes.

103
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,280
They just got married days ago.

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,960
His Majesty is all obsessed with her.

105
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,240
You spent a dozen years with him.

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,400
Now he wouldn't even lay an eye on you.

107
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,560
I gave you such a good opportunity.

108
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,320
It's all a waste.

109
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:42,240
I'm sorry, Aunt.

110
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,760
Never mind.

111
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,760
Go prepare.

112
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
When you become the Queen,

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,960
I can finally take a rest.

114
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,760
I lived my whole life scheming.

115
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,520
I'm tired.

116
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Check over there.

117
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,280
(Liangliang.)

118
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
(Where are you?)

119
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:36,680
Your Majesty!

120
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,880
Have some hot porridge.

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,840
You haven't slept all night.

122
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,480
It's bad for your health.

123
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,360
Take it away.

124
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,040
I'm not hungry.

125
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,760
Your Majesty.

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,200
You have to care for yourself.

127
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
I don't know

128
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,040
where she is

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
or if she's starving.

130
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,200
Drink more, pal.

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,880
Brothers.

132
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,760
Enjoy yourselves.

133
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
There's enough drink. Come on.

134
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,920
Thank you, Master.

135
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,320
General Sa.

136
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,280
It was beautiful, Your Highness.

137
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,800
You are flattering me, General.

138
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,240
What brings you to my place tonight,

139
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,120
General?

140
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,600
I can't sleep.

141
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,640
I had a walk

142
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,760
and wandered off here.

143
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,120
What's on your mind, General?

144
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,480
I...

145
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
I'm afraid I have to leave soon.

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,760
Why is that?

147
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,840
You know it too, Your Highness.

148
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,200
I can't marry Princess Xiangxiang.

149
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:58,760
So,

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,720
I have to go.

151
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,680
But,

152
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,560
now the Queen and
the Princess are both gone.

153
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,280
They might never come back here.

154
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,040
It's not possible.

155
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,360
His Majesty went to look for them.

156
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,920
I'm sure

157
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,960
he'll find them in no time.

158
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,040
I have doubts about that.

159
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,040
I heard

160
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,760
that those bandits are brutal.

161
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,240
