Take the medicine.

You'll recover soon.

5
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:28,880
Let me see.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:31,840
What do you want?

7
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:32,920
Out of my way.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:33,800
Son.

9
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,080
You are awake.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:39,520
Fairy.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,200
You...

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,840
You brought my child back to life.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,840
I was too blind to see your power.

14
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,800
Please accept my apology.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,320
No, no.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,560
Don't.

17
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:51,800
Don't do that.

18
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Just give him medicine on time.

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,400
Yes. Of course.

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,680
But there's one thing
I don't understand.

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,520
What kind of elixir did you give him?

22
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,120
It wasn't elixir.

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
Just anti-inflammatory.

24
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:05,800
Antibiotic.

25
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,800
Anti...

26
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,400
What is that?

27
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,000
Never mind. You won't get it anyway.

28
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,720
Huang Guo'er.

29
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,000
Huang Guo'er.

30
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,280
Give them the medicine.

31
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,000
This is medicine?

32
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,120
It looks peculiar.

33
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:24,640
Right?

34
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:26,440
Her Majesty gave me this

35
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,800
when I had a fever.

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,920
And I recovered within three days.

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:29,760
Is that true?

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,960
Within three days?

39
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,640
Yes.

40
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,640
Hey!

41
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,520
You can't eat it. You are not sick.

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,120
Oh...

43
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,640
Only sick people can eat it.

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,360
What else did you think?

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,560
I thought it could make me live longer.

46
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,360
Keep it safe.

47
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,000
Pretty girl.

48
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,760
Beauty.

49
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,840
Where do you live?

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
Which block are you from?

51
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,560
You don't look familiar.

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,640
Don't be afraid, girl.

53
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,440
We are not bad people.

54
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,480
How dare you!

55
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,360
Add me as a friend in WeChat.

56
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,680
Don't go, girl.

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,480
General Sa.

58
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,080
Didn't you go look for the Queen?

59
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,280
No.

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,880
His Majesty did.

61
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,800
General Sa.

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,040
I thought you didn't
want to see me anymore.

63
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,480
Silly girl.

64
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll always be there

65
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,760
when you need me.

66
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,440
Your Majesty.

67
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,040
My son could never recover

68
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,160
without your help.

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:21,960
Your Majesty.

70
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,800
Don't forget to visit us often.

71
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,120
I will.

72
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,520
You have to come back often.

73
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,600
Don't you want me to visit you?

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,280
Okay.

75
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,320
I will come back when I have time.

76
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Just don't kidnap people

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,200
anymore.

78
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,200
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

79
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I won't forget

80
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
what you said.

81
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,000
From now on,

82
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,080
I'll take everyone with me

83
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,600
to live an honest life.

84
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,960
We won't do that sort of thing anymore.

85
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,880
Brothers.

86
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,560
Is that right?

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,480
Yes.

88
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
We'll be on our way then.

89
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,160
Take care.

90
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,560
Your Majesty.

91
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,640
Safe journey.

92
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,160
Those villagers

93
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:26,720
just came to the midland

94
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,000
because of the floods in the south.

95
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,760
They are not good at house construction.

96
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,800
That's why they
catch a cold very easily.

97
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,520
I am responsible

98
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,160
for that.

99
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,120
Don't feel bad, Your Majesty.

100
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,920
I've written the treatment

101
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,760
for every kind of illness.

102
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
I'll go to the pharmacy on time.

103
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,480
Just don't forget to pay me the money.

104
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,320
Okay.

105
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,240
I'll send the head of the Ministry of
Works to Qingfeng Stockaded Village

106
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,280
to help them with the construction.

107
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,480
I believe

108
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,880
they can build a new home

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:55,920
in midland.

110
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,360
Qingfeng Stockaded Village
can't be the only case here.

111
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:09,000
I want to write a guidebook
to educate people

112
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,000
on some healthcare methods,

113
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,880
so that everyone can stay healthy

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,120
and live a long life.

115
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
You care about the people,

116
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,720
just like a real Queen.

117
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,040
It's not that easy to stay healthy.

118
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,640
Actually, it's pretty complicated.

119
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,080
You need to pay attention to
balanced diet,

120
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,800
food safety,

121
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,280
medical treatment and...

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,080
Why are you staring at me?

123
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,400
Is there anything on my face?

124
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,320
No.

125
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
Is there anything wrong with my makeup?

126
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,120
No.

127
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
I just feel like

128
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,440
I'm dreaming.

129
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,280
I'm afraid you'll disappear

130
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,640
when I wake up.

131
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,800
Where did that come from?

132
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:02,920
Your Majesty.

133
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,960
Princess Xiangxiang left you a letter.

is a genuine person.

She's a good person.

149

Just a bit too loud.

150
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,600
I was so scared.

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,960
I won't go out anymore.

Don't be afraid.
