00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:09,280
Fire!

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:10,480
There's a fire!

5
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:10,920
Hurry up!

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,360
Quick!

7
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:19,640
What's going on?

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,440
I was just patrolling

9
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,080
and saw fire here.

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,000
Something in your resting palace
caught fire.

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:31,520
Wait...

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,840
Your beard...

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
Why do you look so familiar?

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,640
You were just bluffing?

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:48,320
Huang Guoer.

16
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:50,400
Who set the fire?

17
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:51,920
Your Majesty.

18
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:54,440
The curtain caught on fire
when Ruolan was lighting the lamps.

19
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,400
It was an accident.

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,800
I see.

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,040
Don't go too hard on her.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,000
Yes.

23
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,840
Fifty strokes.

24
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,680
Wait!

25
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,720
Get away, you liar.

26
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:12,440
Look,

27
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,360
her hand got burned.

28
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,520
How can you do that?

29
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,440
Come on, get up.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,720
Why are you shaking?

31
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,680
According to the rules,

32
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,880
servants can't go into
His Majesty's resting palace.

33
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,120
What kind of rule is that?

34
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,360
How old are you?

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,440
Two eights.

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,720
Twenty-eight?

37
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,200
You look so young.

38
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,040
I can't believe you are twenty-eight.

39
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,760
"Two eights" means sixteen.

40
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,040
You don't look sixteen either.

41
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,840
I went to high school at sixteen.

42
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,200
When I was sixteen,

43
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,440
I went on horses

44
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
and towers,

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
but not high school.

46
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,720
You didn't fly to the sky?

47
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:05,640
Okay.

48
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,480
Take this.

49
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,240
Rub it on your wound
once or twice every day.

50
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,240
It'll heal within a week.

51
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,160
What are you doing?

52
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,320
Thank Her Majesty.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

54
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,960
Thank you.

55
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,640
Get up.

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,600
Get up from the floor.

57
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Come on.

58
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:25,160
Oh.

59
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:29,360
This.

60
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,360
Take this.

61
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,440
Use this when you light the lamps.

62
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,640
Watch this.

63
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,400
Press here.

64
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,160
Then it lights up.

65
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:37,880
Press this place.

66
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:38,920
Look.

67
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,240
Have a try.

68
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,040
Mischievous girl.

69
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,200
You failed to set the fire.

70
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,320
What are you good for?

71
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,720
Your Majesty.

72
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,200
The fire got put out,

73
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,680
but I have something else to tell you.

74
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,280
What is it?

75
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,280
What's this abominable thing?

76
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,880
The Queen gave me this.

77
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,240
She said it could light things up.

78
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,720
Queen?

79
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,480
She's just a witch.

80
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,040
That sounds good, Feier.

81
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,400
I'll see how this witch

82
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,920
get away with it this time.

83
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,720
Keep watching her.

84
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:43,400
Yes.

85
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,480
Do it carefully.

86
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,480
Why don't you do it yourself?

87
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:02,080
I've never done this in my life.

88
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,320
It isn't in the contract

89
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,040
that I need to tidy up this place.

90
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,760
You are a fake Queen.

91
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,000
The fewer people know that,

92
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,800
the better.

93
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,800
Is that enough?

94
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,840
Your Majesty.

95
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:38,000
You don't need to do that
in front of me.

96
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
Just do this.

97
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,760
Hi.

98
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,080
Just greet me like this.

99
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,480
We are all sisters.

100
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,160
Let's not be so uptight.

101
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,880
Go.

102
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
Your Majesty.

103
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,960
Didn't I just say
you don't have to do that?

104
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,200
Hi.

105
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,520
Just greet me like this.

106
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,840
That's against the rules.

107
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,680
Forget the rules.

108
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,080
Rules are made by people.

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,160
We want to use what Your Majesty
showed me last time for patrol.

110
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,600
Will you be kind enough

111
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,760
to give us more, Your Majesty?

112
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:09,880
It's not really good for patrol.

113
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,280
Take this.

114
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
You can use this for patrol.

115
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
Lanterns are so big and heavy.

116
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,320
Leave them.

117
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,680
Come here, I'll teach you.

118
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,640
Look. Just like this.

119
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
Push the switch back to turn it off.

120
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
And push it forward to turn it on.

121
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,320
Off.

122
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,040
On.

123
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,600
Off.

124
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:28,240
On.

125
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,640
Monster!

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,680
I wonder why there's a smell
of monsters in the palace.

127
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,720
I was just practicing magic
to find the monster.

128
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,960
So it was you, witch.

129
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,320
You are doing evil with your evil craft.

130
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,320
Now I've got you.

131
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,400
Don't be afraid.

132
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm not a witch.

Let's do it before the King gets here.

Kill her as soon as possible.

The time has come.

141
