3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,120
Mom.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,800
My son!

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,680
You've been in bed for almost a year.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:17,680
Now you're finally awake.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,520
She really brought good luck.

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,760
My son is awake.

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,200
It's all superstition.

10
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,040
How dare you!

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,000
That's what Mr. Longlang said.

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,080
Your son got better

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,080
because the medicine I gave him worked.

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,120
Why are you coughing?

15
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,360
I've spent so many years
finding treatment to no avail.

16
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:38,080
Do you think I'll believe what you said?

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,120
You fed him so much wrong medicine.

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,160
It only made him worse.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,560
You were fooled.

20
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,400
Stop it!

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:45,680
What's wrong with your throat?

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,840
What do you mean by that?

23
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,480
Are you saying I'm stupid?

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Fine. Kill her.

25
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:52,880
How dare you!

26
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,640
You can kill her if you want.

27
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,160
But if you do,

28
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:03,000
I won't treat your son.

29
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,680
Think about it.

30
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,800
It's a hopeless case anyway.

31
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,520
Why don't you let me try?

32
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,240
What if I can make him better?

33
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,760
Right?

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,760
I think that makes sense.

35
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:19,680
Okay.

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,240
I'll let you live
for a few more days then.

37
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,280
Listen to me.

38
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:25,640
Guard the door.

39
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,840
Kill whoever comes out.

40
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:27,960
Let's go.

41
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:33,600
This is not a place to stay long.

42
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,520
Let's not get into fights
with these bandits.

43
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:36,960
We should leave at night.

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
I can't go, Your Majesty.

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,720
The Young Master

46
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,160
got better now,

47
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,120
but he might go back
to the earlier state

48
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,160
if I don't continue the treatment.

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
I've promised them anyway.

50
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,320
I can't go back on my words.

51
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,000
Are you sure you can treat him?

52
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:54,160
Don't worry.

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,720
My grandpa is a doctor.

54
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,680
His illness is very common
in my hometown.

55
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,760
I only need a few days.

56
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:04,720
Okay.

57
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,200
Do it then.

58
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,160
We'll stay here together.

59
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,760
I'm so disappointed.

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,040
This is a great opportunity.

61
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,920
How can you help them?

62
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,280
Do you want to be the Queen or nor?

63
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,520
Aunt.

64
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,480
It's all my fault.

65
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,440
But I don't want to fight for the title

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
with these despicable tricks anymore.

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:38,520
Despicable?

68
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,920
I've lived my whole life in this palace.

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,760
The biggest lesson I learned

70
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
is that you can't afford
to be weak-minded.

71
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,880
Aunt.

72
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,120
I'm sorry.

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,920
I don't want to see you today.

74
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,120
Leave.

75
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:02,480
Yes.

76
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,040
What's this?

77
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:27,107
♪Traces of time and space,
and forgotten galaxies♪

78
00:05:28,018 --> 00:05:34,091
♪Time alternates our relationship♪

79
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,884
♪The sea of stars is pretty and quiet♪

80
00:05:38,994 --> 00:05:42,034
♪The rain touches the breath♪

81
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:45,573
♪Get close to you♪
