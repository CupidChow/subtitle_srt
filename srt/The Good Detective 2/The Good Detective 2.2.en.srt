﻿I'm curious.

﻿It seems she has something up her sleeve.

541
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:46,326
Should I ask soemone else to look into it?

542

﻿I'll look into it and get back to you.

﻿What if it could put her at a disadvantage?

544
00:32:52,945 --> 00:32:55,301
﻿Can you be flat-out honest with me?

﻿She was too pretty to rot in the Legal Team.

552
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:26,647
﻿According to the police briefing,

553
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:30,423
﻿Kim Hyung-bok once stalked a nurse
a year before the incident.

554
00:33:30,784 --> 00:33:34,512
﻿That became his motive for having the victim
in a white gown before murdering her.

555
00:33:35,131 --> 00:33:37,308
﻿Then why did the murderer not kill

556
00:33:37,809 --> 00:33:45,427
﻿the woman he stalked
and target those random women instead?

557
00:33:46,027 --> 00:33:50,581
﻿People often misunderstand
that serial killers are impulsive.

558
00:33:50,902 --> 00:33:52,100
﻿But they are not.

559
00:33:52,502 --> 00:33:55,238
<i>﻿They are very rational and cold-headed.</i>

560

<i>﻿This murderer knew he'd be arrested soon</i>

-<i>if he killed the nurse.</i>
-Hello, sir.

562
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:05,905
﻿The serial murder case must've been a headache.

563
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:10,040
﻿Well, what matters is that the case was solved.

564
00:34:10,661 --> 00:34:12,478
﻿Don't try so hard to do well.

565
00:34:13,098 --> 00:34:15,534
﻿There's always a place for you in my team.

569
00:34:22,676 --> 00:34:24,353
﻿I want to go as far as I can get.

570
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,539
﻿I owed you a lot this time.

571
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,557
﻿I'll make sure to repay you one day.

572
00:34:32,757 --> 00:34:34,254
﻿The pleasure is mine.

573
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,067
﻿Do you perhaps know Oh Ji-hyeok?

574
00:34:41,468 --> 00:34:44,463
﻿Yes. I've seen him once during the recent case.

575
00:34:46,103 --> 00:34:49,098
﻿He came to the company today.

576
00:34:50,813 --> 00:34:55,445
﻿The serial murder case including Jung Hee-joo
was all closed, right?

577
00:34:56,718 --> 00:34:57,456
﻿So why?

578
00:34:58,409 --> 00:35:02,524
﻿Why did he come to her former workplace?

579
00:35:07,644 --> 00:35:09,141
﻿He discovered something.

580
00:35:10,516 --> 00:35:12,813
﻿What's funny is.

581
00:35:12,854 --> 00:35:15,590
﻿I wasn't a nurse when I dated Hyung-bok.

582
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:18,407
﻿I was preparing to be a nurse’s aide,

583
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,423
﻿and we broke up only after a few months,

584
00:35:21,464 --> 00:35:23,881
﻿so he didn't even see me in a uniform.

585
00:35:24,561 --> 00:35:26,794
﻿Did you say that to Seoul Violent Crimes Unit?

586
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,296
﻿Of course, I did.

587
00:35:28,577 --> 00:35:30,733
﻿They seemed to understand,

588
00:35:31,014 --> 00:35:32,492
﻿but then the news report said that he killed

589
00:35:32,532 --> 00:35:36,048
women in a white gown because of me.

590
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:38,334
﻿It doesn't feel right.

591
00:35:38,626 --> 00:35:41,082
﻿Is it true he stalked you?

592
00:35:41,083 --> 00:35:41,640
﻿What?

593
00:35:44,053 --> 00:35:47,236
﻿Oh, do you know why we broke up?

594
00:35:47,825 --> 00:35:50,920
﻿He cheated on me.

595
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,089
﻿Why would he even stalk me?

596
00:35:53,829 --> 00:35:56,805
﻿We checked the call history,
﻿and he kept calling you. Why?

597
00:35:56,838 --> 00:35:59,722
﻿He wanted to reclaim the ring he gave me.

598
00:35:59,783 --> 00:36:00,681
﻿He was such a loser.

599
00:36:00,682 --> 00:36:02,439
﻿I didn’t answer his calls.

600
00:36:03,018 --> 00:36:04,376
﻿I wasn't crazy enough to give it back.

601
00:36:04,918 --> 00:36:05,430
﻿I wanted to sell it instead.

602
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:16,964
﻿Now do you get how poorly
Kim Hyung-bok’s motive was made up?

603
00:36:17,724 --> 00:36:20,198
﻿So what are you trying to say?

604
00:36:20,254 --> 00:36:21,706
﻿Kim Hyung-bok isn’t the culprit.

605
00:36:24,808 --> 00:36:25,686
﻿Hey.

606
00:36:26,534 --> 00:36:30,369
﻿Detectives must prove that suspects are guilty,

607
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:31,990
﻿not trying to prove that they are not guilty.

608
00:36:32,431 --> 00:36:34,308
﻿Why would you do such a thing?

609
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:36,622
﻿Who are you, lawyers?

610
00:36:37,076 --> 00:36:38,333
﻿You aren't, are you?

611
00:36:40,759 --> 00:36:41,577
﻿Now,

612
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,087
﻿let me give you a piece of advice.

613
00:36:44,894 --> 00:36:47,650
﻿If Kim Hyung-bok is innocent,

614
00:36:47,691 --> 00:36:50,767
﻿this is a perfect crime for the real culprit.

615
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,097
﻿Would he commit another murder?

616
00:36:53,425 --> 00:36:54,543
﻿No.

617
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:56,960
﻿Just bury it.

618
00:36:57,241 --> 00:36:58,719
﻿He’s the real culprit.

619
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,397
﻿There's no reason to bury it on purpose

620
00:37:00,757 --> 00:37:03,353
﻿The police and prosecution all agreed.

621
00:37:03,674 --> 00:37:06,111
﻿Only a lunatic would dig it up again.

622
00:37:08,609 --> 00:37:09,767
﻿Oh Ji-hyeok

623
00:37:11,046 --> 00:37:12,284
﻿And his partner.

624
00:37:12,931 --> 00:37:14,029
﻿Kang Do-chang.

625
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,838
﻿Those lunatics overturned Lee Dae-chul’s case.

626
00:37:22,779 --> 00:37:23,974
What are you doing?

627
00:37:24,021 --> 00:37:25,302
﻿Keep these with you,

628
00:37:25,349 --> 00:37:28,950
﻿and when we catch the real culprit,
give them back to us.

629
00:37:29,006 --> 00:37:31,149
I'll think of this as your day drunken frenzy.

630
00:37:32,398 --> 00:37:33,955
﻿Please take these back.

631
00:37:34,554 --> 00:37:35,312
﻿I beg you.

632
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:38,255
﻿Kim Hyung-bok isn’t the serial murderer.

633
00:37:38,296 --> 00:37:40,553
﻿The Violent Crimes Unit found the evidence.

634
00:37:41,406 --> 00:37:43,163
﻿The button found on the crime site.

635
00:37:43,188 --> 00:37:45,953
﻿It fell off from Kim Hyung-bok's clothes.

636
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:48,281

00:48:46,012 --> 00:48:46,504
﻿Do-chang.

797
00:48:47,325 --> 00:48:48,842
﻿Didn't you hear anything?

798
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:50,601
﻿What could be here at this hour?

799
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,558
﻿I bet it's that darn boar again.

800
00:48:53,019 --> 00:48:55,655
﻿Gosh, let's get going now.

801
00:48:56,107 --> 00:48:57,114
﻿Goodness.

802
00:49:14,755 --> 00:49:15,793
﻿That sound.

803
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:18,650
﻿-What--
-Stay here for a moment.

804
00:49:18,971 --> 00:49:21,647
﻿Do not... Do not move.

805
00:49:21,648 --> 00:49:23,125
﻿I don’t understand.

806
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:25,045
﻿Stay here for a moment.

807
00:51:08,792 --> 00:51:10,150
﻿Watch out!

808
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:19,843
﻿How can I help you?

809
00:51:20,109 --> 00:51:21,198
﻿We're detectives.

810
00:51:22,398 --> 00:51:23,875
﻿Could we check your trunk?

811
00:51:24,026 --> 00:51:24,604
﻿Sure.

812
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,757
﻿By any chance,

813
00:51:41,718 --> 00:51:43,035
﻿did you see anyone running on your way?

814
00:51:43,315 --> 00:51:44,593
﻿I'm not sure.

815
00:51:45,008 --> 00:51:46,286
﻿I don't think I did.

816
00:52:00,836 --> 00:52:04,072
﻿He wasn’t the real culprit.

817
00:52:10,908 --> 00:52:11,993
Did you discard all the materials?

818
00:52:12,162 --> 00:52:15,177
﻿Yes, including those on everyone's computers.
﻿I confirmed it myself.

819
00:52:15,572 --> 00:52:16,276
﻿All right.

820
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,131
I'll appreciate all your works.

821
00:52:18,382 --> 00:52:19,300
﻿Tonight,

822
00:52:19,434 --> 00:52:21,371
﻿let's drink until we drop dead, okay?

823
00:52:21,691 --> 00:52:22,689
﻿-Yes. sir!
-Yes. sir.

824
00:52:23,028 --> 00:52:25,027
﻿-Good work.
-Good work.

825
00:52:25,028 --> 00:52:26,006
﻿Good work.

826
00:52:26,202 --> 00:52:27,245
﻿What do you want to have?

827
00:52:27,562 --> 00:52:28,283
﻿-Hey.
-Pork belly?

828
00:52:28,284 --> 00:52:29,642
﻿Gosh, let's just have some stew.

829
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:30,881
﻿-Pork belly.
-Stew sounds good too.

830
00:52:30,882 --> 00:52:31,840
﻿-Pork belly.
-Pork belly.

831
00:52:33,079 --> 00:52:34,277
﻿Okay.

832
00:52:36,875 --> 00:52:39,631
﻿Tell the Forensic Team to get ready for work.

833
00:52:39,912 --> 00:52:41,409
﻿What's the matter?

834
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:42,928
﻿This sickening case isn't over yet.

835
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,537
﻿What's going on?

836
00:52:54,472 --> 00:52:55,710
﻿-What?
-What on earth?

837
00:52:56,333 --> 00:52:56,691
﻿Do-chang.

838
00:53:01,896 --> 00:53:02,774
﻿What should we do?

839
00:53:03,212 --> 00:53:04,943
﻿Wait here for a moment. I'll talk to them.

840
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:10,969
﻿We need to talk.

841
00:53:20,676 --> 00:53:23,344
﻿Can you explain why

842
00:53:23,385 --> 00:53:25,151
you two became the initial witnesses?

843
00:53:25,176 --> 00:53:26,254
﻿You know Jung Hee-joo, right?

844
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:29,940
﻿His grandfather wanted to visit the crime site.

845
00:53:30,118 --> 00:53:31,515
﻿So we accompanied him and saw the victim.

846
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:33,593
﻿Did you not have any particular intel?

847
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:34,272
﻿Not at all.

848
00:53:36,311 --> 00:53:38,568
﻿I heard you were
digging into this case privately.

849
00:53:39,294 --> 00:53:41,530
﻿Maybe you came here because you knew something.

850
00:53:42,381 --> 00:53:44,541
﻿Did Mr. Choi Yong-geun tell you?

851
00:53:44,776 --> 00:53:46,333
﻿I guess you two are close.

852
00:53:47,379 --> 00:53:49,514
﻿Don't change the subject.

853
00:53:49,539 --> 00:53:50,837
﻿Be honest with me.

854
00:53:51,395 --> 00:53:54,550
﻿You people knew something
about the real culprit, didn't you?

855
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,948
﻿We would've told you then.

856
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,425
﻿Why would we hide it from the fellow detectives?

857
00:53:59,614 --> 00:54:01,211
﻿What we know...

858
00:54:02,207 --> 00:54:03,741
is that Kim Hyung-bok isn't the real culprit.

859
00:54:03,781 --> 00:54:05,938
﻿Don't you have to admit it now?

860
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:10,393
﻿The murderer is using this murder to say
that the real culprit isn't Kim Hyung-bok,

861
00:54:11,593 --> 00:54:12,111
﻿but him.

862
00:54:12,112 --> 00:54:14,017
﻿What do you even know about this case?

863
00:54:15,537 --> 00:54:16,775
﻿It's my case.

864
00:54:16,998 --> 00:54:18,524
﻿Not yours.

865
00:54:19,115 --> 00:54:20,962
﻿Don't you dare meddle in with speculations.

866
00:54:21,507 --> 00:54:24,738
﻿If you have handed Kim Hyung-bok over to us,

867
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,811
﻿he would be alive now

868
00:54:26,836 --> 00:54:28,514
﻿-What? You little...
-Do-chang.

869
00:54:29,689 --> 00:54:30,927
﻿-What...
-Unbelievable.

870
00:54:31,178 --> 00:54:33,115
﻿-Let go.
-Stay here.

871
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,008
﻿-Darn it!
-Don't move.

872
00:54:34,049 --> 00:54:35,646
﻿And you think you did so well?

873
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:39,759
﻿You turned that innocent guy into a murderer!

874
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:40,878
﻿Hey! -Let go.

875
00:54:41,468 --> 00:54:43,535
﻿We're done giving statements. Can we go now?

876
00:54:43,855 --> 00:54:45,593
﻿Take your team with you.

877
00:54:45,812 --> 00:54:46,874
﻿We will take over.

878
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:49,928
﻿Are you even hearing yourself7 -Do-chang.

879
00:54:50,089 --> 00:54:51,166
﻿Let me do the talking.

880
00:54:54,244 --> 00:54:56,361
﻿You closed the serial murder case.

881
00:54:56,362 --> 00:54:57,799
﻿So this is a different case.

882
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,002
﻿Why must we let you take over?

883
00:55:00,027 --> 00:55:01,775
﻿You'll get an official notice later.

884
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:04,512
﻿If you have an objection even after that,

885
00:55:04,513 --> 00:55:05,871
﻿talk to your chief about it.

886
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,269
﻿Okay. Let's go.

887
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,468
﻿-Hey.
-Come on.

888
00:55:08,749 --> 00:55:10,665
﻿Why do I have to listen to this jerk?

889
00:55:10,929 --> 00:55:13,702
﻿He says it's his case.

890
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:17,738
﻿That means he sees this as the serial murder.

891
00:55:18,378 --> 00:55:21,694
﻿He said it himself,
﻿so let them take over. Let's go.

892
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:24,029
﻿Come on.

893
00:55:25,910 --> 00:55:27,807
﻿This isn't your case, you jerk!

894
00:55:27,989 --> 00:55:30,824
﻿It's the victim's case, and her family's case.

895
00:55:31,964 --> 00:55:34,640
﻿You're rotten from the core.

896
00:55:34,641 --> 00:55:36,329
﻿-Let's go.
-Hey. you jerk!

897
00:55:36,354 --> 00:55:37,152
﻿Do-chang.

898
00:55:38,237 --> 00:55:39,474
﻿It's a mess over there.

899
00:55:49,704 --> 00:55:50,782
﻿Hee-joo.

900
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:53,532
﻿I think I will have to

901
00:55:54,799 --> 00:55:57,595
﻿meet you a little while later.

902
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:12,467
﻿This time, we will catch the culprit first.

903
00:56:12,468 --> 00:56:14,445
﻿They have control over the crime site.

904
00:56:14,486 --> 00:56:16,283
﻿They will identify the victim first.

905
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,280
﻿They will analyze the evidence first.

906
00:56:18,561 --> 00:56:19,739
﻿We're already falling behind

907
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:20,997
﻿None of that matters.

908
00:56:21,394 --> 00:56:23,731
﻿Whoever acts faster will take the lead.

909
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:26,838
﻿Ji-woong.

910
00:56:27,312 --> 00:56:28,549
﻿When you arrive at the station,

911
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:33,344
﻿make a list of missing women in their 20s
based on where the serial murders took place.

912
00:56:38,859 --> 00:56:39,717
﻿What now?

913
00:56:40,078 --> 00:56:43,953
﻿The commissioner believes
that we caught the culprit.

914
00:56:44,233 --> 00:56:46,070
﻿No evidence says
Kim Hyung-bok isn't the culprit.

915
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,068
﻿He's dead!

916
00:56:48,669 --> 00:56:50,925
﻿How could a dead man do this again?

917
00:56:54,582 --> 00:56:56,259
﻿Before catching the culprit,

918
00:56:57,419 --> 00:57:00,135
﻿think about how we'll deal

919
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,972
with this darn situation.

920
00:57:07,049 --> 00:57:09,445
﻿Captain. Reporters are gathering.

921
00:57:09,446 --> 00:57:10,444
﻿What?

922
00:57:11,764 --> 00:57:13,041
﻿Who was it?

923
00:57:18,302 --> 00:57:19,774
﻿As early as two hours,

924
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,232
﻿they'll identify the victim

925
00:57:21,593 --> 00:57:22,751
﻿Don't worry.

926
00:57:22,935 --> 00:57:25,108
﻿Something will get in their way.

927
00:57:30,579 --> 00:57:31,816
﻿-What did he say?
-About 30 minutes ago,

928
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,180
﻿he talked to his daughter.

929
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:35,577
﻿Her phone died, so she used her friend’s phone.

930
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,455
﻿Have all missing persons' cases been checked?

931
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:38,534
﻿Yes, so far.

932
00:57:38,535 --> 00:57:40,372
﻿Wait. We just got a missing person report.

933
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:42,210
﻿A university student in her 20s.

934
00:57:42,251 --> 00:57:43,449
﻿She said she was on the way home

935
00:57:43,489 --> 00:57:45,327
after the school meeting in her last call.

936
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:49,122
﻿It's the same district
the first murder case occurred.

937
00:57:51,141 --> 00:57:53,678
﻿We're running out of time. Let's split up.

938
00:57:53,718 --> 00:57:56,295
﻿Why won't you let us in?

939
00:57:56,296 --> 00:57:58,352
﻿Reveal the crime scene!

940
00:57:58,393 --> 00:57:59,591
﻿Who's in charge here?

941
00:57:59,912 --> 00:58:01,589
﻿Hurry up and reveal the case.

942
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:02,628
﻿Why are you not revealing it to us?

943
00:58:02,909 --> 00:58:05,745
﻿-Reveal it!
-Disclose it to us.

944
00:58:05,746 --> 00:58:07,103
﻿-There he is.
-He's coming.

945
00:58:08,065 --> 00:58:11,738
﻿The victim's identity has not been identified.

946
00:58:11,739 --> 00:58:16,633
﻿The victim was found wearing a white gown
with red lipstick on her lips.

947
00:58:17,513 --> 00:58:18,351
﻿-A white gown?
-A white gown?

948
00:58:18,632 --> 00:58:21,567
﻿Is the white-gown serial murder reoccurring?

949
00:58:21,888 --> 00:58:23,685
﻿We're still working on it.

950
00:58:23,686 --> 00:58:27,341
﻿Are you saying Kim Hyung-bok
﻿was not the culprit?

951
00:58:27,342 --> 00:58:30,957
﻿Did you frame the wrong person
to end the case in a rush?

952
00:58:31,489 --> 00:58:34,873
﻿That means the police deceived the whole nation.

953
00:58:35,111 --> 00:58:36,232
﻿Do you admit it?

954
00:58:36,429 --> 00:58:37,626
﻿The body was found

955
00:58:38,051 --> 00:58:40,407
in the same place the fourth body was found.

956
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:43,281
﻿We'll have to look into it,

957
00:58:43,826 --> 00:58:47,365
﻿but this has never happened
for serial murders before.

958
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,654
﻿Personally. I believe

959
00:58:49,863 --> 00:58:52,499
﻿it’s a different culprit.

960
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:56,490
﻿Are you saying it's not related
to the White-gown serial murders?

961
00:58:56,967 --> 00:58:57,965
﻿The culprit...

962
00:58:59,058 --> 00:59:04,175
﻿is highly likely to be a copycat
of the White-gown serial murders.

963
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:06,566
﻿-What?
-A copycat?

964
00:59:16,238 --> 00:59:17,615
﻿She hasn't returned home yet,

965
00:59:17,616 --> 00:59:18,654
﻿and her phone is off.

966
00:59:19,254 --> 00:59:20,532
﻿I've seen her picture.

967
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,629
﻿She looked close to the victim.

968
00:59:25,108 --> 00:59:26,246
﻿It's her.

969
00:59:26,247 --> 00:59:27,904
﻿Have you checked the CCTVs?

970
00:59:28,864 --> 00:59:29,864
It's her.

971
00:59:40,840 --> 00:59:43,247
﻿Around 5 pm.. the victim left school.

972
00:59:45,146 --> 00:59:47,922
﻿Around 7 p.m., she left the cafe near her school.

973
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:49,681
﻿And...

974
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:54,156
around 7:30 p.m.. she got on the bus home.

975
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:58,471
﻿Around 8 p.m,. the bus reached the bus stop,

976
00:59:58,472 --> 00:59:59,870
﻿and she got off the bus.

977
01:00:01,129 --> 01:00:02,966
﻿Was there anything recorded from the bus stop?

978
01:00:03,007 --> 01:00:04,205
﻿I checked the control room.

979
01:00:04,545 --> 01:00:05,803
﻿There's no CCTV in that area.

980
01:00:05,804 --> 01:00:08,760
﻿So far. the places where the victims were

981
01:00:09,081 --> 01:00:10,518
kidnapped had no CCTVs.

982
01:00:11,074 --> 01:00:12,991
﻿That means the culprit checked everything

983
01:00:13,016 --> 01:00:14,454
before the crime.

984
01:00:14,455 --> 01:00:16,532
﻿Anyway, it occurred between her house

985
01:00:16,533 --> 01:00:18,210
and the bus stop.

986
01:00:18,211 --> 01:00:23,250
﻿Maybe the dashcams in the cars
parked nearbymust've caught it.

987
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:25,482
﻿I bet he calculated that too.

988
01:00:25,523 --> 01:00:26,801
﻿In the end,

989
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,257
﻿is this all we can do?

990
01:00:43,683 --> 01:00:45,161
﻿Lets take one more step from here.

991
01:00:47,128 --> 01:00:48,617
﻿Did you say Sungwol-dong?

992
01:00:48,673 --> 01:00:50,989
﻿Yes, around 8 p.m.

993
01:00:53,588 --> 01:00:54,386
﻿It's here.

994
01:00:54,591 --> 01:00:57,228
﻿Sungwol-dong, Daeju-ro 13-4 at 7:20 p.m.

995
01:00:57,888 --> 01:01:00,524
﻿Sungwol-dong. Daeju-ro 25-1 at 8:10 p.m.

996
01:01:00,845 --> 01:01:01,963
﻿There are two.

997
01:01:06,696 --> 01:01:08,495
﻿I see nothing.

998
01:01:09,695 --> 01:01:11,652
﻿Is that for 8:10 p.m.

999
01:01:12,332 --> 01:01:13,290
﻿Yes.

1000
01:01:13,291 --> 01:01:16,047
﻿The victim got off the bus at 8:05 p.m.

1001
01:01:16,048 --> 01:01:18,665
﻿She should've been filmed here.

1002
01:01:19,005 --> 01:01:21,042
﻿Let's check the one at 7:20 pm. too.

1003
01:01:22,681 --> 01:01:24,518
﻿Aren't they too far apart?

1004
01:01:25,318 --> 01:01:27,056
﻿Let's check just in case.

1005
01:01:28,695 --> 01:01:29,773
﻿Okay.

1006
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,156
﻿Hang on. Rewind it. Go back.

1007
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:57,425
﻿There's nothing.

1008
01:01:58,789 --> 01:01:59,940
﻿Can you zoom in?

1009
01:02:04,816 --> 01:02:05,814
﻿What's that?

1010
01:02:08,982 --> 01:02:10,020
﻿It's a backpack.

1011
01:02:14,465 --> 01:02:18,100
<i>﻿I remember</i>

1012
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:21,177
<i>﻿Our first</i>

1013
01:02:22,417 --> 01:02:24,314
<i>﻿Kiss</i>

1014

<i>﻿Near the window</i>

1015
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,856
﻿He was waiting for the victim.

1016
01:02:32,366 --> 01:02:33,803
﻿With a weapon inside the backpack.

1017
01:02:36,941 --> 01:02:41,815
<i>﻿Say</i>

1018
01:02:42,695 --> 01:02:44,892
<i>﻿You love me</i>

1019
01:03:18,673 --> 01:03:20,566
<i>﻿Do you smell the culprit?</i>

1020
01:03:20,591 --> 01:03:21,948
<i>﻿I must catch him myself.</i>

1021
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:23,666
<i>﻿If I don't.</i>

1022
01:03:23,707 --> 01:03:24,785
<i>﻿I'll be embarrassed for my whole life.</i>

1023
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:27,562
﻿Did you find something
on the crime scene that day?

1024
01:03:27,563 --> 01:03:29,800
<i>﻿One who is filmed on the bus CCTV all day,</i>

1025
01:03:29,841 --> 01:03:31,718
﻿but no one pays attention to.

1026
01:03:31,779 --> 01:03:33,696
﻿Who drove that bus?

1027
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,694
﻿Come out already!

1028
01:03:35,695 --> 01:03:38,291
<i>﻿It’s about time to change TJ directors.</i>

1029
01:03:38,292 --> 01:03:41,126
﻿Someone inside must have the same thought.

1030
01:03:41,151 --> 01:03:42,326
﻿Find who that is.

1031
01:03:42,327 --> 01:03:43,845
<i>﻿It's unlikely a copycat crime.</i>

1032
01:03:43,846 --> 01:03:46,642
<i>﻿I'm afraid you're accusing the wrong person.</i>

1033
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:47,840
﻿You just made a mistake.
