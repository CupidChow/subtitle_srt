00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:40,430
sir

7
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,260
A moment, a moment.

8
00:00:44,310 --> 00:00:47,080
- Sir, sir!
- Ah, it's you.

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,900
Let me enjoy this serenity.

10
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,050
At least for a little while.

11
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,540
What's that? Hey, turn the car!

12
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:57,910
Spin the car!

13
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,760
Sir, wait sir!

14
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:02,870
Sir, wait sir!

15
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,360
Good grief.

16
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,420
Hey.

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,320
Why do I have to climb
over my own office fence?

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
It's all because of you.

19
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:28,280
Damn, I'm just like a thief.

20
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,860
No, Team Leader. Wait...

21
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:37,250
The case happened in Seoul,
and this is Incheon.

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,330
It's your authority
but why do we...

23
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,400
Our detective just happened to be there.

24
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:45,830
Because Director Cheon Na-Na
invited the detectives.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,020
Not. That's... Team Leader!

26
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,540
Damn.

27
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,220
What did he say?

28
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,930
He asked why they had to
handle the case even though there were 2 witnesses here.

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,870
The point is, because it's confusing,
you're the only one who holds this case.

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,110
That's what he said.

31
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,570
Has the reason Cheon Na-Na
fainted has been revealed?

32
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,420
The hospital announced
that he had fainted from

33
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,940
low blood sugar
due to insulin overdose.

34
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,460
Does it mean that there was an error
during the injection of the drug?

35
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,940
Whether this is a mistake or intentional,
further research is still needed.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,220
Does that mean there's a possibility that someone
accidentally overdosed her?

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,010
According to legal experts, overseas there are
criminal cases using insulin.

38
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,420
What is the reason this case is compared
to cases abroad?

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,890
That's because of the contents of Cheon Na-Na's interview
with WCN before the incident.

40
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:42,010
<i>The reason for the corruption of former president
Cheon Sung-Dae is revealed and brought to trial,</i>

41
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,710
<i>actually,</i>

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,680
<i>because I provided the information.</i>

43
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,610
<i>And president Cheon Sang-Woo's crime too,</i>

44
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,500
<i>could be revealed because I
submitted solid evidence to investigators.</i>

45
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,210
<i>This case is currently being handled
by the Incheon West Office</i>

46
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,020
<i>who handled the case of
president Cheon Sang-Woo.</i>

47
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:02,820
<i>What solid evidence
Cheon Na-Na mentioned in the interview,</i>

48
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>and what does that have to do with this case,</i>

49
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,120
<i>So far, the Incheon West Office
has not made any statement.</i>

50
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:16,720
We...

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,120
What statement
do you think we should make?

52
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,250
Still no statement
we can give,

53
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:24,650
but there is an answer
given by Cheon Na-Na.

54
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,880
<i>You know why you were released, right?</i>

55
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,030
<i>I gave the package
to the Blue House.</i>

56
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:35,910
<i>You really want to die by my hands, don't you?</i>

57
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,230
<i>I'll be honest.</i>

58
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,460
<i>I'm afraid of father.</i>

59
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,320
<i>I'm scared...</i>

60
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,330
<i>Dad is really going to kill me.</i>

61
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,510
Until here.

62
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,120
I told you this was
my personal request, right?

63
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,040
If I'm wrong, I will be suspected.

64
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,450
There's nothing
I can do.

65
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,540
Then the result?

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,520
Have you told them?

67
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,870
The reason she sent us the file,

68
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,990
it was caused by Cheon Sung-Dae
who intended to kill Cheon Na-Na,

69
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,490
So she's telling us to
arrest Cheon Sung-Dae?

70
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,520
- That, right?
- That is true.

71
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,020
Do you think Cheon Sung-Dae
really wants to kill Cheon Na-Na?

72
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,100
No

73
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,560
Let's just say that Cheon Na-Na used
the same method when she killed Woo Tae-Ho.

74
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,730
And this time she was attacked
ready to die.

75
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,050
Most likely this
is Cheon Na-Na's fabrication.

76
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,170
Right.

77
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,300
She also deliberately invites
us to witness that,

78
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,210
it was also part of the plan.

79
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,660
She deliberately got us involved.

80
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,230
If so, let's
just pretend this case doesn't exist.

81
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,030
We just have to ignore it.

82
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,910
No, we don't have to
throw away the weapons

83
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,140
for Cheon Sung-Dae
because Cheon Na-Na pointed them at him.

84
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,010
We just need to
point the gun at

85
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,600
Cheon Sung-Dae according to
Cheon Na-Na's will.

86
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:56,560
So we pressure Cheon Sung-Dae
to get close to us.

87
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,480
He will definitely agree
with our research.

88
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,340
Are you close with Cheon Sung-Dae?

89
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,450
Indeed, that person

90
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:07,120
will come and go
just because we tell them to?

91
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,650
You see him that good?

92
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,100
Hey, looks like
the head of the police station was right.

93
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:15,680
What you said means we're going to
play Cheon Sung-Dae,

94
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:20,190
but doesn't it feel unreal?

95
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,180
That Cheon Sung-Dae,

96
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,410
his level was different from Cheon Sang-Woo
and Cheon Na-Na.

97
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,150
The connection he had built up to this point,

98
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,160
will definitely exceed our expectations.

99
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,000
At least one of them,

100
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,330
is an opponent we cannot overcome.

101
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,470
If Cheon Sung-Dae moves,

102
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:39,170
our lives can be equal to flies.

103
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,910
In that case, not
only the flies die,

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,710
but the fly family will also be slaughtered.

105
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,610
Then ,,,

106
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,560
I also admit that.

107
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,290
If it's wrong, we might
all have to quit the police.

108
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,120
You admit it, right?

109
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,210
Okey

110
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,330
Then there is only one
thing we need to do.

111
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,980
We just have to be quiet.

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,270
From now on you

113
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,890
You don't have to go to work,
I'll still give you a salary.

114
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,920
You stay at home

115
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,420
and like a stone statue,

116
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,230
you just stare at the wall.

117
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,630
How, easy, right?

118
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,200
Sir, we must continue to
pursue the Cheon Na-Na case.

119
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,240
'There's already evidence that can
make Cheon Na-Na suspicious.

120
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,470
Hey,

121
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,050
Hey.

122
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,990
your team,

123
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,730
Hey, idiots.

124
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,240
I beg you.

125
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,760
I am...

126
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,700
don't want much.

127
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,410
What I want,

128
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:36,350
there is only one.

129
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,310
Peace of mind.

130
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:39,950
Peace.

131
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,030
I ask. Yes?

132
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:44,550
I...

133
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:48,290
Will risk
my building which is in Gangnam.

134
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,320
If there's a situation we
should all be fired,

135
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,760
I will divide the building
equally for the eight of us.

136
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,140
Why did you..

137
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:00,240
You don't have to do that...

138
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,380
The situation where we all are fired
 will not happen. I'm sure of it

139
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:04,300
What do you mean?

140
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,740
In fact, it could happen.

141
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:07,660
If we proceed with
the case as you say,

142
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,180
we can all get fired right, sir?

143
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,640
If this is the case, then it's the end

144
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,590
looks like we have nothing to lose.

145
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,760
Agree.

146
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,270
Forgive me.

147
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:29,730
Looks like I can't
accept your offer.

148
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,290
The reason?

149
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,360
This is not a situation that can be
resolved even if I intervene.

150
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,250
We assume that's your opinion.

151
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,760
What do McQueen Headquarters think,

152
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,300
over this situation?

153
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,370
Replacing executives?

154
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,700
Yes

155
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,590
Director Cheon Na-Na,

156
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,730
will be promoted as
TJ's top executive.

157
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,600
Why don't you burn it? Why?

158
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,020
I just want to know.

159
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,250
What will come out of there.

160
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,960
Just out of curiosity?

161
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,530
Ki-Jin.

162
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,490
I told you, right?

163
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,690
If we find out, we
won't get any money.

164
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,150
And we also have to return
the money we have got.

165
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,300
Do you know why Ki Dong-Jae
kept that item?

166
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:25,430
To ask for money from Cheon Na-Na.

167
00:08:27,150 --> 00:08:28,590
Ki Dong-Jae is dead.

168
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:31,950
There is an opportunity for us to
take part as well.

169
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,750
Do you know?

170
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,310
I risked
my whole life here.

171
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,790
The end is one of two things.

172
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,740
Go to prison and die,

173
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,050
or a lifetime of abundant money.

174
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,630
Then?

175
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:02,870
How will the Incheon West Office
handle it?

176
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:05,220
He said they also accept the lab results?

177
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:08,090
I got here,

178
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:10,630
Becuase I beleive in you

179
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,030
You have to direct me.

180
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:14,690
Until the end.

181
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,740
TJ has transferred to Cheon Na-Na's hands.

182
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:24,370
And Cheon Sang-Woo couldn't come back.

183
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:28,570
Bet and take down
Cheon Sang-Woo once again.

184
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:30,600
How?

185
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,000
Reveal all

186
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,610
that you know.

187
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,420
Reveal and destroy.

188
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,600
It is hidden by the traffic section.

189
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,230
Cheon Na-Na's Fingerprint,

190
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,660
it's definitely found on the steering wheel and belt.

191
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,640
How did you get this?
They must not be easy to give.

192
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,430
How could they just give it away?
I made a fuss there.

193
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,380
I forcefully opened the cabinet
and fought...

194
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
The physical fights are
quite severe.

195
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,110
If at that time you failed
what would you do?

196
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:59,240
What's there to be afraid of? Fired
will also become the owner of the building in Gangnam.

197
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,730
So I purposely made a fuss.

198
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,770
So that it is reported and we are quickly fired.

199
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:06,180
We should have gone, let's
all be fired immediately.

200
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,600
So...

201
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,970
This nonsense...
Please stop

202
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:13,030
So from Jung Hee-Joo's clothes,

203
00:10:13,670 --> 00:10:15,340
Cheon Na-Na's blood was found.

204
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,880
And on the car is Cheon Na-Na's fingerprint.

205
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,390
In that case,

206
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,310
in the end Cheon Na-Na,

207
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,340
Jung Hee-Joo, Woo Tae-Ho,

208
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,100
did she kill them?

209
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,220
It's still possible to kill,
not sure that she actually did

210
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,530
Yeah, so she probably
killed them both,

211
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:31,970
or it could be just one of them,

212
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,150
or maybe not at all, is that so?

213
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,260
Wait...

214
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:41,330
Shouldn't we start with one
in order for the investigation to work?

215
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,180
So where should we start?

216
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,610
In search of Jung Hee-Joo's legacy,

217
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,670
Jang Ki-Jin even injured her grandfather.

218
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:50,600
It must be for fear of finding
Cheon Na-Na's blood from there.

219
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,300
If that blood...

220
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:56,040
unrelated to
Jung Hee-Joo's death, he wouldn't do that

221
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,130
Right.

222
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,600
And because he wanted to destroy
the evidence, he killed Ki Dong-Jae.

223
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,770
If Cheon Na-Na kills Jung Hee-Joo,

224
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,420
the reason for killing Woo Tae-Ho became clear.

225
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,200
Woo Tae-Ho knew the truth,

226
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,090
and to cover it up, she killed her.

227
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,850
Then what is the reason for Cheon Na-Na to
kill Jung Hee-Joo?

228
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,980
Just because of an affair
with her husband?

229
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,170
Do you think Cheon Na-Na is such a woman?

230
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,450
But it's not that there's no evidence.

231
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,460
Let's just call Cheon
Na-Na and investigate.

232
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,990
In that case,

233
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:29,920
it's the same as saying that the Cheon Sang-Woo
we caught was not the culprit.

234
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,510
If Cheon Na-Na kills Jung Hee-Joo,

235
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,620
meaning it wasn't Ki Dong-Jae
who killed her.

236
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:38,570
In that case, Cheon Sang-Woo
would be innocent. It's getting complicated.

237
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:42,560
With this much evidence, it
's impossible to move.

238
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,500
Yes

239
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,650
OK I understand, I'll wait.

240
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:55,950
Team Leader.

241
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,360
He said Cheon Na-Na headed here.

242
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,870
Why?

243
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,310
I told the lawyer
that the victim's testimony was needed.

244
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,790
But she wanted to come herself
and testify.

245
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,330
Wah.

246
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,500
What was the reason she came
alone to testify?

247
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,760
Did she really want to
catch Cheon Sung-Dae?

248
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,310
No, she must have known it was impossible.

249
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,370
So what?

250
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,830
Her intentions were simple.

251
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,870
On the one hand protecting herself

252
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:27,600
and on the other hand,

253
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,780
to overcome the crisis.

254
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,080
If you say so

255
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:34,000
you think i will understand?

256
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:36,350
Say it simply,
using words that are easy to understand.

257
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,210
In essence she moved
first for fear of being attacked.

258
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,780
And just in case we attack,
she puts a dog collar on us.

259
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,300
Well, now I immediately understand.

260
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,370
Wow, the investigation is amazing.

261
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,530
<i>Can we record your testimony?</i>

262
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,820
<i>Yes, go ahead</i>

263
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,470
<i>Then I'll start the recording.</i>

264
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,590
Record.

265
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:26,120
How can she be confident?

266
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,450
<i>It's better.</i>

267
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,880
We've investigated the hospital.

268
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:33,400
There are no situations that can be
suspected when the drug is injected.

269
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:37,610
Then, in your situation
with the insulin device,

270
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,780
there is an engineering done.

271
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,980
Looks like they
swapped it in my office.

272
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,710
That means someone broke into my office.

273
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,960
Then it means
one of our employees.

274
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,190
And that must have been the order of the person
who could command the employee.

275
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,970
If ordered by an internal party,

276
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,370
means it will not be easy to express.

277
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,420
If Detective Oh is in charge,

278
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:00,290
won't the culprit be quickly caught?

279
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,410
Did you invite us to the event

280
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:04,960
for that reason?

281
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,700
Since you've seen it with
your eyes, you have to catch it.

282
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,720
Are you...

283
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,360
Suspect me?

284
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,490
I...

285
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:18,470
Deliberately injecting too much medicine
until I could die?

286
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,980
Working in this field, we
see a wide variety of people.

287
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,100
Among them,

288
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,180
there are people who cannot be
understood by ordinary people's minds.

289
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,700
Was the investigation difficult?

290
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,550
You said a strange reason.

291
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,710
Right, that's the reason.

292
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,230
Because the suspect's position
was very high, it was difficult to approach him.

293
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,730
I will cooperate as best I can.
He's the one who wanted to kill me.

294
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:43,790
You have to catch him.
Whoever did it.

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,520
Yes but...

296
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:48,000
Since this case is
based solely on circumstances,

297
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,690
as long as there is no direct evidence...

298
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,830
I believe.

299
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:55,500
You are the one who sends the
president of a large corporation to trial.

300
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,260
Because of that belief,

301
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm cooperating with
Detective Oh's investigation.

302
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,460
Even though I know it's illegal.

303
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:07,220
You use
the search method, right?

304
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,960
To make evidence it
has legal force.

305
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,910
I didn't know.

306
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,980
Only found out later on

307
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,370
That there was a problem with gathering evidence.

308
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,510
If it's revealed in
the trial that my brother and my husband did it

309
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,630
looks like it's going to be complicated.

310
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,300
She came to threaten us

311
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:27,530
Shall we continue the recording?

312
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:29,720
We'll see how she
talks first.

313
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,730
<i>Of course it will be complicated.</i>

314
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:35,200
If wrong, president Cheon Sang-Woo
can be innocent.

315
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,320
You don't want that either, do you?

316
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:39,280
You misunderstood me.

317
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,360
But I understand.

318
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,670
That...

319
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:47,450
Something I said
was not true.

320
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,980
What's that?

321
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,230
I am sorry.

322
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,540
I only think of myself.

323
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,530
Because of that,

324
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:02,870
looks like I'm making you
all suspicious in the wrong direction.

325
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,670
Even though I have heard
that my brother ordered Jung Hee-Joo to be killed,

326
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:14,410
but I can't stop it.

327
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,730
I really regret it.

328
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,600
On the day it happened,

329
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,470
I called Jung Hee-Joo
and met her

330
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,190
I should have said that...

331
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,040
But I couldn't

332
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:31,850
It could be...

333
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,650
That I also wanted Jung Hee-Joo dead.

334
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Because she's the woman who stole my husband.

335
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,200
It was very heavy for me.

336
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,790
If I told you that,

337
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,370
Jung Hee-Joo will not die.

338
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,650
Because of that guilt,

339
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,700
I tried to die with Tae-Ho.

340
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,480
Tae-Ho didn't try to kill himself.

341
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,000
I...

342
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,640
I want to die with him.

343
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,830
For I alone am saved,

344
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:16,720
what i can do,

345
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,930
only revealed the person
who had killed Jung Hee-Joo.

346
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,510
Because of that,

347
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:27,510
That's why I helped Detective Oh.

348
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,190
You said you met
Jung Hee-Joo on the day she died.

349
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,600
Did nothing happen?

350
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,410
Yes, nothing.

351
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,800
We just talked and left

352
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,530
What's the reason you didn't
say that before,

353
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,820
is because you are
afraid of being a suspect?

354
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,090
I don't think so.

355
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,880
I...

356
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,650
felt guilty that I let Jung Hee-Joo got killed

357
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,160
so I didn't dare to say we met

358
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,020
Isn't it because you can't remember?

359
00:18:05,130 --> 00:18:06,180
No

360
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,880
Without your knowledge,
those memories can be engineered.

361
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,740
For being too surprised.

362
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,290
So the situation will be remembered,

363
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,680
in your favor.

364
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,020
Has that ever happened?

365
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,010
Is it possible,

366
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,570
Have you ever
experienced that, Detective Oh?

367
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,740
You said you saw the person
who killed your father, right?

368
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,310
Maybe you don't see it.

369
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,210
Because you're scared,

370
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:32,080
 that you
misunderstand and thought

371
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,680
You saw something
you didn't see?

372
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,050
Right.

373
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,240
So the truth is changed at will.

374
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:40,460
So it turns into
the truth we want.

375
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:42,900
Like you.

376
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,000
I've been busy lately.

377
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,220
The company is in crisis.

378
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,930
No one advances but me.

379
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:56,790
After today,

380
00:18:57,130 --> 00:18:59,600
I won't have time
to get interviewed by you.

381
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,900
That's why I came
and spoke today.

382
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,950
More than this...

383
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,550
I hope I don't have
to think about this.

384
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,120
To be honest,

385
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,480
I feel everything
Cheon Na-Na said is true.

386
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,060
Indeed so.

387
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,470
If you hear it, you will believe it.

388
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,840
Because she had arranged it well.

389
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,600
If it's acting, she's amazing.

390
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:28,700
It won't be easy.

391
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:32,280
If she says that in court,
we won't be able to argue.

392
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,430
If so, the
prosecutors will also believe it.

393
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:37,390
Wait, then the blood
on Jung Hee-Jooo's shirt,

394
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,720
still can't be explained

395
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,960
We should have asked about that.

396
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:42,400
After all Jang Ki-Jin

397
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,730
already know that the
lab results are with us.

398
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,390
Then Cheon Na-Na will also know.

399
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,920
Did we just give him
time to get rid of it?

400
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:52,290
Now it's better if we
pretend to lose to Cheon Na-Na.

401
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,390
What Cheon Na-Na wants
is to master TJ.

402
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:56,920
If he bothers her

403
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:58,810
she won't
forgive him, whoever it is.

404
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,620
She came to
tell us that.

405
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:01,960
If you make a mistake,

406
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,880
there could be other victims.

407
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,200
Yes, she is the woman who
framed her father as a murderer.

408
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,690
She can definitely do anything.

409
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,740
Hello

410
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,610
Which detective Shim Dong-Wook is, huh?

411
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,700
I am.

412
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:19,160
We arrested you on suspicion of
bribery and abuse of power.

413
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,760
- What?
- What's this?

414
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:23,800
Take it off. Where could that be?

415
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,110
Release, release.

416
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,370
Leave.

417
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,880
Let go of your hands!

418
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,320
Hold on!

419
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,720
Shim Dong-Il.

420
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,140
He's your brother, right?

421
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,160
Yes

422
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,160
What is Shim Dong-Il's job?

423
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,730
Why do you ask that?

424
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,530
He's unemployed, right?

425
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,450
Excuse me.

426
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,310
You brought me because
there was an accusation against me, right?

427
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:51,600
Then investigate me.

428
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:54,020
Why keep dragging my brother here?

429
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,820
In your brother's account,

430
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,030
300 million won in cash.

431
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,190
Why is there
so much money in an unemployment account?

432
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,850
What are you talking about?

433
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,200
The one who sent the money
, was the company that

434
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,860
related to the TJ you
're investigating.

435
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:10,720
A company completely
unrelated to your brother.

436
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,850
You used
your brother's account, right?

437
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,600
With a plan, the money you receive can be
shared with your teammates.

438
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,000
Damn.

439
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:20,080
Plan? Plan?

440
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,400
You, right?

441
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,720
You arranged
all of this from behind, right?

442
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,900
What are you doing?

443
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:29,180
You're the one, Jang Ki-Jin!

444
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,240
Right.

445
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:33,850
I did it, idiot.

446
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,030
I've checked there is money coming in.

447
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:44,240
Why didn't you
tell us first?

448
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,600
You don't feel anything strange?

449
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,550
Your younger brother is a detective,
you should have told him !

450
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,980
I just thought it was
a mistake sent from the bank.

451
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:54,470
In essence, the money that you
leave in the account, right?

452
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,940
Oh, that...

453
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:00,400
I took it and used it for stock...

454
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,950
This guy!

455
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,330
Damn.

456
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,070
I plan to
return it when it's up.

457
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,290
I can withdraw and
return it now.

458
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,720
- Luckily it's gone up a bit.
- Are you seriously saying that?

459
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,510
Why are you using that money? It
's not your money! That's a crime!

460
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,260
This guy is still unconscious, huh?

461
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:20,640
If it goes wrong, Dong-Wook can
go to jail now because of you.

462
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,630
He didn't do anything wrong.

463
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,720
He was just unlucky
to fall into a trap.

464
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,610
However, we were lucky
that the principal money was secured.

465
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,290
Quickly take it and enter
the initial amount into the savings book.

466
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,490
Well.

467
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,010
But, is it true because I'm Dong-Wook...

468
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:38,100
- into the cell?
- No, that will never happen.

469
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,120
We will not stand still.
Don't worry.

470
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,720
But how did they
get to your account?

471
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:47,000
- Someone asked you to tell him?
- There isn't any.

472
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,320
Then lately there's nowhere
to give and take the money so,

473
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,300
I rarely use it.

474
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:55,100
What was the last reason they made
a passbook transaction?

475
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,500
about that,

476
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,190
he said there used to be a TJ chairman named...

477
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,530
- Choi Yong-geun?
- Yes, that's right.

478
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,990
At first he told to make
the savings book, and it was finally made.

479
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:06,190
And it looks like it was only
used once at that time.

480
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,210
Apparently all of this was
Choi Yong-Geun's idea.

481
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,270
and Jang Ki-Jin's position was as
his accomplice.

482
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,980
Let's catch Jang Ki-Jin too.

483
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:16,310
Based on Goo Jae-Choon's statement,

484
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,420
request an arrest warrant
from the Prosecutor,

485
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,860
under the pretext of Incitement to Attempted
Murder, Jung In-Beom.

486
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,600
that scumbag is the one who started
this fight.

487
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,400
We have to win the battle

488
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,620
Therefore,

489
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,720
we can catch Cheon Na-Na.

490
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,090
This is the outfit
Jung Hee Joo's victim was wearing,

491
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,890
which we confiscated some time ago.

492
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,120
This is hidden evidence,

493
00:23:37,210 --> 00:23:38,700
by the killer, Ki Dong-Jae.

494
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,910
Why the evidence

495
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,910
just appeared now?

496
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,700
We got a report that the investigator
in charge of hiding it.

497
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,110
What is the purpose?

498
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,260
The goal is to
use it as a tool

499
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:52,060
to prove Chief Chun's
innocence ahead of the second trial.

500
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,290
It is said that

501
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,490
found other people's blood stains
on the victim's clothes.

502
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,110
<i>Whose does it belong to?</i>

503
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:01,010
We can't
announce it right now,

504
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,300
but we believe,

505
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:04,380
there is a high possibility,

506
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,090
this blood smeared by someone,

507
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:08,300
after the incident, not during
the incident,

508
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,400
to manipulate evidence.

509
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,760
Is there any evidence regarding this?

510
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,070
From the TJ Group,

511
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:16,570
confirmed that
large sums of money had been deposited,

512
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,090
to the family of the legal team for
the Jung Hee-Joo case.

513
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:21,520
It is believed they have bribed
detectives from the Criminal Team,

514
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,790
who hides evidence to

515
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:25,800
obtain acquittal
in the second trial.

516
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:28,130
The person in charge of this case
is the Criminal Team,

517
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:30,700
do you mean the Criminal Team
of the Incheon Police Station?

518
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,820
That's right.

519
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,610
Incheon Division's Criminal Team is,

520
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:36,480
the team that made the greatest contribution
to Chairman Cheon

521
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,510
until found guilty as
the mastermind of the murder.

522
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,490
But why do they

523
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,500
trying to free
Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo again?

524
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,530
Good point.

525
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:47,280
When found not guilty
at the first trial,

526
00:24:47,350 --> 00:24:48,910
whoever it was all suspicious.

527
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,970
Received criticism for having
released the chairman of a conglomerate family.

528
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,710
At the first meeting,

529
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,240
he gets punished,

530
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,040
then released at the second trial.

531
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,600
It's a scenario,

532
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,210
co-created

533
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,690
by Chairman Cheon and the Criminal Team
of Incheon Seobu.

534
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,910
Didn't you say you
burned clothes, Jung Hee-Joo?

535
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,690
Why is it in Chairman Jang's hands?

536
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,680
Why?

537
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,590
This is the same reason that
Ki Dong-Jae didn't burn the shirt.

538
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,810
I have done many evils,

539
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,280
to remove the evidence.

540
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,180
As the Director said,

541
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,330
as soon as I do something against
the Director's orders,

542
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,410
I fell into the abyss.

543
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:36,640
I'm just preparing myself
for such a case.

544
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,490
Then?

545
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,630
Whose blood is on the clothes?

546
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,410
Don't you know the most
about it?

547
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,600
As said before the press,

548
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:54,560
can you fake the bloodstain ?

549
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,140
I can't handle it myself.

550
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,990
You have to help a little.

551
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:00,100
We have to use the police, the prosecutors,
to the press,

552
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:02,390
behind the scene.

553
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,650
Me?

554
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:06,830
If the problem occurs again,

555
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:08,390
you and me,

556
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,290
the end of our history.

557
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,000
You think you can set me up,

558
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,500
with that blood stain?

559
00:26:18,770 --> 00:26:20,480
You won't be able to do it.

560
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,990
So are the detectives.

561
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,090
I decide the end of my story.

562
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:30,420
No one can end
me now but myself.

563
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,710
I decide everything.

564
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,610
Not me,

565
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,710
but you have to work
it out well for yourself.

566
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:41,300
Goo Jae-Choon and Jang Ki-Jin
communicated via burner cell phone.

567
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,320
That means the two of them,

568
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,540
had planned
Jung In-Beom's assassination beforehand.

569
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,660
Then,

570
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,960
Aren't you sure that Jang Ki-Jin,

571
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,410
hand over Ki Dong-Jae's evidence
to Goo Jae-Choon's side?

572
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:52,690
What?

573
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,520
Okay.

574
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,990
We will conduct a reinforcement investigation
and then report back.

575
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,380
Well.

576
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,080
What did he say?

577
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:09,060
Couldn't prove
that the two of them conspired.

578
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:10,990
Could it be
that the announcements we made were related to

579
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:13,000
Jang Ki-Jin who had
falsified the evidence,

580
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,200
Had any affect at all ?

581
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,400
It seems so.

582
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:18,140
- Even the Prosecutor doesn't believe us.
- To be honest, from the outside,

583
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,220
isn't the Seoul Investigation one percentage ,

584
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,500
will be heavier than
our department?

585
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,110
In the end we also lost
to Jang Ki-Jin.

586
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:27,310
Cheon Na-na must have helped
him from behind.

587
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:32,210
Now TJ's power goes to Cheon.
Its power can be felt.

588
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,970
Truly.

589
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,290
I got a call from
the audit division officer at headquarters.

590
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:43,500
You get a call.

591
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,730
What? All teams?

592
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:49,880
Serious summoning reasons.

593
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,740
It looks like that cheeky Jang Ki-Jin,

594
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,190
really beat us this time.

595
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:57,340
After all, they're the ones who
fake it, aren't they?

596
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,900
What's there to be afraid of?

597
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,380
We can go and tell
the truth.

598
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,880
He seems to want
our investigation to go down the drain,

599
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,650
from his desire
to capture us.

600
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,850
No need to go as a group

601
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:13,990
I'll go in first
and adjust the situation.

602
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,900
Why is your opponent getting bigger and bigger?

603
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,650
Too excessive.

604
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,940
Too greedy.
This time it was really late.

605
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:27,140
Did you do it on purpose?

606
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,330
I'm just investigating
a murder case,

607
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,470
but the big ones
appeared at the same time...

608
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,950
Then avoid it.

609
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,850
You're not the only one
having a hard time, are you?

610
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,020
Your team members.

611
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:37,230
they all will get in trouble

612
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:38,460
What will you do?

613
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,520
Don't scare me .
You know the guys , right?

614
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,510
  you know I'm not that kind of a person either.

615
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,800
If you look closely.
You'll know which side to play with.

616
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,080
I'm not interested in that.

617
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,940
All I know is one thing

618
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,900
If I give you help,

619
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,910
then I will trip over a boulder.

620
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm not asking for your help.

621
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,270
I'm just asking you to
give us a little leeway.

622
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:01,430
What they want

623
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,090
is not giving us time.

624
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,890
So give us some time...

625
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,290
Come on...

626
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,100
Inspector Yoon Sang-Mi.

627
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,320
Please.

628
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,620
Senior.

629
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,530
Once is enough.

630
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,410
You're a cop.

631
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:22,240
Humanly speaking, you're so cool.

632
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:25,190
Then just come here,

633
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,840
don't be so cool anymore.

634
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:35,840
Subtitles by : Summer Fouad

635
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:49,850
Absolutely nothing has changed.

636
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,650
It doesn't seem to work.

637
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't you have any
senior acquaintances at headquarters?

638
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,090
You know a lot of cops
all over the place, don't you?

639
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,600
Of course a lot.

640
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,330
But for the most part,

641
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,080
consists of seniors who hate me.

642
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,000
Why are you living like that?

643
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,690
Because I live with you.

644
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:10,180
And will continue to live with you.

645
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,580
Base.

646
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:17,700
What?

647
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,180
- Why are you living like that?
- What?

648
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,800
If you want to nag, hang up the phone.

649
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,880
Why are you living so insensitive?

650
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,470
If you want to ask for help,

651
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,000
You can call me secretly
and talk about it.

652
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:31,070
How can you ask for help
in a place where a lot of people pass by?

653
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,170
That's why you're never lucky.

654
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,910
Hey, what do you think your life is like?

655
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,070
My goodness.

656
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:41,160
How dare you say
that to the boss?

657
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,320
You have to be able to tell the difference between up and down.

658
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,920
Alright, hang up.

659
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,320
After seeing it again,

660
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,270
looks like it will take some time
to review

661
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,140
about a week.

662
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:54,190
What?

663
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,010
Of course.

664
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,120
Inspector Yoon Sang-Mi.

665
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,900
You really are very thorough.
Of course,

666
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:06,180
- You should check it carefully.
- A week.

667
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,880
After that I will do
according to the rules.

668
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,510
Okay, got it.
Greetings.

669
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,950
It turns out that I live well.

670
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,860
You just need to live like me.

671
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,720
No more no less,
just like Kang Do-Chang.

672
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,070
Yeah

673
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:29,090
We have plenty of time.

674
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,990
How can we reverse this?

675
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,590
We have to have a handle.

676
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,110
What kind of handle?

677
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:37,030
A far more powerful grip,

678
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:40,030
than Cheon Na-Na.

679
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:42,020
<i>Your head is going to explode right?</i>

680
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,800
Because busy making this and that story.

681
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,230
Hey.

682
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:47,970
At least,

683
00:31:48,670 --> 00:31:51,310
there must be such a thing as chance, right?

684
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:54,280
Isn't that all too
ridiculous?

685
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,520
Weren't you the one who ordered
to manipulate it?

686
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:02,440
I don't have the talent
to make up stories like you.

687
00:32:04,910 --> 00:32:06,210
Well then, it looks like Dad.

688
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,590
Right.

689
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,560
- This just makes sense.
- You...

690
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,750
really believe that?

691
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,760
You're his favorite child, aren't you?

692
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:21,040
What can he not do
for his beloved child.

693
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,040
He thinks I did this to you.

694
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,310
He will do anything to
kill me and save you

695
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:34,510
But why does the situation continue to favor you?

696
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,230
You think Dad is stupid?

697
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:41,530
Looks like Dad misunderstood.

698
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:44,410
I think he still has power.

699
00:32:45,270 --> 00:32:48,330
He didn't know all his power
had passed to me.

700
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,510
So he did things
without thinking.

701
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,510
It's just your thoughts.

702
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,330
We never gave it to you.

703
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:59,840
You took it yourself.

704
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:01,230
Everything just...

705
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:04,680
only in your mind.

706
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,660
You know why I wanted to go back
to where Dad was?

707
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,490
That dad...

708
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,750
make everything happen
the way he wants.

709
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,500
If Dad wanted it,
then it would happen.

710
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:19,310
It doesn't matter if it fits or not.

711
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,000
If Dad says it's true,
then it's the truth.

712
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,410
I'll show you.

713
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,470
A world where my thoughts come true.

714
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,590
You can't

715
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,400
I told you can't do that ,, did I ?

716
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:38,820
Look at you now.

717
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,000
What I thought came true, didn't it?

718
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,110
At first, my next thought was,

719
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:55,850
get you out of here
after some time.

720
00:33:56,710 --> 00:33:58,560
If you just shut up...

721
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,940
But you and Daddy,

722
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,180
keep changing my mind.

723
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,000
I can't beat you.

724
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,920
What can I do
with this crazy woman?

725
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:22,210
Okay.

726
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:24,780
Let's see what you want.

727
00:34:25,410 --> 00:34:28,410
Let's see how far

728
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:30,870
your thoughts come true.

729
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,000
- Yes?
- Hello?

730
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,410
I got a summons for the Chairman
from the Incheon Police Station.

731
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,210
I?
Are you sure?

732
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,400
Summon for me?

733
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,690
<i>That's right.</i>

734
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,080
What's this?

735
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,600
Deliberately trying to make me angry?

736
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,690
Sorry, but...

737
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:05,910
they attached
a subpoena too.

738
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:09,120
Because that makes things
more complicated.

739
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,930
<i>Father sent the only person who,</i>

740
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:17,210
<i>you consider your only
family to go to prison?</i>

741
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:20,180
<i>I sent the evidence
to the police station.</i>

742
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,780
<i>I am your daughter,</i>

743
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,540
<i>but can you forgive me?</i>

744
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,200
<i>Apparently you came
with determination today.</i>

745
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,830
<i>Apparently you came
determinedly today.</i>

746
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,520
That voice recording,

747
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,400
Was it Na-Na who sent it?

748
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:38,990
That's right.

749
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:42,310
What are you doing this for?

750
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,870
Perhaps you have seen in the media,

751
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,180
we are in charge
of the Cheon Na-Na case.

752
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:47,970
This is evidence of the victim,

753
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,830
so we can't ignore it.

754
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:52,390
It was just a dad scolding his daughter.

755
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,440
If a father,

756
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,380
heard that from his daughter,

757
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,820
wouldn't he
lose his mind?

758
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,170
Yes, that is correct.

759
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,480
You can say that.

760
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:06,240
But please understand the position of the police.

761
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,900
The situation where Cheon Na-Na fainted
from the drug overdose,

762
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,510
and what did you say to
Cheon Na-Na,

763
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,090
coincidentally fits perfectly.

764
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,590
So?

765
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,590
Do I have to
make excuses for you guys?

766
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,010
No need.

767
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:27,600
We believe it was
Cheon Na-Na's plan.

768
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,310
You want me...

769
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,660
declare that my daughter

770
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,500
have made a plan

771
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,320
to blame her father?

772
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,350
I ask for your cooperation
in research.

773
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,850
Honestly we are having trouble with this.

774
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:49,400
We are asking for your help to
stop the harassment.

775
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,290
If I don't cooperate,

776
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,970
you will reveal the recording to media,

777
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,930
so?

778
00:36:56,450 --> 00:36:57,510
That's right.

779
00:37:03,870 --> 00:37:04,920
my pride,

780
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,940
Is very hurt now

781
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,040
I did lose power,

782
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:15,920
but I'm not weak enough
to make a deal with you guys.

783
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,150
Please show the tape file
to the press.

784
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,440
Because I have to take responsibility
for what I say.

785
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,280
you guys are

786
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:30,890
Detective Kang Do-Chang,

787
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,330
and Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok?

788
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,980
The name of the person I remember,

789
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,880
is a very good person to me.

790
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,580
Or someone who has
exposed an unforgettable disgrace.

791
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,730
Maybe one of the two.

792
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,790
I will never,

793
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,370
forget your names,

794
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,340
however.

795
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,840
Mr. President.

796
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,450
Sir, I have something to say.

797
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:19,830
Open the door.

798
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,120
The investigation we are doing,

799
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,910
to reveal that Gi Dong-Jae
didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo.

800
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:38,900
If it's revealed, Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo,

801
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:40,720
will be released.

802
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,680
The situation I expected came to reality.

803
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:59,310
- Are the results of the investigation out yet?
- Not yet.

804
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,580
I saw the recent transaction price
at the Gangnam building,

805
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,820
of the same size nearby,

806
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,210
around 25 billion won in the city right now.

807
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:12,080
If it is divided into 8...

808
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,660
Are you crazy?

809
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:17,310
Are you happy with that?

810
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,240
But now,

811
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,430
isn't this unfair?

812
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,030
Shouldn't it be paid
differently based on rank?

813
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,830
No, not even you and the Chairman,

814
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,170
- accept small quantity.
- Why?

815
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,580
It hasn't been long, has it?

816
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,420
We should get a lot
of experience from criminal life.

817
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,380
You don't have a family, do you?

818
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,850
me and the chairman,

819
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,900
have other people
to feed.

820
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,510
I have a mother too...

821
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,290
Chairman Cheon Sung-Dae, promised to
cooperate in the investigation.

822
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:52,070
President Cheon Sung-Dae, promised to
cooperate in the investigation.

823
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,400
We just have to keep going.

824
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,350
Chairman Cha, is it too late?

825
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,730
<i>No problem.
go a head</i>

826
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,480
How about dinner?

827
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,410
Okey

828
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,900
<i>What's the matter, sir?</i>

829
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:25,830
There's something I'd like to introduce
to Chairman Cha.

830
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,700
Okay sir.

831
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:43,250
You've come.

832
00:40:44,260 --> 00:40:46,380
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

833
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:51,130
<i>Please come in.</i>

834
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,110
<i>Thank you.</i>

835
00:40:54,770 --> 00:40:56,210
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

836
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,380
Also the President, the Head of the Director General and the Minister.

837
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:02,540
Thank you for accepting
my invitation.

838
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,720
I feel like new again.

839
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,630
Cheon Sung-Dae is not dead yet.

840
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:14,840
<i>You all have established
a good relationship with me.</i>

841
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,700
But I never

842
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,100
ask the audience for help.

843
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:21,950
However,

844
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,950
there is one thing I regret.

845
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,650
<i>I think I'm not a picky eater.</i>

846
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:29,310
<i>But it turns out,</i>

847
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:32,020
<i>peanut rice that I ate
while in the prison cell</i>

848
00:41:32,110 --> 00:41:33,890
<i>really not
to my taste</i>

849
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:39,730
I'm ashamed to say this
with my own mouth,

850
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,640
but in the past,

851
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,650
I give you a little support.

852
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,700
I don't want to burden the audience.

853
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,500
No

854
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,880
Honestly, in my heart...

855
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:53,640
one day...

856
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,540
When I really

857
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:57,250
need help,

858
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,880
I saved it at the right time.

859
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,330
And I think,

860
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,950
that time is now.

861
00:42:06,750 --> 00:42:08,080
Please help.

862
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,980
<i>I am saying goodbye.</i>

863
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,990
<i>Be careful on the road, sir.</i>

864
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:25,100
<i>Thank you.</i>

865
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:36,900
I think this is
a good opportunity for me too.

866
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,780
a privilege for me,

867
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,900
can meet face to face
with great people.

868
00:42:43,330 --> 00:42:44,400
you,

869
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:46,030
big in America, right?

870
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,510
Yes, that is correct.

871
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,930
If you want to do business in Korea,

872
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,820
know this.

873
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,810
Here we do not trade,

874
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:58,540
with money like in America,

875
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:01,140
we do it with politics.

876
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:03,320
Yes

877
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,130
What are you doing?

878
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,690
This is a search warrant.

879
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:20,910
What is the reason?

880
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:33,220
Did you draw it yourself?

881
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,970
- Right.
- You said you caught a glimpse of it?

882
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:38,550
How can you
draw it clearly.

883
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,930
Could someone hand over a photo
and tell you to draw it?

884
00:43:44,490 --> 00:43:45,560
Mr Prosecutor,

885
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,280
can i have a sheet of a4 paper

886
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,750
Sir, could you please come in for a moment?

887
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,110
What's wrong, sir?

888
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,900
Nothing. You can go out.

889
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,060
Good, sir.

890
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:24,670
Please tell me what happened

891
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:28,960
with Team Leader Jang Ki-Jin at
Jung In-Beom's shoe shop in detail.

892
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,810
Team Leader,
what happened?

893
00:44:43,190 --> 00:44:45,770
- What?
- On the warrant of detention,

894
00:44:45,790 --> 00:44:49,760
You are under suspicion of Ki Dong-Jae's
murder and Jung In-Beom's assassination plot.

895
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:50,830
Hey!

896
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:52,410
You believe that?

897
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,970
Goo Jae-Chun, that bastard, was just
talking nonsense and trying to frame me.

898
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,640
Team Leader, no, brother.

899
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,740
What you've been doing lately

900
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,380
In our opinion, it
doesn't feel natural either.

901
00:45:04,830 --> 00:45:06,590
Please explain to us.

902
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,910
Why do you keep taking
cases in weird directions?

903
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:15,010
Get Goo Jae-Chun out of custody.

904
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,420
I will interrogate
Goo Jae-Chun directly,

905
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:20,080
and reveal the truth.

906
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,850
This is easier to eat
than plain tofu.

907
00:45:25,330 --> 00:45:26,880
You've worked hard. Eat it.

908
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:28,750
Anu, what about my older Brother?

909
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:32,650
- That guy's causing trouble...
- Hey!

910
00:45:33,050 --> 00:45:35,110
He did something
worthy of praise.

911
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:39,070
Since he's cooperating, we don't
need to keep track of his accounts, right?

912
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,810
He said he took the money
and used it.

913
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:46,340
Regarding that, he seemed to sense
that it wasn't good money.

914
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:49,510
So because he's afraid of harming you,

915
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,510
he did money laundering.

916
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:55,680
Brother, what do you think is
a consistent word?

917
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,750
It's inconsistent?

918
00:45:56,780 --> 00:46:01,790
Why do you use
criminal language like money laundering?

919
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,830
Hey, don't blame your brother.

920
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:06,450
He is only used by bad people.
Your brother is innocent.

921
00:46:06,470 --> 00:46:10,760
Right. During that time, your brother
kept worrying about you.

922
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:15,470
And you can be released because
your brother is not greedy and speaks the truth.

923
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:18,560
Yes thank you.

924
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,170
- Hey, Man-Goo.
- Yes.

925
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,200
If I open my cupboard,
there is alcohol that I have stored.

926
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,300
Bring this.

927
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,710
There aren't many?
Only that?

928
00:46:28,710 --> 00:46:31,590
Before successfully catching Jang Ki-Jin,

929
00:46:32,070 --> 00:46:34,180
I won't drink
any alcohol.

930
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,870
I will catch him,

931
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:39,430
with my own hands.

932
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,280
Okay.

933
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:47,400
Then,
let's eat too.

934
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:50,450
Hello, Inspector Yoon Sang-Mi.

935
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:52,830
You've grown, yes.
Now you can even use the connection.

936
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:54,820
What do you mean?

937
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:58,750
Today I was contacted
directly by the Director General.

938
00:46:59,020 --> 00:47:03,010
He asked me to stop checking
all sectors of the Incheon West Office.

939
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,090
What happened?

940
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:10,030
I can easily contact
the Chief Director General of the Incheon region.

941
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:15,880
Not the Chief Director General of Incheon,
but from the Head of the Central Director General in Seoul.

942
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:17,630
<i>I have also just been contacted for the first time.</i>

943
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:19,750
What? Did he contact you?

944
00:47:19,790 --> 00:47:24,500
What kind of stronghold did you join,
until the Head of the Director General of Police came forward?

945
00:47:25,730 --> 00:47:27,610
It's hard for me to
tell.

946
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,630
Within the police, there is a
secret stronghold that is not detected.

947
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,330
You just need to know that
I'm at the center of the stronghold.

948
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:38,890
Oh, is that so?

949
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,340
But it looks like I have
to turn off the phone immediately.

950
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:44,690
I feel like
swearing a little longer.

951
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,510
And don't
take my calls anymore,

952
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:52,390
when you've just had a drink and
are drunk during the day.

953
00:47:55,490 --> 00:47:57,260
Did you experience
anything good today?

954
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,960
This is only because,

955
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:02,230
I am crazy.

956
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:05,640
I'm going crazy.

957
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:11,940
I will accept my punishment.

958
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,960
So you should too.
Let's do it fair and square.

959
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:19,250
Don't keep trying to dodge.

960
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:23,630
By logic, you should be
imprisoned for life.

961
00:48:23,690 --> 00:48:24,720
Good grief.

962
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:27,050
Why are you talking like that?

963
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,030
I've seen
everything you did.

964
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:30,600
I'm still a cop.

965
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:36,110
- I can cover this.
- Stop trapping me!

966
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,490
Go and pray
in a temple or church.

967
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,660
So that you don't go to the same prison
as me, idiot.

968
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:47,090
bastard.
You bastard.

969
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:52,550
Hello?

970
00:48:52,840 --> 00:48:53,960
It's me.

971
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:57,280
Talk to your brother.

972
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,230
Take this.

973
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:02,830
The brother you trust the most.

974
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:08,650
Hello, why?

975
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:11,450
Are you sure?

976
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:14,010
Cash?

977
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:16,970
Is that so?

978
00:49:18,090 --> 00:49:19,430
Okay.

979
00:49:20,670 --> 00:49:22,570
I already understand, idiot.

980
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:29,690
You want to take care of my family?

981
00:49:30,150 --> 00:49:33,720
But how, huh?
I have no family.

982
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,250
Even if there are,
they are all my enemies.

983
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,830
I had absolutely no intention
of taking care of my family's life.

984
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:49,590
The amount is also too much to
be used in prison for life.

985
00:49:49,610 --> 00:49:51,920
It looks like it won't be able
to spend it to death.

986
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,220
You did a pointless thing.

987
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,890
Should we die together?

988
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:02,610
Come on live.

989
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,780
together

990
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:18,290
Ah, you've worked hard.

991
00:50:18,310 --> 00:50:19,450
Please put it here.

992
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:25,020
Older brother 

993
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:41,110
Gosh, you work hard, huh.
Looks like this will take some time.

994
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:43,910
The guards also have to eat.

995
00:50:44,850 --> 00:50:46,500
Gosh, there's no need.

996
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:48,410
How's the Inspector General?

997
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,150
Is he mad at me?
He never took my calls.

998
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,720
Please tell me that
I will meet him.

999
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,620
Does the Inspector General still
drink alcohol and karaoke?

1000
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,970
<i>Goo Jae-Chun, accused of murder, was
caught on the run this afternoon</i>

1001
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:11,220
<i>wearing a police uniform
during interrogation.</i>

1002
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,980
Police are tightening checks
and searches across the capital,

1003
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:17,620
and chased after Goo Jae-Chun
who ran away.

1004
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:21,610
But until now there is still no sign
indicating the existence of...

1005
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,930
What kind of cursed situation
is this again?

1006
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:29,980
This is Jang Ki-Jin's doing.

1007
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:34,430
- He really wants to make matters worse.
- It was Jang Ki-Jin who helped him escape.

1008
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:36,150
He must be hiding him

1009
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:37,900
Then maybe kill him.

1010
00:51:38,100 --> 00:51:40,600
Because the charges can only be
cleared if Goo Jae-Chun dies.

1011
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:43,990
That means Goo Jae-Chun will appear
if we keep chasing Jang Ki-Jin.

1012
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,840
Can a man like a fox
be caught by us?

1013
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:47,940
- Good grief.
- That's right.

1014
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,550
He must have also prepared himself
knowing we were after him now.

1015
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:54,110
I'm here

1016
00:51:54,710 --> 00:51:55,790
Hey!

1017
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:58,220
Where are you from? You did
n't even pick up the phone.

1018
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,370
I'm so worried!

1019
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,120
Now Jang Ki-Jin
is in my hands.

1020
00:52:01,490 --> 00:52:06,050
I had memorized his movements
while following him secretly.

1021
00:52:07,810 --> 00:52:09,580
- It's over, right?
- Yes.

1022
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,940
- But why? What for?
- Looks like this will come in handy.

1023
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,270
Do not rush.

1024
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,640
You can get caught right away if you snoop
or cook a tracking device on the fly.

1025
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:19,740
- All that would be for nothing.
- Yes I know that.

1026
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:23,100
At this time, just as Brother Do-Chang said,
we can only rely on our bodies.

1027
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:26,150
It was time for
him to come out after the meeting.

1028
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:28,150
And just trust me,
stay awake here.

1029
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:29,970
I'll be right back
if there's any progress.

1030
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:31,600
Hey, Dong-Wook!

1031
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,910
What made him
so confident?

1032
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,030
Trust him.

1033
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:37,480
He will rely on his body.

1034
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,550
Detective talking to his body.

1035
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,200
<i>Lee Jun-Young</i>

1036
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,610
I put it down because it looks
like you're going to be in danger.

1037
00:54:12,210 --> 00:54:14,720
I've loaded the bullet.
So try checking.

1038
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,530
Until found.

1039
00:54:24,930 --> 00:54:25,960
Damn

1040
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:37,320
You guys still have bullets, right?

1041
00:54:37,350 --> 00:54:38,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

1042
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,600
Put away your gun.

1043
00:54:46,170 --> 00:54:47,210
Hey, you too!

1044
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:48,260
Yes

1045
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,090
Catch them.

1046
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:57,040
<i>Gosh.</i>

1047
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:02,580
Consider yourself lucky.
I almost cut off your head.

1048
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,050
But I endured it.

1049
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:19,990
Hey!

1050
00:55:20,470 --> 00:55:21,620
Quickly get him out.

1051
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,140
Hey, You..

1052
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:36,400
How long were you there?

1053
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:37,920
This.

1054
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,630
Please remove this.

1055
00:55:42,230 --> 00:55:44,550
You should just pee in your pants.
Basic cleaning.

1056
00:55:45,590 --> 00:55:47,560
- I caught him.
- Yes that's right.

1057
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:49,240
I've caught him.

1058
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:04,530
- Ji-Woong.
- Yes.

1059
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:07,600
Take off Team Leader Jang's handcuffs.

1060
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:08,920
What? Why?

1061
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:12,310
We have to hear the explanation first.
Maybe we misunderstood.

1062
00:56:12,330 --> 00:56:15,090
And we shouldn't be
handcuffing detectives.

1063
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:16,150
Oh, fine.

1064
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:18,480
Sit down!

1065
00:56:19,130 --> 00:56:20,770
Sit down!

1066
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:22,660
Damn

1067
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,390
Team Leader Jang Ki-Jin is
welcome to speak first.

1068
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,210
Why are you two
in that place?

1069
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,420
He must be intent on
catching Goo Jae-Chun.

1070
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:41,280
Since he missed it,
he wanted to catch it himself, right?

1071
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,400
Then how do
you explain the money bag,

1072
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,240
fake passport, and the gun
found there?

1073
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,890
It was clearly a trap.

1074
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:54,400
You want to use it as bait to
catch Goo Chae-Jun, right?

1075
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:56,440
On second thought,
it's possible, yes.

1076
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,510
Did this person
say that?

1077
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:02,410
You saw him trying to
shoot a gun at me, right?

1078
00:57:02,450 --> 00:57:04,760
He's trying to kill me
and get rid of the evidence!

1079
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,760
Oh, how is that possible?

1080
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,260
I only played the role of a doll.

1081
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:12,960
I had absolutely
no intention of being vague.

1082
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:16,470
This person who ordered my subordinates to
bring the police uniform,

1083
00:57:16,530 --> 00:57:19,990
bring me money,
and prepare the ship.

1084
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:22,200
Hey!
Don't talk nonsense!

1085
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,480
He's the Chief of the Seoul Investigation Team!

1086
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:27,850
Why did he have to do such a
bad thing? What for?

1087
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:33,440
We tried to kill
Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather on orders

1088
00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:36,620
This Seoul Investigation Team Leader .

1089
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,130
Didn't he
help me escape

1090
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:41,690
and try to get rid
of me to cover it up?

1091
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:46,790
And the killing of Ki Dong-Jae was also
bestowed upon us by him.

1092
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,730
He told me to kill him.

1093
00:57:48,950 --> 00:57:51,370
You guys only defended him
because of your fellow detectives, huh?

1094
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:52,870
I really
won't stay silent.

1095
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:55,100
I will reveal
everything to the reporters.

1096
00:57:55,130 --> 00:57:59,550
That the detectives teamed up and
tried to pass it all on me!

1097
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:01,740
- Ji-Woong.
- Yes.

1098
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:05,620
Try handcuffing
Team Leader Jang again.

1099
00:58:06,510 --> 00:58:07,780
Oh well.

1100
00:58:10,010 --> 00:58:13,550
People think I'm stupid, don't they?

1101
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,910
Just relax.

1102
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,630
- Two handcuffs.
- Oh, all right.

1103
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,060
Who thinks you're stupid?
Not like that.

1104
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:27,700
The incident this time didn't happen
because of Jang Ki-Jin's fault.

1105
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:32,210
President Cheon Sung-Dae is
supporting the detectives.

1106
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,750
If things continue like this,
Vice President Cheon Sang-Woo

1107
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,650
could have been acquitted and
found not guilty.

1108
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:41,250
In that case,

1109
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,400
it gives the detectives
a chance to return

1110
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,070
investigating the
Jang Hee-Joo murder case.

1111
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:49,690
So?

1112
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:54,990
Even if they reinvestigate,
no new evidence will emerge.

1113
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,940
But what's bothering
me is,

1114
00:59:00,270 --> 00:59:02,000
Woo Tae-Ho's case.

1115
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,480
If it was discovered that
it was no ordinary accident,

1116
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:09,010
but a premeditated accident,

1117
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,000
then the relationship between the parties in the Jung Hee-Joo case will be illustrated .

1118
00:59:12,020 --> 00:59:15,580
In that case, it will become an
excuse for the detectives

1119
00:59:15,610 --> 00:59:18,160
to compete to take care
of Jung Hee-Joo's case.

1120
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,280
You don't have to worry.

1121
00:59:23,770 --> 00:59:28,290
Because the detectives will think
I'm suicidal too.

1122
00:59:29,450 --> 00:59:30,880
And that's true.

1123
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:36,880
Are you serious?

1124
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,960
Yes

1125
00:59:43,410 --> 00:59:46,660
<i>4 months ago</i>

1126
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,240
Not me,

1127
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,110
who killed Jung Hee-Joo.

1128
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,530
Who is it, then?

1129
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:56,900
I don't know that either.

1130
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,870
Why should I
believe what you say?

1131
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:08,650
Did you know there is a
villa around Yangpyeong?

1132
01:00:09,630 --> 01:00:14,030
There, I received
Jung Hee-Joo's body.

1133
01:00:16,030 --> 01:00:17,240
From whom?

1134
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,180
Team Leader Choi Yong-Geun.

1135
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:27,910
He who killed Jung Hee-Joo?

1136
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,050
No one knows.

1137
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:31,440
But,

1138
01:00:32,650 --> 01:00:35,960
there was no reason for him to kill
Jung Hee-Joo with his own hands.

1139
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:37,830
'Cause even if he's just silent,

1140
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,560
I would have
killed Jung Hee-Joo.

1141
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:47,880
In that case, did Vice President
Cheon Sang-Woo himself kill her?

1142
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,060
I think so.

1143
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,510
But Team Leader Choi
once told me,

1144
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,700
to confess to the Vice President
that I killed her

1145
01:00:58,170 --> 01:00:59,710
Therefore,
I can earn money

1146
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:04,350
After receiving the body, I contacted
Vice President Cheon Sang-Woo.

1147
01:01:05,060 --> 01:01:09,050
First of all, I said I still
haven't killed Jung Hee-Joo.

1148
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,810
Then he told me
to immediately kill her

1149
01:01:15,160 --> 01:01:16,600
Vice President Cheon,

1150
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:20,810
didn't know that
Jung Hee-Joo was already dead.

1151
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,570
In that case,
not Cheon Sang-Woo.

1152
01:01:27,570 --> 01:01:29,000
Then who, huh?

1153
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,340
whose shadow i see,

1154
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,940
in the living room of the villa where I received,

1155
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:42,970
Jung Hee-Joo's body?

1156
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:48,620
I've conveyed
all the facts that I know.

1157
01:01:50,360 --> 01:01:51,660
Now it's your turn.

1158
01:01:52,730 --> 01:01:54,410
Now there are people,

1159
01:01:56,130 --> 01:01:57,910
that comes
to your mind, right?

1160
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:02,560
who is

1161
01:02:04,570 --> 01:02:05,610
that person?

1162

<i>History of Recent Destinations
Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi</i>

1163
01:02:28,510 --> 01:02:29,570
Why?

1164
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:40,520
On that day,

1165
01:02:42,310 --> 01:02:45,220
why were you here?

1166
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:49,390
On the day Jung Hee-Joo was murdered,

1167
01:02:52,150 --> 01:02:53,750
why did you come here?

1168
01:03:03,010 --> 01:03:04,450
I do not remember.

1169
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:09,160
When was that time
you were talking about?

1170
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:12,130
I looked at your car's destination history.

1171
01:03:13,900 --> 01:03:15,480
You came here
that day.

1172
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:18,850
That means Maybe I was here.

1173
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:20,690
Who with?

1174
01:03:24,020 --> 01:03:25,180
Jung Hee Joo?

1175
01:03:27,820 --> 01:03:29,920
Why did you bring her here?

1176
01:03:38,030 --> 01:03:39,850
I asked her,

1177
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:41,840
What is wrong with her,

1178
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,230
why,

1179
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,470
does she love someone like you?

1180
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,790
Do you love her too?

1181
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:58,210
I'm still confused too.

1182
01:03:59,380 --> 01:04:00,590
Tae-Ho.

1183
01:04:06,740 --> 01:04:08,750
Did we ever love each other?

1184
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,390
Is it painful?

1185
01:04:24,050 --> 01:04:25,690
When she died?

1186
01:04:34,860 --> 01:04:36,390
How about today?

1187
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:40,330
You knew
before you came, right?

1188
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,670
How?

1189
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,240
Was it as painful
as back then?

1190
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:51,890
I do not love you.

1191
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,880
If I love you,

1192
01:04:58,630 --> 01:05:01,010
maybe I
killed Jung Hee-Joo.

1193
01:05:03,840 --> 01:05:06,110
But I didn't
kill Jung Hee-Joo.

1194
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,320
Your current thoughts are wrong.

1195
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:13,630
Jung Hee-Joo was murdered,

1196
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:16,470
by my brother,
Cheon Sang-Woo.

1197
01:05:19,510 --> 01:05:20,590
No

1198
01:05:21,980 --> 01:05:23,790
It wasn't Cheon Sang-Woo who killed her

1199
01:05:26,180 --> 01:05:27,570
I killed her

1200
01:05:31,210 --> 01:05:33,470
I killed Jung Hee-Joo,

1201
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:36,280
for fear of our relationship being exposed.

1202
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:41,610
All of this started with me.
That's right.

1203
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,070
Na-Na,

1204
01:05:45,300 --> 01:05:46,610
you didn't do anything.

1205
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,020
I'll turn myself in.

1206
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:51,790
The police can do it too

1207
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:55,330
accept my murder motive.

1208
01:05:56,010 --> 01:05:57,540
For whom?

1209
01:05:58,760 --> 01:05:59,890
Jung Hee Joo?

1210
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:03,460
Or me?

1211
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:09,650
I,

1212
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:12,890
killed Jung Hee-Joo here.

1213
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:17,680
It was an unplanned murder .

1214

After 10 years...

1215

After about 10 years,

1216
01:06:33,770 --> 01:06:35,500
we will meet again

1217
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:39,910
At the time,

1218
01:06:41,470 --> 01:06:43,710
You only need to tell
me one thing.

1219
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:48,310
that you,

1220
01:06:53,240 --> 01:06:54,710
will forgive me.

1221
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:40,880
How about this?

1222
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:44,160
I still haven't,

1223
01:07:45,650 --> 01:07:48,420
intended to forgive you.
