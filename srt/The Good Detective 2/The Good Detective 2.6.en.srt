Episode 6
[Subtitles translations by twitter: @LeeYunnes]

6
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:42,073
One missed call

7
00:00:57,691 --> 00:00:58,792
Hello,What is it?

8
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,079
Let's eat.

9
00:01:00,986 --> 00:01:03,166
Yes, but I have some work to do.

10
00:01:03,196 --> 00:01:04,597
I'll call you as soon as it's done.

11
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:06,433
All right, call me when you're done.

12
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:30,616
The number you dialed...

13
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:32,092
The phone is turned off.

14
00:01:33,451 --> 00:01:35,544
- The phone was on before, right?
- Right.

15
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,013
Can you confirm where it is?

16
00:01:58,074 --> 00:01:59,128
Yes.

17
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:01,127
Right.

18
00:02:03,277 --> 00:02:04,464
I already know.

19
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:07,274
Then, I will meet you
there in about an hour.

20
00:02:07,694 --> 00:02:09,034
Okay.

21
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:35,716
Chief.

22
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:39,386
Chief.

23
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:42,902
What?

24
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,698
What is the problem?

25
00:02:48,707 --> 00:02:51,080
Kang Do-Chang, is he still at the office?

26
00:02:51,301 --> 00:02:54,481
Yes, Should I 
ask him to come?

27
00:02:54,797 --> 00:02:57,377
Let's drink together
after such a long time.

28
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:00,594
This is for you.

29
00:03:05,223 --> 00:03:06,303
And this one is for you.

30
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,310
I talked to
Michael on the phone.

31
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:13,360
He just admitted that he is the one who back stabbed you

32
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:18,831
He often compliments Tae Ho. He says
I married the right person.

33
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,610
Michael, that guy is really great.

34
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:27,202
Not many people know
when i did scam,

35
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,805
while in Japan.

36
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,348
A CEO of a big company once said:

37
00:03:35,203 --> 00:03:36,937
"Replace everything except your family".

38
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:41,154
But isn't there someone in our family
who can do it?

39
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,271
Are you talking about Tae-Ho?

40
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,634
You can't change him.

41
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:52,099
If you change him, you will
become the biggest enemy in the family.

42
00:03:52,871 --> 00:03:53,897
That person

43
00:03:54,301 --> 00:03:57,104
knows weakness of
all our family members.

44
00:04:00,482 --> 00:04:01,951
And I'm not going to change him.

45
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:06,138
He's the only one who can give me
insulin injections in my ribs.

46
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,694
You're tired of me, right?

47
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,498
- What?
- Have I been bothering you all this time?

48
00:04:25,267 --> 00:04:27,139
Do you hate seeing my face now?

49
00:04:27,218 --> 00:04:30,185
What can I do?
I can't change the police chief.

50
00:04:30,887 --> 00:04:33,200
Chief, where are you going?

51
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:35,599
Did you get promoted?

52
00:04:35,624 --> 00:04:37,699
You said my chances of getting promoted
only three percent.

53
00:04:38,307 --> 00:04:39,707
It can't be done.

54
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:42,908
You spent 97 percent of it.

55
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,203
I am wrong.

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:47,390
Do-Chang, you, the one, who
should be promoted.

57
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:50,423
How long do you want to be treated?
like that by them?

58
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:51,758
Aren't you ashamed?

59
00:04:51,802 --> 00:04:53,689
Does that mean
Do-Chang will be promoted?

60
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,960
Not for the moment.

61
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,307
But you have to choose between
public information and security department,

62
00:04:58,498 --> 00:05:02,317
at the main office, then pick up
the role of being a team leader.

63
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:03,749
Good then.

64
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:06,000
It's part of the promotion.

65
00:05:06,695 --> 00:05:08,060
Congratulations, Do-Chang.

66
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,035
Why?

67
00:05:09,576 --> 00:05:10,370
Why suddenly?

68
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,522
You guys caught Lee Sung-Gon.

69
00:05:13,113 --> 00:05:15,119
The Director General himself ordered it.

70
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:19,322
That you can take the juniors too if you want.

71
00:05:19,793 --> 00:05:21,959
I will take care of their transfer.

72
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:23,897
It Can be in Seoul,

73
00:05:24,325 --> 00:05:26,214
or also at the Head Office.

74
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:27,720
Well.

75
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,263
That's good.

76
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,750
Juniors will love it.

77
00:05:34,313 --> 00:05:37,220
Why are you so nice to us?

78
00:05:37,537 --> 00:05:40,728
The Lee Dae-Chul incident was huge.
This time, Kim Hyung-Bok.

79
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:43,734
There is also another big investigation
 why?

80
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,191
What is the reason?

81
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:48,727
You said you would eradicate it.

82
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,473
Was that just bullshit?

83
00:05:51,513 --> 00:05:54,025
Right, you can think like that.

84
00:05:55,247 --> 00:05:56,440
It is just...

85
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,859
I can stop
disciplinary action,

86
00:05:58,895 --> 00:06:00,916
but i can't
stop an achievement.

87
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,237
It's a right for people
who deserve it.

88
00:06:10,694 --> 00:06:13,438
Hey, where are you going?

89
00:06:13,493 --> 00:06:15,859
I am leaving because I want to.

90
00:06:15,906 --> 00:06:18,513
Nothing can be
done at this time.

91
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:19,967
- Do-Chang.
- I am leaving.

92
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,200
Just leave it. Sit down!

93
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,751
Either he or I,

94
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,987
can be here.

95
00:06:27,605 --> 00:06:28,918
Do you think it's fun?

96
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:29,965
But, even so

97
00:06:30,218 --> 00:06:31,624
he has to leave because of his achievements.

98
00:06:31,657 --> 00:06:32,418
According to you,

99
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:35,851
does he think so too?

100
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:37,698
No.

101
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,919
Chief Choi.

102
00:06:41,296 --> 00:06:45,749
If you are on active duty and
in charge of the Jung Hee-Joo case,

103
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,543
how will you proceed with
this investigation?

104
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:55,315
I will ask the Cyber ​​Investigation Team
to work together.

105
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,218
Anyone crazy enough
to imitate a serial killer,

106
00:06:59,677 --> 00:07:03,251
definitely left a mark on the internet.

107
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:05,583
If the motive for the murder is imitation,
then it's true.

108
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:10,264
But if someone with a clear motive is
found around Jung Hee-Joo,

109
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:13,129
shouldn't we
change the investigation?

110
00:07:14,177 --> 00:07:15,470
Who knows.

111
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:20,282
Jung Hee-Joo was not the type of person against whom others would have a grudge

112
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:25,088
As an employee of a large company,
The chances of getting involved in a crime is very slim too.

113
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,549
Most likely the motive
was sexual violence.

114
00:07:28,579 --> 00:07:30,572
Because there is no other motive
that can be found?

115
00:07:30,859 --> 00:07:31,819
Right.

116
00:07:33,767 --> 00:07:36,511
Nevertheless, why the
detectives of the western part of Incheon,

117
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,293
are lurking around the Jung Hee-Joo's area?

118
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,521
Because there is Oh Ji-Hyeok
at the West Incheon office.

119
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:48,805
For linking the case of Jung Hee-Joo
with the case 2 years ago?

120
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,138
Right.

121
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:53,467
He thinks that
Jung Hee-Joo's case and,

122
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:56,452
case two years ago,
have the same perpetrator.

123
00:07:58,013 --> 00:07:59,066
However,

124
00:07:59,853 --> 00:08:02,126
he's just a detective
with the rank of lieutenant.

125
00:08:03,832 --> 00:08:06,632
Why is he thinking about it too much?

126
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,564
I am sending him
to a good place.

127
00:08:19,299 --> 00:08:23,670
All will go to a good place.
Why is he cursing me?

128
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:27,649
He was just a little annoyed,
not cursing.

129
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,941
He was clearly cursing me.

130
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,740
How dare he leave
while the Chief was speaking.

131
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:39,422
That lowly bastard.

132
00:08:40,307 --> 00:08:42,320
You said let it go.

133
00:08:43,406 --> 00:08:44,480
What do you mean?

134
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,405
You've been weird lately.

135
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,528
One by one makes me sick.

136
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,165
We are happy because we
do well,

137
00:08:53,346 --> 00:08:55,152
and of course we also love to go there.

138
00:08:55,938 --> 00:08:57,658
You certainly know about it.

139
00:08:58,766 --> 00:09:01,073
- You can see their intentions, right?
- Hey!

140
00:09:01,724 --> 00:09:04,404
Hey, is the investigation of
Jung Hee-Joo case that important?

141
00:09:04,778 --> 00:09:07,166
And is detective
in this country there is only one?

142
00:09:07,709 --> 00:09:08,919
Others can do it.

143
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,385
The problem is no one can.

144
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,275
Hey!

145
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,653
Why?

146
00:09:13,104 --> 00:09:15,151
Is Jung Hee-Joo your daughter?

147
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:16,554
So what

148
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:20,116
you choose someone like
That Kang Do-Chang as a cop?

149
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,006
You should just choose
people who just want a promotion.

150
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:26,885
You should choose
shameless person like me.

151
00:09:27,228 --> 00:09:30,148
Why did you choose
such a person as a cop?

152
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,730
Why are you like that to me?

153
00:09:33,206 --> 00:09:34,708
Did I choose him?

154
00:09:39,718 --> 00:09:42,052
Thank you for choosing the
hard road.

155
00:10:06,784 --> 00:10:07,838
Hey.

156
00:10:08,117 --> 00:10:10,104
It's not even enough
to pay a lawyer.

157
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,123
Shouldn't you need a
good lawyer?

158
00:10:12,289 --> 00:10:13,789
Yoo-Na is your friend.

159
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:16,509
- Will you leave her in jail?
- I'll give you more later.

160
00:10:16,555 --> 00:10:17,828
That's all there is for now.

161
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:20,065
It's probably because
we meet often.

162
00:10:20,898 --> 00:10:22,878
You do have a sweet side.

163
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:24,761
What are you doing?

164
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,254
Hey!

165
00:10:28,937 --> 00:10:30,877
What are you doing, you bastard? Hey!

166
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,200
- Uncle.
- Hey! Stop.

167
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,117
- Good grief!
- Geez.

168
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,530
What did you do to Eun-Hye?

169
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,206
I didnt do anything.

170
00:11:24,885 --> 00:11:28,197
You extorted money from Eun-Hye, right?

171
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,261
It was the money she stole from me.

172
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:32,356
What? What did you mean by Eun Hye stealing ?

173
00:11:32,862 --> 00:11:34,962
Hey, what are you doing?

174
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:36,922
Wait a moment.

175
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:39,761
Please wait a moment.

176
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,076
- What is this?
- What?

177
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,988
Hey!

178
00:11:50,536 --> 00:11:52,476
Sick. Gosh, my back!

179
00:11:52,618 --> 00:11:54,558
Call an ambulance!

180
00:11:55,588 --> 00:11:56,761
Can't you be quiet?

181
00:11:58,197 --> 00:11:59,230
Uncle.

182
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:01,453
Take me to the hospital.
Looks like my back is broken.

183
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:02,546
This child.

184
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,188
Detective Kang, please calm down.
Please explain what the situation is.

185
00:12:06,265 --> 00:12:07,472
Money extortion.

186
00:12:07,545 --> 00:12:09,045
I saw him do it.

187
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:10,598
And this...

188
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:13,315
I know he did.

189
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,769
- Is that true?
- Not.

190
00:12:16,275 --> 00:12:17,615
I just want to get back
the money I lend to Eun Hye.

191
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,401
You said Eun Hye stole it earlier, didn't you?

192
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,576
Uncle.

193
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:25,892
This bastard.

194
00:12:27,013 --> 00:12:29,295
He didn't blackmail me,
I gave it.

195
00:12:29,348 --> 00:12:30,008
Why?

196
00:12:30,393 --> 00:12:31,540
Did that person threaten you?

197
00:12:31,634 --> 00:12:32,826
No, it's just that.

198
00:12:33,773 --> 00:12:36,232
I have to help my friend
because she said she was in trouble.

199
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,463
I understand.

200
00:12:38,663 --> 00:12:40,283
You better go home now.

201
00:12:40,443 --> 00:12:41,855
I'll take care of it here.

202
00:12:41,906 --> 00:12:43,972
Nothing bad
will happen to you, right?

203
00:12:44,037 --> 00:12:46,183
I've been a cop for 20 years.

204
00:12:46,598 --> 00:12:49,012
This is nothing.
No need to worry. Come home!

205
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:50,345
Trust me.

206
00:12:51,697 --> 00:12:52,412
In that case,

207
00:12:53,321 --> 00:12:55,201
Do what Detective Oh says.

208
00:12:55,475 --> 00:12:57,644
If you promise to do it,
I will go.

209
00:12:58,183 --> 00:12:58,823
What?

210
00:12:59,748 --> 00:13:01,834
say goodbye, thank you very much.

211
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:04,329
Hey, say thank you.

212
00:13:04,476 --> 00:13:05,689
Thank you for the help.

213
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,123
Harder!

214
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,815
Thank you so much for your help.

215
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:10,948
- Thank you.
- What's this?

216
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,647
What does this mean?

217
00:13:14,055 --> 00:13:16,695
Who is this bastard 
trying to play around with?

218
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:18,328
Do you know who I am?

219
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:19,831
- Detective Kang.
- I will Get rid of you.

220
00:13:19,992 --> 00:13:21,685
- Go. Go, hurry!
- Watch out!

221
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:23,682
Let me go!

222
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,491
Detective Kang, come on!

223
00:13:26,345 --> 00:13:27,205
Hey.

224
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:30,405
Did you give him money?

225
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,876
Detective Kang, don't make this situation complicated.

226
00:13:34,014 --> 00:13:36,574
How dare you.

227
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,082
What are you doing?

228
00:13:47,768 --> 00:13:49,863
Act along with me.

229
00:13:50,576 --> 00:13:51,796
- What?
- Please.

230
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:56,592
Trust me, lets do this with me.
I'll explain later.

231
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:07,236
Who do you think you can be to
push me around?

232
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:15,920
- He started it first.
- You're so outrageous.

233
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:22,034
Please calm down.

234
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:24,743
What are you doing?

235
00:14:32,105 --> 00:14:34,312
What are you doing?

236
00:14:35,042 --> 00:14:37,115
- Hey!
- What?

237
00:14:37,495 --> 00:14:39,148
Come here! Here you go!

238
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,162
- Are you?
- Hey!

239
00:14:42,186 --> 00:14:45,965
- He Just hit me.
- You hit me first.

240
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,125
Wow.

241
00:15:02,979 --> 00:15:05,579
The views reached
100,000 people in a day.

242
00:15:06,216 --> 00:15:07,876
Isn't this amazing?

243
00:15:08,784 --> 00:15:10,683
You think I don't know
What do you think?

244
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:14,532
You guys are deliberately causing trouble
and  uploaded it.

245
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:17,078
I can see it clearly.

246
00:15:17,103 --> 00:15:19,910
Isn't there always the first time to
do the obvious?

247
00:15:19,935 --> 00:15:20,624
Hey.

248
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:24,523
Should you be this childish?

249
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,525
Are you a teenager
who is rebelling?

250
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:28,933
Yes, I'm going through puberty.

251
00:15:29,223 --> 00:15:33,216
If he mess with me for no reason,
I will beat him.

252
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,011
So tell him
to leave me alone.

253
00:15:37,036 --> 00:15:40,147
It's useless
bothering someone like me.

254
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,808
This week,

255
00:15:46,058 --> 00:15:49,098
write the department you want to go to
and submit immediately.

256
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,010
Can we really enter
the department we want?

257
00:15:52,084 --> 00:15:52,817
Right.

258
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:56,108
Director General is the one who ordered it,
so you guys can definitely get in there.

259
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:56,832
Wow.

260
00:15:56,989 --> 00:15:59,029
If so, can we move to
Gangnam, Seoul?

261
00:15:59,091 --> 00:15:59,902
You can.

262
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:01,307
But,

263
00:16:01,468 --> 00:16:04,442
let's decide carefully.

264
00:16:04,974 --> 00:16:07,747
Don't say later you can't adapt
and get kicked out.

265
00:16:11,107 --> 00:16:14,967
How about taking this chance
to enter Seoul headquarters?

266
00:16:15,012 --> 00:16:18,031
There are many things
which can be done.

267
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:19,306
Let's go together, to Gangnam.

268
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,881
It's the best there, isn't it?

269
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:22,642
- Gang-Nam?
- You guys.

270
00:16:22,803 --> 00:16:24,863
Do you have money for
buying a house in Seoul?

271
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:27,080
Do you want to sleep at Seoul Station?

272
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,354
I didn't think of that.

273
00:16:28,379 --> 00:16:29,954
Isn't that a little suspicious?

274
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:32,726
Why suddenly?

275
00:16:33,035 --> 00:16:34,328
they are being nice to us?

276
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:35,859
I think the Director General is just an excuse.

277
00:16:35,894 --> 00:16:37,505
This is chief's plan.

278
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:39,781
What's with him?
He's been getting along lately.

279
00:16:39,969 --> 00:16:41,376
Can't you see it?

280
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,696
He tried to kick me out because he thought
I'm dating Bo-Kyung.

281
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:48,261
It's weird if I'm the only one being kicked out,

282
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:50,776
so i will invite everyone
and send them together.

283
00:16:52,461 --> 00:16:54,547
I will be back
to America's headquarters today.

284
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,311
Maybe there will be talk
about TJ at the rally.

285
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:00,412
What do you think will happen?

286
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:04,803
Results of research conducted
by the consulting firm will be announced.

287
00:17:05,342 --> 00:17:07,388
There will be many different opinions 

288
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,800
I want to hear your opinion.

289
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,173
Your opinion as
representative McQueen Korea,

290
00:17:14,345 --> 00:17:16,085
will be a very important variable.

291
00:17:17,323 --> 00:17:19,316
I'd rather hear your opinion.

292
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:21,824
What do you really want?

293
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:25,667
King.

294
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:29,536
I didn't see that coming.

295
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,383
It was more than I thought.

296
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,656
Also, I'm just an observer.

297
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,514
I can't decide anything.

298
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,060
Yes

299
00:17:40,562 --> 00:17:41,589
I know that too.

300
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,916
I only said it because I thought
I can tell you.

301
00:17:52,233 --> 00:17:54,459
This is a thank you
for buying art.

302
00:17:54,925 --> 00:17:56,164
There is no other meaning.

303
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,959
This doesnt feel right.

304
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:03,401
I'm sorry.

305
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,870
I have to go to the airport immediately.

306
00:18:24,172 --> 00:18:26,518
We have no give and take relationship, right?

307
00:18:26,682 --> 00:18:27,962
We're just friends.

308
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,470
Forgive me.

309
00:18:52,529 --> 00:18:55,228
I didn't see the light sign, because I was on the call.

310
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,912
It's entirely my responsibility,

311
00:18:56,936 --> 00:18:59,572
I will contact the insurance company
and take action.

312
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,885
I see.

313
00:19:14,127 --> 00:19:15,954
The insurance company will contact you.

314
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:18,190
Insurance company will provide
information for you.

315
00:19:18,304 --> 00:19:19,619
Forgive me.

316
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:21,001
I see. It doesn't matter.

317
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,663
Wait a moment.

318
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,453
She left this and
asked me to tell you.

319
00:19:30,942 --> 00:19:33,075
No rejection. Never ever.

320
00:19:33,309 --> 00:19:35,672
She also wanted me to convey
this message to you.

321
00:19:46,186 --> 00:19:47,721
The Brothers Karamazov

322
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:56,206
"One Message Unread"

323
00:19:56,276 --> 00:19:59,109
It's like I don't know you
well. Sorry.

324
00:19:59,624 --> 00:20:01,730
I'll tell you right away
after I got home.

325
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,999
Ji-Woong, are you sure you
don't want to come with me?

326
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:14,793
Aren't you bored?

327
00:20:15,213 --> 00:20:17,013
It's time to try new thing.

328
00:20:17,121 --> 00:20:20,594
Do-Chang, Jae-Hong and Dong-Wook,

329
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,549
Detective Oh, so familiar now.
Too bad.

330
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,494
Bong-Sik is also a very nice person,

331
00:20:27,774 --> 00:20:29,888
can we meet
someone like them again?

332
00:20:30,009 --> 00:20:31,249
Eun-Hee too.

333
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,002
I will miss
the chicken that Eun-Hee makes.

334
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:39,583
But isn't it strange
if we stay here?

335
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:42,682
If you go to headquarters in Seoul,
your promotion time will change.

336
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:45,263
You said you wanted to live
like Do-Chang someday.

337
00:20:45,485 --> 00:20:47,657
I feel like that,
but the truth is...

338
00:20:48,644 --> 00:20:50,551
That one bastard.

339
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:53,229
Wait a moment.

340
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,980
That's the person.

341
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,820
Isn't that the guy we caught?

342
00:20:59,893 --> 00:21:01,913
The man we handed over
to the narcotics department.

343
00:21:02,252 --> 00:21:03,452
Go after him!

344
00:21:20,229 --> 00:21:22,095
How can he be free?

345
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:26,010
I think something's going on there.

346
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:29,936
Looks like he's delivering stuffs again.

347
00:21:32,438 --> 00:21:35,717
if we raid this out,
we're going to get something big.

348
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,280
Let's wait a little longer.

349
00:21:51,153 --> 00:21:53,253
Shut up!

350
00:21:58,132 --> 00:22:01,018
It is true
You're delivering drugs again.

351
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:03,449
Shit.

352
00:22:03,637 --> 00:22:06,066
However,
his intentions are not pure.

353
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,996
Wont our organization let him go again?

354
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:13,639
You will never get a
opportunity like this again,

355
00:22:13,664 --> 00:22:15,717
during your career as a police officer.

356
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:19,171
Close your eyes and just take a video
if you want to go.

357
00:22:19,295 --> 00:22:20,419
What?

358
00:22:20,538 --> 00:22:21,647
How about you?

359
00:22:23,702 --> 00:22:26,701
- I want to go to Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island? Suddenly?

360
00:22:27,614 --> 00:22:30,935
If I am assigned to Jeju Island,

361
00:22:31,271 --> 00:22:33,185
Of course Bo-Kyung
will also come there.

362
00:22:33,654 --> 00:22:36,802
Then we will stay there. Together.

363
00:22:37,093 --> 00:22:39,412
Why will that woman go to Jeju Island?

364
00:22:39,437 --> 00:22:40,961
You're not Detective Oh.

365
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,725
Just wait and see! Which one 
she follows, me or Detective Oh.

366
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,336
Damn it! You don't know anything
about women's feelings.

367
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:50,007
You are.

368
00:22:50,275 --> 00:22:51,306
Why?

369
00:22:58,225 --> 00:22:59,443
You shoot with your phone camera, right?

370
00:23:01,013 --> 00:23:02,076
Let's hurry.

371
00:23:02,192 --> 00:23:04,715
But, it seems we
should be more careful.

372
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,479
Why? Didn't you say
to send him home?

373
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:10,700
We previously caught
and handed him over to the Narcotics Division,

374
00:23:10,725 --> 00:23:11,967
but he was soon released.

375
00:23:12,378 --> 00:23:14,737
I'm sure there's one of the officer
which he has strong support from.

376
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:16,816
First of all, we have to report
this to the Team Leader, just move.

377
00:23:16,841 --> 00:23:18,316
No need. Just hit him.

378
00:23:19,255 --> 00:23:21,810
Before we leave Incheon,
let's have a big success.

379
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:25,068
Then, I will go to Jeju Island
confidently.

380
00:23:25,584 --> 00:23:27,748
- What Jeju Island?
- Said he wanted to go to Jeju Island.

381
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:29,841
Why,Jeju Island?

382
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,826
Waiting for someone
who will never come.

383
00:23:32,054 --> 00:23:34,296
Lifetime. Alone and lonely.

384
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:35,705
Even so, he wants to go.

385
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:37,382
What do you know?

386
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:04,045
It's the police!

387
00:24:04,459 --> 00:24:07,678
You are all arrested
over drug use!

388
00:24:08,433 --> 00:24:09,878
- Catch them!
- Do not move!

389
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:11,685
You guys are arrested!

390
00:24:12,693 --> 00:24:13,771
Hey, let it go!

391
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:14,998
Let me go!

392
00:24:15,038 --> 00:24:17,020
You damn bastard!

393
00:24:17,045 --> 00:24:17,973
Do not touch!

394
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,300
I said don't touch!

395
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,090
Hey, you, come out.

396
00:24:21,115 --> 00:24:25,012
Disgusting -
Narcotics Party Part two

397
00:24:25,531 --> 00:24:26,763
I love this feeling.

398
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,243
The cast this time is great.

399
00:24:32,432 --> 00:24:34,252
There's a congressman's son.

400
00:24:34,692 --> 00:24:37,106
There are also children of
higher ups.

401
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,629
Already has More views
than the first episode.

402
00:24:39,785 --> 00:24:40,848
Who recorded it?

403
00:24:41,324 --> 00:24:42,848
I recorded it through the phone camera.

404
00:24:44,295 --> 00:24:46,052
You also uploaded it to the internet?

405
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,844
Not. I uploaded it.

406
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:49,609
you again?

407
00:24:49,781 --> 00:24:51,836
Other children do not really understand about SNS.

408
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,057
Oh Ji-Hyeok is so great.

409
00:24:54,863 --> 00:24:58,644
He will succeed if he tries to do business on the internet.

410
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,228
The phoneline is hot,

411
00:25:11,432 --> 00:25:13,127
Including the Commissioner.

412
00:25:18,121 --> 00:25:21,082
This is a phone call from
people I have to respect.

413
00:25:21,551 --> 00:25:23,082
- Team Leader Oh.
- Yes?

414
00:25:23,406 --> 00:25:26,672
You said I had a 3% chance
to be assistant commissioner, right?

415
00:25:27,445 --> 00:25:28,672
How about now?

416
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:32,209
In a situation where all
the son of higher ups,

417
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:33,498
have to go to jail?

418
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,474
Zero percent.

419
00:25:36,521 --> 00:25:38,661
So what are the chances that I will

420
00:25:38,686 --> 00:25:40,669
put these fools
on standby?

421
00:25:42,681 --> 00:25:44,665
Seems like 100%.

422
00:25:44,775 --> 00:25:45,892
Do it like that.

423
00:26:03,513 --> 00:26:07,037
Every time I eat this I always remember the ones  my parents bought.

424
00:26:07,412 --> 00:26:08,779
Very delicious.

425
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:13,955
Didn't I already say that?
We have to be careful.

426
00:26:15,391 --> 00:26:17,867
Even though I am already
looking for a house in Gangnam.

427
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:21,078
I also didn't know that Chief
will go that far.

428
00:26:22,608 --> 00:26:25,062
Does Chief want to make me
stay by his side?

429
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:26,029
Good grief.

430
00:26:26,054 --> 00:26:28,093
I should've just let him move to Jeju.

431
00:26:29,015 --> 00:26:32,140
Even though there will be disappointments,
let's just skip it.

432
00:26:32,669 --> 00:26:35,575
The bus has passed,
and that is the last.

433
00:26:35,857 --> 00:26:37,841
It won't come again
to your life.

434
00:26:38,511 --> 00:26:39,699
Forgive me.

435
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,496
I'm sorry for
take your chances.

436
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:44,911
Instead, from now on,

437
00:26:45,099 --> 00:26:47,645
put everything you eat
in this chicken restaurant in my name.

438
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:50,492
You're so crazy.

439
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:52,179
You are very generous.

440
00:26:52,582 --> 00:26:55,121
Do not worry.
We're not really going to do that.

441
00:26:55,146 --> 00:26:58,246
Hey! You think I look
like a liar?

442
00:26:58,271 --> 00:26:59,691
Eat as you please!

443
00:26:59,989 --> 00:27:01,864
I'll transfer the money to your account.

444
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:04,309
From where?

445
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:07,100
From your empty account
after receiving salary?

446
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,108
Just put on my name.

447
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:10,542
Good grief.

448
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:14,285
Don't just order chicken.
Order something expensive!

449
00:27:14,442 --> 00:27:16,949
Don't just drink soju and beer every day.

450
00:27:17,708 --> 00:27:20,263
Looks like I should too
expensive drinks.

451
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:23,083
She is greedy.

452
00:27:23,926 --> 00:27:27,894
Anyway, today Its my treat,
so don't think about anything.

453
00:27:29,381 --> 00:27:31,147
What about forensics?

454
00:27:32,052 --> 00:27:34,887
That white dress and lipstick material,

455
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,028
were slightly different from the ones
used by Lee Sung-Gon.

456
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:39,624
If we dig a little,
I think we can catch him.

457
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,686
Really?

458
00:27:40,711 --> 00:27:43,258
Did you guys find anything?

459
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,217
On the day of the incident, I saw
Jung Hee-Joo's card and found,

460
00:27:46,264 --> 00:27:47,670
that she paid
her grandfather's hospital bill.

461
00:27:47,695 --> 00:27:50,260
Grandpa was in the hospital
for a month.

462
00:27:50,839 --> 00:27:52,870
I asked for the hospital CCTV
just in case.

463
00:27:53,253 --> 00:27:54,307
Good.

464
00:27:54,892 --> 00:27:58,548
I checked Hee-Joo's call history,
there is a history of calls from fake numbers.

465
00:27:58,728 --> 00:28:01,298
We can't check the recipient.
I've confirmed it with the reception.

466
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,884
- Where's that?
- At the head office of TJ Group.

467
00:28:04,139 --> 00:28:05,232
Really?

468
00:28:06,662 --> 00:28:11,037
That means there are suspicious people
from Hee-Joo's company.

469
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:12,264
In that case,

470
00:28:12,407 --> 00:28:16,516
first of all, you guys keep investigating
people around Hee-Joo.

471
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,883
- And Jae-Hong...
- Yes?

472
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,513
Find out the ingredients of the lipstick
and check the stuff.

473
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,724
It is not like that.

474
00:28:22,499 --> 00:28:23,898
I understand your position.

475
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:28,731
Let's just forget I made this request.

476
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,582
Yes.

477
00:28:38,971 --> 00:28:40,142
Moreover,

478
00:28:40,786 --> 00:28:43,126
he's a detective whose position
is an inspector.

479
00:28:43,151 --> 00:28:45,408
Why should I worry about him?

480
00:28:45,971 --> 00:28:49,909
If Oh Ji-hyeok is
the only opponent, then you're right.

481
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:54,612
But when the team moves together,
another story.

482
00:28:57,412 --> 00:29:00,803
Even mutts can
catch tiger

483
00:29:01,537 --> 00:29:03,576
when they get together.

484
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,694
Welcome.

485
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:37,468
Hello.

486
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,407
Sorry.

487
00:29:42,306 --> 00:29:43,486
Who are you?

488
00:29:43,511 --> 00:29:46,132
My name is Woo Tae-Ho,
your granddaughter's company team leader.

489
00:29:46,179 --> 00:29:47,851
What's your business here?

490
00:29:49,419 --> 00:29:52,583
I heard that the only family
Jung Hee-Joo has is her grandfather.

491
00:29:53,447 --> 00:29:55,861
Did Hee Joo come back alive
say that to you?

492
00:29:56,791 --> 00:30:00,291
I will do anything
to help you.

493
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:04,161
Because the company will help you,

494
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,317
so don't feel pressured
and you can call at any time.

495
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:09,153
Okay.

496
00:30:15,535 --> 00:30:16,589
Hee-Joo

497
00:30:18,152 --> 00:30:19,996
was an innocent and cheerful person.

498
00:30:22,606 --> 00:30:26,489
She was the employee who made
everyone in the company feel good.

499
00:30:29,302 --> 00:30:31,043
Maybe the investigation will
do something,

500
00:30:31,474 --> 00:30:33,809
to defame the deceased.

501
00:30:35,205 --> 00:30:38,151
If that happens, don't hesitate
to contact us.

502
00:30:39,424 --> 00:30:40,784
Our lawyer,

503
00:30:41,369 --> 00:30:43,455
will protect
Miss Jung Hee-Joo's honor.

504
00:30:49,287 --> 00:30:50,576
For you,

505
00:30:53,358 --> 00:30:55,397
What kind of person Hee Joo was?

506
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:02,772
She was,

507
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:05,905
a competent subordinate.

508
00:32:23,597 --> 00:32:27,801
You can see it? Here is
a hair salon run by Kim Min-Ji.

509
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:29,033
Come on!

510
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,744
Looks like you'll have to meet her yourself.

511
00:32:31,082 --> 00:32:32,135
Why?

512
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:34,182
She banned me meeting her.

513
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,635
to you? Why?

514
00:32:36,745 --> 00:32:39,503
The reason I took time off
at the Seoul Investigation Team,

515
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,511
is because of Kim Min-Ji.

516
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:45,306
Hey! What are you doing?

517
00:32:45,947 --> 00:32:46,978
Forgive me.

518
00:32:47,322 --> 00:32:48,994
Today I'm not feeling well.

519
00:32:49,508 --> 00:32:52,626
Sorry, can I
hand it over to another employee?

520
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,773
Just do it.

521
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,282
Ye-Rim, when will you be done?

522
00:32:58,423 --> 00:32:59,462
Soon.

523
00:32:59,705 --> 00:33:01,353
- Please help with this one.
- Okay.

524
00:33:02,518 --> 00:33:03,861
I'm really sorry.

525
00:33:11,104 --> 00:33:12,581
Excuse me,

526
00:33:14,026 --> 00:33:15,495
is Kim Min-Ji there?

527
00:33:20,722 --> 00:33:22,542
Because you kept ignoring calls,

528
00:33:23,012 --> 00:33:24,707
I have no choice but to come.

529
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,808
I am not disturbing
your job, right?

530
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:28,998
I still have work
not finished yet.

531
00:33:29,818 --> 00:33:32,669
- I don't think I have much time.
- Okay.

532
00:33:33,557 --> 00:33:37,282
We are investigating 
regarding the Jung Hee-Joo case again.

533
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:42,322
But, You appears quite often
on Jung Hee-Joo's call list.

534
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,862
We were friends.

535
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:47,198
What kind of friends?

536
00:33:47,643 --> 00:33:48,893
When I was in trouble,

537
00:33:49,823 --> 00:33:51,816
she helped me a lot.

538
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:53,753
You must be very close.

539
00:33:54,183 --> 00:33:56,339
Sometimes she was a drinking buddy.

540
00:33:56,988 --> 00:33:59,003
But, I don't really know much
about Hee-Joo.

541
00:33:59,028 --> 00:34:01,902
She rarely talked about herself.

542
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:05,183
How can you be friends then?

543
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:09,787
Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok told me
about the assault case,

544
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:10,858
two years ago.

545
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,742
The first witness back then
was Woo Tae-Ho,

546
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,453
TJ Group's legal team leader.

547
00:34:16,694 --> 00:34:21,030
Jung Hee-Joo, who was killed,
were employees of the same legal team.

548
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:22,874
And you are the victim.

549
00:34:24,095 --> 00:34:27,349
- Should I call this a coincidence?
- I don't want to remember that incident.

550
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,506
Detective Oh must have said so.

551
00:34:29,538 --> 00:34:32,999
Restraining order of Detective Oh,

552
00:34:34,132 --> 00:34:35,898
was also from TJ Group's legal team.

553
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:37,157
Is this also a coincidence?

554
00:34:38,407 --> 00:34:40,110
I did not know about that.

555
00:34:41,524 --> 00:34:42,657
Please...

556
00:34:43,563 --> 00:34:44,961
Do not bother me.

557
00:34:45,052 --> 00:34:48,778
I'm not investigating the
assault case two years ago,

558
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,654
but Jung Hee-Joo's murder case.

559
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:54,940
Not an assault case.
but a murder case.

560
00:34:56,936 --> 00:35:00,397
Your name appears a lot
on Jung Hee-Joo's call list.

561
00:35:00,522 --> 00:35:01,584
You too are,

562
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,417
one of the prime suspects.

563
00:35:17,425 --> 00:35:18,940
The conversation didn't go well, right?

564
00:35:19,433 --> 00:35:21,300
I'm good at talking.

565
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,407
What is the most important skill of a detective?

566
00:35:23,432 --> 00:35:24,983
Insights about humans.

567
00:35:25,218 --> 00:35:27,007
An aura that makes others open their mouths.

568
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:29,470
You can't even tip my nails.

569
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:33,322
That's why you are
under a restraining order.

570
00:35:35,102 --> 00:35:37,406
That's why I am learning from you.

571
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,680
Did you get anything?

572
00:35:40,722 --> 00:35:42,878
She admitted that they were friends.

573
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:44,854
But it seems the fact
that they are friends only,

574
00:35:44,879 --> 00:35:47,136
wont help in solving this case.

575
00:35:48,418 --> 00:35:51,316
The vice president who attacked Kim Min-Ji...

576
00:35:51,464 --> 00:35:53,308
- Cheon Sang-Woo.
- That's right, Cheon Sang-Woo.

577
00:35:53,865 --> 00:35:58,115
Are you sure he's the assailant
two years ago?

578
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:01,786
If that's true, then Cheon Sang-Woo
can commit the same crime

579
00:36:02,139 --> 00:36:04,021
to Jung Hee-Joo.

580
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:08,768
Like back then, Former Prosecutor Woo Tae-Ho must have
gone ahead and handle this case.

581
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:13,431
Kim Min-Ji and Woo Tae-Ho
have to open mouth,

582
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,722
so that all about the case of Jung Hee-Joo
can be concluded?

583
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:18,029
So true.

584
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:22,344
Insights about humans.

585
00:36:22,414 --> 00:36:24,282
An aura that makes others open their mouths.

586
00:36:24,753 --> 00:36:26,479
I just trust you, right?

587
00:36:27,003 --> 00:36:28,385
I? Why me?

588
00:36:28,899 --> 00:36:31,392
You just said it.
Insight and aura.

589
00:36:31,417 --> 00:36:32,999
I used that difficult vocabulary?

590
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,546
Seriously.

591
00:36:36,367 --> 00:36:37,515
I am hungry.

592
00:36:37,661 --> 00:36:38,786
Let's stop by for a bite to eat.

593
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:02,231
Vice President Cheon Sang-Woo

594
00:37:07,804 --> 00:37:10,109
- Yes?
- It's me.

595
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,344
I am stopping by tonight,
so come home early.

596
00:37:18,634 --> 00:37:20,852
I want to drink with you.

597
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:23,204
Yes

598
00:37:23,813 --> 00:37:24,899
Okay.

599
00:37:27,929 --> 00:37:28,976
Vice President Cheon Sang-Woo

600
00:37:41,417 --> 00:37:42,558
You have a child, right?

601
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:44,534
A child who is only one year old?

602
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:46,734
Why?

603
00:37:48,556 --> 00:37:49,720
Soo-Yeon why?

604
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:52,876
You will be going to America for treatment.

605
00:37:53,345 --> 00:37:55,509
Your child will be left alone.

606
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:59,854
Your child can also go to America,

607
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:01,439
but,

608
00:38:01,705 --> 00:38:03,470
you have to keep your mouth shut.

609
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:05,103
Please, my child...

610
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,804
Soo-Yeon, my child...

611
00:38:11,226 --> 00:38:12,390
Soo-Yeon.

612
00:38:42,877 --> 00:38:45,276
- Who are you looking for?
- That..

613
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:48,233
I'm here to see Detective Kang.

614
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:50,076
Detective Kang Do-Chang?

615
00:38:51,183 --> 00:38:53,628
Do-Chang, someone's coming!

616
00:38:57,831 --> 00:38:58,878
It's Woo Tae-Ho.

617
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:01,878
TJ Group's legal team leader, Woo Tae-Ho.

618
00:39:03,046 --> 00:39:05,304
Where did you get these photos from?

619
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:09,046
It was in the letter that came to Hee-Joo
some time ago.

620
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:13,046
- Good that you came.
- Why?

621
00:39:13,999 --> 00:39:14,476
Oh yes.

622
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:16,977
- This is for you.
- For me?

623
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,751
- Please look after the shop.
- Yes.

624
00:39:22,367 --> 00:39:24,461
Oh yes. And also...

625
00:39:25,499 --> 00:39:26,569
Is there anything strange?

626
00:39:27,632 --> 00:39:28,655
No.

627
00:39:29,002 --> 00:39:31,939
If the customer is looking for shoes,
I packed it under the shelf there,

628
00:39:31,964 --> 00:39:33,174
give them.

629
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,236
Yes

630
00:39:53,915 --> 00:39:55,485
Woo Tae-Ho,

631
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,314
is married, right?

632
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,251
Right.

633
00:40:02,372 --> 00:40:03,036
In that case,

634
00:40:03,721 --> 00:40:05,041
when conducting an investigation,

635
00:40:06,088 --> 00:40:09,893
these photos must be shown to others,right?

636
00:40:10,194 --> 00:40:13,491
If you don't want to reveal it,
we can keep it for ourselves.

637
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:19,069
No.

638
00:40:20,132 --> 00:40:22,101
Isn't catching the culprit, the main reason?

639
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,008
Don't think about me.
If needed, just do so.

640
00:40:27,617 --> 00:40:31,343
Do you already know
there was such a thing?

641
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,771
I still couldnt believe it until now.

642
00:40:34,802 --> 00:40:38,505
There is a possibility of manipulation.
You can't just believe in photos.

643
00:40:40,767 --> 00:40:44,923
I raised her since childhood.

644
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:47,321
Just looking at her expression,

645
00:40:47,814 --> 00:40:49,377
I know how she feels.

646
00:40:51,331 --> 00:40:55,019
When she first saw this photo
she was very depressed.

647
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:58,083
She couldn't hide her expression.

648
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,200
That's right.

649
00:41:03,513 --> 00:41:05,723
Hee-Joo made a mistake.

650
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,810
Thank you

651
00:41:10,896 --> 00:41:12,544
You've made a difficult decision.

652
00:41:12,905 --> 00:41:14,881
This will be very helpful for the investigation.

653
00:41:15,225 --> 00:41:17,663
In that case, thank God.

654
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,052
Did you find out?

655
00:41:23,810 --> 00:41:24,864
Yes.

656
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,444
I asked my father.

657
00:41:27,522 --> 00:41:30,608
He doesn't seem like a good person.

658
00:41:30,726 --> 00:41:33,334
I heard he was expelled
of the Seoul Investigation Team,

659
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,764
for accepting bribes.

660
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:38,174
When I first saw him,
he bragged about his money.

661
00:41:38,908 --> 00:41:40,041
I have a hunch.

662
00:41:41,064 --> 00:41:44,666
This guy is really arrogant.

663
00:41:48,008 --> 00:41:49,524
By the way, Director Cheon,

664
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,172
why are you so interested
on Detective Oh?

665
00:41:55,251 --> 00:42:00,446
I don't think he is the type of person
that you should meet.

666
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:03,056
Because he's handsome.

667
00:42:06,096 --> 00:42:09,182
This is CCTV taken
at the hospital on the day of the incident.

668
00:42:09,379 --> 00:42:12,207
She brought Jung In-Beom
out of the hospital room.

669
00:42:14,497 --> 00:42:16,997
And there's also a view
when she got into a taxi.

670
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,013
A moment.

671
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,813
Why? You know him?

672
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,398
You said there was a recording
when she took a taxi, right?

673
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:32,578
Please show.

674
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,196
This. She took a taxi.

675
00:42:41,707 --> 00:42:42,777
Wait.

676
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:46,285
Isn't he a new guy?

677
00:42:48,419 --> 00:42:49,981
He was chasing them both.

678
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,840
Ki Dong Jae. Gangster member
from Gangnam.

679
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:54,912
- You know?
- Yes.

680
00:42:54,939 --> 00:42:57,695
These are the gangsters I investigated
until I left the Investigation Team.

681
00:42:59,857 --> 00:43:01,490
- We're back.
- Yes.

682
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:04,591
- Anything you guys found out?
- Yes.

683
00:43:04,749 --> 00:43:06,616
Among the dresses used
for crime,

684
00:43:08,844 --> 00:43:10,828
That means you can
check the factory, right?

685
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:12,594
Right. We've confirmed it.

686
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:16,069
According to company employees,
they don't ship directly to the store.

687
00:43:16,296 --> 00:43:18,286
They usually sign contracts
with a big hospital,

688
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:19,633
and send the dress there.

689
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:20,911
Which hospital?

690
00:43:21,049 --> 00:43:23,580
Seogun University Hospital, Omun Hospital,
Seojung University Hospital...

691
00:43:23,605 --> 00:43:24,791
What? Seojung University Hospital?

692
00:43:24,816 --> 00:43:25,892
Yes

693
00:43:26,359 --> 00:43:27,937
Isn't that Seojung University Hospital?

694
00:43:30,203 --> 00:43:31,233
Right, here.

695
00:43:31,258 --> 00:43:32,492
You all go to this hospital.

696
00:43:32,517 --> 00:43:33,543
Okay.

697
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:35,582
- Please send me the location.
- Follow the guy,

698
00:43:35,607 --> 00:43:36,660
and secure all CCTV.

699
00:43:36,685 --> 00:43:38,352
I will meet the person in charge of
hospital gowns,

700
00:43:38,377 --> 00:43:40,165
- and see if there is a stolen dress.
- Well.

701
00:43:40,253 --> 00:43:42,823
I have an important appointment.
I will be right back.

702
00:43:42,848 --> 00:43:44,350
- Go.
- Goodbye.

703
00:43:45,866 --> 00:43:49,264
What are you doing? Go, hurry
before the hospital staff leave for home.

704
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:51,952
- The CCTV.
- Yes. Come on.

705
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:55,672
What happened to you?

706
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:58,476
We are investigating,
why did Detective Oh leave?

707
00:43:58,501 --> 00:43:59,625
for personal matters?

708
00:43:59,769 --> 00:44:01,473
He says there is an important appointment.

709
00:44:01,723 --> 00:44:05,105
Is there anything more important
than an investigation for a detective?

710
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:06,524
Shit.

711
00:44:10,707 --> 00:44:11,949
How did you tell her about me?

712
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:13,379
According to what you asked,

713
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:16,449
money, women, and
really arrogant.

714
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:18,131
You're so different than you seem.

715
00:44:18,179 --> 00:44:20,459
It's so dark inside
like a sociopath.

716
00:44:21,208 --> 00:44:23,833
I wouldn't say it's that bad.

717
00:44:24,357 --> 00:44:26,178
You told me to describe you
like a bad person.

718
00:44:26,225 --> 00:44:27,334
Yes. Very good.

719
00:44:28,928 --> 00:44:30,232
By the way.

720
00:44:30,655 --> 00:44:35,460
What is Director Cheon's reasoning
want to meet you?

721
00:44:35,536 --> 00:44:38,231
There must be something to talk about
with me regarding the case.

722
00:44:38,833 --> 00:44:40,216
Thanks then.

723
00:44:40,745 --> 00:44:44,243
Not because you decided
to do something else, right?

724
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:46,846
Maybe so.

725
00:44:47,073 --> 00:44:49,151
Consider money and women.

726
00:44:50,315 --> 00:44:51,370
Maybe so.

727
00:44:56,411 --> 00:44:58,958
- Should I come back again?
- No. Please come in.

728
00:45:06,898 --> 00:45:08,331
You can sit here for a moment.

729
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,283
- Yes.
- Bo-Kyung, you can go.

730
00:45:11,312 --> 00:45:12,867
- What?
- Good job today.

731
00:45:12,892 --> 00:45:13,932
See you at the office.

732
00:45:15,395 --> 00:45:16,928
Yes alright.

733
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,448
Wait.

734
00:45:28,603 --> 00:45:30,349
Why does she have to take a shower
at a time like this?

735
00:45:33,348 --> 00:45:34,381
Irritating.

736
00:45:35,245 --> 00:45:38,485
Wait, why did she leave the office
and meet him at the hotel?

737
00:45:40,195 --> 00:45:41,781
Why did she tell me to leave? Why?

738
00:46:06,835 --> 00:46:08,989
Detective Oh, I'll be waiting for you in the car.

739
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:10,996
Come on down when you're done.

740
00:46:11,859 --> 00:46:13,498
I don't have money for taxi fare!

741
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:14,622
Taxi fare?

742
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:16,256
My credit card is dead.

743
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:19,287
Yes.

744
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:23,410
Sorry, you've been waiting a long time huh?

745
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:25,194
No.

746
00:46:25,936 --> 00:46:30,090
I wanted to contact you directly, but
afraid you will misunderstand.

747
00:46:30,385 --> 00:46:33,453
So, I asked Moon Bo-Kyung for help.
You understand, right?

748
00:46:34,425 --> 00:46:39,333
It was hard to resist for me because of the princess
from the chief of my office who asked for help.

749
00:46:39,782 --> 00:46:41,016
But, that's your goal.

750
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,870
You remember me, right?

751
00:46:45,728 --> 00:46:48,321
- Yes.
- The accident two years ago also remember?

752
00:46:48,762 --> 00:46:49,795
Yes.

753
00:46:50,772 --> 00:46:52,892
You know the culprit
behind the accident?

754
00:46:54,687 --> 00:46:55,714
Roughly speaking, yes.

755
00:46:56,113 --> 00:46:58,285
- Did the victim tell?
- No.

756
00:46:58,759 --> 00:46:59,786
Then, how do you know?

757
00:47:01,368 --> 00:47:02,608
It was difficult.

758
00:47:03,841 --> 00:47:07,087
He was a cash user, so
hard to trace from card payments,

759
00:47:07,124 --> 00:47:08,384
nor could it be confirmed.

760
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,617
All CCTV inside had also been removed.

761
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:12,871
So, no video evidence
on the day of the incident.

762
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:19,391
However, there is one person who I'm suspicious of .

763
00:47:19,574 --> 00:47:21,875
The person asked the driver
who drives the car.

764
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:23,534
It's from the secretary's office,

765
00:47:23,938 --> 00:47:26,351
and he said he left his phone that night.

766
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:28,262
Then he asked where are you?

767
00:47:29,674 --> 00:47:31,034
He answered right away.

768
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:35,700
Right on the scene
attacked by Kim Min-Ji.

769
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:38,920
Then why wasn't the culprit caught?

770
00:47:41,826 --> 00:47:43,002
Because there is no real evidence.

771
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:48,428
It's impossible to demand that much
because he is a higher person.

772
00:47:49,897 --> 00:47:51,270
Oh, what a shame.

773
00:47:51,854 --> 00:47:55,203
If you have convincing evidence,

774
00:47:55,911 --> 00:47:57,564
I'm willing to make a deal.

775
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:01,404
I happen to be in charge
on related cases.

776
00:48:01,882 --> 00:48:05,826
I think the evidence of the assault case will be
found if we dig into the case.

777
00:48:05,901 --> 00:48:07,787
It means you are ready
to start over.

778
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:12,424
The deal you talked about earlier,
what does that mean?

779
00:48:12,587 --> 00:48:14,721
Let's talk again when
there is real evidence.

780
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:17,131
Deal can be done at that time.

781
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:20,421
Yes alright.

782
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:22,715
I will think carefully.

783
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:29,896
Looks like we will...

784
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:33,580
have a very interesting relationship.

785
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:37,943
Cheers.

786
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:43,672
Why? Moon Bo-Kyung said
you really like alcohol.

787
00:48:44,245 --> 00:48:45,278
Yes, right.

788
00:48:58,102 --> 00:49:00,274
He should have come down by now.

789
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,049
No, What were you talking for so long?

790
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,284
Could you...

791
00:49:11,588 --> 00:49:13,820
Did you tell her
that I'm a good drinker?

792
00:49:13,954 --> 00:49:16,283
I told her you like
money, women, and alcohol.

793
00:49:21,938 --> 00:49:23,045
Why...

794
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:25,558
Why did you say that?

795
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:33,073
Western Police Station.

796
00:49:33,098 --> 00:49:35,711
Warm, reliable cop,
and do your best.

797
00:49:36,910 --> 00:49:37,944
Bo-Kyung.

798
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:46,352
- Did you two drink together?
- Ah no.

799
00:49:47,093 --> 00:49:48,780
He drank alone and lay here.

800
00:49:49,623 --> 00:49:51,442
Can I leave him
here and go?

801
00:49:51,779 --> 00:49:53,712
Yes of course. We'll take care of him

802
00:49:54,327 --> 00:49:55,667
Then, I'm leaving.

803
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:57,913
Please wait a moment.

804
00:49:58,291 --> 00:49:59,518
I'll take him inside.

805
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:00,841
Then will take you home.

806
00:50:00,889 --> 00:50:03,790
No need. if Dad see you there it will be a big problem for you, I have to go.

807
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:05,840
- See you later.
- Goodbye.

808
00:50:05,913 --> 00:50:06,947
See you later.

809
00:50:08,724 --> 00:50:10,964
You see, right? Now give up.

810
00:50:11,561 --> 00:50:12,887
They didn't drink together.

811
00:50:12,948 --> 00:50:14,894
She said Ji-Hyeok drank alone
and fainted.

812
00:50:14,963 --> 00:50:16,709
Please stop.

813
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:17,791
Moon Bo-Kyung is beautiful.

814
00:50:24,085 --> 00:50:25,579
Jae-Hong, if it's hard let me just do it.

815
00:50:26,683 --> 00:50:27,722
No need.

816
00:50:28,550 --> 00:50:30,623
I'll take him to the toilet.

817
00:50:31,185 --> 00:50:33,865
You just go in and check the CCTV.

818
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:35,661
Okay.

819
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,977
Make sure to cover him.

820
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,612
It's really a big problem if the person who
fainted suffer from cold

821
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,240
I know. I know everything.

822
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,665
Okay.

823
00:50:46,329 --> 00:50:49,225
If he faints he should have just slept
somewhere. Sheesh.

824
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:45,013
When someone comes,
you should check it.

825
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:48,131
What is it?

826
00:51:48,889 --> 00:51:50,412
You hate me again?

827
00:51:56,838 --> 00:51:58,916
Just forget what happened in the past.

828
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:03,948
I am treating you
well now.

829
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:09,696
The detectives started looking for me.

830
00:52:14,902 --> 00:52:15,936
Meet.

831
00:52:19,353 --> 00:52:21,411
Meet them if they come looking for you.

832
00:52:22,865 --> 00:52:25,716
If you meet, you can say that
you don't know anything.

833
00:52:26,915 --> 00:52:29,067
It would look even weirder
if you avoid it.

834
00:52:31,451 --> 00:52:32,484
Hee-Joo.

835
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:35,753
Who killed her?

836
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:42,435
Hee-Joo.

837
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,571
Who killed her!

838
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:54,086
How can I know that?

839
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:56,469
She died because of you, right?

840
00:52:57,844 --> 00:52:59,824
Did I ever tell you that
this is about Hee-Joo?

841
00:53:00,850 --> 00:53:01,930
Then?

842
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,340
You told about that
to the detectives?

843
00:53:06,139 --> 00:53:07,612
- Not yet.
- Then do it.

844
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,208
If you believe you can handle it.

845
00:53:14,625 --> 00:53:15,654
Evil bastard.

846
00:53:16,627 --> 00:53:17,764
You want to die?

847
00:53:18,346 --> 00:53:21,512
Just kill me. I will make you
sorry if you don't kill me now.

848
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,735
You seem to believe in something.

849
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,565
What's that?

850
00:53:34,442 --> 00:53:35,775
Give Su-Yeon back to me.

851
00:53:36,587 --> 00:53:39,227
You can't raise her.
You have no rights.

852
00:53:39,252 --> 00:53:41,473
My daughter Su-Yeon.
The child I gave birth to myself.

853
00:53:52,833 --> 00:53:53,853
Min-Ji.

854
00:53:54,719 --> 00:53:59,805
I don''t love you.

855
00:54:00,868 --> 00:54:02,815
But, I feel a moral responsibility.

856
00:54:02,884 --> 00:54:05,484
I'm basically not a person who can
feel like that.

857
00:54:05,735 --> 00:54:08,075
I am just forced to do it.

858
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:12,318
Don't let it disappear.

859
00:54:22,204 --> 00:54:24,404
Avoid drinking alone after this.

860
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:30,074
When one drinks alone,
that person starts imagining strange things.

861
00:54:32,806 --> 00:54:34,514
Stop imagining bad things.

862
00:54:34,821 --> 00:54:36,321
It's not good for a mother.

863
00:54:36,695 --> 00:54:38,095
Not good for her daughter either.

864
00:54:58,832 --> 00:55:00,366
There's one thing you should find out.

865
00:55:00,787 --> 00:55:01,914
Yes.

866
00:55:04,453 --> 00:55:06,400
Please leave your address and password.

867
00:55:07,474 --> 00:55:09,167
I'll call you when it's done.

868
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,685
He is a butcher.

869
00:55:18,969 --> 00:55:21,949
There was a case when the east wing boss of Gangnam was
killed two years ago.

870
00:55:22,271 --> 00:55:25,561
Ki Dong-Jae, who is in the same profession,
is the prime suspect.

871
00:55:25,634 --> 00:55:28,234
He was acquitted of charges
because someone else was arrested.

872
00:55:28,259 --> 00:55:29,535
Ki Dong-Jae killed him.

873
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,828
Yes.

874
00:55:30,853 --> 00:55:33,342
The detective back then
caught another person and set him free.

875
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,999
Are you sure he stole the doctor's coat
from the hospital?

876
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:40,404
Yes. I have confirmed via CCTV
that he slipped into the staff room.

877
00:55:40,435 --> 00:55:42,955
However, the doctors don't seem to care
about the suit.

878
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:46,037
They don't even know it's gone.

879
00:55:46,449 --> 00:55:47,716
What is he doing now?

880
00:55:47,741 --> 00:55:49,710
Currently he is a representative of
wholesale meat processing.

881
00:55:49,735 --> 00:55:53,692
It was confirmed that the company
supplies to TJ's headquarters cafeteria.

882
00:55:54,005 --> 00:55:55,978
How? should we
dig it now?

883
00:55:56,463 --> 00:55:59,356
Isn't what happened behind this
more important than this person?

884
00:55:59,807 --> 00:56:01,107
He came.

885
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:04,242
Come on.

886
00:56:17,612 --> 00:56:19,759
Michael Cha returned to
United States headquarters.

887
00:56:21,457 --> 00:56:24,363
The entire board of directors are
going to talk about TJ.

888
00:56:25,916 --> 00:56:28,650
Then send Na-Na
to the United States.

889
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,427
McQueen Headquarters in the United States
blocked all communication lines.

890
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:35,602
They won't even
meet Na-Na.

891
00:56:35,656 --> 00:56:37,356
I didn't mean to send it for
temporary.

892
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,300
It's about sending her
to the United States branch.

893
00:56:42,592 --> 00:56:45,607
President, if Director Cheon
vacate her place in this situation...

894
00:56:45,632 --> 00:56:46,768
Better so.

895
00:56:57,813 --> 00:56:58,846
Yes.

896
00:56:59,473 --> 00:57:01,011
It's in a downtown Seoul apartment.

897
00:57:01,181 --> 00:57:02,768
Ki Dong-Jae entered this apartment.

898
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:05,138
Yes.

899
00:57:05,773 --> 00:57:08,033
But, will there be anything he can do in broad daylight?

900
00:57:08,188 --> 00:57:09,789
Looks like he is just meeting his lover.

901
00:57:10,064 --> 00:57:11,144
Okay.

902
00:57:11,551 --> 00:57:13,558
Just in case,
we will go there too.

903
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:14,974
Give me the address.

904
00:57:17,410 --> 00:57:18,556
He says where to go?

905
00:57:19,870 --> 00:57:21,292
Apartment in downtown Seoul.

906
00:57:22,145 --> 00:57:25,938
It seems that this is not a standard living area of
TJ people.

907
00:57:26,767 --> 00:57:29,087
Looks like it's in the Gangnam area.

908
00:57:29,282 --> 00:57:30,376
Gangnam where?

909
00:58:38,661 --> 00:58:41,487
I left some documents
in a hurry.

910
00:58:42,777 --> 00:58:43,817
What all are needed?

911
00:58:45,921 --> 00:58:47,760
I'll check it out
and call you again.

912
00:58:48,808 --> 00:58:49,841
Yes.

913
00:58:57,801 --> 00:58:59,369
- He's not out yet?
- Yes.

914
00:58:59,966 --> 00:59:01,006
Where's the car?

915
00:59:01,269 --> 00:59:03,535
There. apartment that
he entered there.

916
00:59:03,637 --> 00:59:05,370
Is this the only place he can come out from?

917
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:07,299
There is a way to
underground parking.

918
00:59:07,344 --> 00:59:09,182
But, the car is there.
He'll be out this way.

919
00:59:09,242 --> 00:59:10,989
Sis, this is Kim Min-Ji's apartment.

920
00:59:11,014 --> 00:59:12,047
Kim Min Ji?

921
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:14,760
There's a salon near here, so I
checked it out just in case.

922
00:59:14,785 --> 00:59:16,136
Kim Min-Ji's address is here.

923
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,864
Looks like we should go check it out.

924
00:59:17,891 --> 00:59:18,925
Then come on.

925
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:20,673
- Try calling Kim Min-Ji.
- Okay.

926
00:59:24,691 --> 00:59:25,958
She's calling someone else.

927
00:59:27,436 --> 00:59:29,636
I already contacted
stores in the United States.

928
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,169
I was told to send documents
there by e-mail.

929
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:35,802
Then documents for visa interview
work is complete, right?

930
00:59:36,822 --> 00:59:37,935
Yes.

931
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:40,018
Then, see you later.

932
00:59:49,183 --> 00:59:50,216
What is this?

933
00:59:50,618 --> 00:59:51,952
Why are the detectives here?

934
00:59:51,998 --> 00:59:53,198
No particular problem, right?

935
00:59:54,656 --> 00:59:56,556
Please open the door for a moment.

936
00:59:56,857 --> 00:59:58,096
We have something to check.

937
00:59:58,390 --> 00:59:59,424
Yes, good.

938
00:59:59,867 --> 01:00:00,901
Wait a moment.

939
01:00:09,763 --> 01:00:10,803
Let them go.

940
01:00:12,380 --> 01:00:14,754
Tell them to go quietly,
if you don't want to die.

941
01:00:36,191 --> 01:00:37,238
What is it?

942
01:00:37,698 --> 01:00:39,718
Has anyone visited?

943
01:00:41,453 --> 01:00:42,480
No.

944
01:00:43,290 --> 01:00:44,323
There isn't anyone.

945
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:46,915
Oh I see.

946
01:00:47,341 --> 01:00:50,061
But, we are
looking for suspect now,

947
01:00:50,477 --> 01:00:52,550
it was certain that he came here.

948
01:00:53,817 --> 01:00:55,840
I'm fine, so please go.

949
01:00:56,071 --> 01:00:58,805
Still we have to
check it out first.

950
01:00:58,844 --> 01:00:59,878
You said you were done.

951
01:01:00,914 --> 01:01:02,154
My parents are inside.

952
01:01:03,686 --> 01:01:04,906
I don't want to surprise them.

953
01:01:04,995 --> 01:01:06,212
If something...

954
01:01:07,731 --> 01:01:09,092
I'll call you.

955
01:01:09,550 --> 01:01:11,328
Yes alright. Then we will go.

956
01:01:57,186 --> 01:02:00,826
I don't know why, like not her parents
who were inside. But, Ki Dong-Jae.

957
01:02:01,184 --> 01:02:02,211
Yes.

958
01:02:02,490 --> 01:02:04,683
Ki Dong-Jae meets Kim Min-Ji.

959
01:02:06,151 --> 01:02:07,585
Actually, what is their relationship?

960
01:02:08,510 --> 01:02:09,810
- Brother,
- What is it?

961
01:02:10,493 --> 01:02:12,039
I need to go to the restroom for a bit.

962
01:02:13,126 --> 01:02:14,153
Hurry up and come back.

963
01:02:15,122 --> 01:02:16,455
Where can I defecate?

964
01:02:18,032 --> 01:02:20,206
Please take him to the hospital.

965
01:02:20,623 --> 01:02:21,657
Brother.

966
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:24,816
Man-Goo is not a person who can
defecate anywhere.

967
01:02:25,227 --> 01:02:28,533
Just where something has happened or
is likely to happen.

968
01:02:30,205 --> 01:02:33,051
There are signs that
something will happen here.

969
01:02:33,489 --> 01:02:35,696
Hey, what kind of fortune teller is that.

970
01:02:35,751 --> 01:02:37,811
- Brother
- What is it? is there some kind of wild boar?

971
01:02:37,847 --> 01:02:40,839
Ki Dong Jae. He came out of
underground parking.

972
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:43,062
- You didn't see it?
- Go, hurry.

973
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:07,221
This car.

974
01:03:14,375 --> 01:03:16,389
Go after him. Catch it soon
if you can.

975
01:03:16,477 --> 01:03:17,510
Yes, good. Come on.

976
01:03:19,978 --> 01:03:21,005
Brother.

977
01:03:22,201 --> 01:03:23,315
This car is Kim Min-Ji's car.

978
01:03:24,831 --> 01:03:27,106
Car Registration Certificate.
Name: Kim Min Ji.

979
01:03:43,481 --> 01:03:45,391
Quick call 119. Hurry up! Fast!

980
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,726
Brother, come and see this.

981
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:17,723
Why?

982
01:04:21,355 --> 01:04:22,375
What's this?

983
01:04:23,303 --> 01:04:26,150
CCTV at the place where Kim Min-Ji was 
attacked two years ago.

984
01:05:18,667 --> 01:05:21,441
You want to hide the culprit
or reveal it?

985
01:05:21,567 --> 01:05:23,781
Perpetrators must be disclosed
so that it cant be hidden.

986
01:05:23,806 --> 01:05:25,410
Why do you have that?

987
01:05:25,487 --> 01:05:28,614
She deliberately gave us money
for the sake of that evidence.

988
01:05:28,664 --> 01:05:29,994
I will give you the
opportunity to choose.

989
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:31,742
If you tell the truth now,

990
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:33,771
I will protect you,
even if I die.

991
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:35,490
What are you hiding?

992
01:05:35,515 --> 01:05:37,049
She died because of you.

993
01:05:37,074 --> 01:05:38,518
Why are you like that!

994
01:05:38,568 --> 01:05:39,740
How can you hide it?

995
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:42,567
He held a knife behind me.

996
01:05:42,598 --> 01:05:45,271
This situation is dangerous for you.

997
01:05:45,308 --> 01:05:48,910
I will rise up again. With you, Both of us together
