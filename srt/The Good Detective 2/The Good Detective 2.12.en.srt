1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:04,120
<i>This program is for ages 15 and over</i>

2
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,870
<i>because it contains adult elements,</i>
<i></i><i>violence, and the risk of imitation.</i>

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,700
subtitles by summer fouad

4
00:00:11,810 --> 00:00:15,160
<i>All characters, names, events, and</i>
<i></i><i>others in this drama are fictitious.</i>

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,150
Just kill Jung Hee-Joo.

6
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:25,260
I will finance the life of your descendants,

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,220
so kill that girl!

8
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:36,150
Chairman Choi will take care of the rest.

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,720
Ki Dong-Jae, you

10
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:42,170
just need to kill her

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:46,030
You understand?

12
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:02,760
Who told you that story?

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,890
- You don't remember?
- I?

14
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:10,530
Me?

15
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,850
Do you remember talking
to Jung Hee-Joo in the CEO's office,

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,450
then talk to Ki Dong-Jae?

17
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,930
Dong-Jae's cell phone call records match

18
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,830
phone call records
you have.

19
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,550
At that time you and Ki Dong-Jae were
talking on the phone.

20
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,310
This world is terrible.

21
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:37,600
If everyone gathers
and attacks,

22
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,560
it is very easy to make
one of them the perpetrator.

23
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:45,010
But, I'm curious.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,490
Why are you opening
that important card now in front of me?

25
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,950
Usually, when a detective
pushes this much evidence, he confesses.

26
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,310
If the perpetrator

27
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:07,270
still looks guilty

28
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,940
Do I look petty?

29
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:15,860
I...

30
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,160
Do I look the same
as the dog you guys are dealing with

31
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,880
when I answer
your questions one by one?

32
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,840
Nothing is wrong.

33
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,850
Your actions are the same as the dog.

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,240
President, understand.

35
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,850
Older people can't stand to
see younger people

36
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,230
be rude

37
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,540
You can't take care
of one of those detectives?

38
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,800
Why do I have to deal
with people like them?

39
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:04,880
Forgive me.

40
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:08,040
I didn't think it
would come to that.

41
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,620
Didn't think what you said.

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,410
Those detectives

43
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,730
Seems to be deliberately making me angry.

44
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,140
They must be hiding something.

45
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,950
- You have to find out why.
- Okay.

46
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,130
- understood.
- Well.

47
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,560
I will finance the life of your descendants,

48
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,880
so kill that girl!

49
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,770
I will finance the life of your descendants,

50
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:04,380
so kill that girl!

51
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,950
He must have heard it.

52
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,200
<i>- Yes, President?</i>
- Call the company security team

53
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,270
and have them gather
in my room now.

54
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,160
You definitely don't want to see us.

55
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,130
If it weren't for us,
it wouldn't have come this far.

56
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:44,650
If you're sent to the prosecutor's office tomorrow,
talk to the prosecutor.

57
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,180
Don't trust the bad guys
on the Criminal Team.

58
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,410
What President Cheon said
today is all true.

59
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,560
Prosecutors would love it.

60
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,880
He is a very knowledgeable person.

61
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,930
If you continue to deny
that you are related to him,

62
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,780
we have to give up on him.

63
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,340
All you can trust now
is us.

64
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,410
Oh Ji-Hyeok.

65
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:13,460
Did you hear the contents of the conversation between President Cheon
and Ki Dong-Jae,

66
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,300
actually recorded?

67
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,910
- Yes.
- Is that true?

68
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:24,000
If it's evidence
in court,

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:29,810
I have no choice
but to admit it.

70
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,730
Until then, will you keep your mouth shut
about Cheon Sang-Woo?

71
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,160
Since you are a detective,
you must know very well

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,800
but no matter how much
evidence the detectives find,

73
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,960
if the prosecutor doesn't approve it,
it's a total failure.

74
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,960
Would a wise prosecutor
accept it as you say?

75
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,780
You know exactly what the
prosecutor will say.

76
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:55,860
The evidence is not strong enough.

77
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
I'm sure there are eavesdroppers
and hidden cameras here.

78
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,680
Search comprehensively.

79
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,780
ok

80
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,670
everywhere

81
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:51,720
You should have held him longer.
We don't have much time.

82
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,870
You've unplugged all
the hidden camera equipment, right?

83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,870
It's a waste. Though it's perfect for
killing time when bored.

84
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,360
There's also a lot to be had.

85
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,470
It's illegal.

86
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:02,550
You're lucky I didn't report it.

87
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,680
You just eat alone?

88
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,470
Cheon Na-Na, it must be you.

89
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,370
It must be you, damn it!

90
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,900
I told you.

91
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,060
You can't.

92
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,710
You can't.

93
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:44,900
Will never.

94
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,880
Will never!

95
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,470
I'm full.

96
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,140
How?

97
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,130
You've met him in person.
Is he worth dealing with?

98
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,240
He's more insolent
than I imagined.

99
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,640
Your attitude is good.

100
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,870
You can face it without prejudice.

101
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,870
Please give me the video.

102
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:13,550
It's hard to agree on evidence anyway.

103
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,020
I'll be careful
not to reveal it.

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,020
We have to get the prosecutor
on our side.

105
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,860
The prosecutor has to see for himself
in order to side with us.

106
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:26,110
What video do you mean?

107
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,620
We don't have time.

108
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,350
If we don't finish it in
a short time, we won't win.

109
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,520
That video

110
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,360
would be a shortcut.

111
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,690
Detective Oh, you can do it.

112
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:42,470
Seems like every now and then I have to stop by
the convenience store for noodles.

113
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,660
Eating here is much better.

114
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,310
I go.

115
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,370
You retired to be the Team Leader
of the Seoul Investigation Unit?

116
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,570
Right.

117
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,260
Then no need to explain.
See for yourself.

118
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:22,420
If something is missing,
please tell me.

119
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:26,840
It seems that every evidence required
for the trial has been provided.

120
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,650
The drawback is that there is no
report on Ki Dong-Jae's interrogation

121
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:30,880
who did the murder.

122
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,300
But, you can't interrogate
a dead person,

123
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,540
so this is the best.

124
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,090
Of.

125
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:38,720
You can take this to court.

126
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:39,880
Well.

127
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,400
Is there anything to add?

128
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,660
There isn't any.

129
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:46,770
In that case...

130
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:51,100
Can you say that you
confessed to being Jung Hee-Joo's killer?

131
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,130
Mr prosecutor

132
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,350
Have you met
the TJ Group lawyer?

133
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,290
I bet you get
a lot of calls here and there.

134
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,550
I'm sure there's been a lot of talk
about your future.

135
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,120
I think the most important thing
in this trial is

136
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,800
how do we reach an agreement.

137
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,950
Deal?

138
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:19,600
What kind of deal?

139
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,710
Hands off.

140
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,760
I'll admit it.

141
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,020
But, don't
leave it locked for too long.

142
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,840
If the time is agreed,

143
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,520
I'll keep my mouth shut
about the body for now.

144
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,580
Looks like you've done a lot
of secret deals.

145
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:37,820
You are very open towards it.

146
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,280
I'll take it all out.

147
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:47,010
Okay. As a prosecutor,
I will try to adjust it

148
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,710
so as not to feel ashamed.

149
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,080
The only relative left
by Jung Hee-Joo is grandfather, right?

150
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,980
Right.

151
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,450
I take care of her

152
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,470
since childhood.

153
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,230
No,, No

154
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:05,890
I'm not the one taking care of her

155
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,530
But,she took care of me

156
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,980
Because Hee-Joo let
me breathe and eat.

157
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:18,190
Looks like the grieving family
must be having a hard time

158
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,270
because the case is reversed in the middle.

159
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,860
Yes

160
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:26,820
Now it will be finished soon.

161
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,840
I am very grateful for all
the hard work and time so far.

162
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,020
The man who killed your granddaughter has been exposed.
His name is Ki Dong-Jae.

163
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,180
He is currently missing.

164
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,030
It was probably thought he had been killed.

165
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:46,490
You can take it as punishment.

166
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,090
Yes

167
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,990
But, there are supporters behind it.
His name is Choi Yong-Geun.

168
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,930
It is revealed that he
ordered Ki Dong-Jae.

169
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,030
Yes I already know.

170
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:02,070
Choi Yong-Geun will be brought
to court for trial.

171
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,980
Then suppose your granddaughter 
died unjustly,

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,080
has been released.

173
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,080
And also grandfather who had been
feeling congested could give up.

174
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,710
Yes, Prosecutor Cha.

175
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:14,440
Thank you

176
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:20,080
In that case, if the family
left behind accepts this situation,

177
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,670
this case will be submitted to the court

178
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,720
with Ki Dong-Jae and Choi Yong-Geun
as the main actors.

179
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,950
You have no other complaints?

180
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,860
I...

181
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,580
Detective Kang Do-Chang too

182
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,910
on the same side
as you, right?

183
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,870
It should be.

184
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,140
Then your words must be true.

185
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,140
You must really
trust Detective Kang.

186
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,970
Yes

187
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,460
Who would listen
to an old man like me?

188
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,910
Everyone closes their eyes.

189
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,610
But, Detective Kang

190
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:59,530
he listened to my words
carefully.

191
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:02,660
He is the one who comforts and
gives me comfort

192
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,550
in that stifling time.

193
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:09,280
If Detective Kang believes
your words,

194
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,860
then I also have to believe
and follow you.

195
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,380
Yes

196
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,350
I heard that the great TJ Group President Cheon
came to our office.

197
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,800
Should n't such an important matter
be reported quickly?

198
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:29,100
However, I would like to tell...

199
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,370
How do you know? I have
controlled the press very carefully

200
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:32,470
so they don't notice.

201
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,130
You know, a cop on a desert island
on the West Coast

202
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,920
peeing in the sea?

203
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,000
The next day, the police from the main office
in Seoul held a meeting.

204
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,970
He said a policeman
committed an offence.

205
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,560
Does the boss know too?

206
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:52,070
Of course know.

207
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:01,200
After all, you will continue to
receive pressure calls from above.

208
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:06,230
Isn't it obvious? You want me to
stop investigating President Cheon?

209
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,870
Wouldn't it be better
to avoid it now?

210
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:16,260
Yes. I know very well.

211
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,850
This is a loan call.

212
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,330
You guys are really great.

213
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,710
I already knew that I
would be dismissed as Head of Office,

214
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,310
I called to get a subscription.

215
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,620
Aren't they like ghosts?

216
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,010
I'd rather get
a phone call from the boss.

217
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,680
But, all day there are only
calls like this.

218
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,910
You know why?

219
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,330
I went to the batch meeting yesterday.

220
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,940
But, they treat me
like invisible.

221
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,810
No one poured me a drink
even though my glass was empty.

222
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:52,020
15 people gathered there,
only me drinking alone.

223
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:53,760
You know why?

224
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,250
Yes. Please come in.

225
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,240
Chief, we got a call
from headquarters.

226
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,730
This week's Chief Director General's examination has
been postponed indefinitely.

227
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,970
Yes, fine.

228
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:16,370
In our office, Kwon Jae-Hong is
the fastest and most sensitive.

229
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:20,990
Please explain
how I am now.

230
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,740
You are ostracized.

231
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,490
Traits ostracized.

232
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,790
No one will care
even if I get beaten to death,

233
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,760
my head breaks, or my intestines come out.

234
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:37,270
It feels like a police organization
that you really trust

235
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,590
has left you.

236
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,600
Even me. agreed.

237
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,620
We have to see the stars.

238
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,130
It's pitch black.

239
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,720
O young policeman!

240
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,480
The country owns you...

241
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:13,290
Halo?

242
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,070
Of.

243
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,170
Alright, I'll be there soon.

244
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,600
Of.

245
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,050
I just
got a call from an accountant.

246
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,510
They discover suspicious cash flow
to Ki Dong-Jae's company.

247
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,550
I told you, didn't I? If you
let go, something will happen.

248
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,660
That's good.

249
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,090
We'll go to the accounting firm
and check the documents,

250
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,190
so you two have to
confiscate all the documents

251
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:34,390
from
the Ki Dong-Jae meat processing company.

252
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,050
You understand? I go first.

253
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:37,890
Isn't there a warrant?

254
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:40,250
What do you expect?
The police have abandoned us.

255
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,370
In times like these, we have no
choice but to blindly.

256
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,380
We go first.

257
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,620
Gangsters don't need a warrant.

258
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,850
But Man-Goo, I'm afraid we
'll have some fun with them.

259
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,570
Am I
physically interacting too much?

260
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,810
Yes, fine.

261
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:57,910
Prosecutor Cha wants to see us. Let's go.

262
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:59,070
Why?

263
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:02,290
- He only asked for a drink.
- Out of the blue?

264
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,340
This is about a private meeting.

265
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:08,940
It felt like something
was about to come out. I go.

266
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,010
Goodbye.

267
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:22,560
The star is visible.

268
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,170
Although vague.

269
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,680
I'm waiting.

270
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,470
Bibi.

271
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:46,110
Grandpa asked me to
bring some more chicken.

272
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,180
I heard he was drinking with his neighbor.

273
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,480
Really? what happened ?!!

274
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:52,510
He also ate all the chicken
that was brought.

275
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,710
That's great.

276
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,600
Looks like his appetite has returned.

277
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,780
Let's quickly fry and send it to him.

278
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:00,670
I'm so excited.

279
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,390
I am so glad.

280
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,330
Why suddenly? What happened?

281
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,140
He met the prosecutor today.

282
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,610
He says he will catch
everyone who killed Hee-Joo.

283
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:12,790
That's good. Looks like the prosecutor
is a good person.

284
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,030
Yes. He said he was a very good person.

285
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,710
I'm grateful.

286
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,600
Good grief.

287
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:22,150
- Why did you come so fast?
- Hello, Prosecutor Cha.

288
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,750
Please sit.

289
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:26,480
- You guys don't mind soju-beer?
- Let me do it.

290
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,180
I can do it. All I can do
is get soju and beer.

291
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,440
- Have you ordered chicken?
- No, not yet.

292
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:39,390
Eun-Hee. Order spicy chicken
and I don't know what sauce to like

293
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,260
just bring all the sauce.

294
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,360
Okay.

295
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,940
Looks like you're a regular customer.
You remember all the menus.

296
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,520
- This is my sister's shop.
- That's right.

297
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,720
So, this is a family business.

298
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,870
What about the part-timer?

299
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:59,070
She's not a part time worker,
she's my daughter.

300
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,330
The drink's gone. I'll take it.

301
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,340
Are two bottles enough?

302
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,320
There's a special thing I ordered
while eating ramyeon.

303
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,650
I'll bring it.

304
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,910
The boy calls Detective Kang's sister
aunty.

305
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,260
Shouldn't
he have called her aunt [gomo]?

306
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,040
He's not Detective Kang's biological son.
But, he is considered like a biological child.

307
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:27,380
Why? Detective Kang is not married.

308
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,900
It...

309
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,130
Could she be the
daughter of the victim's family?

310
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,540
Did she raise him
out of pity?

311
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:38,090
Yes that's correct.

312
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,670
He thinks his father died
because of Detective Kang.

313
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,980
Lee Dae-Chul's daughter who was sentenced to death?

314
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,200
This is driving me crazy.

315
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,940
Eun-Hye, why are you delivering orders?

316
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,060
This is not an order.
I brought this for grandpa.

317
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,320
Is that so?

318
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,790
Take him carefully.
Say hello to grandpa.

319
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,570
Yes. I go first.

320
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,590
Here he is.

321
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,950
me all

322
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,850
bring another soju.

323
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,130
Looking at the proportion of people
who drink soju and beer,

324
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,460
I think this will run out fast.

325
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,310
And this is what I usually eat
with ramyeon.

326
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,830
It is very dry and very tasty.

327
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,420
I feel very angry.

328
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:43,990
- Wouldn't you like some soju and beer?
- It's a rule

329
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,670
for a detective to
keep his distance from the victim's family.

330
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:48,910
That way, we can conduct
an objective investigation.

331
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,010
Am I wrong?

332
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,380
- Not. That's right.
- But why?

333
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:56,700
Why do you care about Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather?

334
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:59,860
Why did you bring
free chicken to parents?

335
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:04,460
The victim's family became prejudiced
against the detective.

336
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,100
So how can we
do a fair investigation?

337
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:11,250
I'm sorry for that, but...

338
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:12,840
What is the salary of a detective

339
00:21:14,570 --> 00:21:16,720
to be able to raise the victim's child?

340
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,670
The person who decides the marriage

341
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,140
to catch the killer.

342
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,920
Why don't you let the detective
do the right thing?

343
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:29,710
Why are you destabilizing the situation?

344
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,550
- Unlucky.
- Unlucky?

345
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,390
- You swear at the Prosecutor?
- Prosecutor Cha, please understand.

346
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,920
He doesn't like it when younger people
are rude.

347
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,620
- What?
- Hey!

348
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:56,500
You think I want to live like this?
I used to be a hoodlum too.

349
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,610
I beat up innocent people
and took the money.

350
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:01,210
Then what should i do?

351
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,050
My life has changed

352
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,220
and I don't want to
live like a beggar either.

353
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,420
Now it's not too late!

354
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,160
Live like me.

355
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,820
Take sides with those in power.

356
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,230
Close your eyes and turn around.

357
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:19,900
Buy a house in Gangnam,

358
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,830
send your child to study abroad,

359
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,650
and find a beautiful girlfriend!

360
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:26,080
Why should I

361
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,810
make a miserable life like you?

362
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,550
Human nature is not important.

363
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,130
Proscutor

364
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,510
The reason why you asked to meet...

365
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,370
Who knows. I was so angry
that I forgot.

366
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,090
Be careful on the road.

367
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,240
- Why is he like that? Am I wrong?
- No

368
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,830
- You're not wrong.
- Why is he going crazy like that?

369
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,380
Like you said, it feels like

370
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,750
something will come out.

371
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,820
What are you talking about? It's more tangled.

372
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:14,800
The kids are asleep?

373
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,890
Okay. I drank it all.

374
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,610
I'll be home soon.

375
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:05,830
- Do you want to drink coffee?
- Yes.

376
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,260
Your face is getting brighter lately.

377
00:24:10,370 --> 00:24:11,810
You have a boyfriend?

378
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,260
You are crazy.

379
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,590
What do you think will happen to
the captured team leader Choi?

380
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:33,360
This makes me dizzy.

381
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,600
So therefore,

382
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I want you to do something for him.

383
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,040
What powers do you think I have.

384
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,860
Are you okay?

385
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,930
It looks like the media is trying
to exaggerate this case.

386
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
Nothing will happen to me.

387
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,950
As long as you don't do anything.

388
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,470
It's a shame though.

389
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:55,610
If only during this situation
Tae-Ho was still alive,

390
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,480
this will be your and Tae-Ho's world.

391
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,180
Right?

392
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,450
Apparently...

393
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,150
You're really scared of Tae-Ho, huh?

394
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:12,260
Isn't that really your goal?

395
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,080
What's the reason you brought Tae-Ho?

396
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,450
You brought it to scare me, didn't you?

397
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,160
All right, I'll give you this much.

398
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,040
Do you know?

399
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:27,610
I thought you didn't love Tae-Ho.

400
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:30,550
I thought you didn't love Tae-Ho.

401
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,860
Sorry.

402
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:36,500
I thought he was just a place
for you to reach your goals.

403
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,790
Why did you do that?

404
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,920
You don't love him,

405
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:44,460
but why do you feel jealous?

406
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,270
Don't you know me?

407
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,430
You think I have
that kind of feeling?

408
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,260
You don't have it?

409
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:55,440
Apparently you really
don't have that feeling?

410
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:02,640
It seems that when Tae-Ho plays
with other women in the office,

411
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,470
the fire inside you exploded, huh?

412
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,370
I understand.

413
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,250
Why can't I,

414
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:12,290
be a weak man like Tae-Ho?

415
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,560
If I,

416
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,870
if stabbed by someone,

417
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,360
I will stab him back.

418
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:22,760
What a bad man.

419
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,240
Thanks for the coffee.

420
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,780
<i>Nana.</i>

421
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,650
<i>You killed Woo Tae-Ho, didn't you?</i>

422
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:44,250
<i>Conversation Content from Cheon Sang-Woo's Video</i>

423
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:51,950
<i>yes.</i>

424
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,160
Welcome.

425
00:27:55,990 --> 00:27:57,530
Mr. Prosecutor? Excuse me.

426
00:27:57,820 --> 00:27:59,560
Well. Please sit.

427
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,370
I've seen the file
Detective Oh sent this morning.

428
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,540
yes

429
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,670
Your memory is amazing.
How can you

430
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:15,530
remember all with just
one look.

431
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,850
When he took the police academy entrance exam ,

432
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,680
he failed in all subjects,

433
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,520
but when he memorized,
he got a perfect score.

434
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,630
Memorization and memory.

435
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:24,810
It was these two skills that made him
join the police.

436
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,600
Absolutely amazing.

437
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,930
Memorization is usually absent
in police academy exams.

438
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,140
Really?

439
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,340
It's actually nothing.

440
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,090
Maybe because I'm a detective,

441
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,450
I think all detectives
if you see that video,

442
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,350
will definitely remember it well.

443
00:28:38,590 --> 00:28:40,440
That is true.
I will remember that too.

444
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,070
You are right.
Because we're detectives.

445
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,860
No recorded video material?

446
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,870
That's right.
Since the video was recorded illegally,

447
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,560
looks like it will be hard to come by.

448
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,030
Cheon Sang-Woo was arrested, right?

449
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,450
On charges of murder.

450
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,580
- What?
- Perfectly matches the motive of the murder,

451
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,100
which I have proposed before.

452
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,260
It has also been proven that,

453
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,520
she talks to Ki Dong-Jae
over the cell phone.

454
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,420
Then for this file that was sent earlier.

455
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,180
Enough to be used as evidence.

456
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,610
For an arrest warrant,

457
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,040
looks like it will be difficult.

458
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,200
It wouldn't be difficult if the opponent
was an ordinary person.

459
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:16,610
Maybe because the opponent
is the president of the company...

460
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:18,870
Didn't you ever say that

461
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:22,210
once the arrest warrant is issued,
will you be replaced by another prosecutor?

462
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,640
I...

463
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,130
have two sons.

464
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:31,180
They didn't know their father
was a great prosecutor.

465
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,350
On this occasion,

466
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,310
I will show them,

467
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,840
how great their father is.

468
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,330
Is it true that you asked for a warrant
for Cheon Sang-Woo's arrest?

469
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,540
Yes that's correct.

470
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:46,940
Is the charge of murder?

471
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:48,270
Yes that's correct.

472
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,150
Some argue that
this investigation,

473
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,740
done to cover other cases.

474
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,850
Is that true?

475
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,140
- No.
- Has the warrant been issued?

476
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,080
As far as I know it's still under review.

477
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,850
Regarding the arrest warrant
is this your personal decision,

478
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,630
or the entire prosecutor's office?

479
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,870
The request for an arrest warrant is
a personal decision of the prosecutor.

480
00:30:07,970 --> 00:30:10,530
If the opinion of all prosecutors
differs from yours,

481
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:13,230
isn't there a possibility that you
will be replaced by the leadership?

482
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:17,140
Our Prosecutor,

483
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,100
It is not an organization that is easily
shaken.

484
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,200
We're not that easy,

485
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:24,470
do things like that.

486
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,970
So you mean there is absolutely
no external coercion?

487
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,080
There seems to be a lot
of prejudice going on here.

488
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,940
I will explain clearly here.

489
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:33,230
In this research,

490
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,960
there is no coercion from the outside.

491
00:30:35,530 --> 00:30:37,880
Who would
do such childish things these days?

492
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:40,090
For not listening
to the leadership's orders,

493
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,270
investigators were excluded
from the investigation process.

494
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,110
Then the prosecutor was replaced.

495
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,450
Alright, I'll say goodbye.

496
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:04,950
<i>Prosecutor, the arrest warrant</i>
<i></i><i>is out.</i>

497
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,660
Hello, with Cha Moon-Ho,
from the Incheon Prosecutor's Criminal Division.

498
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:22,800
<i>This is me, the Attorney General.</i>

499
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:23,570
What?

500
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,870
Yes sir?

501
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:26,940
<i>What is your goal?</i>

502
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,070
None, sir.
I just...

503
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,270
<i>Does this have anything to do with politics?</i>

504
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,140
<i>Do you want to play</i>
<i></i><i>with a bigger scale?</i>

505
00:31:37,450 --> 00:31:40,150
I haven't thought that
far, sir.

506
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,740
<i>You didn't say no.</i>

507
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,780
<i>No problem.</i>

508
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,880
<i>Sometimes a strong person like you</i>
<i></i><i>is needed in the organization.</i>

509
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:49,050
That's right, sir.

510
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,960
<i>Do it with confidence.</i>

511
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:53,240
<i>If you win, I will support you.</i>

512
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,670
<i>And if you lose...</i>

513
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,470
<i>You're going out.</i>

514
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:57,950
Fine I understand.

515
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,850
I'll try my best,

516
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:01,760
Thank you

517
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,610
Yes, this is with Cha Moon-Ho.

518
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,850
The warrant for
Cheon Sang-Woo's arrest was out.

519
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:17,170
Catch him.

520
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,370
Do you admit the accusations?

521
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,720
Police say they have
clear evidence, what is it?

522
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:28,220
During your research you object.

523
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,680
Are you still thinking the same thing?

524
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,260
What impact do you think
TJ Group will have if the crime is exposed?

525
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:34,380
Just come in, sir.
Controller.

526
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,600
The former president, Cheon Sung-Dae
is also currently in prison,

527
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:38,790
Now that you are also involved in the case,
what do you think?

528
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,750
<i>Please say a word, Mr. President.</i>

529
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,770
<i>What do you think?</i>

530
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,390
<i>Please say a word.</i>

531
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,990
<i>Do you admit the accusation?</i>

532
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,950
I...

533
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:56,570
scared

534
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:00,850
What if the truth
has not been revealed so far?

535
00:33:01,730 --> 00:33:03,110
What if before I die,

536
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,000
The reason for Hee-Joo's death is not revealed.

537
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:11,520
You have to stick around
until the reason is revealed.

538
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,050
It's too difficult.

539
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,590
I expect
useless things.

540
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:21,150
If I die everything becomes
useless.

541
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,970
When my father died,

542
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,880
<i>Dad looks at me with a smile.</i>

543
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,950
If I get to see Dad again,
I'll give him a smile too.

544
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,790
If Grandpa meets Hee-Joo again,
give her a smile.

545
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:02,290
Tell her to stop being sad,

546
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,760
everything she regrets has been resolved.

547
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,660
Right, I have to give her a smile.

548
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,150
If I see Hee-Joo again,
I have to smile.

549
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,880
As long as Hee-Joo is alive
I always give her a smile.

550
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,740
You gave this old me a
reason to survive.

551
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,480
Thank you, Eun-Hye.

552
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,720
Do you,

553
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:40,670
who ordered the defendant Ki Dong-Jae,
to kill?

554
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,760
Did you send the photo,

555
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:47,000
the place of the victims of the
serial murders to the defendant, Ki Dong-Jae?

556
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:48,850
You give advice over the phone,

557
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:50,670
when Hee-Joo's corpse is about to be abandoned.

558
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,070
Do you admit that?

559
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:54,650
Yes

560
00:34:54,970 --> 00:34:57,610
If so, do you agree
to the charge for the murder?

561
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:01,080
Could there be another killer.

562
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,650
<i>Did the accused confess to only obeying</i>
<i></i><i>orders to dispose of the body?</i>

563
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:07,350
If the allegations are true,

564
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,990
does the defendant know

565
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,260
who ordered, Ki Dong-Jae,

566
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,160
to kill?

567
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,660
Ki Dong-Jae, never said that
to me once,

568
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,570
Dong-Jae, just says that he
accidentally killed people.

569
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:24,100
So you mean it was not ordered,

570
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,530
this is purely
his own crime, is it?

571
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:29,150
Yes, it is true.
At least that's what I know.

572
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,550
When the defendant called Ki Dong-Jae,

573
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,140
the defendant said,

574
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:38,480
What about Hee-Joo's corpse?

575
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,600
Hee-Joo,

576
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,310
was an employee in the
same department as the defendant.

577
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:45,010
His work colleague was killed,

578
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,910
but you didn't ask
the motive for the murder,

579
00:35:48,270 --> 00:35:51,460
- and you just believe it?
- Yes,

580
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,310
I just thought it might be a coincidence,

581
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,330
and ignore it.

582
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,170
After Dong-Jae kills Hee-Joo,

583
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,250
2 billion won agreement paid

584
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:04,480
to the company
run by Dong-Jae.

585
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,950
However, there is no evidence that any
distribution costs were passed on to TJ Group.

586
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,490
It is estimated that this 2 billion won,

587
00:36:11,050 --> 00:36:13,350
is the price of the assassination contract.

588
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,960
Defendant

589
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:21,860
If Dong-Jae asks for advice,

590
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:25,970
should n't Dong-Jae's side
pay the defendant?

591
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,590
I'm a former member of the legal team.

592
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,430
This kind of business has nothing
to do with me.

593
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:33,550
Not related to?

594
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:36,560
If so,

595
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,930
then you say that
the defendant's superior decides and pays?

596
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,880
there is someone whose status
is higher than the defendant,

597
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:45,820
who paid Ki Dong-Jae,
don't you mean that?

598
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,170
Your Honor, Mr. Hakim.

599
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:50,520
Prosecutors are now forcing
defendants to testify

600
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,790
about the truth of the murder contract.

601
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,860
The assassination contract is
just speculation.

602
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:56,810
In that situation,

603
00:36:56,890 --> 00:37:00,310
the claimant's claim that it was
a murder contract is more plausible

604
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:03,000
rather than the defendant's claim that
the murder was unintentional.

605
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:06,320
<i>Please continue.</i>

606
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,450
If the defendant

607
00:37:14,110 --> 00:37:16,780
constantly denying
the existence of other perpetrators.

608
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,520
Then the killer Jung Hee-Joo

609
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,480
in this case only one person,
you alone.

610
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,520
That's it.

611
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:25,990
The defendant, Choi Yong-Geun.

612
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,790
Is it acceptable that

613
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,660
no rebuttal to
the arguments of the prosecutor?

614
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,700
Sir, Prosecutor.

615
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,360
I'm not a murderer.

616
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,720
Then say it.

617
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:39,330
- Who are the other culprits.
- I also want to know.

618
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,970
So that I can get rid of the accusations.

619
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:43,140
If so, the defendant.

620
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:46,160
Does the defendant agree?

621
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,210
that this case,

622
00:37:48,370 --> 00:37:49,860
is contract killing?

623
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,960
Yes, it seems so.

624
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,180
Have you
seen one of the two

625
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,250
the defendant?

626
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,760
Yes, I've seen him

627
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,060
Who?

628
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,960
<i>That person </i>

629
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:33,460
You said that you saw him
before your grand daughter Jung Hee-Joo was murdered.

630
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,200
For what reason do you see him ?

631
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,960
He came to my shop.

632
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:42,060
At first I thought he came
to buy shoes,

633
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,370
But...

634
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,470
He knows Hee-Joo,
but pretends not to.

635
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,780
What was talked about?

636
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,610
He says, Hee-Joo should
be careful with men.

637
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,710
because Hee-Joo is so pretty.

638
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:57,930
After that, you said that
you met him again.

639
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,590
In the TJ Group headquarters building?

640
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,150
What did the defendant say
to the witness at that time?

641
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,530
He said that Hee-Joo,

642
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,110
sent a rich
married man,

643
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:13,050
to stay with her and
take money from him.

644
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:16,700
He said that this was
a punishment that came down from heaven.

645
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,360
The defendant Cheon Sang-Woo,
gave a statement that

646
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,810
he
doesn't know Jung Hee-Joo at all.

647
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,050
and just remembering that he is
an employee of the legal team.

648
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:33,180
That's it.

649
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,390
Let the defense
ask questions.

650
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,680
No, nothing to ask.

651
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,740
Aren't you going to press and
beat the opposing team?

652
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,280
We didn't beat him.

653
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,070
We will pretend to be depressed by them.

654
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,340
Lawyer from that side,

655
00:39:56,210 --> 00:39:58,110
only collect
national level players.

656
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,150
They don't want to lose.
We will not be given time to prepare.

657
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:02,770
Then in rounds two and three,

658
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,490
I will bring them all down.

659
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,590
So, we need to prepare
more maturely.

660
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:08,860
Oh yes.

661
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:10,210
Can I,

662
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:13,390
summon Kim Min-Ji, to court?

663
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,640
Isn't there a recording file for that?
if you play it in court...

664
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,830
No

665
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:19,120
She must come

666
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,270
and explain the situation
on the tape at that time.

667
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:24,180
That way, the evidence will be
clear and strong.

668
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:26,310
She is a very convincing witness,

669
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,940
which could explain
the motive for Cheon Sang-Woo's murder.

670
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,700
She has to come to court.

671
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:34,950
Will Kim Min-Ji appear?

672
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:36,750
I'll try to contact her, but...

673
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,690
I hope you don't
expect too much from her

674
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,390
As you said,

675
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,360
there is a reason why the police pushed
the president during interrogation.

676
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,740
Just then, I checked the records
that Choi Yong-Geun,

677
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:51,150
who was in the detention center,
came out for research.

678
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,580
I asked Choi Yong-Geun,

679
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,550
to directly observe and
verify the Chairman's statement.

680
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,570
That is why Choi Yong-Geun,

681
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
show ambiguity
in court.

682
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,420
We will continue to be on standby.

683
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,110
I think we need to
get rid of that thought

684
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,750
Team Leader Choi is on our side.

685
00:41:12,050 --> 00:41:13,490
Starting from the second round,

686
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:16,280
we must turn the situation
in our favor.

687
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,090
That way, Choi Yong-geun will
direct his heart towards us.

688
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,510
What do you think?

689
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,480
Because there are still many changes,
the final opinion is still confidential.

690
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,110
The most important thing is,

691
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,940
whether Kim Min-Ji
will come to court.

692
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,770
We have to endure it.

693
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:50,140
Min-Ji.

694
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,270
Why didn't you pick up my phone?
Why?

695
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,410
<i>why?</i>

696
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,830
Soo-Yeon?

697
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:01,560
father

698
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:03,980
Now,

699
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:06,660
there is no longer any reason
for me to take your call.

700
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:11,240
You, how can you...

701
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,480
Cheon Na-Na...

702
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,250
You...

703
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,150
I just want to meet my
nephew.

704
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,960
She really looks like her father.

705
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,080
Today was pretty good.
I like it

706
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,660
It seems that witness Kim Min-Ji
has been brought to the prosecutor's office.

707
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:53,350
Yes, we are at a
disadvantage.

708
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,650
We need a card to
turn things around. Let's move.

709
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:12,910
How? Any results?

710
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,590
Yes

711
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,810
How?

712
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,100
I've gathered
opinions from everyone.

713
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:20,830
Woo Tae-Ho.

714
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,230
Woo Tae-Ho?

715
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,180
<i>So...</i>

716
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:29,490
<i>So that's why you</i>
<i></i><i>killed Jung Hee-Joo?</i>

717
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,340
I thought it was just a threat.

718
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:36,790
<i>Because Hee-Joo said she was killed by</i>
<i></i><i>a serial killer...</i>

719
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:39,150
<i>Looks like Deputy Chief Cheon</i>
<i></i><i>didn't kill her.</i>

720
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:43,020
<i>Because Deputy Chief Cheon,</i>
<i></i><i>didn't commit serial murder...</i>

721
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:49,020
<i>Because of the serial killer</i><i></i><i> that...</i>

722
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:53,220
<i>not killing Hee-Joo... </i>

723
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,440
The content of this conversation,

724
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:00,680
is an important clue in
uncovering the motive for the murder of the accused.

725
00:44:02,550 --> 00:44:03,820
Are you sure the sound in there

726
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:06,280
is this recording yours ?

727
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,690
- Certain.
- Is the content of the conversation true?

728
00:44:09,470 --> 00:44:10,530
That's right.

729
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,480
That's it.

730
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:14,790
Please defendant

731
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:19,220
Please play back the last part
of the recording.

732
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:23,060
<i>Hee-Joo said he also</i>
<i></i><i>don't believe you.</i>

733
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,790
<i>Because he found out that you, </i>

734
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:28,250
<i>covering the assault case two years ago.</i>

735
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,950
<i>I think he's on the same side,</i>

736
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,410
<i>with Deputy Chief, Cheon Sang-Woo.</i>

737
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,830
It's enough.

738
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,870
Is this really your voice?

739
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,160
That's right.

740
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:43,820
Did you know at that time that
this conversation was being recorded?

741
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:47,220
- No.
- That's it

742
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,690
Was it the defendant who
ordered his subordinates

743
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:12,340
to take this photo and
send it to Jung Hee-Joo?

744
00:45:16,090 --> 00:45:17,930
- That's right.
- What is the reason?

745
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:19,690
I...

746
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:23,790
knowing that Tae-Ho hid
the CCTV files of the assault case,

747
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:27,800
and takes advantage of
Tae-Ho and Hee-Joo's affair.

748
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:30,590
<i>I told Hee-Joo</i>
<i></i><i>to find the proof.</i>

749
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:34,710
The defendant is the head of the
Seoul Investigation Unit team,

750
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:38,750
responsible for the
assault case two years ago.

751
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,170
According to the recording,

752
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,310
Woo Tae-Ho asked for your help
to cover up the incident,

753
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:45,730
then because of that relationship,

754
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,240
Tae-Ho accepted the accused,

755
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,360
as head of the legal team?

756
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:53,770
That's right.

757
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,070
Then you must
be closer to Tae-Ho,

758
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:58,450
than with the defendant, Cheon Sang-Woo?

759
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:01,050
because you both
know each other's weaknesses.

760
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,700
Yes, right.

761
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:07,160
Does Woo Tae-Ho know
Ki Dong-Jae is a murderer?

762
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,450
Dong-Jae works as a
subcontractor for TJ Group.

763
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,320
However, the head of the legal team definitely needed,

764
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,620
the power to select
subcontractors at will.

765
00:46:17,390 --> 00:46:20,730
Wasn't that possible with the permission
of the director-level Tae-Ho?

766
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:22,870
I think so.

767
00:46:27,260 --> 00:46:30,730
Tae-Ho is the one who has risen
from prosecutor to director of TJ Group.

768
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,000
It was probably because she was the
daughter-in-law of a rich family.

769
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,270
If,

770
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,460
affair with Hee-Joo is known,

771
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:40,600
we will face an irreversible crisis of life .

772
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,380
So I begged Dong-Jae.

773
00:46:43,270 --> 00:46:45,860
Please make Jung Hee-Joo
a serial killer victim,

774
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,960
so that he is free from suspicion.

775
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,670
Judge, we object.

776
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,710
Woo Tae-Ho, it's dead.

777
00:46:53,620 --> 00:46:55,460
This is a story that
can't be proven

778
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:58,230
and is being rotated in a direction
unrelated to the case.

779
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:00,350
Defendant Cheon Sang-Woo.

780
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,420
yes

781
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:05,010
If the defense's accusations are proven true,

782
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:09,830
defendants may receive
separate trials in private cases.

783
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,040
Did you accept the defense attorney's claim?

784
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:15,970
Yes, I admit it.

785
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:18,460
Objection rejected.

786
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:20,770
Defender, please continue.

787
00:47:22,290 --> 00:47:24,600
Against his intention,
Tae-Ho wrote the last card

788
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:26,900
when it was revealed that
Jung Hee-Joo's murder,

789
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,810
not done by a
serial killer,

790
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:32,590
and the divorce was announced by his wife,
who knew of his affair.

791
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:36,440
By taking advantage of Kim Min-Ji,
a victim of violence,

792
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,270
made the defendant Cheon Sang-Woo
the perpetrator of the murder.

793
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,070
He purposely records to use
the conversation with Min-Ji as evidence.

794
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:48,180
Let's hear Woo Tae-Ho's voice,

795
00:47:48,290 --> 00:47:51,040
which was recorded in the black box of the car
before Tae-Ho's death.

796
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,190
<i>This is the best way.</i>

797
00:47:56,020 --> 00:47:57,820
<i>This time, just follow my will.</i>

798
00:47:59,890 --> 00:48:01,690
According to the police report,

799
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:03,580
right before Woo Tae-Ho's death,

800
00:48:03,930 --> 00:48:05,570
call the detective in charge

801
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,590
and reveal that he
has something,

802
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:09,900
to tell about the case,
Jung Hee-Joo.

803
00:48:10,970 --> 00:48:14,170
The reason Tae-Ho said,
This is the best way, on record

804
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,860
was because he thought he could
catch both rabbits.

805
00:48:17,270 --> 00:48:20,150
He went to the police
hiding his guilt

806
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,000
by blaming Cheon Sang-Woo.

807
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,690
And he changed the heart of his wife,
Cheon Na-Na,

808
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,560
who is competing with defendant
Cheon Sang-Woo for management rights,

809
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:32,290
and declare divorce as
unheard of.

810
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:42,850
The defendant was aware of most of the
facts.

811
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,280
However, why during the investigation,

812
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,240
you don't testify like that?

813
00:48:55,150 --> 00:48:57,540
Woo Tae-Ho is my sister's husband.

814
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:01,690
People who have contributed a lot to the TJ Group.

815
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,420
That is my respect
for the deceased.

816
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:09,630
That's it.

817
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,890
<i>No. No.</i>

818
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:23,970
<i>Not Woo Tae-Ho</i>
<i></i><i>the one who killed Hee-Joo.</i>

819
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:26,140
<i>No. No.</i>

820
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:30,450
I heard,

821
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:33,920
it was highly likely that
Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo was released.

822
00:49:33,980 --> 00:49:35,050
Is it possible?

823
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:37,320
Let's wait and see.

824
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:39,390
How are you?

825
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:42,290
At least I
will definitely get punished.

826
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:46,730
However, Cheon Sang-Woo and Cheon Na-Na
won't be able to leave me.

827
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:49,670
They will try from behind.
I rest here and then go out.

828
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:51,900
I'm grateful.

829
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,440
Have you met Director Cheon Na-Na?

830
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:57,540
- Already.
- What did she say?

831
00:49:57,810 --> 00:49:59,840
To withdraw money from the account,

832
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:02,890
she needed the approval of the people
who lent their names.

833
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:04,550
It's hard to convince everyone,

834
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,620
but there are already
willing to allow.

835
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:13,860
You told me that everything had to be done
before the trial ended?

836
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:17,260
Already. She asked me to open an account,

837
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,570
and provide the account number.

838
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:22,630
Check the account,
if the money's in, call me.

839
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:24,570
However, what if

840
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,870
Chief Cheon Sang-Woo is released

841
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:29,640
will he ask again?

842
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:32,490
They wouldn't dare ask for it back.

843
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,780
Because I still have
a weapon called honesty.

844
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,580
After hearing the amount,

845
00:50:41,050 --> 00:50:42,560
it's huge.

846
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:44,290
Moreover, he also said only part of it.

847
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,920
The more the number,

848
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,770
Isn't the chance of getting caught
getting bigger?

849
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,760
Ki-Jin.

850
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:56,030
You know what money is the most generous
in the world?

851
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,570
The stolen money is
then hidden by the thief.

852
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:03,640
We just need to cast the spell.

853
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,210
"Open up!"

854
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:06,810
Sesime

855
00:51:10,550 --> 00:51:12,500
Is there anything we can refute...

856
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:15,250
From the lawyer's statement?

857
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,560
Most of his statements are
based on facts.

858
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:24,300
However, there was no way that Woo Tae-Ho
was the mastermind.

859
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,470
You've looked into it, right?

860
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,870
There's no other way
to prove it now.

861
00:51:29,100 --> 00:51:30,200
Like you said,

862
00:51:30,310 --> 00:51:33,740
there was no other way but to directly question
Woo Tae-Ho and Jung Hee-Joo up there.

863
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:38,840
What was the real meaning when Woo Tae-Ho said
this was his best effort?

864
00:51:39,940 --> 00:51:42,740
Have you met Cheon Na-Na?
Since Woo Tae-Ho told her that,

865
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,380
she should know what it means.

866
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:49,850
She said, it was to uncover
the case of Cheon Sang-Woo's sexual assault.

867
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,190
That doesn't help.

868
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,470
Maybe it could also be about surrender.

869
00:51:56,330 --> 00:51:59,260
You mean you agree
that the culprit is Woo Tae-Ho?

870
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,960
That is not what I mean.

871
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:04,370
Seriously. Didn't you see it?

872
00:52:04,610 --> 00:52:06,150
You said in the video,

873
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:09,870
You saw that Cheon Sang-Woo
ordered the assassination.

874
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:12,880
Why suddenly say that
in front of Mr. Prosecutor.

875
00:52:12,910 --> 00:52:14,280
You confused him.

876
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,810
There is no other way.

877
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:19,550
I will take the video
to court.

878
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:21,570
You said the owner wouldn't give it
up?

879
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:22,790
I will try.

880
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:25,120
It's an illegal recording.

881
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:28,860
Especially if we get
it illegally,

882
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:32,130
The evidence will have no validity whatsoever.

883
00:52:32,260 --> 00:52:34,060
We need valid evidence.

884
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,170
Invalid evidence
will not be accepted by the court.

885
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:38,130
If the evidence is invalid.

886
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,240
We have to give him legitimacy.

887
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:48,360

open sesame

893
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:06,730
You don't need kimchi?

894
00:53:07,730 --> 00:53:09,400
Is there kimchi at the convenience store?

895
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,440
- There is.
- Why didn't you tell me earlier.

896
00:53:12,700 --> 00:53:14,470
Bring me kimchi.

897
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:22,310
Nice.

898
00:53:23,850 --> 00:53:25,880
The video you've seen...

899
00:53:26,550 --> 00:53:28,780
You haven't shown
it to Chairman Woo yet, have you?

900
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:31,550
- Yes.
- I can't believe it, right?

901
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:35,530
Actually the penalty for illegal recording is
not so severe.

902
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:39,060
If it wasn't
for sexual harassment...

903
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,600
At least a fine.

904
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:44,430
- However, I won't change my mind.
- Of course.

905
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:49,240
If it is discovered that Director Cheon
recorded it,

906
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:54,280
You could be the cause of your brother's
being a murder suspect.

907
00:53:55,010 --> 00:54:00,750
Then you will be considered as betraying
the family and expelled from the company.

908
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:02,250
So?

909
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:06,660
The lawyers...

910
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:12,330
Suddenly accusing the late Woo Tae-Ho
in court.

911
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,230
So that's why we have to
attack him suddenly.

912
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,900
I need your permission.

913
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:19,340
Me?

914
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:20,770
What for?

915
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:22,970
To open the door.

916
00:54:29,350 --> 00:54:30,370
What's your goal?

917
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:34,790
To confiscate the goods of
the murder suspect Jung Hee-Joo.

918
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:35,890
<i>Seizure Order Letter</i>

919
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:47,870
You can check over here.

920
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,770
- You check the room.
- Well.

921
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,100
- I'll go up.
- Well.

922
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:57,970
My husband's library is on the second floor.

923
00:54:58,270 --> 00:54:59,580
Okay.

924
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:11,690
Please show the video evidence.

925
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:15,390
<i>Why are you bothering me so much?</i>

926
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,790

00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,260
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

928
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:20,860
<i>why?</i>

929
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,630
<i>why!</i>

930
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:25,230
Object. Judge please turn off the video.

931
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,840
Please turn it off first.

932
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,110
This video was taken illegally.
Can't be used as evidence.

933
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,040
This video can be used as evidence.

934
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,010
I've confirmed it.

935
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:37,150
- On what basis...
- I'll explain.

936
00:55:37,550 --> 00:55:39,150
In the second session,

937
00:55:39,250 --> 00:55:42,890
he stated that Woo Tae-Ho
was the mastermind behind the murder.

938
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,620
As a prosecutor, I need to confirm
the claims of the lawyers.

939
00:55:46,660 --> 00:55:48,320
To find this evidence,

940
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:50,530
we investigated Woo Tae-Ho again,

941
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:51,890
And this video...

942
00:55:52,630 --> 00:55:54,900
found in Woo Tae-Ho's private library .

943
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,430
Evidence obtained from official foreclosures.
And Woo Tae-Ho...

944
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,640
secretly record it.

945
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:01,700
No

946
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:04,810
It wasn't Woo Tae-Ho who recorded it.

947
00:56:10,180 --> 00:56:11,850
So who recorded it?

948
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,050
At the second trial, defense attorneys...

949
00:56:16,270 --> 00:56:20,160
stated that Woo Tae-Ho framed
Cheon Sang-Woo as a suspect.

950
00:56:20,190 --> 00:56:23,100
If it was a fact, then it was true that it was Woo Tae-Ho
who recorded it.

951
00:56:23,730 --> 00:56:25,730
The person who accused Woo Tae-Ho of
being a suspect...

952
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:27,690
is a defense attorney.

953
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,530
Then this is evidence
from the suspect's house.

954
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:34,310
Do you still think
this evidence is invalid?

955
00:56:36,830 --> 00:56:38,770
Please continue the video.

956
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,210
<i>Just kill Jung Hee-Joo.</i>

957
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,050
<i>I'll pay you a lot.</i>

958
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,520
<i>Just kill Jung Hee-Joo.</i>

959
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:55,630
<i>The rest will be handled by Chief Choi.</i>
<i></i><i>Then, your job is just...</i>

960
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,730
<i>You just have to kill him.</i>

961
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,360
<i>Understood ?</i>

962
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,130
Next video.

963
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,360
This is Ki Dong-Jae's reaction
after killing Jung Hee-Joo.

964
00:57:05,570 --> 00:57:06,690
<i>yes?</i>

965
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:08,710
<i>Jung Hee-Joo?</i>

966
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:12,880
<i>However, if you suddenly give</i>
<i></i><i>orders like that...</i>

967
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,840
<i>All right.</i>

968
00:57:16,150 --> 00:57:19,150
<i>I will call again after discussing</i>
<i></i><i>with Chief Choi.</i>

969
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,990
Defendant Choi Yong-Geun.

970
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,040
- Yes.
- In this video.

971
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,240
"Chief Choi" in question

972
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:35,260
by defendants Cheon Sang-Woo
and Ki Dong-Jae...

973
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:37,200
That was you?

974
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:41,070
- Right.
- Last question.

975
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,040
Who is the mastermind...

976
00:57:44,310 --> 00:57:46,740
Jung Hee-Joo's murder?

977
00:58:06,830 --> 00:58:09,670
Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo.

978
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:20,410
That's it.

979
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,850
Yeah

980
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,590
Yeah good. The result is good.

981
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,130
I'll go over there
and tell him straight.

982
00:58:36,890 --> 00:58:39,800
We won. Definitely win.

983
00:58:40,370 --> 00:58:41,870
Don't worry.

984
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:43,300
I'll be right back.

985
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:45,870
- He went out!
- Thats it.

986
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,140
What do you think
about the outcome of the trial?

987
00:58:48,170 --> 00:58:50,950
What do you think
about the video evidence?

988
00:58:50,970 --> 00:58:53,330
- Please give his opinion.
- How do you feel?

989
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:55,010
- Please say something!
- Please say something!

990
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:00,550
Hey, look at him.

991
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:04,720
He couldn't possibly run away
before the verdict, right?

992
00:59:05,090 --> 00:59:06,190
I'm a little worried.

993
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,720
I'll go over there and check it out.

994
00:59:08,090 --> 00:59:10,330
- I go first.
- What about me?

995
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:11,630
Just take a taxi.

996
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,630
<i>Cheon Sang-Woo</i>

997
00:59:34,670 --> 00:59:35,800
<i>Pintu Masuk</i>

998
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:49,530
You're dead!

999
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,140
You're dead!

1000
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:06,150
Hey!

1001
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:08,620
What a bitch of a woman!

1002
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:17,730
You can't beat me.

1003
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:19,560
Surrender.

1004
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,030
You couldn't be more pathetic.

1005
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:25,710
Give up. That is enough.

1006
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:28,570
I underestimated  you too much.

1007
01:00:33,210 --> 01:00:34,230
Die you!

1008
01:00:35,110 --> 01:00:36,350
Die you!

1009
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:57,030
Ouch. Almost...

1010
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,340
I killed my only sister
in front of you.

1011
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:03,970
Na-Na.

1012
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,480
Don't do this again.

1013
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,810
Even if you die, you can't
beat me.

1014
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:13,750
You're just a dying dog like your mother.

1015
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,250
Understand?

1016
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,630
Are you okay?

1017
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,040
Our relationship is terrible, right?

1018
01:01:36,040 --> 01:01:36,910
Yes

1019
01:01:37,570 --> 01:01:38,810
It seems so.

1020
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:58,890
If you want, I'll send someone
to watch.

1021
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:01,700
This is normal.

1022
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,530
I've had it since I was little.
Don't worry.

1023
01:02:06,570 --> 01:02:10,870
The outcome of the trial will meet your expectations.
However, for me...

1024
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:12,440
It's not over yet.

1025
01:02:12,540 --> 01:02:13,880
What else is the problem?

1026
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:15,950
I want to know what really...

1027
01:02:16,550 --> 01:02:18,410
Woo Tae-Ho thought before dying.

1028
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:20,080
After knowing it,

1029
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:21,750
will finally be seen.

1030
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:23,950
Thankfully, I regret it too.

1031
01:02:24,550 --> 01:02:26,120
Let's meet...

1032
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,120
Until the end.

1033
01:02:31,060 --> 01:02:33,100
Thanks for saving me.

1034
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:54,580
Welcome.

1035
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:56,950
How's your condition?

1036
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:59,860
Well. Thanks to you. Please sit.

1037
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:16,940
I have miseducated him.

1038
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,910
Very embarrassing.

1039
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:20,740
You must be very worried.

1040
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,950
The trial was fair.

1041
01:03:25,450 --> 01:03:27,050
You have to accept it.

1042
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:31,520
Now I don't think it's a problem.

1043
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:36,690
Now, TJ is more important
than my son.

1044
01:03:38,460 --> 01:03:40,430
Not because this is my company.

1045
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,600
However, if TJ is destroyed,
the country's economy...

1046
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,970
It will get very bad.

1047
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,720
McQueen's influence will only grow.

1048
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:53,040
We also recognize that this
is a serious matter.

1049
01:03:53,510 --> 01:03:57,350
The reason why McQueen joined
TJ,

1050
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:00,980
not to save TJ,

1051
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:03,220
but turn it off

1052
01:04:03,790 --> 01:04:05,920
and sell them by piece.

1053
01:04:08,290 --> 01:04:09,760
Recently,

1054
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:11,330
McQueen...

1055
01:04:12,060 --> 01:04:15,460
Once chose Woo Tae-Ho
to be the manager.

1056
01:04:16,470 --> 01:04:17,600
Too bad.

1057
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:21,440
It was a precious opportunity
for TJ to survive.

1058
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:27,240
I was so stupid
to have missed that opportunity.

1059
01:04:28,180 --> 01:04:30,010
I already know it.

1060
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,740
Personally,

1061
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:34,750
I also think it's a good opportunity
to change the game.

1062
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:36,200
I will go out

1063
01:04:36,950 --> 01:04:39,860
and found another Woo Tae-Ho.

1064
01:04:42,690 --> 01:04:44,430
Can you promise it?

1065
01:04:50,700 --> 01:04:52,070
In that case...

1066
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:54,940
Do you have someone in mind ?

1067
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,270
Yes , there is

1068
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:57,810
Already available.

1069
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:00,680
this case

1070
01:05:01,110 --> 01:05:03,450
is the first time in our country,

1071
01:05:03,810 --> 01:05:08,450
the head of a large company was put on
trial as a murder suspect.

1072
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,420
All public attention is focused
on this trial.

1073
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,120
This is a condition

1074
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,030
which will affect the country's economy

1075
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:23,230
for imprisoning
the head of a large company.

1076
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:25,630
However, from this court

1077
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:32,570
we can take a value that should
not be forgotten.

1078
01:05:33,310 --> 01:05:34,350
Law

1079
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:36,910
must be fair to everyone.

1080
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,720
Decision.

1081
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:45,720
The defendant Choi Yong-Geun,
found guilty of disposing of the body,

1082
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:48,020
sentenced to five years in prison.

1083
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:54,680
Defendant Cheon Sang-Woo...

1084
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:01,640
Please calm down!

1085
01:06:02,870 --> 01:06:04,210
Defendant Cheon Sang-Woo...

1086
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:07,310
guilty of murder.

1087
01:06:08,110 --> 01:06:10,780
He will be sentenced to 15 years in prison.

1088
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:31,070
Toast. Hard work everyone.

1089
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:32,400
Good business.

1090
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:37,590
You've worked hard.

1091
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:42,160
Thanks to your hard work,
everything ended well. Thank you

1092
01:06:42,190 --> 01:06:44,350
I didn't do anything,
I just stopped him.

1093
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,450
Prosecutors humiliated by detectives.

1094
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,990
Why are you talking like that.
Everything ended well.

1095
01:06:50,150 --> 01:06:52,520
- Why did you...
- I want to ask you one thing.

1096
01:06:52,690 --> 01:06:53,960
Why are you living like that?

1097
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:55,930
For honor?

1098
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,370
For justice?
What's the real reason?

1099
01:06:58,390 --> 01:07:00,230
Not like that.

1100
01:07:00,260 --> 01:07:02,270
You're coming with us, right?

1101
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:06,650
I have no other choice but to come
with you.

1102
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:09,340
What is your real purpose in living like this?

1103
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,930
Since I'm a detective,
there's no other reason.

1104
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:16,110
Don't cross the line.
Don't live like that.

1105
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:18,840
Why are you suddenly worrying about
other people's lives?

1106
01:07:18,890 --> 01:07:20,650
- What a waste.
- Are you cursing at the prosecutor again?

1107
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:23,050
You started it first.

1108
01:07:23,150 --> 01:07:25,290
You still think we're under you?

1109
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:26,690
I can't believe you're like that.

1110
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,090
- You're so old-fashioned.
- It's not a matter of position.

1111
01:07:30,120 --> 01:07:33,400
It's the prosecutor's job to catch
if the detective makes a wrong arrest.

1112
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:34,210
Catch what?

1113
01:07:34,260 --> 01:07:36,800
All you have to do is sit down
and sign.

1114
01:07:36,820 --> 01:07:38,900
What do you know?

1115
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:41,080
Detectives can't see
the whole thing.

1116
01:07:41,270 --> 01:07:42,840
How many cases do you have in a month?

1117
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:46,380
A case of a year for you is a case
that I have to solve in a day.

1118
01:07:46,740 --> 01:07:49,020
Why are you talking to the Prosecutor like that?

1119
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,650
- Do not interfere.
- Do-Chang!

1120
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,960
- Nothing.
- But...

1121
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:55,510
Have you ever seen a corpse in person?

1122
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:58,280
Have you ever seen a rotting corpse?

1123
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:02,170
So, have you ever been unable to sleep
after claiming someone's death?

1124
01:08:02,190 --> 01:08:06,130
- Your job is done after putting the handcuffs on.
- You always underestimate detective work.

1125
01:08:06,160 --> 01:08:08,960
What I underestimated was you,
not a detective.

1126
01:08:09,030 --> 01:08:10,870
What do you mean!

1127
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,990
- How dare you. How old are you?
- "How old are you?"

1128
01:08:16,040 --> 01:08:17,610
He's out

1129
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:24,800
How do you feel after being found
not guilty?

1130
01:08:24,850 --> 01:08:27,630
Former Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo sentenced
to 15 years in prison,

1131
01:08:27,650 --> 01:08:29,850
does it have anything to do with this?

1132
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:32,150
What is the future of the TJ Group
?

1133
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:34,370
What do you think was the reason you were found
not guilty?

1134
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,580
Please say something.

1135
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:37,060
We do not accept inquiries.

1136
01:08:37,160 --> 01:08:39,990
- Please say something.
- Please say something.

1137
01:08:58,580 --> 01:09:00,020
You've worked hard.

1138
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,400
You've been waiting a long time, haven't you?

1139
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:18,570
Forgive me.

1140
01:09:18,870 --> 01:09:20,570
I have a lot of business.

1141
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:21,870
That's okay.

1142
01:09:21,970 --> 01:09:23,310
Please sit.

1143
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:28,110
Grandpa.

1144
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,710
I apologize on behalf
of my company and family

1145
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,480
for Miss Hee-Joo's death.

1146
01:09:33,510 --> 01:09:34,750
No need.

1147
01:09:35,050 --> 01:09:37,790
I have many faults.

1148
01:09:37,850 --> 01:09:40,390
The trial results surprised you, didn't they?

1149
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:43,190
I apologize.

1150
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,460
You suffered a lot
because of the Hee-Joo case, right?

1151
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:52,340
I....

1152
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:56,270
also think that Hee-Joo contributed

1153
01:09:56,810 --> 01:10:00,880
in the death of your husband.

1154
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,950
You don't have to think so.

1155
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,750
I beg...

1156
01:10:08,350 --> 01:10:10,650
Sorry for what Hee-Joo did.

1157
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:13,290
May be...

1158
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:15,760
Hee-Joo is also begging for mercy
up there.

1159
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:19,630
Director Cheon,

1160
01:10:19,690 --> 01:10:21,130
what do you want to drink?

1161
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,530
I will serve it myself.
He is an important guest.

1162
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,770
You want coffee?

1163
01:10:27,440 --> 01:10:29,070
Yes, it's okay.

1164
01:10:29,710 --> 01:10:30,840
Please wait a moment.

1165
01:10:44,050 --> 01:10:45,250
Yes, Team Leader.

1166
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,790
I thought it was a call from the Team Leader's office.

1167
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,640
Forgive me.

1168
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:58,300
No problem. Please speak, Director Cheon.

1169
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:01,770
Oh it's like that.

1170
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,880
All right. I will be there soon.

1171
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:15,240
Grandpa, how is it?
Looks like I have to go.

1172
01:11:15,590 --> 01:11:17,350
Grandpa just wait at the store first.

1173
01:11:17,420 --> 01:11:18,990
I'll be home by dinner.

1174
01:11:19,090 --> 01:11:20,220
Let's eat together.

1175
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:21,940
Good. Go away.

1176
01:11:28,270 --> 01:11:29,520
See you later.

1177
01:11:42,940 --> 01:11:44,550
Oh my gosh, Hee-Joo.

1178
01:11:45,310 --> 01:11:49,320
Why don't you answer the phone?
Did something happen?

1179
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,130
Director Cheon.

1180
01:12:07,870 --> 01:12:08,900
Yes?

1181
01:12:12,340 --> 01:12:14,140
Is that what you called ? Director Cheon

1182
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:16,140
