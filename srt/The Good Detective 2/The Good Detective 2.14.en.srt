<i>Episode 14</i>

7
00:00:26,953 --> 00:00:28,218
Grandpa.

8
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:13,143
Come on.

9
00:01:13,173 --> 00:01:14,727
Drink properly.

10
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,161
Hold him.

11
00:02:13,877 --> 00:02:15,861
The last source is around here.

12
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,714
What place is this?

13
00:02:17,746 --> 00:02:20,128
Grandpa's address is also around here.

14
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:27,451
Hello, Eun-Hye.

15
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:30,482
Grandpa messaged me.

16
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:32,599
The content of the message is very strange.

17
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:35,630
Grandpa says he wants to see Hee-Joo.

18
00:02:36,185 --> 00:02:37,365
But,

19
00:02:37,932 --> 00:02:42,076
Grandpa never
texted me at all.

20
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:44,183
Then,

21
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,410
at the moment

22
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,636
a stranger came to grandpa's shop.

23
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:53,409
I think they're trying to find something.

24
00:02:53,434 --> 00:02:54,317
Yes

25
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,110
Uncle.

26
00:02:57,504 --> 00:03:00,566
I think something
happened to Grandpa.

27
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:01,995
What should we do?

28
00:03:02,355 --> 00:03:03,784
I beg you, Uncle.

29
00:03:05,527 --> 00:03:08,387
Please save grandpa.

30
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:11,043
Looks like they're trying to make it
a suicide.

31
00:03:11,105 --> 00:03:13,886
The message sent to Eun-Hye
hints at suicide.

32
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,159
They took Grandpa's cell phone,
then sent it.

33
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,167
Come on, quickly. Before we're too late.

34
00:03:22,222 --> 00:03:23,682
Come on.

35
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:25,050
Good grief.

36
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:28,815
Boss, someone's coming.

37
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,729
Hey, hurry up.

38
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:37,861
Pull!

39
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:47,864
Over there!

40
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:55,552
Hurry up and cut the rope!

41
00:03:55,602 --> 00:03:58,528
- Fast!
- Hold his leg!

42
00:03:58,605 --> 00:03:59,943
Quickly call an ambulance!

43
00:03:59,998 --> 00:04:01,989
- Take it down!
- Slowly.

44
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:03,651
Lay him down here.

45
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:11,244
Grandpa.

46
00:04:11,353 --> 00:04:13,056
<i>You can't go like this.</i>

47
00:04:14,095 --> 00:04:15,744
Please, be strong.

48
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,837
Please breathe!

49
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,494
There's one more thing

50
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,548
what grandpa should know.

51
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:25,290
So, please endure.

52
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,032
Grandpa.

53
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:01,491
Hang on, for my sake.

54
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:07,339
It's because I can't
take it, Grandpa.

55
00:05:07,364 --> 00:05:08,980
Please

56
00:05:13,588 --> 00:05:16,322
We found a lot of footprints
besides the detectives' feet.

57
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:19,553
They were in a hurry to escape,
so couldn't cover the tracks properly.

58
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:21,119
After inspection,

59
00:05:21,783 --> 00:05:23,792
we will know who they are.

60
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,925
What about the others?

61
00:05:24,964 --> 00:05:26,767
<i>They will check the CCTV
around here.</i>

62
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,814
Okay.

63
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:29,925
Hold the men to the end.

64
00:05:30,017 --> 00:05:32,736
If they don't do well,
I'll kill them all.

65
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:35,869
Don't lose
a single hair. You understand?

66
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,642
<i>Yeah.</i>

67
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,296
Good work.

68
00:05:53,036 --> 00:05:54,755
Grandpa will come back to his senses.

69
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:56,810
I can't guarantee it

70
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:58,495
because grandpa is old.

71
00:05:58,831 --> 00:06:00,573
However, he had a strong will.

72
00:06:01,112 --> 00:06:03,698
Grandpa will recover. I trust him.

73
00:06:05,378 --> 00:06:07,901
Grandpa didn't try
to kill himself, did he?

74
00:06:07,933 --> 00:06:08,980
Yes

75
00:06:09,091 --> 00:06:10,388
That is for sure.

76
00:06:10,552 --> 00:06:11,638
Why?

77
00:06:12,013 --> 00:06:14,708
What made them
do that to Grandpa?

78
00:06:15,724 --> 00:06:17,177
We're investigating it.

79
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,169
So, the reason will soon be revealed.

80
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:23,667
It must be him.

81
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,401
It must have something to do with that guy.

82
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:29,113
Who?

83
00:06:29,152 --> 00:06:30,870
I saw his face.

84
00:06:30,909 --> 00:06:33,245
The man who tied me up,
and ran away from Grandpa's shop.

85
00:06:33,308 --> 00:06:34,354
What?

86
00:06:34,534 --> 00:06:36,354
How dare that fool.

87
00:06:36,808 --> 00:06:38,456
What did he do to you?

88
00:06:38,498 --> 00:06:39,584
That man

89
00:06:39,683 --> 00:06:41,831
was looking for something at Grandpa's shop.

90
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,136
Then he met me,

91
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,519
and he closed my eyes
so I couldn't see him.

92
00:06:46,534 --> 00:06:47,980
But, I saw his face.

93
00:06:51,719 --> 00:06:53,110
<i>Are you sure you saw it?</i>

94
00:06:53,149 --> 00:06:55,696
Have you seen it?

95
00:06:55,758 --> 00:06:56,828
No

96
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,883
But, I remember clearly.

97
00:06:58,992 --> 00:07:00,023
Eyes

98
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:01,172
nose,

99
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:02,391
lips,

100
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:04,468
and all over his face.

101
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:36,101
I do not know.

102
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:39,038
I really don't remember. Forgive me.

103
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,049
<i>It's okay, Eun-Hye.</i>

104
00:07:42,924 --> 00:07:44,065
<i>Dad</i>

105
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,604
<i>It's okay.</i>

106
00:07:57,335 --> 00:08:00,507
I don't want to make that mistake again.

107
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,129
What did you do
to Jung Hee-Joo's clothes?

108
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,635
It's been burned.

109
00:08:17,057 --> 00:08:18,486
Good work.

110
00:08:18,557 --> 00:08:20,517
There's no other problem, right?

111
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:23,057
There are a few things that bother me.

112
00:08:23,082 --> 00:08:25,861
What do you mean
you didn't finish well?

113
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,330
Yeah

114
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,393
I heard, Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather

115
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,502
got an accident.

116
00:08:33,775 --> 00:08:35,596
He didn't die.

117
00:08:37,369 --> 00:08:39,330
Is that what bothers you?

118
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:43,908
The doctor said there was little chance
of recovery.

119
00:08:44,768 --> 00:08:46,440
It is deeply regretted.

120
00:08:46,465 --> 00:08:47,643
True, right?

121
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:49,947
anyhow,

122
00:08:50,002 --> 00:08:52,525
almost all possible problems are
gone, right?

123
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,432
It's too early to conclude.

124
00:08:54,549 --> 00:08:56,736
Looks like we'll have to
keep an eye on the situation.

125
00:08:57,944 --> 00:09:01,170
Team Leader Jang, are you a person
who can't do well?

126
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:02,342
what?

127
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:05,080
You should have convinced me.

128
00:09:05,237 --> 00:09:06,651
"There will be no problem."

129
00:09:06,698 --> 00:09:08,424
"If there is, I will take care of it."

130
00:09:08,455 --> 00:09:10,221
You should have said that.

131
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:12,775
I will try. But...

132
00:09:12,814 --> 00:09:15,307
Why did you do something I did
n't tell you to?

133
00:09:16,103 --> 00:09:19,353
You have to take responsibility
for what you have done.

134
00:09:21,283 --> 00:09:22,525
Fine, I understand.

135
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,306
I think very shortly

136
00:09:24,798 --> 00:09:27,634
I will take care of all the problems.

137
00:09:32,228 --> 00:09:34,423
I've been busy lately.

138
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,330
There is a lot to be done
in the company.

139
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,781
If the job is done well,

140
00:09:40,837 --> 00:09:42,767
I will appoint Team Leader Jang

141
00:09:42,798 --> 00:09:44,917
to my closest side.

142
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,057
Yes

143
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,690
I see.

144
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:57,382
How did you know
Jung In-Beom was in danger?

145
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,317
I

146
00:09:59,358 --> 00:10:01,301
give him something.

147
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,982
That's why

148
00:10:03,442 --> 00:10:05,919
they want to kill grandpa.

149
00:10:07,707 --> 00:10:08,957
What's that?

150
00:10:17,373 --> 00:10:18,670
Hey, you guys.

151
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:21,865
You guys looked for Ki Dong-Jae
and attacked him, right?

152
00:10:22,639 --> 00:10:24,185
You brought Grandpa Jung Hee-Joo,

153
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:27,431
and make it look like suicide.

154
00:10:27,557 --> 00:10:29,893
Ki Dong-Jae's brother
has already given a statement.

155
00:10:29,932 --> 00:10:32,393
I heard you guys came
with Goo Jae-Chun.

156
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,604
Evidence of you being at the location already exists.

157
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:37,088
I turned it over
to the National Forensic Service,

158
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,173
and the results will be out soon.

159
00:10:39,393 --> 00:10:42,776
We have checked the CCTV
which shows your car.

160
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,573
Police number 2112. Am I wrong?

161
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,816
All my life, I have
spent a lot of time

162
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,268
investigate gangsters,
and see bad guys.

163
00:10:52,315 --> 00:10:54,463
I have never
seen fools like you.

164
00:10:54,963 --> 00:10:57,627
Even though they're useless thugs,

165
00:10:57,729 --> 00:10:59,759
but they didn't attack grandpa
like you guys.

166
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,861
- You're not listening to me?
- Hey!

167
00:11:01,893 --> 00:11:03,588
- Stop it.
- Be patient.

168
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:05,494
- Good grief.
- Be patient.

169
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,744
Hey, you guys.

170
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,322
You are not gangsters,

171
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:09,869
you are just insects.

172
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,525
- You guys are insects.
- Hey.

173
00:11:11,572 --> 00:11:12,728
Damn

174
00:11:12,752 --> 00:11:14,862
Why did you hit me?

175
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,343
This is a violation of human rights.

176
00:11:16,392 --> 00:11:17,416
You jerks 

177
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,159
You're saying bullshit.

178
00:11:19,213 --> 00:11:22,088
Human rights only apply
to humans.

179
00:11:23,346 --> 00:11:24,814
Be patient.

180
00:11:27,635 --> 00:11:30,031
Did they do something wrong?

181
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:32,110
You guys were ordered
to do it, right?

182
00:11:32,719 --> 00:11:36,446
You don't want to do it,
but you have to because you are ordered to.

183
00:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,063
If there are rumors circulating that

184
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:39,862
you guys bother
an 80 year old man,

185
00:11:39,909 --> 00:11:42,141
"You guys are gangsters in this field."

186
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,907
You think you can live
with a name like that?

187
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,815
Can't do it, right? Because it's embarrassing.

188
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,369
While in prison, you won't

189
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,652
treated like a human being.

190
00:11:49,683 --> 00:11:52,948
You have to put
your head in the closet.

191
00:11:52,983 --> 00:11:55,378
<i>- Right</i>
- We threw one person into the trash.

192
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,748
That way, your name
will not appear in the media.

193
00:11:58,418 --> 00:12:00,320
Was Goo Jae-Chun the mastermind?

194
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:03,935
Or someone else?

195
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:06,647
So that...

196
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:11,858
Looks like Goo Jae-Chun also received
orders from someone.

197
00:12:12,225 --> 00:12:13,459
Who's that?

198
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:15,623
It...

199
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:19,373
I don't know.

200
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:22,045
Only Goo Jae-Chun knew that.

201
00:12:23,512 --> 00:12:24,832
Seriously!

202
00:12:26,559 --> 00:12:27,918
Seriously!

203
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,372
What brings you here?

204
00:12:35,747 --> 00:12:38,872
I heard Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather
had an accident.

205
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:40,528
Is there a clear reason?

206
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:43,575
Who knows. We're still investigating.

207
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:46,418
What attracted you
to this case?

208
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,145
I'm actually investigating

209
00:12:48,170 --> 00:12:50,731
the disappearance of Ki Dong-Jae some time ago.

210
00:12:51,028 --> 00:12:53,996
I think Goo Jae-Chun
is behind all this.

211
00:12:54,036 --> 00:12:55,341
I want to know,

212
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:57,442
Is it true that Goo Jae-Chun
is behind all this.

213
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:02,207
It's still under investigation.
I can't say anything.

214
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,801
I won't steal the case.

215
00:13:05,927 --> 00:13:08,692
I'll turn the case over
to the Incheon West Office.

216
00:13:08,762 --> 00:13:11,168
Really?

217
00:13:11,567 --> 00:13:12,731
But,

218
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,223
we haven't gotten anything yet.

219
00:13:14,255 --> 00:13:15,645
We're watching

220
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,153
Goo Jae-Chun's men.

221
00:13:17,178 --> 00:13:18,434
I already confirmed

222
00:13:18,473 --> 00:13:20,169
they will be brought here.

223
00:13:20,286 --> 00:13:21,512
It means

224
00:13:21,614 --> 00:13:25,036
they have something to do
with Jung Hee Joo's grandfather case, right?

225
00:13:25,275 --> 00:13:26,353
Right?

226
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,033
Who knows.

227
00:13:30,986 --> 00:13:32,306
This is

228
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,314
proof that Goo Jae-Chun
killed Ki Dong-Jae.

229
00:13:37,946 --> 00:13:39,181
Good grief.

230
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,540
I lost again
to the Incheon West Office.

231
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:43,861
You guys will

232
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:46,415
catch Goo Jae-Chun.

233
00:13:50,284 --> 00:13:51,502
It can't be stopped.

234
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:53,252
I've crossed the line.

235
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,650
Will you stop now?

236
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,006
<i>I'm just doing
what the Team Leader tells me to do.</i>

237
00:13:59,573 --> 00:14:00,893
Let's dodge first.

238
00:14:00,987 --> 00:14:02,994
You should give me time
to fix it.

239
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,566
Then, I will trust you.

240
00:14:32,268 --> 00:14:33,034
What the hell?

241
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:35,558
Did she see me that day?

242
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,948
The forensic report shows

243
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:43,690
there's Ki Dong-Jae's blood on the ship's deck.

244
00:14:44,964 --> 00:14:46,229
Then, this is

245
00:14:48,269 --> 00:14:49,597
a statement that the ship owner

246
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:53,167
lent the ship
to one of Goo Jae-Chun's men.

247
00:14:53,675 --> 00:14:56,745
That's proof that Goo Jae-Chun
killed Ki Dong-Jae.

248
00:14:57,238 --> 00:14:58,402
But,

249
00:14:58,449 --> 00:15:00,753
why did Jang Ki-Jin
leave this to us?

250
00:15:00,808 --> 00:15:03,105
He wants us to arrest Goo Jae-Chun.

251
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,988
Jang Ki-Jin, that fool.

252
00:15:05,027 --> 00:15:07,722
It seemed like he was
playing with his petty wits.

253
00:15:07,761 --> 00:15:10,135
He will blame Goo Jae-Chun

254
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,535
for the murder of Ki Dong-Jae,
and the terror on grandfather.

255
00:15:12,644 --> 00:15:14,378
Then, he will stay away.

256
00:15:17,214 --> 00:15:18,232
Eun-Hye has come.

257
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:19,538
Good morning.

258
00:15:19,577 --> 00:15:20,675
Eun-Hye.

259
00:15:20,816 --> 00:15:22,112
What are you doing here?

260
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:23,957
I have something to show you.

261
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,223
Isn't he Jang Ki-Jin?

262
00:15:39,177 --> 00:15:40,388
This man

263
00:15:40,435 --> 00:15:43,793
is the one who came secretly
to grandpa's shop and stole something.

264
00:15:44,395 --> 00:15:45,598
I just saw him

265
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:47,426
drive the car
out of the police station.

266
00:15:51,177 --> 00:15:53,763
Ki Dong-Jae's brother handed over
the clothes and shoes

267
00:15:53,981 --> 00:15:56,880
which Jung Hee-Joo wore
when she was murdered to grandpa.

268
00:15:57,106 --> 00:15:58,380
Then Jang Ki-Jin,

269
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,317
look for it at Hee-Joo's grandfather's shop.

270
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:04,106
Gangsters from Gangnam kidnap grandpa,

271
00:16:04,294 --> 00:16:06,770
and make it look like suicide and
then kill him.

272
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,310
Meanwhile,

273
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:10,067
Ki-Jin steals Jung Hee-Joo's belongings.

274
00:16:10,114 --> 00:16:12,988
He made sure we caught
the Gangster from Gangnam.

275
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,138
Then, give us the evidence of
Ki Dong-Jae's murder.

276
00:16:16,177 --> 00:16:17,622
Therefore,

277
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:20,781
our focus turned to Goo Jae-Chun.

278
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:23,083
That was Jang Ki-Jin's goal.

279
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:26,099
What exactly is hidden
in Jung Hee-Joo's belongings?

280
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,145
Until they kill someone.

281
00:16:28,185 --> 00:16:30,763
It wasn't Ki Dong-Jae
who killed Jung Hee-Joo.

282
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:34,966
That's why it didn't throw
away the evidence and keep it.

283
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:36,557
There is evidence of Jung Hee-Joo's killer

284
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:39,565
in his possessions.

285
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,526
Jang Ki-Jin is
the Team Leader of the Seoul Investigation Unit.

286
00:16:43,557 --> 00:16:45,861
It also means

287
00:16:45,906 --> 00:16:48,439
the evidence has been turned over to the police, right?

288
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:52,687
He is no longer a policeman.

289
00:16:53,453 --> 00:16:55,320
But, criminals.

290
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,358
Good afternoon.

291
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,159
We're detectives from the Incheon West Office.

292
00:17:06,217 --> 00:17:09,060
How long have
you been driving this car?

293
00:17:21,326 --> 00:17:22,904
Mr. Director, I'm Cheon Na-Na.

294
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:24,778
Ah,, Yeah

295
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,682
Wasn't it announced that
I would be holding a directory meeting?

296
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:29,959
<i>That...</i>

297
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:33,849
<i>That's because the Honorary Chief
suddenly changed places,</i>

298
00:17:34,091 --> 00:17:37,841
<i>so I thought the Honorary Chief
would speak for himself.</i>

299
00:17:38,154 --> 00:17:39,849
<i>It seems that Director Cheon was not contacted.</i>

300
00:17:39,959 --> 00:17:41,224
<i>Excuse me.</i>

301
00:17:43,573 --> 00:17:45,291
No, you don't need to apologize.

302
00:17:45,338 --> 00:17:46,573
I understand.

303
00:18:02,854 --> 00:18:04,650
- Hello.
- As the Director said.

304
00:18:04,685 --> 00:18:06,737
Looks like the detectives
are investigating something.

305
00:18:06,776 --> 00:18:08,197
Fine, I understand.

306
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,604
Good work.

307
00:18:18,752 --> 00:18:20,424
Burning it is the right choice.

308
00:18:20,455 --> 00:18:22,463
Things can get complicated.

309
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,517
Brother ,, Hyungnim 

310
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,940
However, the situation is very serious.

311
00:18:26,965 --> 00:18:29,745
There is more than one charge against me
for this incident.

312
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,658
Illegal infiltration, acts of violence,

313
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:32,861
concealment of evidence,

314
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,047
even attempted murder.

315
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,478
It's a lot.

316
00:18:37,885 --> 00:18:39,330
You don't have to worry.

317
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:41,541
I'll take care of the rest.

318
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,010
But, you can't protect
Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo.

319
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:46,862
Now you're also
wearing a prison uniform.

320
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,885
Can I continue to trust you
in a situation like this?

321
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,198
Ki-Jin.

322
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,916
If something happens to you,

323
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:59,823
the money you received will also be lost.

324
00:19:00,096 --> 00:19:02,018
This time, I too was desperate.

325
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:05,502
I will protect you.
So don't worry.

326
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:08,861
Yong-Geun.

327
00:19:09,903 --> 00:19:11,442
Who is the real culprit?

328
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,814
If you say that,
I will believe you too.

329
00:19:19,249 --> 00:19:20,406
Me

330
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,452
only took over Jung Hee-Joo's body.

331
00:19:23,484 --> 00:19:25,492
I handed it over to Ki Dong-Jae.

332
00:19:25,517 --> 00:19:27,905
I don't know who killed her

333
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:29,585
That is what I mean.

334
00:19:29,781 --> 00:19:33,215
Who handed over his body to you?

335
00:19:39,284 --> 00:19:40,573
Woo Tae-Ho.

336
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,135
Then why in court...

337
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:46,760
Because we can earn money,

338
00:19:46,862 --> 00:19:49,729
if Cheon Sang-Woo goes to jail.

339
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:01,839
The cardiac shock machine is ready.

340
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:04,003
- Raise the wave to 200 <i>Joules.</i>
- Good.

341
00:20:14,621 --> 00:20:15,879
Just this.

342
00:20:16,035 --> 00:20:17,386
No Jang Ki-Jin.

343
00:20:17,434 --> 00:20:20,090
They had tracked the location of the nearest CCTV
before they made their move.

344
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,785
That bastard

345
00:20:22,357 --> 00:20:24,974
Is this what you learned
from your detective work?

346
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:29,560
So, this is the only evidence
we have.

347
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,658
- Did you guys find anything?
- Yes.

348
00:20:35,404 --> 00:20:36,763
Was Jang Ki-Jin caught on camera?

349
00:20:36,788 --> 00:20:38,810
Not. Jang Ki-Jin is not recorded.

350
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,613
But, there is Cheon Na-Na.

351
00:20:52,052 --> 00:20:55,155
Is this a sign that
Cheon Na-Na is involved in this case?

352
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,687
Right. But, this is during the day.

353
00:20:57,749 --> 00:21:01,030
It's far from the night time
when Eun-Hye saw Jang Ki-Jin.

354
00:21:01,366 --> 00:21:03,023
Is it just a coincidence?

355
00:21:04,038 --> 00:21:06,132
Let's make sure with Cheon Na-Na.

356
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,382
It was certain she had gone to the store.

357
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:10,758
So, she will tell
the reason why she went there.

358
00:21:10,797 --> 00:21:13,381
You think Cheon Na-Na
will tell the truth?

359
00:21:13,973 --> 00:21:16,147
Yes, I'm Kang Do-Chang
from Incheon West Office.

360
00:21:17,611 --> 00:21:18,647
What?

361
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:20,780
Fine, I understand.

362
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:22,624
I'll be there soon.

363
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:23,765
Yes

364
00:21:25,726 --> 00:21:27,498
Something happened to grandpa.

365
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,936
I have to go to the hospital.

366
00:21:28,983 --> 00:21:30,920
- I'll call you later.
- okey

367
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:37,116
Isn't the situation a bit suspicious?

368
00:21:37,147 --> 00:21:40,585
Why did something happen to grandpa

369
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,795
when Cheon Na-Na was
caught going to the store?

370
00:21:42,882 --> 00:21:43,978
Maybe Cheon Na-Na...

371
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:46,319
Hey, why would a woman like Cheon Na-Na
do that?

372
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:49,905
She is a woman
who will do anything.

373
00:21:56,919 --> 00:21:57,992
What happened?

374
00:21:58,331 --> 00:21:59,351
What...

375
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:31,057
What is it?

376
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,671
Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather is in the hospital.

377
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,500
Some tried to kill him
and disguised him as suicide.

378
00:22:41,358 --> 00:22:45,311
You were recorded on the black box
in the truck near Jung In-Beom's shop.

379
00:22:45,353 --> 00:22:46,413
Why did you go there?

380
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:48,864
- To meet grandpa.
- What is the reason?

381
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:52,639
I don't think you will believe
anything I say.

382
00:22:53,433 --> 00:22:56,642
Since Grandpa is unconscious,
you can't hear the story.

383
00:22:56,703 --> 00:22:59,222
I never mentioned
Grandpa was unconscious.

384
00:22:59,829 --> 00:23:01,862
Do you think
I can't read the situation?

385
00:23:02,411 --> 00:23:04,644
You might think
I have men everywhere.

386
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:09,923
You admit that you met the victim
on the day of the incident?

387
00:23:17,869 --> 00:23:19,991
You suspect me again?

388
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,313
With the fact that you met the victim,

389
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:24,359
you could be a suspect.

390
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:28,364
You made grandpa like that.

391
00:23:29,372 --> 00:23:31,872
Because you keep digging up
cases that happened a long time ago

392
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:34,410
resulting
in innocent victims.

393
00:23:36,547 --> 00:23:38,318
If you stop here,

394
00:23:39,288 --> 00:23:40,794
nothing will happen.

395
00:23:43,748 --> 00:23:44,908
If I stop,

396
00:23:47,293 --> 00:23:49,349
perpetrators will also stop, right?

397
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:51,968
If I'm the culprit,

398
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:54,265
it seems so.

399
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,921
All right. Thank you for your cooperation.

400
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:03,371
Later I will send you

401
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,610
legal application letter.

402
00:24:05,667 --> 00:24:06,867
See you at the office.

403
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:12,728
All the things that are happening
around you now,

404
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,600
it happened because of you.

405
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:19,863
There could be another innocent victim
like grandpa.

406
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:22,914
Think well.

407
00:24:41,687 --> 00:24:44,248
<i>You made grandpa like that.</i>

408
00:24:45,348 --> 00:24:47,020
If you stop here

409
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,756
nothing will happen.

410
00:24:50,510 --> 00:25:00,515
Subtitles are provided by: Summer fouad

411
00:25:00,515 --> 00:25:03,825
How does McQueen view
TJ in this situation?

412
00:25:05,524 --> 00:25:06,769
If I can be honest,

413
00:25:07,135 --> 00:25:08,235
I think this is very bad.

414
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,719
- Drink up.
- Yes.

415
00:25:21,393 --> 00:25:22,965
What's your dream?

416
00:25:23,382 --> 00:25:24,438
For now,

417
00:25:24,915 --> 00:25:26,846
I want to rise to the top position
in McQueen.

418
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,262
Should I give you
the best position at McQueen?

419
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:31,902
In their world, you are just...

420
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:33,708
Stranger.

421
00:25:34,637 --> 00:25:35,660
I agree.

422
00:25:36,153 --> 00:25:37,220
I have to change.

423
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,703
I will change it.

424
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:43,145
You're planning to

425
00:25:43,598 --> 00:25:45,103
destroy TJ and sell it, right?

426
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,617
You can get a lot of money
if you destroy it everywhere.

427
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:54,020
But after you destroyed
a big Korean company,

428
00:25:54,745 --> 00:25:57,318
would you give
it to a foreign company?

429
00:25:58,005 --> 00:26:00,066
You will be severely criticized.

430
00:26:01,772 --> 00:26:03,516
Maybe from McQueen's side

431
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:05,771
some will be thrown out
for sacrifice.

432
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:10,535
Who do you think is the most appropriate
victim?

433
00:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,998
If you save
a dying company

434
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:18,330
with your own hands,

435
00:26:20,334 --> 00:26:23,784
Won't you be the person
TJ and McQueen need?

436
00:26:25,489 --> 00:26:28,337
That's a very good thought.

437
00:26:29,331 --> 00:26:30,664
But TJ's current situation

438
00:26:30,866 --> 00:26:33,566
not a situation I could have saved
with my own hands.

439
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:34,741
I mean,

440
00:26:35,934 --> 00:26:37,428
I ordered you

441
00:26:38,244 --> 00:26:40,377
to become President Director at TJ.

442
00:26:42,353 --> 00:26:43,918
This world wants a difference

443
00:26:44,224 --> 00:26:46,796
between ownership and management
of conglomerate companies.

444
00:26:47,626 --> 00:26:48,965
If you can make it happen

445
00:26:49,908 --> 00:26:51,436
you will be in the spotlight.

446
00:26:53,087 --> 00:26:54,120
What's that

447
00:26:54,431 --> 00:26:55,687
could it really happen?

448
00:26:56,103 --> 00:26:57,875
What I want will come true.

449
00:26:58,407 --> 00:26:59,474
You...

450
00:27:00,105 --> 00:27:01,955
Just do one thing.

451
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,343
<i>Do you have time?</i>

452
00:27:16,093 --> 00:27:17,127
<i>Let's meet.</i>

453
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:20,210
I have an appointment in the evening.

454
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:22,310
<i>I already sent the car.
Stop by for a moment.</i>

455
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:29,774
Okay.

456
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,474
Looks like I have to go.

457
00:27:47,213 --> 00:27:48,286
Sit down.

458
00:27:51,742 --> 00:27:52,798
You must be busy.

459
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,490
As usual.

460
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:58,324
Shouldn't you be apologizing to me
for breaking your promise

461
00:27:58,613 --> 00:27:59,935
at the shareholder meeting?

462
00:28:00,673 --> 00:28:02,134
This is not an excuse,

463
00:28:02,293 --> 00:28:04,621
but the situation back then was
absolutely unavoidable.

464
00:28:06,838 --> 00:28:07,872
Okay.

465
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:10,138
What did the Chief say?

466
00:28:11,658 --> 00:28:14,019
He asked for an opinion.

467
00:28:14,418 --> 00:28:15,440
What opinion?

468
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:17,251
You must also know about this situation.

469
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,033
And also what the Chairman wants from me.

470
00:28:20,549 --> 00:28:21,783
Is there any talk about me?

471
00:28:23,101 --> 00:28:24,506
There isn't any.

472
00:28:25,543 --> 00:28:26,587
Then,

473
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:28,826
what was the conclusion of your meeting?

474
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,308
From McQueen's side also do not want
anything like this to happen in the future.

475
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:34,821
Because it's possible

476
00:28:35,347 --> 00:28:37,189
ending with a bad conclusion.

477
00:28:39,508 --> 00:28:42,008
The chairman wants to negotiate directly
with McQueen.

478
00:28:43,645 --> 00:28:44,667
But that too

479
00:28:45,489 --> 00:28:46,900
will worsen the situation.

480
00:28:49,239 --> 00:28:51,350
So, this is just my opinion.

481
00:28:52,557 --> 00:28:54,012
Apart from the Chairman

482
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,084
someone had to go to McQueen
and offer a solution.

483
00:28:59,123 --> 00:29:00,156
Who?

484
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:05,559
You want to meet
CEO McQueen too, right?

485
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:08,521
You told me to leave.

486
00:29:13,076 --> 00:29:14,176
I'm not going to force.

487
00:29:14,643 --> 00:29:17,265
It's up to you
how you will judge this situation

488
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:20,080
which one is for the company
and which one is for yourself.

489
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,228
You have a strange habit.

490
00:29:30,807 --> 00:29:33,140
When you say something
dishonest,

491
00:29:33,715 --> 00:29:35,760
You subconsciously said
it in English.

492
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:40,123
Isn't it quite the opposite?

493
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,173
It's easier for me to use English

494
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,912
when I show my feelings.

495
00:29:45,941 --> 00:29:48,169
OK, I'll think about it.

496
00:29:51,404 --> 00:29:52,818
Go. You said you had an appointment.

497
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:53,991
Okay.

498
00:29:54,652 --> 00:29:56,185
Call me when you've decided.

499
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:07,167
Dad told you, right?

500
00:30:07,574 --> 00:30:08,841
Move me to America...

501
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,741
Then he asked you to kill me there.

502
00:30:11,195 --> 00:30:13,207
What? Of course not.

503
00:30:13,232 --> 00:30:14,466
Why do you think so?

504
00:30:14,502 --> 00:30:15,824
I told you!

505
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,890
Don't lie to me
in English!

506
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:19,593
Na-Na...

507
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,012
Are you siding with dad now?

508
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,941
Did you and dad work together
to kill me?

509
00:30:26,395 --> 00:30:28,716
Let's pretend the conversation to America
never happened.

510
00:30:28,904 --> 00:30:29,940
Is that what you want?

511
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:43,751
Tell dad.

512
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:45,788
I will not die.

513
00:30:47,107 --> 00:30:48,489
Even if I die,

514
00:30:48,935 --> 00:30:50,977
I will draw all of you
to die with me.

515
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:53,733
Before everything is destroyed.

516
00:31:24,644 --> 00:31:26,935
<i>You may think
I have minions everywhere.</i>

517
00:31:27,388 --> 00:31:29,133
If you stop here

518
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,731
nothing will happen.

519
00:31:32,229 --> 00:31:33,247
If I'm the culprit,

520
00:31:34,338 --> 00:31:35,623
it seems so.

521
00:31:41,959 --> 00:31:43,959
How about grandpa?
Is he okay?

522
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:47,159
 They said he had a heart attack.

523
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,337
Fortunately,

524
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:50,758
can immediately return to normal.

525
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,192
What is the reason?

526
00:31:53,201 --> 00:31:54,268
Who knows...

527
00:31:54,742 --> 00:31:56,590
Doctors say
they don't know why either.

528
00:31:56,923 --> 00:31:59,517
Said it could happen
in very critical patients,

529
00:31:59,615 --> 00:32:00,954
So I believed what the doctor said.

530
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:04,209
How was the meeting with Cheon Na-Na?

531
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:06,141
She claimed to meet grandfather?

532
00:32:07,547 --> 00:32:08,583
Yes

533
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:11,302
What do you think?

534
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,448
Are you also sure that Cheon Na-Na
is helping Jang Ki-Jin?

535
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,404
For now

536
00:32:18,435 --> 00:32:20,840
I think it's better if
we don't bother Cheon Na-Na first.

537
00:32:20,865 --> 00:32:23,391
Why suddenly say that?
You're so confident though.

538
00:32:24,482 --> 00:32:25,779
Are you afraid of Cheon Na-Na?

539
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:28,597
We have to catch Goo Jae-Chun first.

540
00:32:28,658 --> 00:32:30,901
We catch Goo Jae-Chun,
then if Jang Ki-Jin shows up

541
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,569
we will be able to see Cheon Na-Na.

542
00:32:33,065 --> 00:32:35,192
It's obvious they've been caught...

543
00:32:35,674 --> 00:32:37,019
You know where he's hiding?

544
00:32:37,418 --> 00:32:38,921
Right, maybe you can too

545
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,406
they fled abroad.

546
00:32:41,306 --> 00:32:43,124
We'll see how it turns out.

547
00:32:43,725 --> 00:32:47,501
He thought that Seoul Investigation Unit Team Leader
Jang Ki-Jin would save him.

548
00:32:49,647 --> 00:32:50,731
Hey.

549
00:32:50,965 --> 00:32:52,438
You know about Goo Jae-Chun.

550
00:32:52,747 --> 00:32:54,123
Does he have a girlfriend?

551
00:32:54,301 --> 00:32:55,628
There is a woman he likes,

552
00:32:56,168 --> 00:32:57,786
but he wasn't the loyal type either.

553
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,357
He's been under investigation for over two years .

554
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,699
I'm not so sure
he's still in touch with women.

555
00:33:03,191 --> 00:33:04,415
Good grief.

556
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:09,819
We have to catch him so that the suspicions
on Jang Ki-Jin can be clear.

557
00:33:11,306 --> 00:33:13,645
There was one thing
that Goo Jae-Chun really liked.

558
00:33:14,937 --> 00:33:15,967
What is it ?

559
00:33:17,098 --> 00:33:18,134
Black sheep.

560
00:33:29,322 --> 00:33:31,285
This is the restaurant
that Goo Jae-Chun often goes to, right?

561
00:33:32,101 --> 00:33:33,616
- Yes.
- How often does he come?

562
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:36,639
I think about once every two weeks.

563
00:33:36,676 --> 00:33:38,361
What does he usually order here?

564
00:33:38,985 --> 00:33:40,542
Usually he eats hotpot stew.

565
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,814
Is there a special cooking style
that Goo Jae-Chun likes?

566
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:46,073
The hotpot stew at this restaurant is
very good.

567
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:49,065
He also likes braised pork
and spiced skin.

568
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,652
He's not going to eat right here.

569
00:33:52,677 --> 00:33:55,035
He'll definitely ask for it to be wrapped
or delivered,

570
00:33:55,263 --> 00:33:56,863
so we have to follow him

571
00:34:06,491 --> 00:34:07,533
Why are you here?

572
00:34:09,216 --> 00:34:11,440
I cleaned up before grandpa came.

573
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:15,288
He would definitely be sad
if he saw his shop was dirty when he came home.

574
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,279
He is a very neat person.

575
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,185
Looks like Grandpa's condition has improved.

576
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:30,723
Really?

577
00:34:31,973 --> 00:34:33,748
You will know
if you hear the sound of his breath.

578
00:34:33,956 --> 00:34:35,895
He looks
rather comfortable now.

579
00:34:36,816 --> 00:34:39,476
You and grandpa seem to be
chatting a lot.

580
00:34:40,124 --> 00:34:41,148
Yes...

581
00:34:41,578 --> 00:34:43,711
Grandpa really loves you.

582
00:34:44,603 --> 00:34:47,142
No, I love him more.

583
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,002
Why? In terms of what?

584
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:53,486
Only...

585
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,395
I'm grateful for his existence.

586
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:59,725
I can meet him
whenever I want.

587
00:35:01,544 --> 00:35:03,175
Uncle, I'll go first.

588
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,023
I have to leave immediately
because it's visiting time.

589
00:35:06,185 --> 00:35:07,202
- Go away.
- Good.

590
00:35:17,801 --> 00:35:18,979
You're not going to work?

591
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,855
Why are you here?

592
00:35:24,527 --> 00:35:26,561
You're not going to work?
Why do you drink alcohol?

593
00:35:31,202 --> 00:35:32,940
You said you had a lot of work to do.

594
00:35:34,694 --> 00:35:36,666
Come on, what's the matter with you?

595
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:39,600
You must immediately catch
those who harmed Grandpa.

596
00:35:39,625 --> 00:35:42,094
You said you had to catch
them before they ran away.

597
00:35:42,423 --> 00:35:43,918
You can't stay here.

598
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,070
I am angry.

599
00:35:52,198 --> 00:35:53,354
Oppa,,big brother

600
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:55,718
I'm just mad...

601
00:35:59,213 --> 00:36:00,837
I'm angry with myself.

602
00:36:01,418 --> 00:36:03,354
I'm mad at everything.

603
00:36:03,722 --> 00:36:07,106
Everything makes me angry.

604
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,894
Cry it out.

605
00:36:16,261 --> 00:36:17,739
Yes, cry all you want.

606
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:02,266
You've been arrested!

607
00:37:03,278 --> 00:37:04,350
What is it?

608
00:37:07,338 --> 00:37:10,282
- That...
- Is there an officer here

609
00:37:10,532 --> 00:37:11,910
whose name is Ji Moon-Sook?

610
00:37:13,043 --> 00:37:14,610
That's his younger brother

611
00:37:14,635 --> 00:37:16,754
his face looks like his but his hair is at shoulder length.

612
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,134
No. There is no such person.

613
00:37:21,223 --> 00:37:22,534
But that's why...

614
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,541
Just watch out if I catch Noon-Sook...

615
00:37:27,612 --> 00:37:31,138
Moon-Sook, I will destroy him

616
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,754
Where are you Moon-Sook?

617
00:37:35,264 --> 00:37:36,314
Happy eating.

618
00:38:02,635 --> 00:38:04,812
I didn't know you were coming,
so I didn't order.

619
00:38:05,227 --> 00:38:06,883
Let's say the server has one more person.

620
00:38:07,144 --> 00:38:08,188
It doesn't matter.

621
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,751
Please eat.

622
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:17,181
How did you know I was here?

623
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,513
I sent people

624
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:21,186
for worrying about dad.

625
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:22,778
Really?

626
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:24,824
The vegetables here are delicious.

627
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,050
It's sure to suit your chatty mouth .

628
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:31,190
I...

629
00:38:33,215 --> 00:38:35,737
Don't know what dad wants from me.

630
00:38:36,992 --> 00:38:39,386
If dad says it in detail
I will.

631
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:40,847
I already said,

632
00:38:41,597 --> 00:38:42,697
don't stand out.

633
00:38:43,275 --> 00:38:45,270
I was just in my place
as usual.

634
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,425
How...

635
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,604
Should I be humble as again?

636
00:38:50,217 --> 00:38:51,567
Where you can't be seen.

637
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:53,336
Where I can't see you

638
00:38:53,608 --> 00:38:54,675
Shut up there.

639
00:38:56,605 --> 00:38:57,627
Should I die?

640
00:39:02,292 --> 00:39:03,614
What did you say to your father?

641
00:39:03,955 --> 00:39:05,654
I am so guilty
that I deserve to die.

642
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:10,954
You even included brother,
the only one you considered family

643
00:39:11,105 --> 00:39:12,571
to prison

644
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,023
I brought the evidence to the prison.

645
00:39:17,055 --> 00:39:18,244
Even though I'm your daughter

646
00:39:18,672 --> 00:39:19,850
can i be forgiven?

647
00:39:24,579 --> 00:39:25,623
What's wrong with you?

648
00:39:26,922 --> 00:39:28,683
Father has made mother die.

649
00:39:30,197 --> 00:39:31,213
Are you taking revenge?

650
00:39:33,002 --> 00:39:34,603
I've given you a lot

651
00:39:35,065 --> 00:39:36,815
for that woman

652
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,244
But why do you...

653
00:39:38,398 --> 00:39:40,943
Why do you
want to avenge that woman now?

654
00:39:42,388 --> 00:39:44,277
The woman my father is talking about,

655
00:39:46,475 --> 00:39:49,175
She taught me one thing
before She died.

656
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:51,390
"Seize."

657
00:39:52,207 --> 00:39:54,068
"You too will die
if you don't snatch it."

658
00:39:54,399 --> 00:39:57,405
You really believe
what that stupid woman told you?

659
00:39:59,586 --> 00:40:00,758
She was stupid

660
00:40:01,808 --> 00:40:03,308
She died by being trampled

661
00:40:03,649 --> 00:40:04,966
without putting up a fight.

662
00:40:05,146 --> 00:40:07,568
You came today
with a lot of preparation, apparently.

663
00:40:08,481 --> 00:40:11,248
So that I falter
and not let you just like that.

664
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,234
You know why you're in prison, right?

665
00:40:17,426 --> 00:40:19,704
I gave the data
to the Blue House.

666
00:40:20,731 --> 00:40:23,686
It turns out that you really
want to die by my hands.

667
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:29,691
Enjoy your meal.

668
00:40:40,551 --> 00:40:42,229
I will speak honestly.

669
00:40:43,853 --> 00:40:45,314
I'm afraid of dad.

670
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:47,899
I'm scared...

671
00:40:49,165 --> 00:40:50,759
Dad is really going to kill me.

672
00:41:21,299 --> 00:41:25,776
<i>You sent the brother I
considered the only family to prison.</i>

673
00:41:27,199 --> 00:41:29,589
<i>It's me who gives evidence to the police.</i>

674
00:41:30,746 --> 00:41:33,847
<i>Can she be forgiven
because she's his daughter?</i>

675
00:41:33,894 --> 00:41:36,277
<i>You came with a plan apparently.</i>

676
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,247
<i>Annoys me and keeps me from moving.</i>

677
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:43,593
<i>You know why dad is in prison, right?</i>

678
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,578
<i>I submitted the file to the Blue House.</i>

679
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:50,501
<i>You really seem to
want to die by my hands, don't you?</i>

680
00:41:51,812 --> 00:41:53,507
<i>I'll tell the truth.</i>

681
00:41:55,128 --> 00:41:57,003
<i>I'm afraid of my father.</i>

682
00:41:57,905 --> 00:41:59,131
<i>I'm afraid of him</i>

683
00:42:00,413 --> 00:42:02,280
<i>will kill me.</i>

684
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,448
Yes, Team leader

685
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:08,268
How long do I have to be like this?

686
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,344
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

687
00:42:11,696 --> 00:42:14,649
After I found out, you
banned me from going abroad.

688
00:42:14,701 --> 00:42:16,062
Please release that.

689
00:42:16,087 --> 00:42:17,437
Let me get some wind.

690
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:19,807
I feel suffecated 

691
00:42:20,378 --> 00:42:21,581
Okay.

692
00:42:22,232 --> 00:42:24,591
It will take some time
to get to the top.

693
00:42:25,626 --> 00:42:27,087
Anyway, I will withdraw the ban.

694
00:42:27,571 --> 00:42:28,610
Just wait.

695
00:42:59,581 --> 00:43:00,659
Yes

696
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,472
Yes ,, I see

697
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:03,634
Yes

698
00:43:04,184 --> 00:43:05,410
It's true he
ordered a hot pot.

699
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:07,667
He also ordered pickled skin.

700
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:34,623
They should just eat jjajangmyeon
why should they order a scapegoat too?

701
00:43:36,053 --> 00:43:37,248
Arrived already.

702
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,334
Let's go

703
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:41,095
While we are here let's eat 
jjajangmyeon first.

704
00:43:42,697 --> 00:43:43,815
Good afternoon.

705
00:43:44,385 --> 00:43:45,580
Welcome.

706
00:43:46,026 --> 00:43:47,053
Please sit.

707
00:43:51,887 --> 00:43:52,926
What do you want to order?

708
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,991
Just keep eating,
we'll order later.

709
00:43:56,023 --> 00:43:57,335
Okay.

710
00:44:01,041 --> 00:44:01,814
Hey.

711
00:44:02,304 --> 00:44:04,093
Why is the scapegoat not eaten?

712
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,880
Right. I wonder why?

713
00:44:08,110 --> 00:44:09,196
I'm back.

714
00:44:12,754 --> 00:44:14,589
Hey you. Eat it later.

715
00:44:14,614 --> 00:44:15,832
Something has to be delivered.

716
00:44:36,154 --> 00:44:38,279
They seem to be using tactics.

717
00:44:38,512 --> 00:44:41,496
I think they avoided tracking
by complicating shipping routes.

718
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:42,759
I'm sure it's
Goo Jae-Chun.

719
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:44,685
Yes

720
00:45:19,653 --> 00:45:20,947
Let's eat.

721
00:45:29,265 --> 00:45:30,476
What's this?

722
00:45:34,870 --> 00:45:36,026
Truly.

723
00:45:43,243 --> 00:45:44,743
Clean up the crime scene!

724
00:45:46,205 --> 00:45:47,760
- Jae-Chun.
- Yes?

725
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:49,963
Please.

726
00:45:50,476 --> 00:45:51,952
Just surrender here and let's go

727
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,162
I don't know how much I'm going
to beat you today.

728
00:46:02,284 --> 00:46:05,128
I've heard everything from
Ki Dong-Soo's brother Ki Dong-Jae.

729
00:46:07,459 --> 00:46:10,654
Why did Ki Dong-Jae try to
steal Jung Hee-Joo's belongings?

730
00:46:10,992 --> 00:46:12,281
Does it help?

731
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:15,382
Then why did you do
that to Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather?

732
00:46:15,483 --> 00:46:17,022
What's the point for you?

733
00:46:19,349 --> 00:46:20,474
Who ordered it?

734
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,414
I don't know where he
died or is alive,

735
00:46:27,728 --> 00:46:29,666
so I went to
catch him.

736
00:46:29,957 --> 00:46:33,253
Grandpa's problem has
nothing to do with me.

737
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:35,129
Your subordinates did it.

738
00:46:35,162 --> 00:46:36,889
Someone must have
told them.

739
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:39,149
They don't just
do my job.

740
00:46:39,390 --> 00:46:40,999
They also do
part time work.

741
00:46:41,033 --> 00:46:42,447
You just said that too.

742
00:46:42,781 --> 00:46:45,179
What can I get out of it?

743
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:47,467
You said you didn't know he was
dead or alive, right?

744
00:46:47,493 --> 00:46:48,680
Yes

745
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:51,840
Look at this.

746
00:46:52,630 --> 00:46:53,872
If you see,

747
00:46:54,979 --> 00:46:56,972
You will know what
happened to Ki Dong-Jae.

748
00:47:06,878 --> 00:47:08,886
That's what Jang Ki-Jin handed
us.

749
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:11,272
So that you are caught
as Ki Dong-Jae's killer.

750
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:15,824
Jang Ki-Jin used you as a shield.

751
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:18,900
If you shut up, we like it too.

752
00:47:18,925 --> 00:47:20,400
We are ashamed too.

753
00:47:20,726 --> 00:47:24,046
The fact that we have
bad members among our police officers.

754
00:47:34,416 --> 00:47:38,366
Let Goo Jae-Chun write
the report on Ki Dong-Jae's murder.

755
00:47:39,161 --> 00:47:40,724
What about Jang Ki-Jin?

756
00:47:41,225 --> 00:47:44,084
He is an active duty officer and
the leader of the Seoul Investigation Team.

757
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:47,419
It was hard to catch with just
one statement from Goo Jae-Chun.

758
00:47:48,049 --> 00:47:49,119
'There are eyewitnesses.

759
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:50,744
Eun-Hye.

760
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:54,513
Eun-Hye.

761
00:47:56,362 --> 00:47:57,510
Why?

762
00:47:58,058 --> 00:47:59,105
What?

763
00:48:00,547 --> 00:48:01,665
Arrested?

764
00:48:02,376 --> 00:48:03,672
Who did it?

765
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,039
Are you scared?

766
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:08,662
No

767
00:48:09,507 --> 00:48:11,398
You must have been to this place many times.

768
00:48:12,025 --> 00:48:14,932
Not long ago, you were arrested
as an accomplice in a theft case.

769
00:48:15,133 --> 00:48:16,586
Then released Oh Ji-Hyeok.

770
00:48:17,179 --> 00:48:18,507
You're a cop.

771
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,235
But why do that

772
00:48:20,417 --> 00:48:22,300
- You know me?
- I told you I saw.

773
00:48:22,592 --> 00:48:24,662
- Where?
- At Grandpa's shop.

774
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:26,303
Oh yes?

775
00:48:26,768 --> 00:48:28,158
I did go too.

776
00:48:28,229 --> 00:48:29,736
To retrieve important evidence.

777
00:48:31,416 --> 00:48:33,579
It was you then.

778
00:48:33,604 --> 00:48:34,994
But why are you there?

779
00:48:35,288 --> 00:48:37,515
Did you also come
to collect evidence?

780
00:48:39,232 --> 00:48:41,193
Did you
hide it?

781
00:48:41,758 --> 00:48:43,039
On the orders of Kang Do-Chang.

782
00:48:43,070 --> 00:48:45,195
- What?
- That proof,

783
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:47,445
is important evidence
for a murder case.

784
00:48:47,946 --> 00:48:49,774
If what
you say is true,

785
00:48:49,853 --> 00:48:53,970
it means Detective Kang Do-Chang
is hiding evidence through you.

786
00:48:55,310 --> 00:48:56,669
I never said that.

787
00:48:56,694 --> 00:48:57,881
No need to be afraid.

788
00:48:58,178 --> 00:49:00,818
I only called you as a witness.

789
00:49:01,798 --> 00:49:05,313
But why were you in such a desperate hurry at that time?

790
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:08,381
Did Kang Do-Chang tell you?

791
00:49:09,081 --> 00:49:11,557
That evidence
you must keep properly.

792
00:49:11,673 --> 00:49:13,202
What are you talking about?

793
00:49:13,429 --> 00:49:15,382
You hit me first.

794
00:49:15,545 --> 00:49:17,990
You tied me up and forbade me to meet.

795
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,474
I'm a detective.

796
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:22,364
I only suppress people
who get in the way of my work.

797
00:49:22,396 --> 00:49:25,295
Because you're young so
I just handcuff you.

798
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,199
Also because your life is suffering.

799
00:49:30,486 --> 00:49:32,068
You should thank me.

800
00:49:37,243 --> 00:49:38,618
Think well.

801
00:49:39,751 --> 00:49:41,251
Let's cool our heads.

802
00:49:41,808 --> 00:49:43,448
You don't have to worry.

803
00:49:45,611 --> 00:49:47,041
Hey you!

804
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:48,213
Hey!

805
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,788
Don't be too enthusiastic.

806
00:49:52,826 --> 00:49:54,756
I just called her as a witness.

807
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,410
I didn't take her
because she was guilty.

808
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:57,763
What?

809
00:49:58,452 --> 00:50:00,398
What case do you mean?

810
00:50:01,414 --> 00:50:04,554
I've told her everything.
Just ask for an explanation.

811
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:06,996
You can go home. Thank you.

812
00:50:07,715 --> 00:50:08,863
Are you okay?

813
00:50:08,945 --> 00:50:10,210
- No problem?
- Yes.

814
00:50:10,289 --> 00:50:12,867
Detective Kang Do-Chang
is a great person.

815
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:15,605
Raising the daughter
of the man you executed.

816
00:50:16,298 --> 00:50:18,454
Very human.

817
00:50:18,956 --> 00:50:22,246
Why not just be the director of the orphanage
and act as a detective instead?

818
00:50:35,941 --> 00:50:37,379
Why didn't he answer?

819
00:50:38,238 --> 00:50:41,289
Is he going to pick up? This
is Goo Jae-Chun's disposable cell phone.

820
00:50:41,808 --> 00:50:45,136
If he was picked up, it would be obvious
that he was on the same team as Goo Jae-Chun.

821
00:50:45,316 --> 00:50:46,871
He didn't pick up. Just close it.

822
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:49,292
- Well.
- Hey, you!

823
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:50,515
Look at me.

824
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,011
Jang Ki-Jin that person
talking like that?

825
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,001
Are you interfering
with official duties?

826
00:51:16,051 --> 00:51:17,465
Evil bastard.

827
00:51:17,704 --> 00:51:19,681
He stole the start from us.

828
00:51:20,668 --> 00:51:23,942
He also claims that Jung Hee-Joo 's belongings were hidden by you my brother.

829
00:51:23,967 --> 00:51:25,252
If there's a problem,

830
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:28,957
they will accuse you of hiding evidence.

831
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:32,630
Eun-Hye.

832
00:51:33,126 --> 00:51:36,431
I don't want to drag you
into this case again.

833
00:51:36,605 --> 00:51:38,097
- So...
- I saw it.

834
00:51:38,432 --> 00:51:40,438
I'll tell him.
He's the culprit.

835
00:51:40,478 --> 00:51:42,447
I'm afraid you will get hurt.

836
00:51:43,161 --> 00:51:46,403
I'm afraid you're stuck on
something pointless and get hurt again.

837
00:51:46,428 --> 00:51:50,123
If I go out, you're going to say
that grandpa won't wake up again?

838
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,268
Eun-Hye.

839
00:51:51,311 --> 00:51:53,671
With that I have
another lump of stone in my heart.

840
00:51:54,197 --> 00:51:55,611
You know that's not true.

841
00:51:56,064 --> 00:51:57,619
It's just a mess now.

842
00:51:57,954 --> 00:51:59,657
It's really hard to even breathe.

843
00:52:06,254 --> 00:52:07,387
yes

844
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:10,162
I traced the area Goo Jae-Chun
called with a disposable cell phone.

845
00:52:10,214 --> 00:52:11,800
Generally in downtown Seoul.

846
00:52:11,872 --> 00:52:14,247
Also appeared some
around the Seoul Investigation office.

847
00:52:15,414 --> 00:52:17,929
Then about the new place.

848
00:52:18,584 --> 00:52:21,631
Around him was a
prominent building.

849
00:52:39,893 --> 00:52:43,024
Detectives have only one reason to
go to the National Forensic Service.

850
00:52:43,565 --> 00:52:46,806
To leave Jung Hee-Joo's belongings
taken from her grandfather's shop.

851
00:52:47,153 --> 00:52:49,137
Didn't take it
to hide?

852
00:52:49,172 --> 00:52:50,617
Because of orders from Cheon Na-Na.

853
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,688
Also want to know why Ki
Dong-Jae hid it.

854
00:52:54,641 --> 00:52:57,415
Because there will be traces
of the real culprit.

855
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:05,120
Jang Ki-Jin, the leader of the
Seoul Investigations team came, right?

856
00:53:07,254 --> 00:53:08,676
What did he leave?

857
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,777
It was an item he
had personally deposited.

858
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:13,067
Murdered victim

859
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:14,999
shoes and clothes

860
00:53:15,172 --> 00:53:16,192
Am I right ?

861
00:53:17,531 --> 00:53:18,590
Right.

862
00:53:20,824 --> 00:53:25,223
The victim is Jung Hee-Joo. We
are in charge of the case.

863
00:53:25,427 --> 00:53:27,591
This is not a personal request.

864
00:53:28,347 --> 00:53:31,667
We are in the process of taking the necessary
official steps for the investigation.

865
00:53:33,944 --> 00:53:36,414
These are the shoes and clothes
worn at the time of his death.

866
00:53:36,541 --> 00:53:38,111
Genetic identification
is ongoing.

867
00:53:38,995 --> 00:53:40,370
There are some
spots of blood.

868
00:53:40,484 --> 00:53:43,573
It was confirmed that it was
not a single person's bloodstain.

869
00:53:44,366 --> 00:53:47,333
That means the bloodstains of someone
other than the victim are also confirmed?

870
00:53:47,388 --> 00:53:48,411
Right.

871
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:50,011
Has it been identified?

872
00:53:50,499 --> 00:53:54,460
It will take time. The results
will probably be out within this week.

873
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,895
Just because the results come out doesn't
mean the identity is revealed, right?

874
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,633
I have the DNA data of several people including
Ki Dong-Jae sent by Chairman Jang.

875
00:54:01,829 --> 00:54:03,415
When compared,

876
00:54:03,587 --> 00:54:05,321
will identify it faster.

877
00:54:06,172 --> 00:54:08,586
Please contact us as soon
as the results are out.

878
00:54:09,448 --> 00:54:10,581
Fine, I understand.

879
00:54:11,089 --> 00:54:14,347
If there's a stain on Ki Dong-Jae from there,

880
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,309
we can get through it
without any problem.

881
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:19,271
For example if there is someone else's blood?

882
00:54:19,336 --> 00:54:21,188
So we return to
the beginning of the case investigation.

883
00:54:22,075 --> 00:54:23,325
My goodness.

884
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:25,660
Why this case has no end.

885
00:54:25,685 --> 00:54:27,489
Always in the same place.

886
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:30,340
Hello

887
00:54:30,365 --> 00:54:31,582
In this situation,

888
00:54:31,783 --> 00:54:34,315
I only have one thing
to tell you.

889
00:54:34,718 --> 00:54:38,913
O young cop. The country believes in you!

890
00:54:38,972 --> 00:54:40,409
Yes, that's it

891
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:41,636
Okay.

892
00:54:43,116 --> 00:54:44,507
Kang Do-Chang.

893
00:54:45,085 --> 00:54:46,640
I got
a call from the PR team.

894
00:54:46,761 --> 00:54:50,457
He said TJ invited you and
Oh Ji-Hyeok to a charity event.

895
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:54,344
They are the opposite of us.

896
00:54:54,832 --> 00:54:55,996
I saw his intentions.

897
00:54:56,129 --> 00:54:57,270
What is it?

898
00:54:57,645 --> 00:54:59,270
You were invited then,

899
00:55:03,285 --> 00:55:04,558
as the director said,

900
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:05,930
ten billion per person.

901
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:13,257
After researching, the head of
the West Incheon Police Department is your father?

902
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:14,493
Right?

903
00:55:15,054 --> 00:55:16,124
yes

904
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:20,444
Then you must know a lot about
the detectives in the western part of Incheon.

905
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:25,854
It's nothing.

906
00:55:26,334 --> 00:55:28,146
We are preparing a lawsuit.

907
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:29,857
This was delayed due to the trial.

908
00:55:30,724 --> 00:55:33,393
Illegal investigation, defamation.

909
00:55:33,467 --> 00:55:37,146
We will continue the lawsuit
against each of the detectives.

910
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,409
They underestimate
the big companies too much.

911
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:41,978
They have to get their payback.

912
00:55:42,259 --> 00:55:45,213
Please take care of that.

913
00:55:46,951 --> 00:55:48,560
Why me?

914
00:55:50,761 --> 00:55:54,701
It seems that the former head of the legal team
chose you because you needed the role.

915
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:57,133
but you didn't do
the role right.

916
00:55:57,195 --> 00:56:00,530
Instead, the company leaked
unfavorable information.

917
00:56:01,828 --> 00:56:03,594
I'm giving you a chance
to make up for it.

918
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:12,499
I'm thinking about
when to give this up,

919
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,098
but you gave me a reason.

920
00:56:16,925 --> 00:56:19,026
If you go out like
this, the ending will be bad.

921
00:56:19,561 --> 00:56:21,569
I recently
joined this team.

922
00:56:22,382 --> 00:56:25,722
So I can't
spoil this dirt on TJ.

923
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:26,909
However,

924
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:30,170
there is enough material to blow up
at least one of the team leaders.

925
00:56:31,312 --> 00:56:33,632
Want to see who
has the worse ending?

926
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:36,627
This is how I feel.

927
00:56:37,318 --> 00:56:40,240
Those who are dirty and disrespectful
should be treated even more dirty.

928
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:43,926
That way, you
know how bad it is.

929
00:56:57,800 --> 00:56:59,199
Please enjoy.

930
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:01,183
- Call me if you need to.
- Good.

931
00:57:02,633 --> 00:57:04,211
The business is selling well.

932
00:57:05,195 --> 00:57:06,679
Her business was going well.

933
00:57:06,741 --> 00:57:07,811
Right.

934
00:57:07,836 --> 00:57:09,296
Better than thought.

935
00:57:09,482 --> 00:57:12,341
The food is delicious and
also Eun-Hye works hard.

936
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:18,968
But I don't know,

937
00:57:19,782 --> 00:57:24,556
did she cut the raw chicken herself
and fry it or

938
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:29,018
Deep fry the chicken  after boiling it

939
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:33,344
I do not know about that.
Just ask Eun-Hye.

940
00:57:34,528 --> 00:57:35,708
Okey 

941
00:57:36,323 --> 00:57:39,448
I will come again and ask
when she has free time.

942
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:43,661
Why? Do you want to open a chicken shop too?

943
00:57:44,731 --> 00:57:46,169
I'm still thinking.

944
00:57:46,194 --> 00:57:50,986
But I don't think I
can skin the chicken.

945
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,367
When I was little I went to my grandmother's house.

946
00:57:55,716 --> 00:57:59,528
I had a trauma when I saw
grandma twist the neck of a raw chicken.

947
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,761
So now I can't eat chicken.

948
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,575
But if you think about it,

949
00:58:05,821 --> 00:58:07,305
looks like that I can eat them 

950
00:58:07,422 --> 00:58:08,524
Oh yes.

951
00:58:08,589 --> 00:58:10,112
Aren't you curious?

952
00:58:10,190 --> 00:58:11,237
What?

953
00:58:11,389 --> 00:58:14,842
That Jang Ki-Jin entrusted
forensics to the National Center,

954
00:58:15,159 --> 00:58:16,479
over there...

955
00:58:16,763 --> 00:58:20,103
It seems if pork can do it,
jokbal or samgyeopsal.

956
00:58:20,465 --> 00:58:22,473
It's impossible for us to handle
raw pork, right?

957
00:58:22,508 --> 00:58:26,559
Chairman. If this goes wrong, we have to
release Cheon Sang-Woo again.

958
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:29,848
Ouch, why are my ears
suddenly numb?

959
00:58:29,991 --> 00:58:31,499
I can't hear.

960
00:58:31,624 --> 00:58:33,265
I didn't hear anything.

961
00:58:33,331 --> 00:58:35,823
I didn't hear.

962
00:58:38,919 --> 00:58:42,192
Aren't cows better than pigs? Cows
have more servings than pork.

963
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:43,321
Better beef?

964
00:58:50,370 --> 00:58:57,372
Subtitles provided by : Summer Fouad

965
00:58:57,372 --> 00:58:58,521
Hey.

966
00:59:00,061 --> 00:59:02,279
Why don't you come in?

967
00:59:02,976 --> 00:59:04,140
Just because

968
00:59:49,374 --> 00:59:50,616
Dad

969
00:59:51,598 --> 00:59:52,707
Bo Kyung.

970
00:59:55,809 --> 00:59:58,582
Let's not talk today.

971
01:00:01,454 --> 01:00:04,025
We don't have to suffer
twice, do we?

972
01:00:08,926 --> 01:00:10,059
Ok

973
01:00:23,445 --> 01:00:27,517
TJ They're suing us?

974
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:29,111
Why?

975
01:00:29,369 --> 01:00:31,159
You guys are teasing TJ.

976
01:00:31,386 --> 01:00:34,315
Those people always give
back as much as they have suffered.

977
01:00:34,403 --> 01:00:35,653
You have to be prepared.

978
01:00:35,856 --> 01:00:37,571
They are really
scary people.

979
01:00:38,420 --> 01:00:39,936
What's there to be afraid of?

980
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:44,799
Being a detective is basically
dealing with scary people.

981
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:47,979
If you are sued, they can
take everything you have.

982
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:50,976
We are already poor. What
are they going to take?

983
01:00:51,927 --> 01:00:54,873
If you make a wrong move, you
can't even get promoted.

984
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:59,731
Detectives are so far away with promotions,
we just have to deal with cases.

985
01:00:59,923 --> 01:01:02,438
It can even
harm the family.

986
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:06,384
Speaking of family,
there is only one younger brother who is unemployed.

987
01:01:06,492 --> 01:01:09,172
there is only one way
to annoy him.

988
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:14,056
Get into the game he's
playing and pick up all his items.

989
01:01:15,142 --> 01:01:18,829
Then I'm
worrying about pointless things.

990
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:21,170
I go.

991
01:01:24,701 --> 01:01:26,364
Hey

992
01:01:26,412 --> 01:01:28,342
if you haven't eaten

993
01:01:28,375 --> 01:01:30,494
here is a
good restaurant, I'll treat.

994
01:01:30,519 --> 01:01:31,631
It's fine.

995
01:01:32,127 --> 01:01:34,783
You've got
nothing and no promotion intent,

996
01:01:34,808 --> 01:01:38,344
also there is an unemployed family
so how shall I accept your treat.

997
01:01:38,548 --> 01:01:39,985
Not good like that.

998
01:01:40,470 --> 01:01:41,728
I'll just go.

999
01:01:43,823 --> 01:01:45,027
Goodbye.

1000
01:01:45,152 --> 01:01:46,472
Am I being too honest?

1001
01:01:47,508 --> 01:01:48,867
Is she disappointed in me?

1002
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:50,599
What do you expect?

1003
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:53,564
You do all
the things girls hate.

1004
01:01:54,561 --> 01:01:56,475
Everything I've built is in vain.

1005
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:58,584
What are you arranging?

1006
01:01:59,553 --> 01:02:01,475
You don't have any of them arranged.

1007
01:02:04,212 --> 01:02:06,009
Should I take something else to eat?

1008
01:02:22,170 --> 01:02:26,174
Thank you for visiting
the Jung Hee-Joo Scholarship Foundation.

1009
01:02:26,220 --> 01:02:28,345
- Yes.
- We are grateful.

1010
01:02:28,405 --> 01:02:30,265
Please enjoy your time.

1011
01:02:32,862 --> 01:02:34,229
What's the intention?

1012
01:02:34,343 --> 01:02:36,093
What she intends to take

1013
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:38,129
moral responsibility for
Jung Hee-Joo's murder?

1014
01:02:38,497 --> 01:02:39,700
I do not know.

1015
01:02:41,789 --> 01:02:43,992
Please wait a moment. I'll let you go first.

1016
01:02:48,115 --> 01:02:49,831
- Welcome.
- Yes.

1017
01:02:49,870 --> 01:02:51,105
Hello

1018
01:02:51,222 --> 01:02:52,996
Thank you for the invitation.

1019
01:02:53,341 --> 01:02:55,317
It doesn't seem like
the right event for us.

1020
01:02:55,399 --> 01:02:57,032
- Why...
- Of course you should come.

1021
01:02:57,248 --> 01:03:00,380
You guys are the ones who revealed the truth
about Jung Hee-Joo's murder, right?

1022
01:03:00,405 --> 01:03:03,186
This is also a place to thank
you guys for your hard work.

1023
01:03:03,265 --> 01:03:04,436
Thank you?

1024
01:03:04,585 --> 01:03:06,624
-  Who us?
- Of course.

1025
01:03:06,649 --> 01:03:08,805
In particular, Detective Oh
saved me, didn't he?

1026
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,057
On that day.

1027
01:03:10,112 --> 01:03:12,276
The day my brother tried to kill me.

1028
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:15,722
That's my job as a detective.

1029
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:19,132
That's why I
like Detective Oh.

1030
01:03:19,157 --> 01:03:20,374
No personal feelings.

1031
01:03:21,162 --> 01:03:24,172
As said, do what
you have to do as a detective.

1032
01:03:24,201 --> 01:03:25,795
I just need that.

1033
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:46,134
It will return.

1034
01:03:54,656 --> 01:03:55,953
Yes, what is up?

1035
01:03:56,334 --> 01:04:01,013
TJ's group situation is serious.

1036
01:04:01,404 --> 01:04:03,755
For what reason
came to this situation?

1037
01:04:04,802 --> 01:04:06,365
To be honest,

1038
01:04:06,491 --> 01:04:11,307
this incident was caused by an
unfortunate accident in our family.

1039
01:04:11,416 --> 01:04:15,111
Former Chairman Cheon Seong-Dae, was sentenced
to prison at the first trial for corruption.

1040
01:04:15,141 --> 01:04:20,829
And you say that because
of the current president Cheon Sang-Woo,

1041
01:04:21,246 --> 01:04:25,808
who was recently arrested
as the mastermind of the murder?

1042
01:04:26,954 --> 01:04:28,212
I admit it.

1043
01:04:28,802 --> 01:04:32,443
But all of this was also
caused by me.

1044
01:04:33,397 --> 01:04:37,030
The reason I agreed to today's interview
is to reveal that fact.

1045
01:04:37,366 --> 01:04:41,947
Are you saying that
TJ's group crisis started with you?

1046
01:04:42,244 --> 01:04:43,322
Right.

1047
01:04:43,392 --> 01:04:44,955
Can you be more specific?

1048
01:04:45,352 --> 01:04:49,110
The reason former Chairman Cheon Seong-Dae
was involved in corruption and put on trial

1049
01:04:49,503 --> 01:04:50,659
actually

1050
01:04:50,979 --> 01:04:52,580
because I reported it.

1051
01:04:53,884 --> 01:04:56,598
The facts of Chairman Cheon
Sang-Woo's crimes are also revealed

1052
01:04:56,777 --> 01:05:00,355
because I submitted decisive evidence
to the investigative agency.

1053
01:05:00,676 --> 01:05:03,418
Why did you do that?
Aren't you the Cheon family?

1054
01:05:04,970 --> 01:05:08,009
TJ's crisis started a long time ago.

1055
01:05:08,065 --> 01:05:09,260
I just hid it.

1056
01:05:09,943 --> 01:05:15,392
I thought TJ would come back to life when
the hidden errors were cleared.

1057
01:05:15,692 --> 01:05:20,368
So do former presidents
and current presidents know about it?

1058
01:05:20,587 --> 01:05:21,626
Yes

1059
01:05:22,414 --> 01:05:25,711
But many misunderstood.

1060
01:05:26,121 --> 01:05:27,301
That...

1061
01:05:28,861 --> 01:05:32,353
I took revenge
for my mother who committed suicide.

1062
01:05:32,825 --> 01:05:34,481
That's the saddest thing.

1063
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:41,802
I bow my head apologizing
to the ex-employee TJ who is still working

1064
01:05:42,098 --> 01:05:47,571
in the field and to the shareholders
who trust and invest in TJ.

1065
01:05:50,256 --> 01:05:52,006
TJ will survive.

1066
01:05:53,065 --> 01:05:55,682
I promise to reflect on
all past mistakes

1067
01:05:55,752 --> 01:06:01,737
and reborn TJ as the
best company with my own hands.

1068
01:06:02,248 --> 01:06:03,702
I watched his broadcast.

1069
01:06:04,475 --> 01:06:07,007
I think you're shaking
hands too much, a lot of stocks are down.

1070
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:09,341
You will know if
you watch his broadcast.

1071
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:12,497
That I was the reporter who
sent the documents to the Blue House.

1072
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:16,276
I think there is a possibility.

1073
01:06:17,541 --> 01:06:19,650
But my doubting mind is bigger.

1074
01:06:21,215 --> 01:06:23,722
Team leader Woo Tae-Ho
sent over the documents he kept.

1075
01:06:24,569 --> 01:06:26,522
It's just a small branch of them.

1076
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:29,579
His body was separated,
in a deadly place.

1077
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:31,366
Why?

1078
01:06:31,866 --> 01:06:33,709
Did you speak
to the honorary chairman?

1079
01:06:34,163 --> 01:06:36,742
That he would present himself
as Michael Car's management.

1080
01:06:39,193 --> 01:06:41,404
He's like a doctor to TJ.

1081
01:06:41,429 --> 01:06:43,242
The savior of dying TJ.

1082
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:48,884
But no doctor can
save someone who is already dead.

1083
01:06:51,863 --> 01:06:53,566
Director, everything is ready.

1084
01:06:54,047 --> 01:06:56,249
Yes. I'll change my
makeup and come back.

1085
01:07:32,852 --> 01:07:36,720
The late Jung Hee-Joo
was a capable employee.

1086
01:07:37,190 --> 01:07:42,698
She is an employee who keeps her job
till the end and did her best.

1087
01:07:43,041 --> 01:07:46,463
So sad and
unbelievable,

1088
01:07:47,114 --> 01:07:49,864
but because of this wrong decision

1089
01:07:50,474 --> 01:07:52,068
She died

1090
01:07:53,002 --> 01:07:56,221
And her grandfather, who is
Jung Hee-Joo's only protector.

1091
01:07:56,561 --> 01:07:58,546
Is lying in the hospital.

1092
01:08:06,653 --> 01:08:12,619
We remember Jung Hee-Joo's bright smile.

1093
01:08:13,572 --> 01:08:14,720
What is hapenning ?

1094
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:16,056
Today we

1095
01:08:16,455 --> 01:08:19,096
with Jung Hee-Joo's unfair sacrifice

1096
01:08:19,622 --> 01:08:22,505
What is wrong with him? Is She sick?

1097
01:08:25,038 --> 01:08:27,038
Yes, this is Oh Ji-Hyeom
Incheon violence team.

1098
01:08:27,118 --> 01:08:29,672
The blood stains left on
Jung Hee-Joo's clothes were already there.

1099
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:31,150
The DNA matching is also complete.

1100
01:08:31,825 --> 01:08:32,950
I got it

1101
01:08:35,697 --> 01:08:38,650
It's been revealed whose blood
is on Jung Hee-Joo's clothes.

1102
01:08:39,052 --> 01:08:40,286
Who?

1103
01:08:41,822 --> 01:08:42,939
Cheon Na-Na.

1104
01:08:44,758 --> 01:08:49,499
At the establishment of the Jung Hee-
Joo Foundation, I would like to apologize to...

1105
01:09:30,490 --> 01:09:38,490

1110

What would you do?</i>

1111
01:09:47,805 --> 01:09:50,385
<i>This time Jang Ki-Jin really ran away.</i>

1112
01:09:50,410 --> 01:09:52,099

turn this situation around?</i>

1113
