1
00:00:02,927 --> 00:00:05,733
This program is for ages 15 and over
because it contains adult elements,

2
00:00:05,758 --> 00:00:07,503
violence, and the risk of imitation.

3
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:11,530
This program contains ads
indirect and virtual advertising.

4
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,675
All characters, names, events and more
in this drama is only fictitious.

5
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:26,607
Episode 4

6
00:00:48,922 --> 00:00:49,930
Yes.

7
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,765
I'm Oh Ji-Hyeok
from the Incheon West Office.

8
00:02:15,785 --> 00:02:16,818
There isn't any.

9
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,458
But it seems not too long ago
he was at his house.

10
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:20,796
The phone still hasn't been picked up?

11
00:02:21,736 --> 00:02:23,980
Seems abandoned.
His cell phone is off.

12
00:02:24,029 --> 00:02:24,772
Unlucky.

13
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,117
The village bus is just located crossing the highway.

14
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:31,973
- Where?
- Towards Ganghwado.

15
00:02:32,254 --> 00:02:33,300
Let's go!

16
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,191
He left his cell phone,

17
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:08,010
to avoid location tracking.

18
00:03:08,487 --> 00:03:11,116
It is clear, that
he is going to commit another crime.

19
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:13,362
He passed the toll gate
30 minutes ago,

20
00:03:13,387 --> 00:03:15,094
the longest golden time is one hour.

21
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:16,266
Then, right?

22
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,014
Journalist looking at black bag
a few days ago?

23
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,790
- Yes.
- But why,

24
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:24,092
did he expose himself?

25
00:03:24,117 --> 00:03:26,199
Because he knew
that we were looking for the owner of the bag.

26
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:28,217
He tried to divert the attention
to Choi Ho-Jun.

27
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:31,015
He used the same bag
as Choi Ho-Jun,

28
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,542
just in case.

29
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:00,031
Don't come in, everyone wait outside.

30
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,753
Uncle.

31
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:55,629
I am guilty.

32
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:58,862
At that time I was very drunk,

33
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,434
I will apologize.

34
00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:03,187
I will sincerely apologize.

35
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,754
Please, I beg you.

36
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,089
Good grief.

37
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:23,670
Why was the lipstick changed?

38
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:26,349
For me red is better.

39
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:39,253
Don't let anyone enter
until the Forensic Team arrives.

40
00:05:39,278 --> 00:05:40,333
Fine, I understand.

41
00:05:40,678 --> 00:05:42,165
Is there something inside?

42
00:05:42,727 --> 00:05:44,921
Just a few drops of blood on the floor.

43
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:46,781
Victim didn't die here.

44
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:50,016
- Have you asked headquarters for help?
- Yes, they are coming soon.

45
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:52,735
Not too long ago.

46
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:54,369
Come on. Before it gets too late.

47
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:01,438
Let's split up from here.

48
00:06:01,864 --> 00:06:02,911
Everyone,

49
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:05,214
you all should be careful.

50
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:07,002
He is holding a gun.

51
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,702
We're going up here.

52
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,380
- You guys go up there.
- Well.

53
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,813
Careful.

54
00:06:24,947 --> 00:06:26,000
I beg.

55
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,662
Don't be too scared.

56
00:06:30,296 --> 00:06:31,902
If you do what I ask,

57
00:06:32,036 --> 00:06:33,222
nothing will happen.

58
00:06:33,516 --> 00:06:35,922
I'm really guilty.

59
00:06:36,093 --> 00:06:38,379
Please forgive me just this once.

60
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,430
It's good that you understand your mistake.

61
00:06:43,017 --> 00:06:44,043
In that case,

62
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,348
will you let me go?

63
00:06:50,459 --> 00:06:52,252
- I'll let you go.
- Really?

64
00:06:55,605 --> 00:07:00,286
Okay, thank you.
Everything is totally my fault.

65
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:02,605
I'm going to really think about all of this.

66
00:07:02,865 --> 00:07:05,137
If I get out of here,

67
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:06,818
I will not report.

68
00:07:07,837 --> 00:07:10,163
Therefore, please let me go.

69
00:07:12,535 --> 00:07:14,355
If so, get up first.

70
00:07:14,789 --> 00:07:15,822
What?

71
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:19,073
I told you to get up.
Do not be like that. Fast.

72
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,562
- Turn around.
- What?

73
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,326
Turn around and tell me what you did wrong.

74
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:34,768
If I feel sincerity
in your words,

75
00:07:34,995 --> 00:07:36,602
I will let you go peacefully.

76
00:07:42,619 --> 00:07:45,739
So, tell me what you did wrong.

77
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,403
Never turn around. Start.

78
00:07:50,616 --> 00:07:51,696
At that time,

79
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:53,868
I was too pushy.

80
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,427
I was too late to ring the bell.

81
00:07:57,677 --> 00:07:59,949
I blamed you.

82
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,991
you  stopped,
but i didn't go down.

83
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:05,387
I spoke very rudely to you.

84
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,443
For that I am very sorry.

85
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:12,960
Again.

86
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,660
Again.

87
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:18,440
You have to say till I say stop

88
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,195
Yes.

89
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:22,142
I only thought about myself.

90
00:08:22,289 --> 00:08:24,089
I only harm other people.

91
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:29,336
In the future I will never
ignore others.

92
00:08:30,325 --> 00:08:31,919
I really will live well.

93
00:08:32,923 --> 00:08:37,697
Please let me go,
just this once, please.

94
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,222
- Hurry up and run!
- Well!

95
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,753
- Run!
- Go after him!

96
00:09:48,555 --> 00:09:49,718
Help!

97
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,530
Help!

98
00:10:20,802 --> 00:10:22,721
Shut up.

99
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:26,581
Shut up.

100
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:40,034
I have to finish it.

101
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:45,999
Lee Sung-Gon!

102
00:10:53,807 --> 00:10:55,567
- Miss!
- Are you okay?

103
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:00,167
How?

104
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:01,761
Still alive.

105
00:11:02,153 --> 00:11:03,840
Hurry up and pick up the victim.

106
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,319
Well.

107
00:11:07,258 --> 00:11:09,284
The victim has been rescued
and the perpetrator fled.

108
00:11:09,536 --> 00:11:10,804
Block all roads on the mountain,

109
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,631
send all the remaining forces to the mountain.

110
00:11:16,238 --> 00:11:17,637
Where is she?

111
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:19,184
Check well.

112
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:45,938
Sis.

113
00:11:46,459 --> 00:11:47,511
- Fast.
- Yes.

114
00:12:29,418 --> 00:12:30,458
Hey.

115
00:12:33,746 --> 00:12:34,766
Where?

116
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,446
Who are you? Hey!

117
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,705
Come forward.

118
00:12:49,096 --> 00:12:50,536
- Who are you?
- Raise your hands.

119
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:52,555
What is it?

120
00:12:52,922 --> 00:12:55,142
Don't move and raise your hand!

121
00:12:57,738 --> 00:13:00,011
Don't move and raise your hand!

122
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,548
This guy.

123
00:13:03,168 --> 00:13:05,254
I understand.

124
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,134
But what is this?

125
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:08,902
I don't...

126
00:13:09,075 --> 00:13:10,215
I...

127
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,824
Just slowly.

128
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:16,310
I have done nothing wrong.

129
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,547
Lee Sung-Gon has been caught.

130
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,614
Have arrived.

131
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:22,308
- Get out of the way.
- Please step aside everyone.

132
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:24,949
Hurry up and film him!

133
00:13:25,026 --> 00:13:27,026
- Fast.
- Don't push.

134
00:13:27,053 --> 00:13:28,140
Wait a moment.

135
00:13:28,207 --> 00:13:30,110
- Get out of the way.
- He's already caught.

136
00:13:30,148 --> 00:13:31,749
He's caught!

137
00:13:33,196 --> 00:13:34,915
What's your reason for doing it?

138
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:36,850
Is this imitation
from a serial murder case?

139
00:13:36,867 --> 00:13:39,035
What does this have to do with the previous case?

140
00:13:55,461 --> 00:13:56,527
Lee Sung-Gon.

141
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,179
Don't be ridiculous.

142
00:14:05,634 --> 00:14:06,674
You're sane, right?

143
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:10,751
Yes.

144
00:14:11,086 --> 00:14:12,446
Did you do that on purpose?

145
00:14:16,754 --> 00:14:17,527
This...

146
00:14:18,247 --> 00:14:19,701
Where is this?

147
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:21,727
It's not home.

148
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:25,926
Uncle, who are you?

149
00:14:26,306 --> 00:14:27,385
You don't know me?

150
00:14:29,038 --> 00:14:31,351
We seem to have met before.

151
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:39,789
- Still not awake?
- It's cold.

152
00:14:42,537 --> 00:14:43,691
Lee Sung-Gon.

153
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,577
Don't make a show.

154
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:48,756
You rode the bus
and took the woman to the mountains.

155
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:51,286
You fled in the mountains.

156
00:14:51,505 --> 00:14:54,396
It's something that can't be done
unless you're a smart person.

157
00:14:54,872 --> 00:14:56,585
Do not play around.

158
00:14:57,945 --> 00:14:59,312
I,

159
00:15:00,437 --> 00:15:04,464
looks like I made a mistake again.

160
00:15:06,047 --> 00:15:07,127
In fact,

161
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:10,219
what did i do wrong?

162
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:14,828
This lunatic really...

163
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,213
The result is positive.

164
00:15:21,267 --> 00:15:22,747
He really did.

165
00:15:28,497 --> 00:15:29,604
Oh I remembered,

166
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,033
It turned out to be like this because of the girl.

167
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,909
Uncle, don't believe her words.

168
00:15:36,114 --> 00:15:38,607
She's the one who made me who I am now.

169
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:39,535
Yes?

170
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:41,443
She asked for money.

171
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,890
'Cause I look stupid,

172
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:47,254
She made it look like i did.

173
00:15:47,325 --> 00:15:50,764
This is not the first time
I was abused like that.

174
00:15:52,823 --> 00:15:53,456
Good grief.

175
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,230
This fool.

176
00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:58,555
Don't drag girls
who were harassed by you.

177
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:00,782
How can it come out of a human mouth?

178
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:02,643
You're worse than an animal!

179
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:04,323
Hold on, Detective.

180
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:06,407
What would you do if there is a problem?

181
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,474
What is the problem?

182
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:10,511
What's the problem with treating this criminal
like animals?

183
00:16:10,536 --> 00:16:12,664
Why to treat this criminal
like humans?

184
00:16:13,568 --> 00:16:15,101
Detective Kwon's words were right.

185
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:19,344
This person is moving
by calculating all the possibilities.

186
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,810
Later he will state that he is forced to confess and he is
mentally and physically weak.

187
00:16:28,467 --> 00:16:29,820
Take it slow.

188
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,099
Ignore time,

189
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:35,671
very slowly.

190
00:17:06,638 --> 00:17:09,298
Who the hell is this detective?

191
00:17:12,213 --> 00:17:13,333
Wants to play with me?

192
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,370
Shit.

193
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,409
That stupid detective.

194
00:17:46,588 --> 00:17:48,475
I'm Lee Sung-Gon!

195
00:17:49,053 --> 00:17:51,687
Lee Sung-Gon, you fools!

196
00:18:02,502 --> 00:18:03,761
Can you please pour me some coffee?

197
00:18:16,226 --> 00:18:18,253
- Are you getting better?
- Yes.

198
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,202
What hurts?

199
00:18:24,361 --> 00:18:25,514
Just because it hurts.

200
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,264
What hurts? Because of what?

201
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:30,004
'It always hurts.

202
00:18:33,373 --> 00:18:35,187
You feel burdened because I'm worried?

203
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:38,442
You know I've been tired lately.
Why ask that?

204
00:18:40,387 --> 00:18:41,807
You met him?

205
00:18:41,921 --> 00:18:43,390
Not anything special.

206
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:45,115
We met and did nothing.

207
00:18:45,861 --> 00:18:47,827
Just talked about college days and how we separated.

208
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:57,911
That person is the director of McQueen Korea.
He's involved with us.

209
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:00,344
To me he is just a college friend.

210
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:03,809
This is a sensitive period.
You have to be careful.

211
00:19:03,945 --> 00:19:05,459
Why should I be careful?

212
00:19:05,949 --> 00:19:07,661
What do you mean? someone suspects me?

213
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,268
Deputy Director Cheon Sang-Woo?

214
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,150
I waited for you all night.

215
00:19:15,844 --> 00:19:17,630
Waited for you until morning and called you many times.

216
00:19:17,834 --> 00:19:20,000
"I'm sick. It seems I
Can't go to the office."

217
00:19:20,767 --> 00:19:21,947
That's all you said.

218
00:19:22,798 --> 00:19:24,011
You told me to wait.

219
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:26,357
but you,

220
00:19:26,657 --> 00:19:28,469
just arrived now
after two days had passed.

221
00:19:28,737 --> 00:19:30,463
should not you explain something?

222
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:34,088
That's right Deputy Director Cheon Sang-Woo, right?

223
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:36,574
He told you to watch over me?

224
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,259
I asked,

225
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:42,161
Explain to me
so I can accept it.

226
00:19:43,867 --> 00:19:45,067
I asked,

227
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,600
Did the person who ordered to watch over me
is Cheon Sang-Woo?

228
00:19:52,058 --> 00:19:53,126
No.

229
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,537
Brother is a person who is
always suspicious of me.

230
00:20:03,736 --> 00:20:06,056
When I was little when I just held a fork
on the dining table,

231
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:09,437
He suspected me of killing him
with that fork.

232
00:20:09,984 --> 00:20:11,171
Just because,

233
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:14,781
I am different from him and Mother.

234
00:20:15,619 --> 00:20:17,346
Now erase those past memories.

235
00:20:19,142 --> 00:20:21,145
This is a crisis situation.
We must support each other.

236
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:23,242
When I was in middle school,

237
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:26,613
You know why I ran away to America?

238
00:20:31,723 --> 00:20:34,697
Every night that person came to me
and suffocated me.

239
00:20:46,842 --> 00:20:49,388
Who else is in this house,
that I can talk about these things to?

240
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,853
I only have you.

241
00:20:56,258 --> 00:20:57,385
Thanks for the coffee.

242
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,617
Sorry for not being able to call you.

243
00:21:04,334 --> 00:21:05,414
Because suddenly I became sick.

244
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:07,493
There is no other explanation.

245
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:16,143
Too bad, Jung Hee-Ju died.

246
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:20,458
She was working well
and was a smart kid.

247
00:21:23,032 --> 00:21:24,999
But you must be more disappointed
than me.

248
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,167
Woo Tae-Ho

249
00:21:38,127 --> 00:21:40,400
She was working well
and was a smart kid.

250
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,885
But you must be more disappointed
than me.

251
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,765
Chairman.

252
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:55,628
Are you sure, you
got rid of that notebook?

253
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:58,415
Yes.

254
00:21:58,621 --> 00:22:00,774
I went out by car
and dumped it in the Han River.

255
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,384
Good work.

256
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:06,665
No outsiders should know about this.

257
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,327
Only the two of us know, 
Understand?

258
00:22:10,808 --> 00:22:11,847
Yes.

259
00:22:14,485 --> 00:22:16,339
Sorry to trouble you.

260
00:22:18,002 --> 00:22:19,299
Want to have dinner together?

261
00:22:19,868 --> 00:22:20,935
Not.

262
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,470
Today I have an appointment.

263
00:22:24,844 --> 00:22:26,766
All right, you can go.

264
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,870
Why did you trust me
with an important task like this?

265
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:34,816
Because I trust you.

266
00:22:45,731 --> 00:22:46,998
Yes, Vice Chairman?

267
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,749
Fine, I'm coming upstairs.

268
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,625
Did you find out what
what is Na-Na doing lately?

269
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,472
Her body hurts a little.

270
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,017
So, she has no time
to worry about something else.

271
00:23:17,382 --> 00:23:19,669
Who? You or Na-Na?

272
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:21,301
Na-Na?

273
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,940
Na-Na said like that? She Can not
do anything because of pain?

274
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,335
Not like that. It's because of me who
always pay attention to her.

275
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:31,451
- Are you sure?
- Yes I am sure.

276
00:23:37,715 --> 00:23:41,128
You really think you can
fully understand Na-Na?

277
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,693
Na-Na, She is..

278
00:23:47,572 --> 00:23:50,863
You won't know even though
she's lying.

279
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:55,435
After that, she will ask you
believe it's true.

280
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,906
I didn't even know when I was a kid,

281
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:03,684
Only I was insulted and questioned
for touching a sick person.

282
00:24:08,347 --> 00:24:09,950
Don't believe her words.

283
00:24:10,735 --> 00:24:13,582
Keep an eye on what she's doing.

284
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,758
That's the truth about Na-Na.

285
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,394
Yes?

286
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,941
Welcome. You want some coffee?

287
00:24:46,505 --> 00:24:47,616
Thank you

288
00:24:56,513 --> 00:24:58,446
You remember back then?

289
00:24:59,348 --> 00:25:00,901
About two years ago.

290
00:25:02,207 --> 00:25:06,340
When my brother got into an accident, a detective met Tae-Ho.

291
00:25:07,239 --> 00:25:08,342
You know that detective?

292
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:11,444
Yes, my department mate.

293
00:25:12,611 --> 00:25:14,556
That's right, he's my friend.

294
00:25:14,843 --> 00:25:17,570
I remember him because he was so handsome
for a detective.

295
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,229
But, why is he still around?

296
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,958
Is it because he wants to find something about me?

297
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,747
I'll find out about it.

298
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:29,189
Yes, even though he won't answer
when you ask him.

299
00:25:30,229 --> 00:25:31,351
I'm a little worried.

300
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:34,880
No need to worry.
I'll clean it up.

301
00:25:38,712 --> 00:25:43,639
This is the card we have to hold
to get what the Chairman wants.

302
00:25:45,089 --> 00:25:47,015
This can't be shown
to anyone.

303
00:25:47,881 --> 00:25:50,054
- You know, right?
- Yes I know.

304
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:54,855
The cup is pretty, isn't it?

305
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,020
The president gave me this first.

306
00:25:58,123 --> 00:26:00,487
He bought it directly from Japan
and brought it here.

307
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,111
He didn't give the cup
to anyone.

308
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:06,802
Maybe you already know.

309
00:26:06,849 --> 00:26:10,430
Our legal team is responsible for
all litigation related to the company.

310
00:26:11,094 --> 00:26:13,300
In addition, one of the 
most important task is,

311
00:26:13,858 --> 00:26:15,638
to protect the privacy of the head of the family.

312
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:16,911
Well.

313
00:26:17,209 --> 00:26:21,353
Incidentally, there is one thing that can only
done by you.

314
00:26:22,073 --> 00:26:25,226
But, I can't understand 
my job well yet.

315
00:26:26,569 --> 00:26:29,869
This is the first task given to you
who just had an internship.

316
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:34,369
Your achievements on this task will
be your standard of judgement.

317
00:26:37,447 --> 00:26:39,306
I don't know if you
already know or not.

318
00:26:39,911 --> 00:26:43,311
The legal team's official duties are still pending.

319
00:26:44,203 --> 00:26:47,064
This is due to the approval of the superior  which is still not set.

320
00:26:49,475 --> 00:26:51,618
Yes. Leave it to me, Chief.

321
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:53,382
I will do it
no matter how.

322
00:26:53,407 --> 00:26:54,440
Okay.

323
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:57,127
It's a simple job.
No need to feel burdened.

324
00:26:57,299 --> 00:26:58,332
Well.

325
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:01,843
Police are still looking for evidence
left by the perpetrator.

326
00:27:02,473 --> 00:27:05,001
According to officers, the perpetrator tried to kill
with the same technique,

327
00:27:05,026 --> 00:27:07,128
like a white dress serial killer.

328
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,571
However, the police have not confirmed
officially if this crime,

329
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,928
is a clone of white dress serial murder case.

330
00:27:19,872 --> 00:27:20,974
Are you awake?

331
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:26,029
Why did you do it?

332
00:27:26,182 --> 00:27:28,543
Why did you kill the girls
so horribly?

333
00:27:28,816 --> 00:27:29,916
What is your reason?

334
00:27:30,186 --> 00:27:31,726
What are you talking about?

335
00:27:32,701 --> 00:27:35,310
- I never did that.
- I saw you in the forest.

336
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:40,447
I saw you with my own eyes,
You were pointing the knife at the victim.

337
00:27:42,973 --> 00:27:45,758
Sorry, I don't remember it at all.

338
00:27:46,084 --> 00:27:48,437
I admit I took the drug.

339
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:50,494
I must've been crazy.

340
00:27:50,773 --> 00:27:53,460
But, after taking it
I don't remember anything. This is serious.

341
00:27:54,111 --> 00:27:56,302
He really is shameless.

342
00:27:57,288 --> 00:28:00,168
He doesn't even remember
banging his head.

343
00:28:00,241 --> 00:28:01,494
Since when have you been taking it?

344
00:28:04,216 --> 00:28:08,381
Honestly, I can't remember anything.

345
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:10,639
Just check the bus CCTV.

346
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,668
How messed up there.

347
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,775
I also saw all the passengers.

348
00:28:15,906 --> 00:28:17,912
Since it was me, I held back.

349
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,401
If only it was someone else,
he would definitely run out.

350
00:28:24,218 --> 00:28:25,471
Just look at the CCTV.

351
00:28:26,981 --> 00:28:28,641
You all must be angry.

352
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:33,972
Such people
must be taught a lesson.

353
00:28:34,339 --> 00:28:37,418
So that they know what they did wrong.

354
00:28:37,916 --> 00:28:40,087
To give some
rebellious girl lesson,

355
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:42,982
You gave her drugs and kidnapped her.

356
00:28:43,691 --> 00:28:44,737
Yes.

357
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:47,670
But, why are did you put a
White gown on the victim?

358
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,041
and put on lipstick?

359
00:28:53,131 --> 00:28:54,599
I did that?

360
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,767
I must've gone crazy.

361
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:01,078
Why did I do it?

362
00:29:01,726 --> 00:29:04,843
I saw it on the news show.

363
00:29:05,683 --> 00:29:08,456
I saw it and thought
if i imitate it,

364
00:29:09,572 --> 00:29:12,259
it would be much scarier.
Like that.

365
00:29:13,744 --> 00:29:18,271
She would be scared if she knows how can I kill her.

366
00:29:21,311 --> 00:29:23,531
That's why you banged your head,

367
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:27,007
To try to buy time, right?

368
00:29:27,409 --> 00:29:29,555
Did you change your mind after being arrested?

369
00:29:31,414 --> 00:29:33,874
You don't like Kim Hyeong-Bok
become a serial killer, right?

370
00:29:35,734 --> 00:29:37,674
That's why you were dragging
Park Seon-Mi's body.

371
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:39,733
to the scene of Jung Hee-Joo's murder.

372
00:29:40,048 --> 00:29:42,134
To let us know that
you are the real culprit.

373
00:29:45,734 --> 00:29:47,954
Because you have to
be the main character.

374
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,131
But, someone else
became main character.

375
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,200
It is not like that?

376
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,060
You're not too late.

377
00:29:56,398 --> 00:29:58,018
Tell me with pride.

378
00:29:59,287 --> 00:30:01,094
Get everything out of your head.

379
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:04,363
Say everything to the police.

380
00:30:07,901 --> 00:30:08,967
You...

381
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:14,976
are Not someone who imitates
other people's crimes.

382
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,096
Has the culprit been caught?

383
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:27,293
What?

384
00:30:28,205 --> 00:30:31,992
Like I said, the man with the bag
on the bus was the culprit.

385
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,815
You could not catch him
until now?

386
00:30:36,601 --> 00:30:39,573
Turns out you couldn't catch him.

387
00:30:44,076 --> 00:30:46,780
Detective, Team Leader
Seoul Investigation team came.

388
00:30:46,978 --> 00:30:48,081
What?

389
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,045
What are you doing here? Hey?

390
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:01,309
You're the same as putting a spoon on the table when the whole table is ready.

391
00:31:01,438 --> 00:31:05,478
This means we will take
the whole table, not just the spoons.

392
00:31:05,848 --> 00:31:08,249
You said it well.

393
00:31:08,274 --> 00:31:09,627
What did you say?

394
00:31:10,975 --> 00:31:12,308
How did you deal with the suspect?

395
00:31:12,428 --> 00:31:15,001
Not a suspect, but
criminal on the spot.

396
00:31:15,483 --> 00:31:17,476
- Perpetrator.
- I don't have time for jokes.

397
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,985
I'll just say what I mean.

398
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:21,148
Just hand it over.

399
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:23,877
We will not be responsible for
bad suspect management

400
00:31:25,032 --> 00:31:26,781
You have a conscience
which is very bad.

401
00:31:27,058 --> 00:31:28,871
Still, you guys
from the Gwangsu area of ​​Seoul.

402
00:31:29,151 --> 00:31:30,804
- Aren't you cowards?
- What did you say?

403
00:31:31,273 --> 00:31:32,306
Hey.

404
00:31:33,678 --> 00:31:37,591
Just because we took over,
doesn't mean we're going to let it go.

405
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:41,260
Give us some time to investigate
before sending it to the prosecutor's office.

406
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:44,020
You think we can't write
investigation report?

407
00:31:44,045 --> 00:31:46,694
It will all be done with one hand
while typing on the keyboard.

408
00:31:47,777 --> 00:31:48,997
Just take Lee Sung-Gon.

409
00:31:50,468 --> 00:31:51,515
Detective!

410
00:31:51,844 --> 00:31:53,397
When the staff from there is assigned,

411
00:31:53,702 --> 00:31:55,329
into the office, except for our team.

412
00:31:55,358 --> 00:31:57,924
Submit all the evidences
to their team.

413
00:31:58,662 --> 00:32:00,468
No, why do we do that?

414
00:32:00,968 --> 00:32:04,128
Anyone can see their tyranny from a far.

415
00:32:04,178 --> 00:32:05,484
Forget it.

416
00:32:05,997 --> 00:32:08,130
They are also working hard for months,
can't go home

417
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:11,343
and can't sleep properly
to catch the suspect.

418
00:32:11,686 --> 00:32:13,305
They had to meet him in person.

419
00:32:13,665 --> 00:32:16,571
But there is a prerequisite.

420
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:22,050
Lee Sung-Gon is really the culprit.

421
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:23,907
Admit it.

422
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:28,042
And to Kim Hyeong-Bok and his mother
that you have made a suspect,

423
00:32:29,181 --> 00:32:30,517
apologize officially.

424
00:32:33,055 --> 00:32:34,075
Yes.

425
00:32:36,685 --> 00:32:37,765
Let's go.

426
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:48,979
Legal Team, Moon Bo-Kyung

427
00:32:49,014 --> 00:32:51,899
I heard there was a 
big accident two years ago.

428
00:32:52,466 --> 00:32:53,506
Then?

429
00:32:53,632 --> 00:32:57,858
I heard you've been suffering lately of
psychological stress as a result.

430
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:00,486
Our legal team will help you.

431
00:33:01,105 --> 00:33:03,012
- Why?
- Honestly, because I'm a new employee

432
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:04,878
I can not explain it
in detail.

433
00:33:05,343 --> 00:33:09,157
It seems you know the reason better than all of usm

434
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:12,872
What should I do?

435
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,683
Our legal team

436
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:18,726
will take legal actioj on behalf of you, Kim Min-Ji.

437
00:33:18,916 --> 00:33:21,716
The contents are compiled by our team of lawyers.

438
00:33:21,972 --> 00:33:23,979
After you agree and
sign it, we will

439
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:26,306
take it to court immediately.

440
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,703
It's about victims of psychological stress feeling threatened.

441
00:33:29,996 --> 00:33:35,055
The culprit is Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok
from the Incheon west office, right?

442
00:33:37,382 --> 00:33:38,719
What did the doctor say?

443
00:33:39,428 --> 00:33:42,588
I can't wait until later,
give it asap.

444
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:44,805
He looked fine.

445
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,760
Excuse me, Detective.

446
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:50,082
- What's the matter, sir?
- I saw the news.

447
00:33:50,385 --> 00:33:51,985
That says you caught the culprit?

448
00:33:52,294 --> 00:33:54,574
- Is he the culprit?
- Still don't know.

449
00:33:54,919 --> 00:33:58,118
This is still an investigation.
Go home, I'll call you later.

450
00:33:58,421 --> 00:34:01,669
Hey, let me see him.

451
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,865
I said it's still under investigation.

452
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:06,339
If you are like this, it will be slower.

453
00:34:07,743 --> 00:34:10,736
Fine, I'll wait until it's done.

454
00:34:11,108 --> 00:34:12,554
We don't know when it will be finished.

455
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:15,795
Please just go home,
I will call you.

456
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:18,406
Right now I can only do this.

457
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,667
Please let me wait here.

458
00:34:23,028 --> 00:34:24,397
Do what you want.

459
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:44,377
Sir, family and relatives can't
meet the suspect according to law.

460
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:46,537
I am not doing anything.

461
00:34:46,849 --> 00:34:48,782
I just want to know.

462
00:34:49,226 --> 00:34:51,593
Is it true that he killed her
and what is the reason. Only that.

463
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,240
I told you not to.

464
00:34:53,295 --> 00:34:55,428
Don't frustrate us and go home.

465
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,184
Good grief.

466
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,450
What do you think, Detective?

467
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:02,521
Is he really the killer of my grand daughter  Hee-Joo?

468
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:05,099
You should stop,

469
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,213
why are old people like you bothering me?

470
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,510
That child is my grand daughter.

471
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:12,354
It wasn't just your grand daughter who died.

472
00:35:14,891 --> 00:35:16,470
I'll be announcing it to the press soon.

473
00:35:16,925 --> 00:35:17,945
Just look at that.

474
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:29,739
Watch it. If he continues to insist,
accuse him of obstructing the investigation.

475
00:35:31,252 --> 00:35:32,498
Grandpa.

476
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,955
This is not a place to be
visited by the public for a long time.

477
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:37,225
Yes.

478
00:35:38,213 --> 00:35:39,273
Okay.

479
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,700
Hey.

480
00:35:50,987 --> 00:35:53,207
Why leave it to them?

481
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,164
From the start, this was their case.

482
00:35:55,193 --> 00:35:58,900
How could I not let them
with something to their detriment?

483
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,789
Hey, now the Chief has
really woke up.

484
00:36:00,814 --> 00:36:02,597
I'm just rehearsing for a press conference.

485
00:36:02,622 --> 00:36:05,851
How do I tell him
that the case was submitted to Seoul team?

486
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:07,473
Then you pretend not to know.

487
00:36:08,456 --> 00:36:10,849
Just follow me.

488
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,901
I'll take care of the rest.

489
00:36:15,856 --> 00:36:16,895
Hey, Oh Ji-Hyeok.

490
00:36:17,305 --> 00:36:18,952
Call me after five minutes.

491
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,956
No big problem
in investigation, right?

492
00:36:22,983 --> 00:36:25,413
Of course, gathering
evidences is going well.

493
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,066
The motive for the murder will soon be revealed.

494
00:36:27,142 --> 00:36:28,415
It's only a matter of time.

495
00:36:28,518 --> 00:36:29,551
Okay.

496
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,628
Do-Chang.

497
00:36:32,454 --> 00:36:35,621
In my cop life,
I'm lucky to meet you.

498
00:36:36,261 --> 00:36:37,648
Thank you, Kang Do-Chang.

499
00:36:38,182 --> 00:36:40,895
Gosh, what are you saying.

500
00:36:41,069 --> 00:36:43,076
It's all thanks to you.

501
00:36:46,675 --> 00:36:47,728
Yes, Ji-Hyeok?

502
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:50,210
What?

503
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:52,713
What?

504
00:36:54,722 --> 00:36:56,469
What do you mean?

505
00:36:57,205 --> 00:36:59,505
All right, hold them tight.

506
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:02,021
- These kids really.
- Why?

507
00:37:02,107 --> 00:37:06,627
Does it make sense they would take
The Lee Sung-Gon we caught?

508
00:37:06,748 --> 00:37:08,455
- What?
- What is the reason?

509
00:37:08,496 --> 00:37:11,016
Where's the reason? They are blinded
by special events.

510
00:37:11,722 --> 00:37:13,369
I will slash them all.

511
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:14,908
Take it easy.

512
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,113
Let's talk to the Chairman first,

513
00:37:17,208 --> 00:37:20,914
The chief, we must need to tell.

514
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:23,977
Right, I was only thinking about myself.

515
00:37:24,278 --> 00:37:27,901
Chairman. please contact seop
Gwangsu team and file a complaint.

516
00:37:28,378 --> 00:37:30,998
- I?
- We were made to be like fools.

517
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:32,372
Right, Chief.

518
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,531
We are seen as a nursing home.

519
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:36,936
You have to protest this.

520
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:40,348
Yes alright.

521
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:46,050
But, Seoul team captain is younger than me.

522
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:47,854
But He is taller than me.

523
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:50,303
Then talk to the Director.
This is not fair.

524
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,305
- Meet directly with the Director.
- Director?

525
00:37:54,038 --> 00:37:56,184
Chief, this is not just a problem of
our criminal team,

526
00:37:56,209 --> 00:37:58,444
but also the pride of Incheon.

527
00:37:58,823 --> 00:38:03,509
You should discuss this
directly with the Director.

528
00:38:03,632 --> 00:38:06,512
Truly. That is right.

529
00:38:09,387 --> 00:38:13,550
But, we are not handing it over to
foreign police. But, our police.

530
00:38:13,882 --> 00:38:15,975
This is not something that
interesting right?

531
00:38:16,017 --> 00:38:18,524
Chief, you can't be so weak.

532
00:38:18,561 --> 00:38:21,861
Bong-Sik, at a time like this
we have to calm down.

533
00:38:21,898 --> 00:38:25,598
Chief, this is related
with our team's special promotion.

534
00:38:25,627 --> 00:38:27,347
You have to protect us.

535
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:28,964
All members believe in you.

536
00:38:29,007 --> 00:38:31,571
Fine, I understand. I understand!

537
00:38:32,837 --> 00:38:36,671
I'll take care of it, you can go.

538
00:38:37,072 --> 00:38:40,969
Chief, this could be a stain
on the history of West Incheon.

539
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:42,090
- Bong-Sik.
- Yes?

540
00:38:42,285 --> 00:38:44,311
The chairman said he would take care of it.

541
00:38:45,409 --> 00:38:46,495
Okay.

542
00:38:47,525 --> 00:38:49,216
We only have you, Chief.

543
00:38:49,241 --> 00:38:50,544
For us, Chief...

544
00:38:50,706 --> 00:38:53,666
Enough. Shut your mouth and stop.

545
00:38:54,634 --> 00:38:55,888
In that case, okay.

546
00:38:56,213 --> 00:39:00,093
Then, we are trusting you and saying goodbye.

547
00:39:00,276 --> 00:39:02,949
- Chief, cheer up!
- Okay.

548
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:05,197
- Spirit!
- Go.

549
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:08,449
- We have to give advice.
- Already.

550
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,410
- You're great.
- Great?

551
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,106
Let's go.

552
00:39:16,763 --> 00:39:18,337
Damn, these kids.

553
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,321
That's called stealing.

554
00:39:24,459 --> 00:39:26,639
- What did the Chief say?
- was he so noisy?

555
00:39:26,737 --> 00:39:28,504
Of course it was very noisy.

556
00:39:28,853 --> 00:39:32,573
We're so tired,
but the case was taken away

557
00:39:32,606 --> 00:39:34,414
Hey, everyone.

558
00:39:34,925 --> 00:39:39,364
It's in the palm of my hand.
I cleaned it up neatly.

559
00:39:39,675 --> 00:39:41,623
If the Chairman says otherwise, talk to me.

560
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:44,147
The chairman is mine from now on.

561
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:47,416
Have you contacted Sung-Gon's company?

562
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:49,489
Yes, recently someone was looking for it.

563
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:51,933
- I want to go over to him.
- Okay then.

564
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:54,650
Ji-Hyeok, there's an incoming call.

565
00:39:56,995 --> 00:39:58,265
Yes, with Oh Ji-Hyeok.

566
00:39:58,682 --> 00:39:59,749
Yes?

567
00:40:00,475 --> 00:40:01,847
Is this urgent?

568
00:40:02,397 --> 00:40:04,569
Then, let's meet for a moment.
Where is the place?

569
00:40:04,673 --> 00:40:07,673
Yes I know. See you later.

570
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,925
Who's that? His voice seems to be heard a lot.

571
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:15,292
Who? People related
with our case?

572
00:40:15,629 --> 00:40:17,016
Chairman Sang-Beom's daughter.

573
00:40:17,608 --> 00:40:19,155
Ah right, her voice.

574
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,554
I will be out for a bit, about 30 minutes.

575
00:40:21,579 --> 00:40:23,223
Fine, go. Hey!

576
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:28,493
Treat her well, she is chairman's daughter,
 We will end up facing problem if something happens.

577
00:40:28,609 --> 00:40:29,382
Especially...

578
00:40:29,646 --> 00:40:34,311
Your suspicious gaze, be careful.
It's the most dangerous.

579
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,216
Yes.

580
00:40:37,466 --> 00:40:38,506
You are crazy.

581
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:42,910
Brother,

582
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:46,333
Never mind, what if you are not the one she mentioned as handsome.

583
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,400
Hey!

584
00:40:47,516 --> 00:40:50,096
I've been close to her
not Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok.

585
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:53,746
Ah right, I saw Oh Ji-Hyeok
in front of the chicken restaurant.

586
00:40:53,870 --> 00:40:55,697
- Right, I saw it.
- Is that true?

587
00:40:55,779 --> 00:40:58,739
I carried her,
Ji-Hyeok only looked at her for a moment.

588
00:41:01,967 --> 00:41:07,181
It's hard to talk to me directly,
so she asked the people around me?

589
00:41:08,357 --> 00:41:10,644
You think I don't know women?
Women are like that.

590
00:41:10,735 --> 00:41:16,597
Man-Goo, in terms of face, who is superior
Kwon Jae-Hong or Oh Ji-Hyeok?

591
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:18,604
Definitely Oh Ji-Hyeok,
no competition.

592
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:22,071
It's because you don't know, woman
actually prefer a face like mine.

593
00:41:22,451 --> 00:41:24,024
This is the reality.

594
00:41:24,425 --> 00:41:26,365
- You are crazy.
- Get to your sense.

595
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,333
Hello.

596
00:41:40,598 --> 00:41:41,766
Yes, hello.

597
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,859
What is it?

598
00:41:48,425 --> 00:41:52,363
Are you really Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok?

599
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:54,548
Yes, I'm Oh Ji-Hyeok.

600
00:41:57,039 --> 00:41:59,646
I'm currently investigating a case,
so I don't have much time.

601
00:41:59,774 --> 00:42:01,081
Please get straight to the point.

602
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:08,362
This, please confirm.

603
00:42:08,586 --> 00:42:12,199
If you approach Kim Min-Ji one more time,
call her or send an email,

604
00:42:12,761 --> 00:42:14,764
You will go through the inspection process.

605
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,722
Command Order to Ban Access.

606
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,897
I heard you are in the TJ group.

607
00:42:30,124 --> 00:42:32,077
Is this a task from there?

608
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:35,490
You said you were busy.
There is No time to explain.

609
00:42:37,312 --> 00:42:39,705
Just don't go near her
so that there is nothing.

610
00:42:40,383 --> 00:42:43,783
It's Not good for your job
if you get involved in other's problem.

611
00:42:44,084 --> 00:42:45,230
I don't care about that.

612
00:42:47,201 --> 00:42:50,761
After all, my father has
high position in your office.

613
00:42:50,786 --> 00:42:53,193
Imagine I am involved between you too..so

614
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:57,036
What work are you doing there?

615
00:42:57,608 --> 00:42:58,912
Legal team.

616
00:43:01,753 --> 00:43:07,440
Just a matter of law.
So please don't think about anything else.

617
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:10,095
As for the legal team, Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho.

618
00:43:10,944 --> 00:43:12,098
Section Chief Choi Yong-Geun.

619
00:43:12,123 --> 00:43:17,187
No need to talk about anything else.
Just don't go near Kim Min-Ji.

620
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:20,785
I am saying goodbye first because
there are other matters.

621
00:43:43,462 --> 00:43:47,509
Hey, why Bo-Kyung
invited you to meet?

622
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:51,023
- Not a big problem.
- What? Personal problems?

623
00:43:52,864 --> 00:43:54,067
Absolutely not.

624
00:43:56,133 --> 00:44:00,192
You know Hee-Joo, one of the victims,
was an employee of TJ Group's legal team?

625
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:01,989
I know.

626
00:44:03,007 --> 00:44:07,191
Come to think of it, company
where Bo-kyung works is TJ.

627
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:09,915
Looks like Bo-Kyung is filling in
Hee-Joo's place.

628
00:44:10,099 --> 00:44:12,359
Is it a coincidence?

629
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:13,850
Self-created coincidence.

630
00:44:14,572 --> 00:44:18,085
Moon Bo-Kyung fills the empty seat
left by Jung Hee-Joo.

631
00:44:18,567 --> 00:44:19,647
Who?

632
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,156
See you again.

633
00:44:22,283 --> 00:44:23,126
Cheon Na Na.

634
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:27,378
only child of
Head of TJ group.

635
00:44:27,698 --> 00:44:29,803
Choi Yong-Geun, former chief of Seoul
Gwangsu  team

636
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:31,583

must be involved too.

637
00:44:31,608 --> 00:44:33,894
Now he works as
TJ Group's attorney.

638
00:44:34,205 --> 00:44:35,542
What's wrong with them?

639
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:38,206
It's a bit complicated.

640
00:44:39,053 --> 00:44:42,399
- Do I have to explain now?
- Forget it.

641
00:44:43,046 --> 00:44:46,226
Just Lee Sung-Gon's problem
it's complicated as of now.

642
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:51,329
What's the matter, sir?

643
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:53,994
It doesn't matter. Please talk.

644
00:44:54,395 --> 00:44:55,315
You see.

645
00:44:55,368 --> 00:44:58,108
Sorry if I continue to
interrupt your time.

646
00:44:58,907 --> 00:45:00,879
Can we meet now?

647
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:04,505
Now I'm
doing something outside.

648
00:45:04,685 --> 00:45:07,299
Then I will be waiting at the police station.

649
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,764
- Is it really urgent?
- It is not like that.

650
00:45:10,303 --> 00:45:11,197
This...

651
00:45:11,475 --> 00:45:12,779
very frustrating for me.

652
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:17,017
I'm just curious about the continuation of the Hee-Ju case.

653
00:45:17,053 --> 00:45:18,719
In that case,

654
00:45:18,773 --> 00:45:21,733
I will give one address,
please wait there.

655
00:45:21,782 --> 00:45:24,336
If my work is over,
I'll see you right away.

656
00:45:24,361 --> 00:45:25,982
Okay. Thank you

657
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,618
Jung Hee-Ju.

658
00:45:32,027 --> 00:45:32,907
Why...

659
00:45:33,501 --> 00:45:36,981
he always focuses on the case of
Jung Hee-Ju only?

660
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:41,522
This is very strange.

661
00:45:42,673 --> 00:45:44,545
According to me,

662
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,047
he looked like he already planned
everything in advance

663
00:45:47,878 --> 00:45:50,651
He wasn't nervous or hesitant at all.

664
00:45:55,198 --> 00:45:56,205
He was like...

665
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:59,214
He is used to killing people.

666
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:03,197
- Detective sir.
- Yes.

667
00:46:03,234 --> 00:46:05,567
I will never meet
with him again, right?

668
00:46:05,592 --> 00:46:07,860
Yes It will not happen.

669
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:10,082
He's very scary.

670
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:12,020
His face is exactly the same
with the face I saw,

671
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,198
when I took the city bus.
That scared me even more.

672
00:46:14,238 --> 00:46:16,335
When he took the knife
and tried to kill me,

673
00:46:16,362 --> 00:46:17,869
he put on a normal face.

674
00:46:18,976 --> 00:46:20,981
That face keeps haunting me.

675
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,706
That innocent face.

676
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,020
In that case, okay.

677
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,040
Please you can leave now,

678
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,220
We will call you
if anything else is needed.

679
00:46:29,797 --> 00:46:31,115
What do you think?

680
00:46:31,689 --> 00:46:34,095
As you said
to the press,

681
00:46:34,392 --> 00:46:36,897
is it true that Lee Sung-Gon
is a copycat?

682
00:46:38,521 --> 00:46:40,713
Until this matter is sent to the prosecutor's office,

683
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:43,226
however,

684
00:46:43,334 --> 00:46:45,305
watch your words
about Lee Sung-Gon.

685
00:46:45,631 --> 00:46:47,317
As you said
to the press,

686
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,410
he must be the culprit.

687
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:54,413
There's nothing wrong with Lee Sung-Gon.

688
00:46:55,279 --> 00:46:58,528
You have to adjust everything.

689
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,043
Lee Sung-Gon's younger sister?

690
00:47:08,191 --> 00:47:08,824
Yes

691
00:47:09,176 --> 00:47:10,623
She said so.

692
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,580
Lee Sung-Gon is an orphan,
so he has no family.

693
00:47:13,605 --> 00:47:15,421
I thought like that at first too.

694
00:47:15,596 --> 00:47:16,983
about a month ago,

695
00:47:17,393 --> 00:47:19,143
someone was looking for Mr. Lee.

696
00:47:19,822 --> 00:47:21,408
She can't speak Korean,

697
00:47:21,479 --> 00:47:23,325
so there's someone
who is the translator for her.

698
00:47:23,791 --> 00:47:25,004
According to her,

699
00:47:25,591 --> 00:47:27,442
she is an adopted person staying
abroad.

700
00:47:27,466 --> 00:47:28,973
Her name is also in English.

701
00:47:29,384 --> 00:47:30,912
Do you still remember?

702
00:47:31,382 --> 00:47:33,420
How can I remember a 
name in English?

703
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,422
Wait a moment.

704
00:47:35,986 --> 00:47:37,198
At that time,

705
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:40,267
looks like i got
translator's phone number.

706
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:44,031
She asked me to deliver
Mr. Lee's phone number.

707
00:47:47,287 --> 00:47:50,120
You must know
who is Lee Sung-Gon, right?

708
00:47:54,989 --> 00:47:56,814
Do you know Lee Sung-Gon?

709
00:47:58,985 --> 00:48:00,211
Excuse me,

710
00:48:00,485 --> 00:48:02,146
can you
leave us for a moment?

711
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:02,704
What?

712
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,139
But she can't speak Korean.

713
00:48:06,164 --> 00:48:08,173
What can we do?
if she can't communicate?

714
00:48:08,197 --> 00:48:10,190
Some personal matters might come up.

715
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:12,893
So, It will be better if she stayed outside.

716
00:48:13,087 --> 00:48:16,035
We can use a translator,
but you are so arrogant

717
00:48:19,289 --> 00:48:22,013
She is under treatment
due to severe stress disorder.

718
00:48:22,038 --> 00:48:24,626
If possible, don't stress her more.

719
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,693
We understand.

720
00:48:30,074 --> 00:48:31,512
So,

721
00:48:31,588 --> 00:48:34,414
You have met Mr. Seung Gon Lee, right?

722
00:48:35,312 --> 00:48:39,753
and he's the brother you were separated from...
When you were little?

723
00:48:40,690 --> 00:48:41,817
I am not sure.

724
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,912
We didn't talk much
because he didn't speak English.

725
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:45,505
But...

726
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:49,229
I think,he didnt like the idea that I came to see him

727
00:48:49,307 --> 00:48:50,729
What did he talk about?

728
00:48:51,626 --> 00:48:54,279
Did he mention anything about himself?

729
00:48:54,313 --> 00:48:56,319
about his condition?

730
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:03,477
I know that you have been hospitalized for stress disorder.

731
00:49:03,665 --> 00:49:06,698
Did something happen during that encounter?

732
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,191
Mr. Lee is currently locked up.

733
00:49:17,588 --> 00:49:19,826
He is charged with a series of murders.

734
00:49:20,903 --> 00:49:24,067
Did he happen to mention anything to you?

735
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,905
Don't ask things
which depress her.

736
00:49:31,938 --> 00:49:34,326
- Do you understand what we're talking about?
- Are you underestimating me?

737
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,161
Murder.
Murder.

738
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,516
Murder.

739
00:49:38,912 --> 00:49:40,116
Murder.

740
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,483
You saying that word that stress her out.

741
00:49:43,508 --> 00:49:44,680
I'm sorry.

742
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,120
Him and I,

743
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,516
we are not as siblings.

744
00:49:51,088 --> 00:49:52,159
When I was little,

745
00:49:52,238 --> 00:49:54,310
mom got divorced and got remarried.

746
00:49:54,788 --> 00:49:57,307
My stepfather had a son and thats who Lee Sung-Gon is.

747
00:49:57,342 --> 00:49:59,021
We're not blood related at all.

748
00:50:00,064 --> 00:50:02,369
The only reason why I wanted to find him because,

749
00:50:02,805 --> 00:50:06,085
I needed some kind of trace when I was in korea,

750
00:50:06,126 --> 00:50:09,111
Because I thought
this might be my last visit ever,

751
00:50:09,135 --> 00:50:10,212
to this country.

752
00:50:12,471 --> 00:50:14,114
Are you trying to say...

753
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,888
you have no emotional relation with him,

754
00:50:17,314 --> 00:50:19,419
not now or in the past?

755
00:50:21,886 --> 00:50:24,458
But you did have some kind of conversation.

756
00:50:24,532 --> 00:50:26,906
He didnt mention anything?

757
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,925
Like I said
he doesn't speak english.

758
00:50:33,297 --> 00:50:35,006
I didnt know much Korean either.

759
00:50:35,701 --> 00:50:36,914
and to be honest,

760
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,993
I really dont want to talk about him,

761
00:50:39,018 --> 00:50:40,229
You understand?

762
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:44,311
What did she say?

763
00:50:44,695 --> 00:50:46,535
She doesn't want to talk about it.

764
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:03,146
What did she actually hear
from Lee Sung-Gon?

765
00:51:03,378 --> 00:51:04,932
There must be something she is hiding.

766
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,734
Can you really understand
English language?

767
00:51:07,798 --> 00:51:11,738
Facial expressions can tell
more things than words.

768
00:51:13,304 --> 00:51:15,843
Looks like this will take a
long time.

769
00:51:16,993 --> 00:51:18,645
When we will meet Lee Sung-Gon,

770
00:51:19,076 --> 00:51:21,025
let's talk about his little sister.

771
00:51:21,879 --> 00:51:23,650
That way we will know the reaction.

772
00:51:23,981 --> 00:51:25,222
is it okay
if we meet him now?

773
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,888
Didn't you say you wanted to meet
with Jung Im-Beom?

774
00:51:27,927 --> 00:51:30,681
If I meet him now,
there's nothing I can say either.

775
00:51:31,081 --> 00:51:32,408
I will tell him

776
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,034
when i find
more information.

777
00:51:49,206 --> 00:51:51,226
Looks like there won't be any
customers today.

778
00:51:51,282 --> 00:51:52,817
Eun-Hye, you can go home early.

779
00:51:52,983 --> 00:51:55,141
No. I will help you.

780
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:57,691
If brother knows you're still
working late into the night,

781
00:51:57,716 --> 00:51:59,264
He will nag all night 

782
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,922
Go home and help Jae-Ung
do his schoolwork.

783
00:52:02,343 --> 00:52:04,110
Okay. I understand.

784
00:52:08,892 --> 00:52:09,917
Hello, oppa?

785
00:52:10,694 --> 00:52:11,603
That person?

786
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:13,905
Yeah he is there.

787
00:52:14,398 --> 00:52:15,205
Why?

788
00:52:29,264 --> 00:52:31,004
- I am going first.
- Okay.

789
00:52:31,051 --> 00:52:34,490
And also, don't let
Jae-Ung ​​eat in the evening.

790
00:52:34,608 --> 00:52:36,228
These days, he hardly
eats at night.

791
00:52:36,391 --> 00:52:37,321
Okay.

792
00:52:48,406 --> 00:52:49,419
Grandpa.

793
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,007
My brother said to me,

794
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:56,577
the investigation is not yet over,
he says to meet next time.

795
00:52:56,601 --> 00:52:57,816
Is that so?

796
00:52:58,809 --> 00:53:00,347
I'm sorry in advance.

797
00:53:00,696 --> 00:53:04,130
He also felt guilty,
when he told me,

798
00:53:04,196 --> 00:53:06,516
he said he would call you
and meet you in person.

799
00:53:07,109 --> 00:53:08,222
I understand.

800
00:53:08,719 --> 00:53:13,072
I forced him too much to meet,
even though he's busy.

801
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,567
Please tell
my apologies to him.

802
00:53:16,356 --> 00:53:17,958
How much is the total?

803
00:53:17,999 --> 00:53:20,325
Not. It doesn't matter.
You don't have to pay for it.

804
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:22,424
And also... this.

805
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:25,068
You can take it and
eat with your family.

806
00:53:25,092 --> 00:53:26,616
Do not be like that.

807
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:28,609
Because I ordered,
let me pay for it.

808
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,168
It doesn't matter.

809
00:53:30,209 --> 00:53:32,595
I will be scolded
if I accept it.

810
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,206
Thank you very much.

811
00:54:13,589 --> 00:54:14,103
Hey!

812
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:15,811
You think you can run away
alone?

813
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:17,218
You're friends
with Hyeong Sa-Rang, right?

814
00:54:17,502 --> 00:54:19,509
Stay away from Yu-Na.

815
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:22,204
If you don't want to destroy 
your pretty face


816
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,051
Try it.

817
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:18,793
No need, I just
just need slippers.

818
00:55:18,896 --> 00:55:22,648
This is in exchange for the price of chicken, your aunt gave me at the chicken restaurant earlier.

819
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,325
If you wear it,

820
00:55:25,716 --> 00:55:27,883
I will no longer feel burdened.

821
00:55:28,292 --> 00:55:29,630
Wear it, who knows if it fits.

822
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:44,244
Is the size right?

823
00:55:44,285 --> 00:55:46,905
Yes It fits perfectly.

824
00:55:47,275 --> 00:55:49,728
All my life, I saw
many other people's feet,

825
00:55:49,795 --> 00:55:52,055
once seen i already know if
this will fit.

826
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,312
Is the shape not to your taste?

827
00:55:56,337 --> 00:55:58,945
Certainly not. This is very beautiful.

828
00:55:58,970 --> 00:56:00,320
Thank you, Grandpa.

829
00:56:00,366 --> 00:56:02,360
All right, wear what you like.

830
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:04,765
You can wear it.
Of course.

831
00:56:16,273 --> 00:56:19,724
Don't you guys have anything to do in this case anymore?

832
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:23,635
I know this case has been taken over 
by the people up there.

833
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:25,404
You...

834
00:56:27,684 --> 00:56:30,724
Have a younger sister
separated since childhood, right?

835
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,153
I think your sister knows a little about you.

836
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,914
What did she say?

837
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:43,900
She's very different from you.

838
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:46,009
She is nice.

839
00:56:46,999 --> 00:56:48,493
Very good.

840
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:53,320
You can't judge people
from face.

841
00:56:54,714 --> 00:56:57,475
You guys don't know
what was the past like?

842
00:56:57,848 --> 00:57:00,548
- What was her past like?
- If you see her again,

843
00:57:00,684 --> 00:57:01,910
please tell her ,

844
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:03,587
About what has been
I told her,

845
00:57:03,894 --> 00:57:05,541
she should always remember that
during her lifetime.

846
00:57:35,485 --> 00:57:36,590
You remember me?

847
00:57:39,781 --> 00:57:40,972
Forgive me.

848
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:42,262
I...

849
00:57:42,324 --> 00:57:44,711
can't speak Korean very well.

850
00:57:45,765 --> 00:57:46,698
I understand.

851
00:57:46,997 --> 00:57:48,235
You must want to forget it.

852
00:57:48,795 --> 00:57:49,722
Why did you come?

853
00:57:50,424 --> 00:57:51,784
Pleased to meet you.

854
00:57:51,978 --> 00:57:53,464
I asked why did you come?

855
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,176
You've lived happily
in the United States. Why come back?

856
00:57:56,513 --> 00:57:57,653
Forgive me.

857
00:57:58,508 --> 00:58:00,681
I don't really understand Korean.

858
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:02,211
Then, how?

859
00:58:02,713 --> 00:58:04,804
'Cause I never learn,
So I can't speak foreign languages.

860
00:58:05,382 --> 00:58:07,087
- Older brother.
- What?

861
00:58:09,086 --> 00:58:10,818
Why should I be your brother?

862
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:13,031
I miss you.

863
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:16,457
Why should I be your brother, you
crazy woman?

864
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:18,665
Why should I be your brother!

865
00:58:32,822 --> 00:58:33,847
You remember this?

866
00:58:34,811 --> 00:58:38,352
Your mother who is like a whore
that took you with her.

867
00:58:39,529 --> 00:58:42,931
My God, I'm sorry for all my sense with all my heart,

868
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,425
and choosing to do wrong.

869
00:58:45,457 --> 00:58:47,517
What are you saying?
Speak the truth!

870
00:58:47,591 --> 00:58:50,631
I am only ordinary human,
help me in my prayers,

871
00:58:50,669 --> 00:58:53,037
Speak the language
all I can understand stupid!

872
00:58:53,093 --> 00:58:55,686
Protect me forever,

873
00:58:56,236 --> 00:58:57,672
save me,

874
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,407
United States of America?

875
00:59:00,604 --> 00:59:02,943
Are you happy that you can live there?

876
00:59:03,344 --> 00:59:04,911
Is it like heaven?

877
00:59:04,957 --> 00:59:05,917
Then me?

878
00:59:05,982 --> 00:59:07,554
My life is like hell.

879
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:10,962
I lived it without anything!

880
00:59:13,526 --> 00:59:15,073
You.

881
00:59:15,186 --> 00:59:17,272
If you and your mother,

882
00:59:17,306 --> 00:59:20,072
didn't show up then

883
00:59:20,114 --> 00:59:22,400
and my father didn't die like that,

884
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:24,300
I won't live like this either!

885
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:26,605
- I really...
- Shut up!

886
00:59:27,234 --> 00:59:28,466
I...

887
00:59:28,502 --> 00:59:31,192
ask for your kindness and forgiveness...

888
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,874
I regret my sins and
I am ready to be given any punishment.

889
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:41,815
Do you know my reason
to become a killer?

890
00:59:42,879 --> 00:59:45,319
I've killed a lot of people.

891
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:48,856
Every time I see the woman in front of me,
your mother's face that always appears.

892
00:59:49,886 --> 00:59:51,758
wearing a white dress,

893
00:59:52,423 --> 00:59:54,617
wearing red lipstick on her lips,

894
00:59:55,591 --> 00:59:58,205
attract the attention of men.

895
00:59:58,995 --> 01:00:00,167
That's who your mother is.

896
01:00:05,705 --> 01:00:06,541
You.

897
01:00:06,755 --> 01:00:10,087
You came looking for me
at the very right time.

898
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:13,447
I won't kill you.

899
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:15,516
I will let you go.

900
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,252
Remember this.

901
01:00:18,991 --> 01:00:20,118
Every time...

902
01:00:20,917 --> 01:00:23,223
I kill people
with this...

903
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:24,728
you...

904
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:28,996
you will feel pain
like in hell.

905
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,533
The reason I killed them was...

906
01:00:33,597 --> 01:00:36,370
because you're still alive.

907
01:00:38,201 --> 01:00:39,239
Remember it well.

908
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:45,917
My God,

909
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,267
I am sorry.

910
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:52,630
This is all my fault.

911
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,622
I love my brother so much.

912
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,700
How is your relationship with Tae Ho?

913
01:01:07,356 --> 01:01:08,294
Nice 

914
01:01:08,730 --> 01:01:10,136
It must be so.

915
01:01:10,363 --> 01:01:13,723
This is the marriage you wanted,
you have to defend it.

916
01:01:14,088 --> 01:01:16,336
The chairman is now more confident
on Tae ho than with me.

917
01:01:16,361 --> 01:01:18,021
I don't need to interfere anymore.

918
01:01:19,376 --> 01:01:21,281
Isn't that too much?

919
01:01:21,702 --> 01:01:23,135
We are husband and wife.

920
01:01:23,328 --> 01:01:24,251
That is true.

921
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,855
You have nothing to lose.

922
01:01:31,288 --> 01:01:33,060
You must have known, right?

923
01:01:33,087 --> 01:01:35,834
before detention, there was confiscation
and search by the legal team.

924
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,531
They...

925
01:01:37,988 --> 01:01:40,468
said that
there is strong evidence from the Blue House

926
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:43,228
which got my father sentenced.

927
01:01:43,556 --> 01:01:45,602
What if the evidence,

928
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,112
submitted,

929
01:01:49,216 --> 01:01:50,841
from the legal team to the prosecutor's office,

930
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:53,448
at the time of the search?

931
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,449
You know he is a 
very thorough person.

932
01:01:55,591 --> 01:01:56,914
He won't do anything wrong.

933
01:01:57,077 --> 01:01:58,674
What If not a mistake but intentional?

934
01:01:58,714 --> 01:01:59,610
What for?

935
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,623
You yourself said,
it's too big.

936
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:05,826
Don't you want more than this?

937
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,940
Not long ago I met
with Michael Cha.

938
01:02:10,965 --> 01:02:12,240
He is the CEO of McQueen Korea.

939
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:13,539
Really?

940
01:02:13,859 --> 01:02:16,533
I told him we were from
one school and one class too.

941
01:02:16,946 --> 01:02:20,879
I just found out it's your business
in Japan not going well.

942
01:02:22,597 --> 01:02:23,877
Dad doesn't know yet.

943
01:02:24,383 --> 01:02:26,334
What happened to you two years ago,

944
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:28,440
and Chairman Woo 
helped you cover it.

945
01:02:30,117 --> 01:02:32,831
If Woo Tae ho is a bad person,

946
01:02:32,856 --> 01:02:35,590
shouldn't the Chairman
already know everything?

947
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,055
Why didn't he tell him?
even though he knows everything.

948
01:02:39,109 --> 01:02:40,869
We are family.

949
01:02:40,894 --> 01:02:42,001
The same lineage.

950
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:50,126
Right. So true.

951
01:02:50,559 --> 01:02:53,532
In this world we can only believe
our own siblings.

952
01:02:59,376 --> 01:03:02,916
This looks like a very caring gift from your mother.

953
01:03:06,111 --> 01:03:09,111
If you see this dont you want to see your mother and want to have it?

954
01:03:10,558 --> 01:03:11,583
It's beautiful.

955
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:18,966
I haven't seen Dad in a long time.

956
01:03:19,327 --> 01:03:22,347
Let's go visit him.

957
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,005
Contact me when you set the time.

958
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:46,362
Hello, Mother?

959
01:03:46,402 --> 01:03:47,889
Are you on the plane?

960
01:03:47,991 --> 01:03:49,600
Ya, just few mins before the 
the plane leave.

961
01:03:49,747 --> 01:03:51,303
I'll call when I arrive.

962
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:52,218
Na-Na.

963
01:03:53,196 --> 01:03:55,135
Once you're in the United States,
don't come back here again.

964
01:03:56,599 --> 01:03:57,401
Run away.

965
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:00,607
Open the door!

966
01:04:02,743 --> 01:04:06,136
Don't try to trick me. Open the door!

967
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:09,550
I know what you're planning.

968
01:04:10,067 --> 01:04:12,914
I know it's all for the money!

969
01:04:15,486 --> 01:04:17,019
Open the door!

970
01:04:17,259 --> 01:04:19,073
Give up and open the door!

971
01:04:19,325 --> 01:04:21,639
Na-Na, never come back again.

972
01:04:22,012 --> 01:04:24,512
Never come back to this house again.

973
01:04:25,491 --> 01:04:27,531
You have to live.

974
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,884
Even if it's just you.

975
01:04:29,911 --> 01:04:30,911
Mother.

976
01:04:31,277 --> 01:04:32,339
Are you okay?

977
01:04:32,602 --> 01:04:33,841
Something happened?

978
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:04,167
I won't run away like Mom.

979
01:05:10,607 --> 01:05:12,246
I will stay alive.

980
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,149
Until the end.

981
01:05:46,563 --> 01:05:48,662
What did that woman say
about Lee sung-Gon,

982
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,884
is a hint for
exposing the crime.

983
01:05:50,917 --> 01:05:52,223
Forever you will remember it.

984
01:05:52,263 --> 01:05:56,010
You are seen by the media that you are
prime suspect in the murder case.

985
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:58,323
Who is he to act like that?

986
01:05:58,356 --> 01:06:00,276
Mr Chairman refused to meet anyone.

987
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:02,062
I'll restructure it.

988
01:06:02,087 --> 01:06:04,162
I am here because I feel lonely.

989
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:05,660
You in front of others,

990
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,502
said I took a strange pill and became different.

991
01:06:08,554 --> 01:06:11,275
I can't answer your question about the killer.

992
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,869
This seems to be just my selfishness.

993
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:14,941
She wasn't on the bus at the time.

994
01:06:14,966 --> 01:06:16,599
See this.
