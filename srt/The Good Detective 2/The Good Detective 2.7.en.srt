00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,510
<i>This program is for ages 15 and over</i>
provided by Summer Fouad

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,900
<i>because it contains adult elements,
violence, and the risk of impersonation.</i>

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,250
<i>This program contains
indirect advertisements and virtual advertisements.</i>

4
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:16,460
<i>All characters, names, events,
etc. in this drama are fictional.</i>

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,180
<i>Episode 7</i>

6
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:40,330
Na-Na.

7
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,880
Na-Na.

8
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:44,200
Please get the syringe in the drawer.

9
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,480
You are okay?

10
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:55,480
Yes im fine.

11
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,720
I missed syringe time because I was too busy.

12
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:00,030
I'll get better.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,720
This never happened.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:04,380
Let's go to the hospital.

15
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,900
Tae-Ho.

16
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,780
I need you.

17
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,340
You're the one who understands the most.

18
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,310
those people

19
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,270
won't let me go.

20
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,230
Especially Sang-Woo.

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,310
You don't know what he's going to do.

22
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:35,800
I'm scared.

23
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:37,360
Na-Na.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,480
It's not about Cheon Sang-Woo.

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,970
Do you know how scared I am

26
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,060
when I'm alone in America?

27
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,260
I never came home.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,490
I stay at the hotel every day.

29
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,410
I keep changing hotels

30
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,430
for fear that Sang-Woo would come
to kill me.

31
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,770
Na-Na.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,450
You're very sensitive now.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,130
If you rest...

34
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,280
Let's send Cheon Sang-Woo

35
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,400
to where Dad is right now.

36
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,830
If evidence is found

37
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:25,510
from the assault
and attempted murder case two years ago,

38
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,670
he will be imprisoned
for several years.

39
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,910
The case is over.

40
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,140
No

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,640
There are still detectives after him.

42
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,980
We can do it.

43
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,170
Na-Na.

44
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,280
The case has something to do with me.

45
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:50,500
If Sang-Woo goes to jail,
I'll be jailed too.

46
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:52,670
You're just helping him.

47
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,240
You're just falsifying evidence.

48
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:58,680
Wouldn't you be able to escape
punishment, Mr. Prosecutor?

49
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:03,540
Everything will fall apart.

50
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,520
You have to build a new one.

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,850
You and me.

52
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,490
Just the two of us.

53
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:27,720
<i>President, if Director Cheon steps down
in this situation...</i>

54
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,140
Better that never happens

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,430
<i>Let's send Cheon Sang-Woo</i>

56
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,060
<i>to where Dad is right now.</i>

57
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,140
You have to build a new one.

58
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,360
You and me.

59
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,080
Just the two of us.

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,030
<i>Wait</i>

61
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:23,430
You have to explain
who is in the video.

62
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,270
Who's he?

63
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,000
The man who dragged the woman

64
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,980
was the Vice Chairman of TJ Group,
Cheon Sang-Woo.

65
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,190
The man seen
on the screen now is

66
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,750
<i>Son-in-law and Legal Team Leader,</i>

67
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,220
Woo Tae-Ho.

68
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:41,250
I invite you to
investigate Jung Hee-Joo's case,

69
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,600
but why did you bring this?

70
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:45,460
This is the case I pursued
at the Seoul Investigation Team.

71
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,900
If by then we get
this tape,

72
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,490
we must have caught Sang-Woo.

73
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,100
In that case...

74
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:52,870
Go back to the Seoul Investigation Team.

75
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,780
Back there, then...

76
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,310
Solve this case.

77
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:59,600
Why are you bringing this nuclear weapon
to us that has nothing to do with it?

78
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,440
The sure thing is
this video will connect

79
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,150
with the motive for the murder of Jung Hee-Joo.

80
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:05,880
So, Jung Hee-Joo's killer

81
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,350
could be one
of those two?

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,510
Most likely.

83
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,490
They are on a different level.

84
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:13,160
To be honest, they are too strong.

85
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,000
Too strong? This is really...

86
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,760
Super strong!

87
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,980
If we touch something wrong,
we will be crushed.

88
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:22,600
You won't be able to do it.

89
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,670
You'll just be powder.

90
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,690
You sent that guy, right?

91
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,270
Why do you have that?

92
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,650
You said you only saw it.

93
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:48,010
But why...

94
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:49,820
Why do you have that?

95
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,870
You sent him to kill me?

96
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:54,700
I just wanted to make sure.

97
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:58,300
I thought you might have something
useless about me.

98
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,800
Turns out I was right.

99
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,340
You're putting a knife
in the back of my head.

100
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,640
Because I need something like that.

101
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,520
I kept it to survive.

102
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,590
Have you ever shown
it to anyone else?

103
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:18,250
Never.

104
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:21,070
I have no reason
to show it.

105
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,030
However,

106
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:29,000
I apologize

107
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,280
for hurting you.

108
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,510
It wasn't because I told him to.

109
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,930
You already know, right?

110
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,640
Do not play around

111
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,920
with me and Su-Yeon.

112
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:42,180
Min-Ji.

113
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,810
You're the first to make a mistake!

114
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,240
It's because of your greed!

115
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,100
This could break our relationship.

116
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,940
Either way,

117
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:55,440
you have to keep it.

118
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,020
If you missed it,

119
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:01,590
You and that child's relation will also
be severed.

120
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:03,150
Remember that.

121
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,430
Do it!

122
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,590
Do!

123
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,420
Whore woman!

124
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,570
Unlucky!

125
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,760
Bitch woman!

126
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,970
Help me.

127
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,340
Please help me.

128
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:25,950
How dare you.

129
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,250
How dare you.

130
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:31,830
How dare you!

131
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,440
Why is she my child?

132
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,870
Why?

133
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,260
she's your child

134
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,760
your child not mine

135
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,410
Come here.

136
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,310
She is the blood of your rotten flesh.

137
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,050
She has nothing to do with me!

138
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,190
<i>Die!</i>

139
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,250
<i>Die!</i>

140
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:50,580
<i>Die!</i>

141
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,150
Save me

142
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,680
please save me

143
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:09,140
save me

144
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,730
Please save me

145
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,140
I thought you had stopped drinking.

146
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,570
You started drinking again?

147
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,040
Sit down.

148
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,160
Does business run smoothly
by drinking alcohol?

149
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,860
Business is growing.

150
00:08:41,050 --> 00:08:43,110
- My restaurant has a name.
- Then, why are you drinking?

151
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,340
Business is going well,
but you're drinking alcohol. That is dangerous.

152
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,200
Today,

153
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,140
I tried calling to
know Eun-Hye's qualification exam results.

154
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,500
- She didn't pass?
- It is better if she doesn't pass

155
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,830
She didn't even take the exam at all.

156
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,720
She says he is going for the exam,
but she goes somewhere else.

157
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,110
- What?
- When she studied for the exam,

158
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,540
all just imitating.

159
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,810
What are you talking about?

160
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:10,140
Eun-Hye is not that kind of child.

161
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,360
Then why not take the exam?

162
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,120
Have you asked Eun-Hye the reason?

163
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,460
If she was my daughter, I'd run after
her and break her leg.

164
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,170
But, she is not my daughter.

165
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,470
I wonder why I
should interfere in her life.

166
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,490
Who knows.

167
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,850
How far do we have to keep Eun-Hye?

168
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,290
How far can we
ask to do something?

169
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,870
We're her parents.
We have to scold her if she is wrong.

170
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,910
According to me,

171
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,360
you are the problem.

172
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,440
Me?

173
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,620
What do I do?

174
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Eun-Hye is not a child
who can study well.

175
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:45,080
Because you keep hoping for her

176
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:47,580
She just adjusts to you.

177
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,230
So,

178
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,710
let's pretend
that we don't know what's going on.

179
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,510
After asking her to work in a shop,
and growing up

180
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,260
let's let her live independently.

181
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:59,620
Maybe it's for the best for Eun-Hye.

182
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:01,570
Who do you think you are?

183
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,890
Who do you think you
are to judge other people as you please?

184
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,880
She's very smart.

185
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:10,170
She is also very good at drawing.

186
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:11,710
Why did you waste her talent?

187
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,310
What does that have to do with talent?

188
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:15,340
You know how the environment
he grew up in.

189
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,380
She never studied from the beginning of school.

190
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:20,720
It doesn't work by force.

191
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,350
I will kill you

192
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,350
if you put her to work
at a chicken restaurant.

193
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,310
Do not ask her anything but to study.

194
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,510
You understand?

195
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,240
Eun-Hye.

196
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,450
Eun-Hye!

197
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:35,510
What are you doing ?...

198
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,230
Please lower your voice.

199
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,170
Jae-Woong.

200
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,670
You should sleep in your room.

201
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,830
Wake up.

202
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,690
I will carry you.

203
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,920
I'm going to Jae-Woong.

204
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:52,060
Please wait.

205
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,080
Okay.

206
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:15,430
<i>Group of SMA Equivalence Packet Test Questions</i>

207
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,890
Eun-Hye.

208
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,640
Why don't you take the exam?

209
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,470
Forgive me.

210
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:37,160
How will I face your father
if you keep doing this?

211
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,100
That person.

212
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:41,640
The person who took money from you.

213
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,300
Just because you can't blend in...

214
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,470
I heard when you were talking to aunt.

215
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,380
Her words are true.

216
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,440
I really don't want to study.

217
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,160
No one likes to learn.

218
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,200
You're doing this for your own life.

219
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,370
Do I deserve it?

220
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:02,210
- What happened to you?
- Uncle.

221
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,820
I'm so happy to be living with you,

222
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,730
aunt, and also Jae-Woong.

223
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:11,370
I feel very happy.

224
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:16,430
I guess you had a hard time
because of me.

225
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,630
It was very difficult for me
to keep going.

226
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,560
I am a nobody.

227
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,420
Looks like I put too much pressure on you.

228
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,300
There is still another test.

229
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:41,050
We can test again

230
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,640
after six months, right?

231
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,750
Let's try...

232
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,510
Let's try one more time.

233
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,600
ok

234
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,660
I'll think about it.

235
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,010
You cry too much.

236
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,730
You can stop crying now.

237
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:17,340
Why are you just saying it now?

238
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,030
Why did you hide it from me?

239
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,370
I shouldn't have mistaken
Eun-Hye.

240
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,700
I did that because I thought
you were going to cause a big problem.

241
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:28,640
I don't need anything.

242
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,990
They slandered Eun-Hye?

243
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,050
Jang Yu-Na, that person...

244
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:33,620
He's been tried and jailed.

245
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,130
Then the detective!

246
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,360
How dare he on Eun-Hye.

247
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,720
He is on his way to the test site!

248
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,850
The detective freed
the suspected accomplice.

249
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,290
He even added
a false testimony for Jang Yu-Na.

250
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,100
Come to think of it,
you're the most annoying one.

251
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,960
Why did Eun-Hye call
you instead of me?

252
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,290
That's a little suspicious.

253
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:58,130
It's been weird from the first time.

254
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,880
Why is he looking for you?

255
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,960
Good grief!

256
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,490
It's because I don't bother.

257
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,350
Why don't you bother?

258
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,810
He should have looked at me more comfortable
and less troublesome.

259
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:10,580
Why are you screaming in the morning?

260
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,080
Hey.

261
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,900
Don't you know

262
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:17,480
that you are waiting for orders?

263
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:20,530
Shouldn't you guys
be able to lift your heads?

264
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,380
If you make trouble like this,

265
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,710
what will happen to my position?

266
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,980
Fine, I understand.

267
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,230
Forgive us.

268
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,730
Hei, Kang Do-Chang.

269
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,900
Hey.

270
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,840
I'm really really nervous.

271
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,590
Kwon Jae-Hong, that guy

272
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,510
didn't secretly meet
with Bo-Kyung, right?

273
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,810
Of course.

274
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,330
No way Bo-Kyung

275
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,330
like a guy like Jae-Hong.

276
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,870
True, right?

277
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,720
Right.

278
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,550
Even though she has poor taste,

279
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,160
she wouldn't like a man
like that grilled anchovy head.

280
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,020
Wait.

281
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,670
When Bo-Kyung is drunk,

282
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:09,400
You were
at that chicken restaurant too, right?

283
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,430
Yes

284
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:13,580
But, I only saw her briefly.

285
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,110
Have you ever

286
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:18,170
meet the handsome guy
that Bo-kyung said?

287
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:20,150
I want to ask for help.

288
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:23,030
I'm so desperate.

289
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,150
What is it?

290
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:26,850
What's your secret

291
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,670
to get Bo-kyung
into a prestigious university?

292
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,590
If she's from your DNA,

293
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,470
she couldn't approach a prestigious campus.

294
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:36,070
How can you send her there ?

295
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:39,400
Why are you all of a sudden?

296
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,340
Are you

297
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,100
going to college?

298
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,340
I mean, for Eun-Hye.

299
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,140
Oh it's like that.

300
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,330
Right

301
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:49,050
It

302
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,520
it turns out that she's not the only one
who has to be good.

303
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:54,340
The role of the father is very important.

304
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:01,610
Good morning.

305
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:02,710
Hey.

306
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,040
What are you doing here?

307
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:06,600
Sorry, just...

308
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,720
The front of this shoe is slightly open.

309
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,940
Give it to me.

310
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,500
Isn't grandpa tired?

311
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,480
Apparently you came
because you were tired.

312
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:34,160
What's so difficult?

313
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:41,100
Every time I think about myself,
I feel irritated and angry.

314
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,680
It is just

315
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,320
I wish I could disappear.

316
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,650
Why?

317
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,800
Because I'm a useless human.

318
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,320
It's finished. Try it.

319
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,450
- That's more comfortable, right?
- Yes.

320
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,930
Seems to be getting better.

321
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,870
I do not do anything.

322
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,320
I just pretended to knock.

323
00:17:13,370 --> 00:17:15,540
-It's the same as before.
- Yes?

324
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:19,020
If you have nowhere to go,

325
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,980
come anytime.

326
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,750
I also feel happy to see you.

327
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:25,180
Me?

328
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,650
What do I do?

329
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,490
What do you think the reason is?

330
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:33,260
Your presence can make someone
feel better.

331
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,770
That's the reason.

332
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:42,040
I thank Hee-Joo.

333
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,660
Because she was always there for me
while she was in this world.

334
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,850
Detective Kang is always happy
to talk about you.

335
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,640
It is just...

336
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,240
No reason.

337
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,160
It's only because he has you.

338
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,990
This is the video that was
on Kim Min-Ji's laptop.

339
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,330
Is it

340
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,950
because of this they came home?

341
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:11,140
Do you rummage through my laptop
to your heart's content?

342
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,450
The laptop was still on when we arrived.
Then we happened to see him.

343
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,660
Vice Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo
dispatched that person

344
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:20,650
because he knows you have this video, right?

345
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:22,000
No

346
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,470
Even if the person
who hit me is found,

347
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,120
I will not sue
him or imprison him.

348
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,430
Isn't that my right?

349
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:36,440
We didn't investigate
the assault two years ago.

350
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:39,160
We're looking for Jung Hee-Joo's killer.

351
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:41,740
What matters is not the content of this video.

352
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,920
But, how does this video
get into your laptop.

353
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,900
The last person to appear in this video
is Woo Tae-Ho.

354
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:52,530
Most likely
Woo Tae-Ho had this video.

355
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,480
Did Woo Tae-Ho
give it to you?

356
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,900
Or

357
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,690
Jung Hee Joo?

358
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:05,970
What is the reason for killing Jung Hee-Joo

359
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,410
because he gave this video to you?

360
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,900
I have a daughter.

361
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,960
She is four years old.

362
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,180
I have to take care of her myself.

363
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:20,000
It was very difficult and scary.

364
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,440
I'm afraid something bad will happen to my daughter.

365
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:26,010
I have to work hard.

366
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:29,670
So that my daughter can grow up
like a normal child.

367
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:32,620
So, I accepted this hair salon.

368
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,440
It was vengeance that paid off.

369
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:39,350
What did I do wrong?

370
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:41,360
This video

371
00:19:42,810 --> 00:19:44,490
you got from Jung Hee-Joo, right?

372
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,050
Please just tell me that.

373
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,240
I don't want to tell you.

374
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:49,990
Forgive me.

375
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:52,890
Your friend, Jung Hee-Joo has died.

376
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,300
We have to find out who
killed her

377
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,970
Jung Hee-Joo died unjustly.

378
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,410
I'm very grateful to Hee-Joo.

379
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,250
Therefore my heart aches,

380
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,600
and very sorry.

381
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,350
You can say I'm selfish.

382
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,950
But for me,

383
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,090
my daughter is more important

384
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,530
compared to Jung Hee-Joo.

385
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,140
Forgive me.

386
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,600
I have nothing more to say.

387
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,290
Police

388
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:29,540
look at the tape we both
had from two years ago.

389
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:32,350
Do not blame me.

390
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:35,100
This happened because of the person you sent.

391
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,020
What caused me to be exposed?

392
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,470
They are looking for me

393
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,530
not because of Kim Min-Ji.

394
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,810
Really?

395
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:46,380
Are you sure?

396
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:49,420
They say themselves

397
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,550
that they were looking for Kim Min-Ji
while chasing me.

398
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:54,850
I heard people at Incheon West Office

399
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,780
investigating Jung Hee-Joo?

400
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,630
- Then...
- Go away for a while.

401
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,160
Don't contact anyone.

402
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,210
You just need to call me.

403
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,270
No

404
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,430
I won't call you either.

405
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,930
If someone stabs a knife
in my back,

406
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,690
I will come to you.

407
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:22,770
Take care of your health always.

408
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:56,520
That video that you lovingly hid

409
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,460
fell into the hands of the police.

410
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,800
The police will call me.

411
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:03,090
You will also be called.

412
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,210
I understand you didn't throw the video away

413
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,300
to kill me.

414
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,360
But, what I don't understand is

415
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,860
why did you give the video
to Jung Hee-Joo?

416
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,680
I admit that I have the video.

417
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,270
However, I threw it away not too long ago.

418
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,520
How to?

419
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,710
By commanding Jung Hee-Jung?

420
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,430
In the end, Jung Hee-Joo

421
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:36,740
take that video?

422
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,440
How do you know
that Jung Hee-Joo has it?

423
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,940
That's not the point!

424
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:47,570
The video is in police hands now.

425
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,990
There is no direct evidence.

426
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:52,460
There will be no problem.

427
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:54,150
It could happen.

428
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:55,650
Except you

429
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,910
testify that you arranged it.

430
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,770
When did you find out
Jung Hee-Joo had the video?

431
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,010
I told you!

432
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,380
That's not the point.

433
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:11,120
Fine, I understand.

434
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:18,000
I'll make sure
the police don't cause trouble.

435
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,690
<i>Team Leader Woo.</i>

436
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,330
Why did you entrust
such an important job to me?

437
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,800
<i>West Incheon Police Station</i>

438
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,340
It was unexpected.

439
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,970
I thought you wouldn't come easily.

440
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:08,150
As you know,

441
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,440
we

442
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,840
got the record two years ago.

443
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:16,080
We also know that Team Leader Woo
is involved in this case.

444
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:17,280
Involved?

445
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,560
Wouldn't it be better
not to jump to conclusions?

446
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,760
The case two years ago
was a different matter.

447
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:25,300
The thing we want to know is

448
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,970
Jung Hee-Joo's killer.

449
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,120
This is personal privacy.

450
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,620
It is illegal to collect.

451
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,350
As expected, you understand the law.

452
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,910
But this relates to
the victim of a homicide case.

453
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:00,620
This is legal evidence that has nothing to do
with personal privacy.

454
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,020
If the victim is killed because of this photo,

455
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,520
isn't this proof enough?

456
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:13,200
Isn't it with this much evidence
and circumstances,

457
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:15,920
most prosecutors will allow
arrest warrants?

458
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,610
We ask because it sounds like
you understand better than we do.

459
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,690
You're asking for my opinion
as a prosecutor?

460
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,020
Find the source of this photo.

461
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:34,410
Get convincing testimony or evidence
,

462
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,670
about who took the photo
and for what purpose.

463
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,040
If the video has been obtained,

464
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,140
Are the victim's statements consistent enough
to identify the perpetrator?

465
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,160
Is it strong enough to be taken
as evidence in a trial?

466
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,610
Check from there.

467
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,800
And also...

468
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:49,790
coercion to
testify through threats

469
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,180
can violate
human rights and is illegal.

470
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:56,490
Please send the information today
to our legal team in writing.

471
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,120
After discussion,

472
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,670
You will be notified directly
about the lawsuit

473
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:04,190
responsible law enforcement officers
.

474
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,990
You've worked hard
today.

475
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:17,810
Who is interrogating whom?

476
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,110
Prosecutors talk about
this and that case in front of detectives?

477
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,110
Human rights violations. Illegality.

478
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,960
Catching a strange behavior?

479
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,210
You know what prosecutors like that have in common ?

480
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,810
They were asked to do something,

481
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,700
or have to hide something.

482
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,210
He forgot that no
one knew a prosecutor as well as a detective.

483
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,410
Yes

484
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,010
How about Ki Dong-Jae?

485
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,800
Currently in search.

486
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:05,020
His cell phone was off and he was
n't near the office either.

487
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,330
Yes, I'll be right back.

488
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:14,300
You guys shouldn't hold a knife
like that in front of detectives.

489
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:18,220
What are you guys doing?
Go make a living, you moron.

490
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,910
Ah these bastards.

491
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:24,570
If you see Ki Dong-Jae,
please contact us immediately.

492
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,320
Understand? Contact us.

493
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:32,710
Hyung, they are fierce.

494
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,000
Ki Dong-Jae, that brat really
disciplined them.

495
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,620
What to do?

496
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,010
We have to catch Ki Dong-Jae
to solve this case.

497
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,220
What do you think?
I heard you were after him.

498
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,100
Not just one
or two accusations against him.

499
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,830
Every moment, everything is lost.

500
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,510
Moreover, this time the former chairman
of the Seoul Investigation Team, Choi Yong-Geun,

501
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:53,910
will train me.

502
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,670
This will take
longer than we thought.

503
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,910
And that person is from Gangnam, Seoul,
which is not within our jurisdiction.

504
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,630
Then, let's ask for
cooperation from Gangnam.

505
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,480
Looks like the TJ Group
has prepared everything.

506
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,500
You better not hope.

507
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,390
Then what should I do?
We have to fight TJ Group?

508
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:18,890
My sister-in-law works for
the window cleaning subcontractor TJ Group.

509
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:22,580
No need to go far, the chairman's daughter also
works at TJ Group.

510
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,900
If wrong, the three families will be destroyed.

511
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,790
We have to catch Ki Dong-Jae
first.

512
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:30,310
After that it doesn't matter if you want to go up.

513
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,440
So how
to catch Ki Dong-Jae?

514
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,910
Isn't there a saying
among detectives?

515
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,010
Criminals against criminals.

516
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,020
You don't know?

517
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,070
Team Leader.

518
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,380
Sorry, I'm so messed up today.

519
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,380
Be careful on the road.

520
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:26,510
Team Leader.

521
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,740
Are you not feeling well?

522
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:38,300
No, I'm fine.

523
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,520
Why?

524
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:41,310
Did something happen?

525
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,970
Do I look pathetic?

526
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,190
A man who has everything
he has,

527
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,160
who always grumbles about
himself...

528
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,490
I really am nothing.

529
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,810
Everything is fake.

530
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,220
No

531
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,720
There isn't any...

532
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:07,790
Nothing is real.

533
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,130
Ah, I'm talking nonsense again.

534
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:14,380
Let's go

535
00:30:14,910 --> 00:30:15,910
I'll go home.

536
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,230
Where are you going?
Do you already know where to go?

537
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,580
I don't know.

538
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,710
Do not go.

539
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,120
Take a little rest here.
I will keep you company.

540
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:41,250
You're the one, right?

541
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:46,690
Who? The person who asked you to
take the photo?

542
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,720
10 seconds. That's the time
I gave you to apologize.

543
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,110
I'll tell you.

544
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:07,920
Who?

545
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,520
What did the detectives say?

546
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:19,910
That evidence is not a legal basis
for convicting the vice president.

547
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:24,610
I know the police don't have enough evidence,

548
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,210
their real goal is
the Jung Hee-joo case.

549
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:35,220
This has nothing to do
with the Vice President,

550
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:38,580
You don't have to worry about that.

551
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:41,270
Good, go.

552
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:01,210
Do you think I have anything
to do with this case?

553
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,450
I will give you a choice.

554
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,110
If you tell
me honestly this time,

555
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,610
I will protect the Vice President
even if I die.

556
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,610
If you miss this moment,

557
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,740
I may not be able to
protect the Vice President.

558
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:40,090
I have no reason
to kill Jeong Hee-Joo, do I?

559
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,060
I'm grateful.

560
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:57,420
Jo Sang-Pil, the one who
made Gangnam gangsters.

561
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,700
Two years ago he was murdered in a hotel room.

562
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:04,900
The one who took over was
the current boss, Goo Jae-Chun.

563
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,810
The Gangnam redevelopment project
is going well for a while.

564
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:10,180
There are two deputy bosses under him,

565
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,620
one of them is Ki Dong-Jae.

566
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:18,050
When Jo Sang-Pil is murdered, we see
Ki Dong-Jae as a strong suspect.

567
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,220
However, the leader of the Rotary faction,
Gangnam Dongpa's rival organization,

568
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,130
arrested for the murder of Jo Sang-Pil.

569
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,030
In the end Ki Dong-Jae was released,

570
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,220
and he now manages a
meat processing company as vice boss.

571
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:31,300
Back then, why was Ki Dong-Jae
a suspect?

572
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:34,720
Because of romance. There was a woman
that Jo Sang-Pil loved,

573
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,610
and Ki Dong-jae touched it.

574
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,470
Did the Rotary leader confess?

575
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:41,310
He didn't confess, but was made
to confess.

576
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,610
Who?

577
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:46,200
Choi Yong-Geun. At that time, was
the head of the Seoul Investigation Team

578
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:50,450
He is now retired due to corruption
and is the head of TJ's legal team.

579
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:54,080
Apparently Ki Dong-Jae and Choi Yong-Geun
they worked together.

580
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,930
How is the atmosphere of Ki Dong-Jae's subordinates?

581
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:58,120
Not kidding.

582
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,320
They seemed like they would stab me
to death if I touched them.

583
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:08,530
This guy is going to catch Ki Dong-Jae.

584
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,700
You killed Jo Sang-Pil right?

585
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:12,610
What?

586
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,610
What? Detective Oh, who is this person?

587
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,640
Expert in the western part of Incheon.

588
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:20,860
What?

589
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,890
You killed Jo Sang-pil to
be the boss right?

590
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:27,730
You were afraid of being stabbed by the underlings, so
you worked with detectives, right?

591
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:31,090
All of that is clear.

592
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,190
This case is long overdue.

593
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:37,830
Then...

594
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:41,880
Why did this man
come and go crazy here?

595
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:43,640
Hey, you know me right?

596
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,280
Every time I start something,
I will keep digging until the end.

597
00:35:48,070 --> 00:35:51,780
I think the Jo Sang-Pil murder case
is still unsolved.

598
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,500
Why did I kill Sang-pil?

599
00:35:55,620 --> 00:36:01,410
I'm so sad that
Jo Sang-Pil's killer hasn't been found yet.

600
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,830
Don't say useless nonsense , raise your hand quickly.

601
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:09,330
These people, what exactly
are you guys doing?

602
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:10,970
Am I a joke?

603
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,370
This bastard. What are you doing?

604
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,620
Let's talk at the office.

605
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,500
Why are you making all the noise
to arrest me?

606
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:18,620
What are you talking about?
Come here.

607
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,050
Be patient. It's too early
to handcuffs.

608
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:25,170
Detective Oh.

609
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:28,360
Can it be frivolous
without evidence like this?

610
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,030
I really won't stay still.

611
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,230
I handcuffed you to keep you quiet.
If you move, you die. Come here.

612
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,170
This is enough for today.

613
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:39,670
That guy wasn't very tough. I will
tell him so he can understand.

614
00:36:43,230 --> 00:36:44,030
Goo Jae-Chun.

615
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,340
Think carefully.

616
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,680
Come to us
and clean it all up.

617
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,790
Until then, we will
follow you forever.

618
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:52,900
Get ready.

619
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,270
The people I hate the most are
people like you.

620
00:36:58,310 --> 00:37:01,280
Blaming others
for everything and making a fuss.

621
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,970
I marked you. I won't
let you go

622
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:17,910
Ah, I've been so unlucky lately.

623
00:37:17,970 --> 00:37:20,150
The flies were constantly
swarming around me.

624
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:22,440
Oh yes, Goo Jae-Chun is here.

625
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:25,530
Yes, he was drinking soju.

626
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,710
Your hands are empty? Want a quiz?

627
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,380
It seemed he had no intention
of running away.

628
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,820
I'll call
you if I see the signs.

629
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:44,270
Hey, boss is coming.

630
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,240
- Yes, hello? Who's this?
- Video calls?

631
00:37:56,770 --> 00:37:59,410
Did you see it?
Yeah, looks like he's been out drinking.

632
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,010
Yes, he is in the middle.

633
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,880
Hey, try to come forward.

634
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,560
Back, back.

635
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,890
Too far.

636
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:12,610
Why don't you guys line up?

637
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:14,630
- Are you guys playing games?
- Hey.

638
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,510
- What are you doing?
- Now the view is good.

639
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,830
- That's enough for today. Let's go.
- Come on.

640
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,720
I'm leaving, Jae-Choon.

641
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,800
You come back.

642
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,420
My goodness.

643
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:31,910
What's the real reason?

644
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:37,230
Now I feel fine.
Did I do something?

645
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:41,540
Detective Oh Ji-hyuk is here.
You know that person.

646
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,750
I'm not the kind of guy who
wants money.

647
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:46,240
Then what is the reason?

648
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:49,010
Do you think I
killed Jo Sang-Pil?

649
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:51,890
Unlucky.

650
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,230
When the detectives came,

651
00:38:55,700 --> 00:39:00,020
they were talking about something
about the detective in charge.

652
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,650
Do you remember?

653
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,360
Yes, I remember.

654
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:07,320
The detective in charge at that time
was Choi Yong-Geun.

655
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,510
Who is our closest subordinate ?

656
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:12,710
he is very close
to Dong-Jae.

657
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,070
Ki Dong-Jae?

658
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,120
It's fixed, right?

659
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,520
Already. Please check.

660
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,700
Everything is in it.

661
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,900
Then that's enough.
Go.

662
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:55,040
Yes, I understand.
Okay.

663
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:04,710
I got information about
the fake cellphone that Jung Hee-Joo called.

664
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:05,990
What?

665
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,470
- Have you checked the location?
- Yes.

666
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:25,520
- How did you get this?
- A woman found it in the park.

667
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,440
Try the phone.

668
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,820
This is a fake cell phone.

669
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:42,030
So Cheon Sang-Woo was
the original owner of this phone.

670
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:46,920
The person who found this phone
was Cheon Na-Na.

671
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,520
Cheon Sang-Woo threw it away,
then was picked up by Cheon Na-Na.

672
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,120
What does all this mean?

673
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,720
We'll know
if we ask, right?

674
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:03,920
You're trying really hard huh.

675
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:07,320
Looks like this could be
an interesting deal.

676
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,400
This is not yet evidence.

677
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:17,520
To catch the perpetrators, there must be
evidence showing the time of the incident.

678
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,400
Victim of violence, Kim Min-Ji.

679
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:21,420
The one manipulating events,
Woo Tae-Ho.

680
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:25,420
Then, the perpetrator of violence,
Cheon Sang-Woo.

681
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,700
Everything would be revealed if
one of them spoke.

682
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:34,810
That means there's no point in
me interfering with this business.

683
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,020
If I...

684
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:40,910
have no evidence of violence,
but evidence of murder...

685
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:42,920
How?

686
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:46,970
What murder case?

687
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:48,820
Jung Hee-Joo's murder case.

688
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:52,310
Does it have anything to do
with our family too?

689
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,900
Before Jung Hee-Joo is killed,
she makes a secret phone call.

690
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:01,610
And that secret cell phone
has been found today.

691
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,400
Then?

692
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,490
The real owner of the phone has
been found.

693
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,700
So, the main suspect of
Jung Hee-Joo's murder case is revealed.

694
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,710
Who is it?

695
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:16,510
The person who went to where the
cell phone was thrown away.

696
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:20,320
We've checked the CCTV
in the park parking lot.

697
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:24,310
We also already know
who took the phone.

698
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,780
What do
you really want?

699
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:40,650
Do you want to hide it?

700
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,930
Or want to reveal everything?

701
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,210
Of course both.

702
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:48,010
I can hide
it if the culprit is exposed.

703
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:51,030
Find out the culprit.

704
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:54,830
If only the two of us knew
who did it,

705
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,850
the price of this transaction will
be much higher.

706
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:05,720
If there is a request from
the West Incheon office,

707
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,520
please follow up.

708
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:13,110
But please check carefully
and report everything to me.

709
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,710
Well. Please cooperate.

710
00:43:27,970 --> 00:43:28,820
Yes

711
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:39,450
Team Leader.

712
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:43,520
Regarding the salary and severance pay of my
predecessor, Jung Hee-Joo.

713
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,920
Everything has been counted.
What's next?

714
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,300
You cashed it all out,

715
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:49,990
then give it directly
to her family members.

716
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:51,040
also

717
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,110
please also give
condolence money from the office.

718
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,010
Which family member should I give
it to?

719
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:06,900
Shouldn't you
find out for yourself?

720
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:08,920
Excuse me.

721
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:13,220
You meet all her family members,
then show your condolences...

722
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:19,820
When you meet them,

723
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,820
show that you
are truly sorry.

724
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:24,840
They will just accept it.

725
00:44:25,390 --> 00:44:26,390
Go ahead

726
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,520
ok

727
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:41,010
Her brother could have been arrested,

728
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:43,720
but her sister, Cheon Na-Na...

729
00:44:43,950 --> 00:44:47,710
actually give us
solid evidence that could harm her brother?

730
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,210
Isn't this ridiculous?

731
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,610
Maybe she wanted to imprison
Cheon Sang-Woo, or...

732
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,710
SHe wanted to have
her brother's weak point.

733
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,810
Are they really siblings?

734
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:59,410
According to the family record,
they are real siblings

735
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:02,100
I really have no idea.

736
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:06,660
I can't understand why
a sister wants to imprison her brother.

737
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:08,920
They don't seem to know
what a real brother is like.

738
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:11,090
Do you know?

739
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,730
- Of course not.
- you Jerk

740
00:45:16,680 --> 00:45:20,520
Do you always show off
your money in front of Eun-Hye?

741
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:27,120
- SHe's not that kind of person.
- You don't have any more advantages.

742
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,220
Absolutely ridiculous.
Really uninteresting.

743
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,420
I don't know why
Eun-Hye is always looking for you.

744
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,900
Hyung,, older brother

745
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,520
don't do tug-of-war.

746
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:45,610
I pulled away a little,
then immediately pulled her to me.

747
00:45:45,630 --> 00:45:48,320
You always pull her
like this, she must not like it.

748
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:54,820
Did Eun-Hye tell you
that she doesn't like me?

749
00:45:57,820 --> 00:46:02,520
You always feel guilty
every time you see Eun-Hye, right?

750
00:46:04,190 --> 00:46:06,610
You have to erase that feeling.

751
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:08,630
I know,

752
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,620
but human feelings
can not easily change.

753
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:24,030
Get rid of him.

754
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,300
- What's this?
- Let's go.

755
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,320
Catch them!

756
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:36,530
Goo Chae-Joon is looking for
Ki Dong-Jae. What do they know?

757
00:46:37,590 --> 00:46:40,320
They will not be
able to walk on both feet.

758
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:44,620
Before Goo Chae-Joon caught
and killed Ki Dong-Jae,

759
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,510
we give them a little lesson.

760
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:53,020
Yes

761
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:54,680
Team Leader.

762
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,640
I arrived at
Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather's shop.

763
00:46:58,030 --> 00:47:00,500
Her grandfather really did not want to accept.

764
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,620
Why can't you
take care of that little thing.

765
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,320
Grandpa always asks to meet you.

766
00:47:07,370 --> 00:47:09,190
Looks like there's something to talk about.

767
00:47:09,290 --> 00:47:11,380
I heard you can't.

768
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:15,290
I heard, he will
look for you all the way to the office.

769
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:17,710
Okay.

770
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,280
He can't come here?

771
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:37,200
Tell him I
'll just come to the office.

772
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:40,120
Please wait a moment.

773
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:47,000
Excuse me.

774
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,630
Halo?

775
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:52,630
I heard you wanted to
talk about something.

776
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:56,830
I saw your photo with Hee-Joo.

777
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:00,820
Can you wait
outside for a moment?

778
00:48:12,490 --> 00:48:15,220
Did you kill Hee-Joo?

779
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:17,200
Not me.

780
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:18,520
Who is it, then?

781
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,230
If it's not you,
tell me who it is.

782
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,620
I do not know.

783
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:29,170
Even if you didn't kill her

784
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:31,510
but she died because of you.

785
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:42,530
Because Hee-Joo likes you?

786
00:48:44,390 --> 00:48:45,310
No

787
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,510
I like Hee-Joo.

788
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,230
You're already married, so why?

789
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:55,620
I'm sorry

790
00:49:06,680 --> 00:49:08,510
When the child dies,

791
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:12,920
are you sad?

792
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,590
Why are you like that?

793
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:24,020
Why do you like Hee-Joo?

794
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:28,720
The police will soon catch the culprit.

795
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,020
I will try to be cooperative
in the investigation.

796
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,780
Forgive me.

797
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:51,110
Team Leader.

798
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:55,950
I'm going first, I have urgent business.

799
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:19,750
Sorry.

800
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,390
Sorry.

801
00:50:29,470 --> 00:50:31,290
I am really, really sorry.

802
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:50,320
Hee-Joo, thank you.

803
00:50:50,490 --> 00:50:52,100
Sorry for holding you back at this hour.

804
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:54,720
This is work related.
No problem.

805
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,590
Yes, sir?

806
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:09,700
Fine, I understand.

807
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,310
I'll have someone
send some cash over there.

808
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:15,050
Please send address

809
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,810
and club name via message...

810
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,510
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

811
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,220
I want to add another bottle of soju.

812
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,390
Okey

813
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,770
Thank you

814
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:45,200
Please drink it all in one gulp.

815
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:58,510
One more glass?

816
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:12,220
I think that's enough.

817
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:14,980
I will drink the rest at home.
You can, right?

818
00:52:54,050 --> 00:52:55,500
Want me to make coffee?

819
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:02,130
Na-Na.

820
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:03,910
I...

821
00:53:05,510 --> 00:53:07,910
Will handcuff Cheon Sang-Woo's hands.

822
00:53:14,030 --> 00:53:15,600
Today I met a detective.

823
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,950
So...

824
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:20,930
Suspect brother for
Jung Hee Joo's murder.

825
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:24,900
But, I think the guilt is too big.

826
00:53:24,930 --> 00:53:26,510
I couldn't handle it either.

827
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:28,020
Just

828
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,190
Wasn't it enough to make big brother
the attacker?

829
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,330
No

830
00:53:34,930 --> 00:53:35,940
Cheon Sang Woo...

831
00:53:37,270 --> 00:53:40,000
If we don't destroy him now
we will be in danger.

832
00:53:42,390 --> 00:53:45,030
Do you also think that big brother
killed Jung Hee-Joo?

833
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:54,800
Do what you want to do.

834
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:57,610
I trust you.

835
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,200
- Hyung ,,older brother .
- Yes

836
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:34,440
You've come.

837
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,060
How have you been lately?

838
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,570
I'm taking a short break.

839
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,100
Your body is fine, right?

840
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:43,130
Yes Play is much more difficult.

841
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:46,400
How about your wife?

842
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:48,510
You guys still live apart?

843
00:54:48,730 --> 00:54:50,400
We still live alone.

844
00:54:50,430 --> 00:54:52,970
Why are you complicating your life
like this?

845
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,020
Why not give a little chance,

846
00:54:56,190 --> 00:54:57,890
and live together again.

847
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,420
I also want to be like that but,

848
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,890
conditions are not possible.

849
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,910
You're really stiff, you know that?

850
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:06,960
You live too looking forward.

851
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:09,480
You should take a look around you.

852
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:12,650
If something falls, you can
pick it up and carry it.

853
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:15,540
You think anyone knows
you live like this?

854
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:17,180
I think so.

855
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,710
A few days ago,

856
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:25,280
I help the children
of TJ's subsidiary,

857
00:55:25,840 --> 00:55:27,230
I got one house.

858
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:31,410
You're really amazing.

859
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:34,410
You live here.

860
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:38,800
Since this is a pulled house, it's
a bit difficult to sell.

861
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:41,660
There's no other meaning,
so don't say No

862
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:42,890
 But this is too ,,

863
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,840
I'll think about it first.

864
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:47,780
Ki-Jin.

865
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,010
yes

866
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,230
Do you know?

867
00:55:52,410 --> 00:55:55,630
How did I feel when I walked into TJ?

868
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,500
They are all thieves.

869
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,690
The difference between them and the petty thieves
we've caught is,

870
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:06,420
the thing they stole
has no owner.

871
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,650
Soon there will be a call
from the Investigation Team.

872
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,810
What?

873
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:15,830
- I'll call you again.
- Wait...

874
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:17,630
Don't think too hard

875
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:19,470
You just need to keep
catching bad guys

876
00:56:19,510 --> 00:56:21,100
and put him in jail.

877
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,410
Yes , sir

878
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,400
I understand

879
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,550
I will be right back.

880
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,900
<i>Night Club</i>

881
00:56:50,670 --> 00:56:51,910
22.

882
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:54,860
<i>Lottery ticket</i>

883
00:56:57,750 --> 00:56:58,780
Next.

884

32.

885
00:57:04,970 --> 00:57:06,010
Carry on.

886
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,830
Are the numbers all correct?

887
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:10,240
Hurry up, next.

888
00:57:11,240 --> 00:57:12,330
Wait.

889
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:13,510
Okay, go ahead.

890
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:15,420
46.

891
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,660
Really?

892
00:57:22,790 --> 00:57:24,830
Let me see. The number is correct?

893
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:27,500
Really rude,
my heart is crazy.

894
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:35,520
At least you're in third place.

895
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:38,380
The prize was over a million won.
You got here amazing.

896
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,210
I know.

897
00:57:41,790 --> 00:57:42,860
I just feel...

898
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,270
My luck seems
to be drained all over here.

899
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:48,830
My life...

900
00:57:49,590 --> 00:57:50,630
Only...

901
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:52,400
Worth a million won alone.

902
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,410
Don't overdo it.

903
00:57:54,520 --> 00:57:57,020
You're just one number short,
no need to reach...

904
00:57:57,090 --> 00:57:58,940
Hey, one of the numbers too...

905
00:58:11,380 --> 00:58:13,070
Quickly Chief...

906
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,240
Get signal.

907
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:17,130
Why? What is it?

908
00:58:51,890 --> 00:58:53,330
Okay.

909
00:58:53,410 --> 00:58:54,830
Pursue him secretly.

910
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:57,620
Call me if you see
anything suspicious.

911
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:03,450
Goo Jae-Chun's men
had also started to move.

912
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:05,630
Seeing Goo Jae-Chun also meddling,

913
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,970
looks like they found, Ki Dong-Jae.

914
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:09,680
I want to know,

915
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:11,220
if Ki Dong-Jae is caught,

916
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,320
what is the name of the high official that will come out
of the mouth of the fool.

917
00:59:15,030 --> 00:59:16,760
It wouldn't be that easy, he said.

918
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,590
If he doesn't want to open his mouth.

919
00:59:18,650 --> 00:59:20,230
Just say we'll let it go.

920
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:22,990
If we let it go,

921
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,280
Goo Jae-Chun will kill Ki Dong-Jae.

922
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,270
So for now
the cell is the safest place.

923
00:59:42,270 --> 00:59:43,790
Why suddenly call me?

924
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:47,040
Chairman McQueen,

925
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:49,000
chose Woo Tae-Ho,

926
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:50,870
as the next TJ Group manager.

927
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:52,560
Woo Tae-Ho?

928
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,570
Does that make sense? He...

929
00:59:54,620 --> 00:59:55,670
Who is he?

930
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,720
Just because McQueen chose Woo Tae Ho,

931
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,140
not that TJ will fall
into the hands of Woo Tae Ho.

932
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:01,810
But...

933
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:05,620
You have to admit that Tae Ho
is one step ahead of you.

934
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:08,480
Na-Na is behind him.

935
01:00:08,530 --> 01:00:09,890
Tae-Ho put the name in front,

936
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,380
and he will think that
he has power.

937
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:13,920
Na-Na is also my family.

938
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:15,910
Not unworthy.

939
01:00:16,510 --> 01:00:17,570
But...

940
01:00:18,780 --> 01:00:20,430
I don't want Na-Na.

941
01:00:21,610 --> 01:00:22,710
He knows that too.

942
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,560
It...

943
01:00:25,960 --> 01:00:28,700
Is the reason I can't forgive him.

944
01:00:30,850 --> 01:00:32,480
I've called him back but,

945
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:35,420
Grandpa said, even if he died, he
didn't want to accept the money.

946
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:40,030
So I just sent
the rest of her salary to her account.

947
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:44,930
Okay. Just handle it like that.

948
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:53,060
Anything else to talk about?

949
01:00:53,890 --> 01:00:54,950
I...

950
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,820
Have thought this through carefully.

951
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,900
Looks like I have to say this.

952
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,230
I happened to see it.

953
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:09,620
The chairman cries because of Jung Hee-Joo.

954
01:01:12,030 --> 01:01:14,080
The chairman likes Jung Hee-Joo, right?

955
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:17,810
<i>That's why,</i>

956
01:01:18,190 --> 01:01:20,900
<i>Chief is very, very sad,</i>

957
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:24,440
<i>and feel guilty
about it, is that true?</i>

958
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:29,300
You don't have to
think too much about my words,

959
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,970
I just want to know your sincerity.

960
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:33,290
Therefore,

961
01:01:33,350 --> 01:01:35,520
my suspicions can disappear.

962
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:39,200
I'm sorry

963
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,340
yes

964
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,600
<i>At McQueen's public meeting,</i>

965
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,810

from the place already discussed.

977

Approximately, 20 people.

1004
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:48,320
First, check where Ki Dong-Jae is.

Just trouble us.

We have to wait for the others.

If we lose them it
will be more troublesome, just go after them.

You are okay. This is nothing.

01:09:59,870 --> 01:10:00,950
You didn't get stabbed by a knife.

1038
01:10:01,290 --> 01:10:02,790
You're not stabbed. Be aware.

Open your eyes.

1040

I told you to wait for us.

1042

Stop being stupid.

01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:25,950
Ji-Woong.

1049
01:11:29,710 --> 01:11:32,570
He went there.

1050
01:11:42,810 --> 01:11:44,200
Are you okay?

1051

He's fine,
you don't have to worry.

1057
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:20,670
Man-Goo is physically strong, you know that.

1058
01:12:21,850 --> 01:12:23,190
Think of yourself first.

1059
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:24,710
He told me to wait.

1060

Man-Goo told me to wait.

1061
01:12:27,910 --> 01:12:29,340
But I forced him.

<i>I think I found
an important clue.</i>

1065
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:32,280
<i>I'm more worried about you
than the police.</i>

1066
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,020
<i>It never occurred to you
that I could throw you away?</i>

1067
01:13:35,070 --> 01:13:37,790
<i>Please tell me where
to touch him so that he hurts.</i>
