<i>Episode  16 </i>

6
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,120
You're currently living in the Lyon Apartments
in Hannam-dong, right?

7
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,160
Looks like you changed the name
recently.

8
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,960
This is an apartment built
by a construction company

9
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:34,420
which is affiliated with TJ Group.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,270
And recently

11
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,310
your wife bought a three-story building.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:43,310
Isn't your wife an
ordinary housewife?

13
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,600
Where did he get
that much money all of a sudden?

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,930
Who takes care of it?

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,910
Choi Yong-geun?

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,000
Cheon Na-Na?

17
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,020
- Who?
- Hey, Detective Jang.

18
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,210
I will ask you

19
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,440
as a senior detective.

20
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,570
Why did you do that?

21
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:09,010
Anyways I have to
check the report,

22
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,790
if it's wrong just say it.

23
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:20,340
You're the Head
of the Seoul Investigation Unit, right?

24
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:25,540
You worked at the Busan Police Station as
a Criminal Team detective for 15 years.

25
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,900
You caught the real culprit in
the serial murders in Ocheon-dong, Busan.

26
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:31,210
3 years ago you were promoted
to the Seoul Investigation Unit

27
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:35,340
for your contribution to catching
the Haeundae Family's murder.

28
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,550
Right?

29
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:41,480
Not long ago, you formed a special team
to catch Lee Sung-Gon

30
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,560
for 3 months.

31
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,820
Don't you want to catch him?

32
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,780
You held on like crazy
for wanting to catch him.

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:51,780
In the end you can't catch it,

34
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,620
and he was taken away
by the wrong people.

35
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,500
Because of that case, you got involved
in the Jung Hee-Joo case.

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,610
Right?

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,100
I asked is it true?

38
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
If you're trying to
catch a killer.

39
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,470
During the hard times you tried to
catch Lee Sung-Gon,

40
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,810
You said you would free
people who died unjustly.

41
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:17,750
That's why you and your team
are defending this case.

42
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:19,070
I'm asking you, damn it!

43
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,240
I asked if that's true, damn it!

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,920
Never mind.

45
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,620
Because nothing matters

46
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,980
- Order him food.
- okey

47
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,450
What do you want to eat?

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,610
The soybean paste stew at this place is delicious.
I recommend it.

49
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,120
I have no thoughts.

50
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,950
After you left,

51
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,490
Jang Ki-Jin asked me for a favor

52
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,620
He will plead guilty to all charges,

53
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,480
so there is no other motive in the report.

54
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,440
He says he did it for the money

55
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,010
Right. Money.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,970
Because of money.

57
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:34,200
That I can understand

58
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,950
As a policeman,

59
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,440
he will tell us
one last thing.

60
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,280
do you know

61
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,200
the most painful memory of my life
as a detective?

62
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:49,240
I know the real culprit.

63
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,530
I knew exactly who he was,
but couldn't catch him.

64
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,980
I think I'm going crazy.

65
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,710
I was very angry

66
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,410
until I bit my tongue so hard I
thought I was going to die.

67
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,660
As a detective,
I will pass on the pain

68
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,770
what I felt at the time.

69
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,230
Jung Hee-Joo

70
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,870
She was killed by Cheon Na-Na.

71
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,280
He must think we can't
catch Cheon Na-Na.

72
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,010
He's not entirely wrong.

73
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,080
The only proof is
Cheon Na-Na's blood left behind

74
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,210
on Jung Hee-Joo's shirt.

75
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:41,350
No motive, no crime scene evidence,
we found nothing.

76
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,330
Even a newly graduated lawyer
can prove

77
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,690
that she is innocent.

78
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,690
I don't care about anything else.

79
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,690
Cheon Na-Na kills Jung Hee-Joo.

80
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,790
That's all that sticks in my head.

81
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,560
As Jang Ki-Jin said,

82
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,300
I will never delete it

83
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:03,350
even if I
bite my tongue and die.

84
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,710
I'm sorry to you.

85
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,390
Forget everything now

86
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,490
and live well.

87
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,090
What about my father?

88
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,260
What about my father?

89
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,800
your father

90
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,620
was a good person.

91
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,750
At that time I was wrong.

92
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,370
Are you going for exersice ?

93
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,170
Soo-Yeon, it's grandpa.

94
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,670
Say hello to grandpa.

95
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,150
Who's she?

96
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:32,810
She's your grand daughter.

97
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:34,630
Your biological grand daughter .

98
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,080
She is my brother's daughter out of wedlock.
Same as me.

99
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,810
That's why I love her more.

100
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,060
Her mother was a woman
he met at a bar earlier.

101
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:50,430
The attack that happened two years ago
was because of her mother...

102
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,830
Enough. I don't need another explanation.

103
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,520
Explain why you
brought the child home.

104
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,380
Of course I had to bring her home.
She is my niece .

105
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,030
With whose permission?

106
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,680
I know dad won't agree.

107
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:05,420
This would be a huge blow to the big
brother's image in prison.

108
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,220
People probably won't
treat brother like a human being

109
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,800
if the mother's child assault case is
known to the world.

110
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,330
I'm a little worried about that.

111
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,580
I got a call from CEO McQueen.

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,480
I would recommend you
as CEO instead of Sang-Woo.

113
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,520
But, that's only possible if dad
raises my hand.

114
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:28,820
If dad is against it, I would
have thought more about Soo-Yeon's problem.

115
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,250
Even this was revealed to the media

116
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,230
and brother got back

117
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,180
maybe there is no place
for my brother to stand.

118
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,560
Send the kid back.

119
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,820
You called me, sir?

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,790
Bong-shik.

121
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,810
I love you, Bong-Shik!

122
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:21,010
Everyone, try to get together.

123
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,980
During this regular personnel appointment

124
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,890
Head of our office

125
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:36,890
promoted to an assistant commissione of the police

126
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,490
I will introduce the person
who will lead TJ Group

127
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,600
to replace me

128
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,320
from today onwards.

129
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,450
Come in.

130
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,220
Please sit.

131
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:23,940
I'm Cheon Na Na.

132
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,890
From now on, TJ Group

133
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,910
not a group that exists
for every family.

134
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,260
Everyone will be a leader

135
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,790
and everyone will be
responsible for the community.

136
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,580
I will stand behind.

137
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:40,110
Please come forward.

138
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,440
Please step by step
advance towards the top.

139
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:48,370
I will give you guys
a round of applause.

140
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,830
I am not the one who determines
the future of TJ Group.

141
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,570
You all decide.

142
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,010
I've done
everything I can do.

143
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,800
This time it's your turn to keep your promise.

144
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:18,780
I will prepare my best
before the trial.

145
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
The best is still not enough.

146
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,770
Shouldn't you be sure?

147
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,600
It's clear that Ki Dong-Jae
didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo.

148
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:29,010
That will be prooven

149
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,250
Who is the real culprit?

150
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,150
If the real culprit comes out,

151
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,910
wouldn't it be obvious
that my son was innocent?

152
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,990
It seems that it will be difficult to prove it
in this trial this time.

153
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,200
Is the real culprit Na-Na?

154
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,160
The odds are high.

155
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:48,990
Both of them

156
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,980
Are my children

157
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,770
Can't you let them both go?

158
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:58,110
If you don't support us this time,

159
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,240
investigation of your daughter
is impossible.

160
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,710
Now you

161
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,890
have to choose one of them.

162
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,450
There was summons by the prosecutor not long ago.

163
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,830
At the next trial,

164
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:30,410
looks like I'll be released
with a suspension.

165
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,030
That's good.

166
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:38,410
By releasing me, it meant that
Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo would be released as well.

167
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,470
Is that possible?

168
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,570
The Honorary President is on the move.

169
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:49,650
It was possible if he
bonded with the detective.

170
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,670
If so, that can't happen.

171
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:55,930
- The evidence of incitement to murder is clear.
- It's very simple.

172
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:01,000
If the detectives only provide evidence
that Ki Dong-Jae

173
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,980
not really who commited the crime

174
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,210
Chairman Cheon will be released although
the real culprit has yet to be identified.

175
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,130
As far as I know,
detectives have a lot of evidence.

176
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,330
You have to get ready.

177
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:19,010
Nothing has changed
even though he is out.

178
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,360
Many things have changed.

179
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,970
The problem is the detectives.

180
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:29,780
What really bothers me is
neither my father nor my brother,

181
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,400
and not the detectives either.

182
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,260
It's you.

183
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,020
Who do you think killed Jung Hee-Joo?

184
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,770
The one who killed Jung Hee-Joo
was Cheon Sang-Woo.

185
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,550
That's all you have to believe.

186
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,200
That's what you think, isn't it?

187
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,030
Of course.

188
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:04,920
It's delicious.

189
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:07,200
Eat as much as you want.

190
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,640
Damn these kids.

191
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,010
Today it's just chicken

192
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:15,200
but if I got this promotion as assistant commissioner

193
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,400
It will be no longer chicken

194
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:19,820
but cows.

195
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,800
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

196
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,710
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

197
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,420
It also feels good to me.

198
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,310
You still haven't given up
on the lottery have you?

199
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:39,080
I've given up, but...

200
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,000
Detective Oh appeared in my dream yesterday,

201
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,500
and he suddenly told
me his six numbers.

202
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:52,080
That makes sense. He gave you
lottery numbers instead of the Gangnam building.

203
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,260
I remember five numbers,

204
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,660
- but can't remember which one.
- What about number 18?

205
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,880
Number 18?

206
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,520
You said it was the number
Detective gave you. Oh?

207
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,670
If the chief becomes assistant commissioner,
the owner of the Gangnam building will go out of business.

208
00:14:08,150 --> 00:14:09,840
That number just popped into my mind.

209
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,280
Eighteen.

210
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,170
That's good.

211
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,100
Hey, here!

212
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,900
Here. If they were a little closer together,
two more people could sit down.

213
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,500
Hey, your shop is lacking if you only have one.

214
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,320
Nothing.
Soon there will be an empty one.

215
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,570
I'm so jealous of you.

216
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,800
Looks like it's an order call.
Please pick up.

217
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,120
Please enjoy.

218
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,470
Hello, this is a chicken restaurant.

219
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:45,530
Of course it can be delivered.

220
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,000
Where? In Seoul?

221
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,710
It seems difficult to send there

222
00:14:51,470 --> 00:14:52,760
because we are in Incheon.

223
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,960
What?

224
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,990
Wait for a while.

225
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,130
This is from TJ Group's headquarters.

226
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,240
They ordered chicken ,, what does that mean ?

227
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,650
They saw us
and told us to drop off.

228
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,590
Cheon Na-Na.

229
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,590
What is she really planning ?

230
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:23,840
Everything that is happening
around you right now

231
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:26,780
is because of you.

232
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,080
That was a warning.

233
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:38,010
If we keep bothering Cheon Na-Na,
maybe she will touch your family.

234
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:53,900
It's delicious.

235
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,710
Did you order
from Seoul to Incheon on purpose

236
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,580
because you know my sister
runs a chicken restaurant?

237
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,690
I'll spread the word later.

238
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,200
- It will be more in demand from now on.
- It's selling well now.

239
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:08,680
You don't need to care.

240
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,930
I owe you,
so I have to pay it.

241
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,000
What do you mean you owe me?

242
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,280
Does it mean something good
or something bad?

243
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,390
It's delicious.

244
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,140
But, I don't eat much.

245
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,760
I investigated a bit
about my brother's trial.

246
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,520
I saw Detective Oh's name
on the lawyer's witness.

247
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,740
Aren't you supposed
to be the prosecutor's witness?

248
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,260
The one who killed Jung Hee-Joo
was not Ki Dong-Jae.

249
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,420
Cheon Na-Na was the one who killed her

250
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,680
Of course, I must appear as a witness
and free Cheon Sang-Woo.

251
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,280
Hey.

252
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,020
Brother stay silent this time

253
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:55,090
Even if you object,
I will still reveal it.

254
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:58,160
Am I the culprit?

255
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,490
Does Detective Kang
think so too?

256
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,500
I'm the only one who believes.

257
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,930
You're the culprit.

258
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,540
Hey.

259
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,030
No proof yet...

260
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:20,430
Sorry, but I can't hear you.
I can't trust you either.

261
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:22,630
What?

262
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:24,120
Wait and see.

263
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,580
I'm sure I'll prove
that I'm right.

264
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:32,490
- Won't you regret it?
- Of course.

265
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,070
So you have to let my brother go?

266
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,670
I'm just doing it according to the law.

267
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,090
Think carefully.

268
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,510
Let's see if it's right
to let my brother go.

269
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,190
I'm afraid you'll play
by the rules of the game

270
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,980
which I have set.

271
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,130
Do not take it wrong.

272
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,100
It's not me playing games, it's you.

273
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:03,020
Before Dong-Jae died,

274
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,500
he said he didn't
kill Jung Hee-Joo.

275
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,330
- There's evidence too.
- What is the proof?

276
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:12,150
He says he left it
to his brother.

277
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,420
Dong-Jae didn't leave it to me,

278
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,280
but he hid it.

279
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:20,230
Have you confirmed it?

280
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,160
Yes. It was clothes and shoes
with blood on them.

281
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,130
Well. I see.

282
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,230
Please play the recording.

283
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,280
This is a recorded conversation

284
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,540
between Ki Dong-Jae and Choi Yong-Geun
who left Jung Hee-Joo's body.

285
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,120
<i>Drive enough cars </i>

286
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:42,760
<i>then submerge it in water.</i>

287
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:44,730
<i>Even if it is thrown away or burned, the DNA is still there.</i>

288
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,930
<i>Must be drowned.</i>

289
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:49,260
<i>Do you have any physical evidence before
drowning him? Check thoroughly.</i>

290
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,140
<i>Burn all your things
to ashes.</i>

291
00:18:53,510 --> 00:18:54,730
<i>Fine. I understand.</i>

292
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,480
As per Choi Yong-Geun's orders,
Ki Dong-Jae omitted the evidence

293
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,040
that he dumped Jung Hee-Joo's body.

294
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,720
But, why Ki Dong-Jae

295
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:07,790
left the victim's clothes and shoes ?

296
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,000
Before he died, Dong-Jae said
he was hiding something.

297
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,690
I told him that if he
threatened someone with that,

298
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,320
he can take the money.

299
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,360
Well. Thank you

300
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,820
He killed Jung Hee-Joo,

301
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:22,750
then put on the victim's clothes
and shoes,

302
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,120
which will be the most decisive evidence
of the crime,

303
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:26,260
as a means of intimidation.

304
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,710
Isn't that contradictory?

305
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,120
Among the evidence we collected
during the investagation

306
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,470
there was no direct evidence that
Ki Dong-Jae killed Jung Hee-Joo.

307
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:57,270
I heard that the Criminal Team 2
in the West Office of Incheon

308
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,810
continue to investigate
Jung Hee-Joo's murder.

309
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:00,910
What is the reason?

310
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:02,450
That's because

311
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,660
We questioned the fact

312
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,330
that Dong-Jae killed Jung Hee-Joo.

313
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,570
In that case,

314
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,360
did you admit that
the investigation was wrong at the time?

315
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,280
Yes

316
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,960
Actually,

317
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:26,970
it is not easy for detectives
to admit the fault of the investigation.

318
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,900
That must be a big burden.

319
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,270
But,

320
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,160
why do you admit your mistake?

321
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:43,470
At the time, I didn't think I was wrong.

322
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:44,810
Now

323
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,340
I think that I was wrong.

324
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,510
Now

325
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,140
I think that I was wrong.

326
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,940
Are you satisfied with the outcome of the trial?

327
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,800
Please say something to the community.

328
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:23,630
As a socially responsible leader ,

329
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,750
I am very sorry
to have caused such a stir.

330
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:30,810
I admit my mistakes
and I will reflect on myself.

331
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:38,810
And I want to convey
my respect to the judges

332
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,810
which gave me a fair trial.

333
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,940
Today,

334
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,300
I feel that the law is
fair to everyone.

335
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,760
<i>Thank you.</i>

336
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,030
<i>One more thing,</i>

337
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,310
<i>I would like to thank
the investagetors  for their courage</i>

338
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,320
<i>to admit their wrong investigation
and exonerate me.</i>

339
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,030
No need to watch

340
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:05,710
I really want to hit everyone.

341
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:08,550
Why did you take us
at the last minute?

342
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,470
Do we ask him to
say thank you?

343
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:13,310
What does thank you mean?
He's kidding us, isn't he?

344
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:14,620
Comments have started to appear.

345
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:16,870
The legal basis has not changed.

346
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:19,160
Laws for the rich
and laws for the poor.

347
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,540
These are all swear words.

348
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,790
There is one compliment for us.

349
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,360
Our police officers fully
guarantee human rights

350
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,940
for rich kids.

351
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,530
Netizens will make us
suffer a lot from now on.

352
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:35,120
Looks like it's already started.

353
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:37,430
Where?

354
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,470
A group of scum that took
out the leader

355
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:42,220
after receiving money from the conglomerate.

356
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,820
His facial features look good.

357
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:51,890
If it's like this, it wouldn't be strange if
one of us got stabbed in the street.

358
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:53,740
Hello

359
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,450
What are you doing here?

360
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,280
<i>Letter of Lawsuit</i>

361
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,530
<i>Defendant: Cheon Sang-Woo</i>

362
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,960
A lawsuit has been filed.

363
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,760
We will continue our investigation soon.

364
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,030
Well. If so, I say goodbye.

365
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,960
Thank you for your time.

366
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,580
Be careful on the road.

367
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,590
Cheon Sang-Woo admits to the
assault case of Kim Min-Ji at the trial.

368
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,830
Even if she doesn't sue, we'll
continue on our own. Why should she?

369
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,500
That's not bad for us.

370
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,320
If there is a victim's complaint, the
investigation will proceed more quickly.

371
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,800
But, why did he have to
do it at this point?

372
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,830
Right after Cheon Sang-Woo was released .

373
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,170
This is the characteristic of Cheon Na-Na.

374
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,580
Before being hit in the back of the head,
stalking, then hitting first.

375
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm thinking of bringing in
and raising Soo-Yeon.

376
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:58,130
- What do you think?
- What?

377
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,050
For the sake of her future, wouldn't it be better
if she was handed over to us?

378
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:05,220
No.  you can't .  I will never.

379
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,570
Will never.

380
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,970
It would be much less profitable for
you if she went to the father's side.

381
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,600
Please.

382
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,940
Let me raise Soo-Yeon.

383
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,230
Help.

384
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:19,140
Hasn't my brother been released?

385
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,950
If my brother was still in prison,
he might not know.

386
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,410
There's no reason for us
to give up on Soo-Yeon.

387
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:27,400
What

388
00:24:30,390 --> 00:24:32,000
what should i do?

389
00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:40,740
Thank you

390
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,000
Mother has come. Let us go home.

391
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,080
Come on. Oh, my daughter

392
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,860
Thank you Come on, Soo-Yeon.

393
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,800
Soo-Yeon.

394
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,700
You only have a mother.

395
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,260
You don't have grandparents and aunts.

396
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,410
And you don't have a father either.

397
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,450
for you

398
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,680
there is only mother.

399
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,650
You understand?

400
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,730
Soo-Yeon just lives with her mother.

401
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:19,390
You can't go anywhere.

402
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,090
<i>Congratulations on your success</i>
<i></i><i>as the new head of TJ Group.</i>

403
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,580
Thank you

404
00:25:30,770 --> 00:25:35,140
<i>I was very impressed with TJ's share price</i>
<i></i><i>it went up more than I expected.</i>

405
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:39,860
<i>Perhaps the leader's bold decision</i>
<i></i><i>to sell played a big role.</i>

406
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,230
Purchasing a Japanese retail company
was a mistake made

407
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,040
former Chairman Chun Sang-Woo.

408
00:25:45,430 --> 00:25:47,250
It was a company
that should have been sold.

409
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,680
Without hesitation.

410
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:53,710
<i>TJ Group Chairman Cheon Na-Na is listed</i>
<i></i><i>WCN as "50 Female CEOs in the World"</i>

411
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,480
She's great. She looks good...

412
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,620
Na-Na.

413
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,690
For the time being, let's just let
things go to Na-na.

414
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:06,590
Actually, from the company's point of view,
her capabilities are quite good.

415
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,260
Father.

416
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:14,200
On the shirt of the late Jung Hee-Joo
is Na-na's DNA.

417
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,070
Na-Na who killed her.

418
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:19,470
She hid it
and made me look like a killer.

419
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:20,880
I know that clearly.

420
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,880
How can I let her ?

421
00:26:24,010 --> 00:26:25,040
Then?

422
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:29,080
You're going to destroy each other again
Sibling's fight?

423
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,690
You'll only be satisfied
when TJ is crushed in your hands?

424
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,660
Why must it be destroyed?

425
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:37,760
I have no such thoughts, Father.

426
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,860
I...

427
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:45,230
Just want to meet Na-Na and
ask her to pay attention to me.

428
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,740
"I will live in peace,
mind your own business."

429
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,310
"Never mind me."

430
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,060
Like that.

431
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,580
Honestly right now...

432
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,350
I am no match for Na-Na.

433
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:00,940
I admit that.

434
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,590
<i>Stop the impartial investigation!</i>

435
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,490
<i>Stop it!</i>

436
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,110
<i>Imprison of Cheon Sang-Woo again!</i>

437
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,970
<i>Imprison</i>

438
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,700
<i>Cheon Sang-Woo is the killer!</i>

439
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,380
<i>Prison for Cheon Sang-Woo!</i>

440
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:22,040
<i>Imprison</i>

441
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:24,840
Why did they do that.

442
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:27,810
Turn the car around.

443
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:42,290
Head Office, be careful!

444
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,290
Until yesterday,

445
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:49,900
The chances of me getting promoted
to Assistant Commissioner were 100%.

446
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:52,500
- Team Leader Woo.
- Yes.

447
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,320
What are the chances of
me getting promoted in this trash situation?

448
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,280
That's... Maybe because the cases that are handled
are always finished...

449
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,000
So what percentage?

450
00:28:02,610 --> 00:28:04,650
Maybe 10... 23%?

451
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,580
Honestly, objectively.

452
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,240
Objectively, maybe seven?

453
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,410
- You want to die?
- 0.7%?

454
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,390
Thanks to you,

455
00:28:14,670 --> 00:28:16,690
I look lazy again.

456
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,070
I would be quite satisfied with that title.

457
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,400
So you do whatever
you want.

458
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,100
Up to you.

459
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,100
You investigate TJ's office
without a warrant.

460
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,540
Then you arrest the people
who have to confess,

461
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,780
and tormented them.

462
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,110
Beat them until they confess!

463
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,480
You guys are going back to the police days
of 1988.

464
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,590
You guys ruined your hard work

465
00:28:38,070 --> 00:28:40,850
and all that has been attempted
must be restarted from the beginning.

466
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,660
Kang Do-Chang.

467
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,630
Fun, right?

468
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,190
This is your favourite.

469
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:49,960
No... I'm not that bad.

470
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,150
What do you mean?

471
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
You guys can do that.

472
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,230
You...

473
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,330
In the history of the police,
you are the one who humiliated us the most.

474
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,150
Okay.

475
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,470
Let us...

476
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:06,210
united,

477
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,210
get fired.

478
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:11,170
Because of that,

479
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:14,650
until we become building owners
in Gangnam,

480
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:18,350
let's unite
and do all the bullshit.

481
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,010
What do you think ?

482
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:22,860
I am not kidding! This is serious!

483
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,580
We understand what that means.

484
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,990
We will try

485
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,300
do that shit
with no regrets.

486
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,750
Respect!

487
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,720
Mr building owner,

488
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,580
No complaints right?

489
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,540
Yes! No complaints! Respect!

490
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,840
If it doesn't meet the call,
we will send again.

491
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,110
If three times do not work,

492
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,310
we will invite force.

493
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,500
can i come in

494
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,460
congratulations

495
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:34,230
Congrats for what.

496
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,070
It's all because of the Chairman of course.

497
00:30:45,770 --> 00:30:48,170
My office was left alone...

498
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,210
Thanks for that.

499
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,350
You've had a lot of trouble.

500
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:56,920
Whenever it  helped me at the company.

501
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,920
I will receive
you whenever you are ready.

502
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,700
Of course.

503
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,470
You did well,

504
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,340
Of course I have to help you.

505
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,440
In the end the result was good.

506
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:08,730
- That's why we...
- Right.

507
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:10,660
Now...

508
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:14,000
We don't have to fight
or beat each other anymore.

509
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:18,570
I've been living comfortably all this time.

510
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,780
You're very helpful on this.

511
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,310
I can still live.

512
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,480
I'm grateful.

513
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,580
And for Kim Min-Ji's case...

514
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,790
For the Kim Min-Ji attack case,

515
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,890
I want to pay for my mistakes.
So that I can feel calm.

516
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:38,430
I really became a human!

517
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:44,230
By reaching to this stage,

518
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,590
you were so great.

519
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:49,240
I must temporarily
leave my position...

520
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,510
Oh yes, one more thing.

521
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,280
If I come back,

522
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,090
leave one place for me.

523
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:01,920
can you ....

524
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,250
do that, right?

525
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,900
Of course.

526
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,890
You must always be careful.

527
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:15,230
If you fall too,
TJ will really be over.

528
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,830
Okay.

529
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,170
I'm really grateful.

530
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,070
This really wakes you up.

531
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,420
I...

532
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:30,750
Now I know my position.

533
00:32:47,930 --> 00:32:49,550
- Would you like to try?
- No

534
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,570
Please enjoy yourself.

535
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,400
I'm not happy.

536
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,410
'Cause this time I got help,

537
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:02,490
I want to reply.

538
00:33:03,110 --> 00:33:05,250
- What should I give?
- No need.

539
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,850
You just cooperate
in the assault case.

540
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,570
What you both want

541
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,100
isn't it to find the real culprit
in Jung Hee-Joo's murder case?

542
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:15,130
Although we all already know that.

543
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,430
There's DNA on the victim's shirt,

544
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,780
It cannot be evidence
because it can be considered manipulation.

545
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,710
And some of Woo Tae-Ho's killer fingerprints

546
00:33:24,130 --> 00:33:27,800
also found, but the explanation is lacking.

547
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:31,990
There is also no motive for the killer.

548
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,310
Must be a burden at the police station.

549
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,630
You find out a lot of things huh.

550
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:39,700
I don't have a job.
That's why I found out

551
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,520
and match the case
from start to finish.

552
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:45,190
The culprit killed Jung Hee-Joo.

553
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,590
And her body was left
in the special police unit.

554
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:48,750
Subtitles are provided by Summer Fouad

555
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:49,880
Is it possible

556
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:54,130
she was not worried that the victim's body
would be discovered and investigated.

557
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:59,820
Why? Because Cheon Sang-Woo had
the recorded data at the scene where the murder took place.

558
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:03,610
Later we will use it
to attack Cheon Sang-Woo.

559
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:08,740
The plan that the perpetrator made
was perfect. But...

560
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:11,950
There is one gap.

561
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:16,180
The scenario was originally created by the perpetrator,

562
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,350
but, next scenario

563
00:34:20,090 --> 00:34:22,080
made by others.

564
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,560
That is cooperation.

565
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:26,900
What if...

566
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,930
This guy

567
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,770
in a very stressful situation

568
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,620
he confessed?

569
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,940
Are you talking about Choi Yong-Geun?

570
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,810
You're not going to eat this cake?

571
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,310
It's very tasty.

572
00:34:49,450 --> 00:34:52,150
This time he would make a scenario
together with Cheon Sang-Woo.

573
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,380
The important thing is that they have the same goal.

574
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:57,030
He teamed up with Choi Sang-Woo?

575
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,510
You're the one who said that
catching gangsters should be with gangsters.

576
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,220
And the killer...

577
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,470
Will catch the killer.

578
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,910
We have been looking for a borrowed account
to send money to Choi Yong-Geun.

579
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,870
Really?

580
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,380
do you know

581
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,240
someone who takes care of finances

582
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,900
in the police?

583
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:23,120
Yes, I know someone
at the Central Police Academy.

584
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,760
Report it to the police.

585
00:35:25,050 --> 00:35:27,290
We know the borrowed account.

586
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,230
I'm serious.

587
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:03,260
Yes, with Choi Yong-Geun here.

588
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,590
<i>Meet me.</i>

589
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,760
Fine, I understand.

590
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:14,800
You should have called me.

591
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,510
Even though you know I'm out.

592
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,680
You are.

593
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,240
I feel sad.

594
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,510
Forgive me.

595
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:26,830
Is there something happened ?

596
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,010
Just before I came here,

597
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,320
something happened.

598
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,430
What?

599
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,120
What happen...

600
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,190
Something dangerous?

601
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:40,420
- Don't you know that too?
- What?

602
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:42,980
Me?

603
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,800
Am I suspicious?

604
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,570
Are you afraid I will kill you?

605
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:50,870
Then again

606
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,540
you can think so.

607
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:57,310
Seeing what you did
at the trial, it's only natural.

608
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:03,390
But than me,
doesn't Na-Na look more desperate?

609
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:07,360
Everything will be closed tightly
if you die.

610
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:09,350
Okay.

611
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,860
Please choose.

612
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,530
I? Or Na-Na?

613
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:16,830
Who do you want to kill?

614
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,020
Sir

615
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,470
Your words are quite exaggerated.

616
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:25,690
I already know
the money Na-Na sent you.

617
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:32,180
If I tell the police, the
money will just evaporate.

618
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,870
Reveal all the secrets

619
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:38,180
which Na-Na hides.

620
00:37:38,350 --> 00:37:43,760
Then I'll release evidence
of what's in your account.

621
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:49,660
Na-Na biting like a dog

622
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:53,180
even killed her own husband.

623
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:58,210
If the investigation continues,
you will also be like Woo Tae-Ho.

624
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:05,960
Why are you nervous?

625
00:38:10,550 --> 00:38:13,360
You're afraid I'm recording this, aren't you?

626
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,860
It's okay, you don't have to worry.

627
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:21,460
The CCTV you installed in my room
for Na-Na

628
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:23,650
I've removed it.

629
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,270
But why am I speaking secretly?

630
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,580
Judging from the news, the investigation
into the loan account has already started.

631
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,280
Will our account be found out?

632
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,890
Cheon Na-Na is already the Chairman.

633
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,460
We will try to protect it.
I will also be the President.

634
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,050
Don't worry.

635
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,560
Please don't trust too much

636
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:56,700
Cheon Na-Na.

637
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,300
This time it
was Cheon Sang-Woo who made the move, not Cheon Na-Na.

638
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,360
After being here,
I can only believe Cheon Na-Na.

639
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,540
Because of that,

640
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,580
wait a minute

641
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,780
No one can touch the money.

642
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:16,380
You just think
you'll be out in a minute.

643
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,060
I will take care of this money.

644
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:20,690
Don't worry about me.

645
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,530
There's something else
that Cheon Na-Na keeps with me.

646
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,650
Besides, I won't be able to get
out of here that easily.

647
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:30,600
I will give my share
to my family.

648
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,240
That's enough for me.

649
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:35,190
Is there anything else
that Cheon Na-Na has with you?

650
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,910
The one I have to follow isn't you,

651
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:40,140
but myself, that's what I mean.

652
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,980
I can leave you anytime.

653
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,980
That's also in my point.

654
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,590
What happened to Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather,

655
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,090
is the thing that Cheon Na-Na told me to do.

656
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:55,760
You have to be careful too.

657
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,110
Why?

658
00:40:01,730 --> 00:40:03,040
Think carefully.

659
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,030
There are 4 people who know about this case.

660
00:40:06,470 --> 00:40:08,670
Ki Dong-Jae, Woo Tae-Ho, Cheon Na-Na,

661
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,300
then

662
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:12,220
you

663
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,480
Ki Dong-Jae and Woo Tae-Ho
are dead.

664
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,450
Besides Cheon Na-Na

665
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:20,920
only you are left.

666
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:33,460
I am Im Cha-Sung, director of
Taejoo Construction.

667
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,260
Please help.

668
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:53,680
I'm TJ's director of distribution
and transportation, Choi Yong-Geun.

669
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,630
I'm still lacking in many ways.

670
00:40:57,050 --> 00:40:59,950
Please accept my expertise

671
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:27,700
I can't see it.
Try to see.

672
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,140
<i>Im Cha-Sung: Director Taejoo Construction</i>

673
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:28,710
<i>Choi Yong-Geun: Director</i>
<i></i><i>TJ Transportation and Distribution</i>

674
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,990
- Detective, there's a package.
- Well.

675
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:41,130
Why? What is it?

676
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:43,970
Impossible!

677
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:47,300
Will you do it again?
That doesn't make sense.

678
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,580
not only one,

679
00:41:48,770 --> 00:41:54,460
The five numbers that Ji-Hyeok gave were wrong,
and Jae-Hong... out of 18 only got one right.

680
00:41:59,710 --> 00:42:01,620
Why? What is my fault?

681
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,020
What's that?

682
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,780
- Bulletproof vest.
- You have one already, why?

683
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,910
This was specially given from the FBI.
I got a special delivery.

684
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,440
Very arrogant.

685
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,230
- Why did you buy that?
- The Team Leader said.

686
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,970
Now it's not strange
that I got suddenly stabbed by a knife.

687
00:42:22,330 --> 00:42:23,540
I'm just getting ready.

688
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,050
- Stronger.
- More?

689
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,120
Yes

690
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:36,020
Try to stab him straight away.

691
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,120
You will do well.

692
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:41,460
Don't feel pressured,
do it comfortably.

693
00:42:41,870 --> 00:42:43,490
Fine, I understand.

694
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:46,900
We don't have to hide anymore,
you're a director now.

695
00:42:47,890 --> 00:42:51,100
You just have to add  the number you want
in that area.

696
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:52,430
Yes thank you.

697
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,500
I also thank you.

698
00:42:55,870 --> 00:42:58,760
I was able to get to this point,
all because of you.

699
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,640
I'm more grateful
that you think so.

700
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,350
To be honest,

701
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,620
I only gave the title of President only.

702
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:12,790
Like now, be my shadow.

703
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:16,160
With that I will feel safe
and be able to survive in this place.

704
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:19,830
I understand that too.

705
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:22,060
Yes. Please go.

706
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,500
We'll see you later.

707
00:43:28,370 --> 00:43:29,520
Director Choi.

708
00:43:33,710 --> 00:43:34,980
Becomes a detective

709
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,150
very difficult, right?

710
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,760
You must know because you've tried it.

711
00:43:41,450 --> 00:43:44,650
The detective put his life on the line.

712
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:46,770
Yes, sort of.

713
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,670
Did any of your friends die too?

714
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:54,300
yes

715
00:43:56,930 --> 00:44:00,900
So it seems.
Because it's dirty work.

716
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,980
There will be a lot of people
who want to kill the detective huh?

717
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,610
Right ?

718
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:27,100
<i>Please choose.</i>

719
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,800
You want to be killed by me or Na-Na?

720
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,750
This is Oh Ji-Hyeok from
the Incheon office's Criminal Team.

721
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:53,820
I'm Choi Yong-Geun.

722
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,390
yes

723
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,690
Is there something?

724
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,800
There's something I want to give you.

725
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,000
What is it ?

726
00:45:04,730 --> 00:45:06,740
Data recording of Cheon Na-Na.

727
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:09,620
Everything you want to know is there.

728
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,740
- Why all of a sudden?
- I want to live.

729
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,910
This is the only way to save me.

730
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:20,140
All right, where do you want to meet?

731
00:45:20,370 --> 00:45:23,120
Where we used to be when we caught
Park Ji-Kwang,

732
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:27,340
do you remember where it is?

733
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,030
Yes, I remember.

734
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,580
This is not the way to the office.

735
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,620
Where are you going, Oh Ji-Hyeok?

736
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,080
I found out about Park Ji-Gwang,

737
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:43,560
He just came out not long ago,
he went back to the junkyard.

738
00:47:43,590 --> 00:47:44,810
Okay, thank you.

739
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,800
Do you remember when we
caught Park Ji-Sung?

740
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:55,400
He's out.
If he shows up, you will be killed.

741
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,940
Why do you still remember that?

742
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,870
You will kill me

743
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:04,880
and blame Park Ji-Kwang for it?

744
00:48:07,110 --> 00:48:10,320
Why did you forget
what you learned as a detective?

745
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,690
Attacking the police is
a big problem

746
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,240
Because you are on probation, the
punishment would be bigger.

747
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:29,400
Where's the data you told me?

748
00:48:32,370 --> 00:48:33,540
No such thing huh?

749
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:38,950
If so, do it.

750
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,780
I'll give you a chance
to think.

751
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,240
What is it?

752
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:31,870
I got into trouble
while trying to catch Ji-Hyeok.

753
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:35,020
In the end he escaped.

754
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,530
Maybe it'll be a mess later
because he'll be looking for me.

755
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:42,510
My face is exposed.

756
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,320
Why did you say that to me?

757
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,320
I have to hide
for a while.

758
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:58,090
I won't get caught because I know
how detectives do investigations.

759
00:49:59,890 --> 00:50:01,360
But you are the problem.

760
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,970
You will find me no matter what.

761
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:13,130
I need security guarantees.

762
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,150
Please say it directly
with your own mouth

763
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:21,330
that you're the one
who killed Jung Hee-Joo.

764
00:50:22,650 --> 00:50:27,300
I'll take it as a promise
that you won't kill me later.

765
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,860
I killed Jung Hee-Joo?

766
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,430
What does that mean?

767
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,260
you gave

768
00:50:37,330 --> 00:50:38,630
Jung Hee-Joo's corpse

769
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,240
to me

770
00:50:44,300 --> 00:50:45,710
I told you.

771
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,510
I didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo.

772
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:53,450
I told you,
I didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo!

773
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,120
I am very tired.

774
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:04,470
Then I must surrender.

775
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,940
I have to go to jail,

776
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,270
but maybe it's better there.

777
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,650
Because we're both going to be in jail.

778
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:17,810
There's no evidence I killed Jung Hee-Joo.

779
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:21,110
Whatever you say,
I won't get caught.

780
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:24,400
Want to see the story of who will win
in court?

781
00:51:25,330 --> 00:51:27,100
If I give my testimony

782
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,100
about the motive for the murder, the crime scene,

783
00:51:29,270 --> 00:51:31,530
and your blood that's
on Jung Hee-Joo's shirt,

784
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:35,420
seems to explain everything.

785
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,850
Why?

786
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:43,670
Why don't you believe what I say?

787
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:45,420
So.

788
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,840
Try to make me believe.

789
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,260
You never explain to me

790
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,880
who killed her

791
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:58,250
or how you killed her , right?

792
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:03,300
we have to have things to share with
each other to trust each other.

793
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,670
There is something to tell ,, isn't there ?

794
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:16,200
It was an accident.

795
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,970
That girl injured herself

796
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:28,910
I was a detective.

797
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,020
At first glance, it wasn't an
external injury from an accident.

798
00:52:33,870 --> 00:52:34,980
Someone

799
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,680
hit her from behind
with a blunt object.

800
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,920
I killed her

801
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,370
Now the only person who knows that

802
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,300
me and you.

803
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:59,420
us both.

804
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:01,540
Enough, right?

805
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:06,110
We are a couple who
have to trust each other.

806
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:09,300
Okay.

807
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:11,180
That is true.

808
00:53:14,290 --> 00:53:15,480
Okay.

809
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,840
Although unfortunate,

810
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:23,350
I will trust you once again.

811
00:53:26,570 --> 00:53:29,570
If anything
suspicious happens to me,

812
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:32,760
I'm going straight to the police station.

813
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:34,500
Excuse me.

814
00:53:50,090 --> 00:53:51,640
I will kill you!

815
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,290
I will kill you!

816
00:53:54,530 --> 00:53:57,410
I will kill anyone
who chokes me.

817
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,530
I'll kill you all!

818
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,140
You are crazy! Damn!

819
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,350
What is it?

820
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:35,230
What were you doing at
the office so late tonight?

821
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:37,350
Do you have a lot of work?

822
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:41,300
My goodness.

823
00:54:41,990 --> 00:54:46,020
Looks like we have to buy a new phone
for our CEO Choi Yong-Geun.

824
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,260
Na-Na,

825
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,500
You can't

826
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:59,610
throw, stomp and kill

827
00:55:00,510 --> 00:55:02,150
just because you don't like it.

828
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:04,020
Right?

829
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,060
Where's that?

830
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,680
Hey!

831
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:56,050
She's so noisy.

832
00:56:14,610 --> 00:56:16,380
yes. Thank you

833
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,560
Yes

834
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:23,960
TJ search and seizure warrant

835
00:56:24,720 --> 00:56:25,810
has been issued out.

836
00:56:28,380 --> 00:56:32,450
Lately, why are
warrant applications dropping so fast?

837
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,700
It's not fun like this.

838
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:37,060
So. We just have
to go and search everything.

839
00:56:37,490 --> 00:56:39,240
Then we won't be fired?

840
00:56:39,290 --> 00:56:41,630
Don't talk too much and
just be prepared for foreclosure.

841
00:56:42,380 --> 00:56:43,760
Have you told
that person?

842
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,090
He's not going to storm off to get in the
way again, is he?

843
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:48,140
Yes. He would leave
the door open and wait.

844
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:04,560
This is a search and seizure warrant .

845
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:05,960
Please cooperate.

846
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:08,650
Yes, do as you please.

847
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,690
<i>I killed her</i>

848
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,090
<i>Now who knows that</i>

849
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:28,870
<i>You and  I</i>

850
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:31,270
Us both

851
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:33,500
<i>Enough, right?</i>

852
00:57:34,890 --> 00:57:37,850
<i>We are a couple who</i>
<i></i><i>must trust each other.</i>

853
00:57:38,690 --> 00:57:39,990
All of these

854
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,720
has it been disclosed?

855
00:57:41,830 --> 00:57:43,800
It's Choi Yong-geun

856
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:46,380
really a detective.

857
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,010
He did what he should.

858
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,720
Hand over
this recording to the prosecutor

859
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,140
and catch him immediately

860
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:56,370
after receiving the warrant.

861
00:58:17,640 --> 00:58:18,920
<i>Cheon Sang-Woo</i>

862
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:23,930
<i>I killed her.</i>

863
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,730
<i>Now who knows that</i>

864
00:58:28,790 --> 00:58:30,070
<i>me and you.</i>

865
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:31,560
<i>The two of us.</i>

866
00:58:31,910 --> 00:58:33,190
<i>Enough, right?</i>

867
00:58:33,780 --> 00:58:34,910
<i>Cheon Sang-Woo sent a picture</i>

868
00:58:42,670 --> 00:58:43,920
<i>Good luck.</i>

869
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:05,450
She already knew.

870
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:08,020
If the video is already in our hands.

871
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,710
Could it be that she left
her cell phone at the villa?

872
00:59:13,370 --> 00:59:14,860
To escape from our pursuit.

873
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:16,490
That's not Cheon Na-Na's style.

874
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:18,910
She doesn't run away, she
will be there.

875
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:22,140
The place where Cheon Na-Na is now
is the place where her mother died.

876
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:24,790
It was also where she murdered someone

877
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,160
Looks like we need
to prepare for an emergency.

878
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:55,880
How about this? Just hack it?

879
00:59:55,910 --> 00:59:58,120
Are you sure she's in there?

880
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,930
Where are you?

881
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:06,910
A warrant has been issued.

882
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:08,970
Let us in

883
01:00:09,720 --> 01:00:11,260
You can
talk about it there.

884
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,370
Why?

885
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:15,020
Why me?

886
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,190
Not me.

887
01:00:18,010 --> 01:00:20,360
Jung Hee-Joo was killed by Cheon Sang-Woo.

888
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:22,710
Not me, but Cheon Sang-Woo!!

889
01:00:26,150 --> 01:00:28,330
<i>I tried</i>
<i></i><i>to save Jung Hee-Joo</i>

890
01:00:28,860 --> 01:00:30,920
<i>I tried to save her.</i>

891
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:34,020
<i>Shit!</i>

892
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,630
<i>Kill Jung Hee-Joo!</i>

893
01:00:43,970 --> 01:00:47,360
<i>I will give you whatever money </i>
<i></i><i>you ask for.</i>

894
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:49,840
<i>Kill Jung Hee-Joo!</i>

895
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,990
<i>I will take care of the rest.</i>

896
01:00:53,020 --> 01:00:55,080
<i>So, Ki Dong-Jae, you</i>

897
01:00:55,540 --> 01:00:57,720
<i>just need to kill her.</i>

898
01:00:58,350 --> 01:00:59,530
<i>Do you understand?</i>

899
01:01:00,980 --> 01:01:03,290
I'll
tell you how to live.

900
01:01:04,090 --> 01:01:05,520
Take this to the police.

901
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,460
Then the police will protect you.

902
01:01:12,510 --> 01:01:14,150
I'm saving you

903
01:01:14,370 --> 01:01:16,080
Instead you have to...

904
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:21,750
Why did you give this to me?

905
01:02:21,870 --> 01:02:24,990
Send the documents on this laptop
to the Blue House via your email.

906
01:02:25,220 --> 01:02:26,240
What?

907
01:02:26,270 --> 01:02:28,360
Woo Tae-Ho and you have to
endure that much.

908
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:42,320
Isn't this necessary for you to live?

909
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,830
What is it?

910
01:02:57,650 --> 01:02:58,960
<i>Let's meet.</i>

911
01:02:59,110 --> 01:03:00,360
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

912
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,450
It's too late to go today.

913
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:07,070
Are you

914
01:03:07,270 --> 01:03:09,620
where your mother died?

915
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:12,040
Why?

916
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:14,790
Do you
want to summon the ghost

917
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:17,380
then ask her to curse me?

918
01:03:21,220 --> 01:03:22,570
Actually

919
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:24,940
what do you want to tell me?

920
01:03:25,030 --> 01:03:26,280
<i>You, right?</i>

921
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:29,880
What made Jung Hee-Joo act like that in front of me?

922
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:32,640
You said all that right?

923
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:35,510
Is this in your genetic?

924
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:38,000
You have a disease acting like your mother?

925
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:39,340
Right?

926
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:42,730
You want to die crazy like your mother?

927
01:03:54,670 --> 01:03:55,980
I already sent it.

928
01:04:12,450 --> 01:04:13,870
Please give it to me.

929
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:47,890
I apologize.

930
01:04:48,670 --> 01:04:49,960
What for?

931
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,190
Why are you apologizing to me?

932
01:04:54,110 --> 01:04:55,760
Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho

933
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,090
love you with all his heart.

934
01:05:03,550 --> 01:05:05,630
Don't forgive me.

935
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:11,210
But, please forgive Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho.

936
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,960
Please

937
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:20,420
And also congratulations

938
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,550
I think he

939
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:25,900
will be a good father.

940
01:05:32,510 --> 01:05:33,840
You...

941
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:42,100
What do you see?

942
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,140
I hope you will be happy

943
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:50,340
Happy?

944
01:05:53,290 --> 01:05:55,190
You expect me to be happy?

945
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,410
Why should I hear that from you?

946
01:06:24,770 --> 01:06:27,130
Why should I hear that from you?

947
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:55,980
You are a dying child.

948
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:00,850
Not me.

949
01:07:01,510 --> 01:07:03,550
Cheon Sang-Woo killed you.

950
01:07:06,550 --> 01:07:07,780
Not me.

951
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:10,300
Not me.

952
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,450
Not me.

953
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,990
You are a dying child.

954
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:21,570
It wasn't me, but Cheon
Sang-Woo who killed you.

955
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:24,500
Not me.

956
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:26,640
Not me.

957
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:59,400
You're all right, right?

958
01:08:01,040 --> 01:08:03,370
Are you sure you can turn me
into a criminal?

959
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:04,690
yes

960
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:06,310
Enough

961
01:08:06,570 --> 01:08:07,780
Try it then.

962
01:08:11,450 --> 01:08:14,660
Cheon Na-Na you are
arrested for murder

963
01:08:24,170 --> 01:08:28,380
Jung Hee-Joo and Woo Tae-Ho.

964
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:39,610
This time you are wrong again.

965
01:08:40,660 --> 01:08:42,240
Not me.

966
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:43,610
That's you.

967
01:08:45,210 --> 01:08:46,720
This time I was right.

968
01:09:12,160 --> 01:09:13,620
Is there any progress?

969
01:09:17,490 --> 01:09:19,340
Why did solve the case ?

970
01:09:20,550 --> 01:09:22,150
Why did I catch the culprit?

971
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,230
If nothing changes.

972
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:28,490
Have you caught the real culprit?

973
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,170
What's that for.

974
01:09:31,820 --> 01:09:33,360
He definitely wouldn't understand.

975
01:09:33,940 --> 01:09:37,440
I should have caught her
earlier and told him.

976
01:09:37,930 --> 01:09:39,900
I feel so sorry for him.

977
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:41,500
You're blaming yourself again.

978
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:44,100
You have caught the real culprit.

979
01:09:44,490 --> 01:09:46,740
That means you've
done what the detectives did.

980
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:49,100
I caught her not
because I'm a detective.

981
01:09:52,720 --> 01:09:54,080
Because it hurts.

982
01:09:57,190 --> 01:09:59,270
Whenever I think
of Jung Hee-Joo's death,

983
01:10:00,330 --> 01:10:01,640
it hurts

984
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,340
Also whenever I think
of a sick grandfather like this,

985
01:10:07,860 --> 01:10:09,980
I feel sick.

986
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,260
Because it hurts,

987
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:20,920
So I ran like crazy
to catch the real culprit.

988
01:10:23,410 --> 01:10:25,270
Tell grandpa.

989
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,410
If you caught her

990
01:10:28,980 --> 01:10:30,370
It's no use.

991
01:10:30,620 --> 01:10:32,470
He must be listening to you.

992
01:10:32,710 --> 01:10:34,660
He definitely understands your feelings.

993
01:10:35,270 --> 01:10:36,580
He must know

994
01:10:36,740 --> 01:10:39,120
if you are tormented like that.

995
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,990
Grandpa.

996
01:10:57,810 --> 01:11:00,000
I caught

997
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,100
the one who killed your grand daughter

998
01:11:04,650 --> 01:11:06,040
It's Cheon Na-Na.

999
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,510
You understand, right?

1000
01:11:12,570 --> 01:11:13,790
Now

1001
01:11:17,750 --> 01:11:19,510
you can stop fighting.

1002
01:11:20,720 --> 01:11:22,210
Forgive me.

1003
01:11:29,850 --> 01:11:31,560
Let's go.

1004
01:11:50,440 --> 01:11:51,610
Uncle come on

1005
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:28,390
You don't even have to
take me home.

1006
01:12:29,050 --> 01:12:30,290
No

1007
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:32,190
Of course,

1008
01:12:32,780 --> 01:12:34,450
I have to take you.

1009
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:36,870
I've been thinking,

1010
01:12:36,980 --> 01:12:41,590
maybe
next week i have free time.

1011
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,090
So,

1012
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:45,490
- we can have dinner.
- Sorry,

1013
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,560
Wait a minute, please.

1014
01:12:47,680 --> 01:12:48,810
Yes

1015
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,660
What are you guys doing on the road?

1016
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:02,290
Just a minute, a minute.

1017
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,930
Come here!

1018
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:05,130
You are!

1019
01:13:06,170 --> 01:13:07,200
Hey,

1020
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,790
let me go

1021
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,810
You can't be like this on the road.

1022
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:14,140
We'll talk elsewhere.

1023
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,010
- Already!
- Hey!

1024
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:45,610
Yes

1025
01:13:46,620 --> 01:13:47,750
What is it?

1026
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:49,180
An-Geuk

1027
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:52,830
An-Geuk

1028
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:54,960
An-Geuk

1029
01:13:55,790 --> 01:13:57,120
An-Geuk

1030
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,390
The dog's name is An-Geuk?

1031
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:00,580
Yes

1032
01:14:01,930 --> 01:14:03,640
Shouldn't it have been found?

1033
01:14:03,670 --> 01:14:06,020
- Let's just give up.
- Not. We have to find him.

1034
01:14:06,130 --> 01:14:08,540
The owner lost his dog
and stopped eating and drinking because he was sad.

1035
01:14:08,570 --> 01:14:10,480
Why do we have to find a dog?

1036
01:14:10,510 --> 01:14:11,600
Aren't we detectives?

1037
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:14,450
The owner is the wife of our boss
our chief

1038
01:14:14,610 --> 01:14:17,650
Our chief still hasn't
given up on being the Inspector General.

1039
01:14:18,590 --> 01:14:19,990
An-geuk!

1040
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:23,650
Hey! Meet! We found it!

1041
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,550
Is that An-Geuk?

1042
01:14:28,780 --> 01:14:29,960
Good work.

1043
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,750
Let's see.

1044
01:14:33,070 --> 01:14:35,170
Similar. It's similar.

1045
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:40,530
This is a different dog.

1046
01:14:41,430 --> 01:14:45,770
This one has freckles
but it's not there, look.

1047
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,900
If this is painted maybe it will be similar?

1048
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,300
Don't say no.

1049
01:14:52,820 --> 01:14:54,710
This is evidence manipulation.
Find it again soon.

1050
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:56,680
Ji Man-Goo why hasn't he come yet?

1051
01:14:56,700 --> 01:14:58,150
Where's Man Goo?

1052
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,690
Is he
marking the area again?

1053
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:03,850
He had sensed the smell of <i>dodeok</i>,
so he was looking for it.

1054
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:09,410
Run!

1055
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:10,570
What's wrong with him?

1056
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:12,000
Wild boar again?

1057
01:15:12,030 --> 01:15:13,280
The wild boar is nowhere to be seen.

1058
01:15:14,980 --> 01:15:16,440
Why is his face like that?

1059
01:15:17,060 --> 01:15:18,650
Like swelling.

1060
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,770
What is wrong with him?

1061
01:15:23,540 --> 01:15:24,690
Hey Hey!

1062
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,270
Your face seems to be swollen.

1063
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:28,710
Bee!

1064
01:15:30,340 --> 01:17:50,290
