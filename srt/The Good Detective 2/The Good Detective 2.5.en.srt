00:00:19,843 --> 00:00:23,031
Said she is going back to America,
and left for airport about two hours ago.

7
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,701
Let's go to the airport.

8
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,935
If she left for the airport two hours ago,
there's still a chance we'll find her.

9
00:00:34,301 --> 00:00:37,971
According to the nurse, Its not because of Laura Caine
doesn't know Korean well.

10
00:00:38,605 --> 00:00:41,408
Even though I don't know how to say it,
but she understood roughly.

11
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,046
So she pretended to not know?

12
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,202
I mean she can communicate
with Lee Sung-Gon.

13
00:00:45,227 --> 00:00:48,569
At least, understand to some extent
what Lee Sung-Gon said.

14
00:00:48,765 --> 00:00:51,695
After Laura Caine
met Lee Sung-Gon...

15
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,593
You said she was treated
in the hospital for shock?

16
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:56,898
Yes.

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:01,854
Please tell her,
when you see her again.

18
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,093
If, I hope she remembers...

19
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:06,400
What I said and stay alive.

20
00:01:07,531 --> 00:01:08,913
Murderer.

21
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,463
Lee Sung-Gon told Laura Caine,

22
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:15,734
about the crimes he committed.

3F . departure

24
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:25,679
Detective,

25
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,687
Too late.

26
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,663
Maybe she will call after she reaches America?

27
00:01:37,452 --> 00:01:38,679
Who knows.

28
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,213
There's no reason to talk yourself,

29
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:44,468
especially how her older brother became a murderer
and how she must live the rest of her life,

30
00:01:44,515 --> 00:01:45,984
as the killer's sister.

31
00:01:46,974 --> 00:01:48,006
Detective,

32
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,159
Forgive me.

33
00:02:08,261 --> 00:02:10,597
I have sinned.

34
00:02:17,253 --> 00:02:19,175
I lied to you two

35
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:33,956
When you were little,

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,425
your father was a barber isn't he?

37
00:02:37,324 --> 00:02:41,184
Did Laura Caine's mother help your father
running a barbershop?

38
00:02:42,323 --> 00:02:45,011
The reason you put a white robe
on your victims,

39
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,245
is because of bad memories,

40
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,292
that you had as a child.
Isn't that right?

41
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,983
Isn't that unfair, Detective?

42
00:03:04,317 --> 00:03:07,821
It's all because of that woman and her mother.

43
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:10,991
Why only I have to experience it
and live like this? Why?

44
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,135
The woman eats well and lives well
in America, whereas why only me.

45
00:03:15,162 --> 00:03:17,276
Why should I live
with pain? Why?

46
00:03:31,285 --> 00:03:32,165
Hey!

47
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:36,589
Unlucky! Why are you wearing lipstick
red again?

48
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,191
Why? I told you
not to wear it.

49
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:43,644
Which other man are you seducing!

50
00:03:48,003 --> 00:03:48,525
Hey.

51
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:51,690
Come here! Here!

52
00:03:51,715 --> 00:03:55,237
Why don't you listen to me, why!

53
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:08,496
Where else are you going?

54
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:11,003
you left me,

55
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,386
You can't go anywhere.

56
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:17,331
I will follow you to hell.

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,884
Now let it all go.

58
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,342
You have to be free 
from that pain now.

59
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:46,112
If you keep holding on,
you will only continue to suffer.

60
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,092
This...

61
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:55,315
You killed them all?

62
00:04:56,263 --> 00:04:57,331
All five?

63
00:04:59,232 --> 00:05:00,567
Then among the five,

64
00:05:01,808 --> 00:05:04,417
is there a woman you didn't kill?

65
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:11,066
Who's she?

66
00:05:23,558 --> 00:05:25,448
How can I find out?

67
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,252
Isn't that something only known
by the real killer?

68
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,588
You said you killed them all,
This bastard!

69
00:05:33,612 --> 00:05:35,089
When?

70
00:05:35,292 --> 00:05:37,425
I never said that
with my mouth.

71
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:41,385
Aren't you supposed to record this?

72
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:43,370
I never said it.

73
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:53,284
Isn't that unfair, Detective?

74
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:57,675
It's all because of that woman and her mother.

75
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,693
Why only I have to experience it
and live like this? Why?

76
00:06:00,737 --> 00:06:03,979
The woman eats well and lives well
in America, whereas why only me.

77
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,492
Why should I live
with pain? Why?

78
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:10,487
Is this your motive?

79
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:11,698
It...

80
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,560
Could it be my motive?

81
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,026
Killing people for that reason?

82
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,448
Yes?

83
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,283
Okay.

84
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:24,695
You are right.

85
00:06:26,565 --> 00:06:28,385
No excuses for you in the first place.

86
00:06:28,441 --> 00:06:31,471
You only blame others
at your uncontrollable urge,

87
00:06:31,519 --> 00:06:32,784
to kill.

88
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:36,105
Killing weapon. your past.

89
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,003
The traces you left

90
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,698
Everyone says you did it.

91
00:06:42,448 --> 00:06:44,206
You can't dodge.

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,558
Whether you killed five or four,

93
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,917
You will never come back
to this society in the end.

94
00:06:50,331 --> 00:06:51,534
Only,

95
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:55,284
just say you
didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo.

96
00:06:56,253 --> 00:06:58,292
For the deceased Jung Hee-Joo.

97
00:06:58,534 --> 00:07:00,417
For her bereaved family.

98
00:07:00,573 --> 00:07:05,558
This is the last and only way
you can make someone imitate you, that's all.

99
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,259
It was a funny joke.

100
00:07:10,196 --> 00:07:11,164
Think about it.

101
00:07:11,189 --> 00:07:16,042
If I confess I didn't kill her,
did i kill the rest?

102
00:07:17,206 --> 00:07:19,808
No, why should I tell like that?

103
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:22,026
Why? Why?

104
00:07:22,441 --> 00:07:24,987
You will be remembered forever for sure.

105
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:28,377
As the protagonist of the serial killer case.

106
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:29,942
which even created imitators.

107
00:07:31,387 --> 00:07:35,099
Not a childish impersonator
imitating others.

108
00:07:45,246 --> 00:07:46,551
Arrest him.

109
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,682
But ..

110
00:08:05,057 --> 00:08:06,081
now I,

111
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:09,565
won't meet them again right?

112
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:17,276
Too bad, even though they
are lovely people.

113
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:18,893
Fast.

114
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:25,331
Did Lee Sung-Gon said anything,

115
00:08:25,917 --> 00:08:27,792
that I should know?

116
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,301
Oh Ji-Hyeok.

117
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:32,917
Tell him about us meeting
with Lee Sung-Gon's younger sister.

118
00:08:36,783 --> 00:08:37,823
What was that?

119
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,838
I'll send you the sound recording.

120
00:08:42,385 --> 00:08:45,456
This will be very helpful in uncovering
Lee Sung-Gon's murder motive.

121
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,706
Fine, I will Make sure to mention you guys as
source in the report.

122
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,518
you don't have to,

123
00:08:52,034 --> 00:08:54,456
Just say that we
have found the motive.

124
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,790
On the contrary,

125
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:59,315
you just need to remember that we
have shared content.

126
00:09:10,221 --> 00:09:11,729
Shit!

127
00:09:12,815 --> 00:09:14,237
Embarrassing.

128
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,766
Why?

129
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:18,516
One who doesn't even look like a human,

130
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:21,612
I became emotional to when I was speaking,

131
00:09:21,768 --> 00:09:23,541
about Jung Hee-Joo's family,

132
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:25,870
though I can't get it.

133
00:09:25,956 --> 00:09:27,573
Why am I like this, lately?

134
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:30,221
- You must be going through puberty.
- What?

135
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,031
Puberty and moderate menopause
overlap each other.

136
00:09:33,071 --> 00:09:34,680
Although the case is rare.

137
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,766
Right. As you said,
it seems true this is puberty.

138
00:09:39,977 --> 00:09:41,602
My body is aging,

139
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:44,094
but my mind is still a child.

140
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,989
What a shame.

141
00:09:48,461 --> 00:09:49,531
Detective!

142
00:09:49,556 --> 00:09:52,251
This is the translation of the statement from
Lee Sung-Gon's sister.

143
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:55,492
It became clear why he
killed those women that way.

144
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,619
I think it will be useful in court.

145
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,751
Who told you to judge?

146
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,852
- Yes?
- I make the decisions.

147
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:07,969
Don't rush ahead.
Watch your mouth, got it?

148
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:09,297
I understand.

149
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:14,172
Forgive me.
I have sinned.

150
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:18,585
My stepdad cut my mom's throat with his razor blade.

151
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:21,758
and her white robe was stained with blood.

152
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,821
I still remember like yesterday.

153
00:10:25,196 --> 00:10:28,516
and I think the memories have stuck forever for my brother too

154
00:10:28,946 --> 00:10:31,297
Why did your stepdad kill your mother?

155
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,800
He got mad because,

156
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:36,769
my mom put red lipstick on her lips.

157
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,339
I was so young, that's all i remember.

158
00:10:44,077 --> 00:10:46,914
It reminds you of bad memories
from your childhood, right?

159
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:49,704
So you put white dress on your victims,

160
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:51,829
and put lipstick on them.

161
00:10:53,126 --> 00:10:55,477
I don't know what you're talking about.

162
00:10:56,219 --> 00:10:58,219
Otherwise, by chance,

163
00:10:58,258 --> 00:11:01,063
Did serial killing technique of Kim Hyeong Bok reminded,

164
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:03,633
you of your hidden past?

165
00:11:03,688 --> 00:11:06,055
"That's why I followed
Kim Hyeong-Bok method,"

166
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:07,899
"and committed the crime of impersonation."

167
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,344
What's that?

168
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:11,618
Between both?

169
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,415
But,

170
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:20,915
No matter what, you're still trash.

171
00:11:23,704 --> 00:11:25,040
But, Detective,

172
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,211
first of all I didn't kill anyone.

173
00:11:30,743 --> 00:11:32,344
Then imitate?

174
00:11:32,438 --> 00:11:33,852
That is not true.

175
00:11:34,516 --> 00:11:36,711
I was just trying to scare her.

176
00:11:37,204 --> 00:11:38,438
Of course,

177
00:11:38,516 --> 00:11:40,266
From the Detective's point of view,

178
00:11:41,001 --> 00:11:43,325
it will be better for you
if I become a copycat, right?

179
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,055
That's what you said to the reporters.

180
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:48,485
You don't have to think about
from our point of view.

181
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:52,133
Then, apart from this case,

182
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:54,391
just say it,

183
00:11:54,758 --> 00:11:56,196
that I'm the culprit.

184
00:11:56,727 --> 00:11:57,852
How?

185
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:03,954
However, I didn't kill anyone.

186
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,258
- Is that so?
- Yes.

187
00:12:08,821 --> 00:12:10,297
But do you know?

188
00:12:10,672 --> 00:12:13,477
I don't need confession
from a bastard like you.

189
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:16,047
You just have to say
in front of people,

190
00:12:16,136 --> 00:12:18,945
that you are only guilty of
using drugs and kidnapping people.

191
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:26,164
Lee Sung-Gon, you have the right to refuse
any statement that can,

192
00:12:26,234 --> 00:12:28,126
be used against you as evidence in court.

193
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:29,915
You also have rights to a lawyer.

194
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:33,790
Oh, yes.

195
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,522
One more.

196
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:40,501
If you want, we can refer you
to a professional for mental evaluation.

197
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,012
That bastard,

198
00:12:59,296 --> 00:13:02,819
just going to talk nonsense
in front of the prosecutor?

199
00:13:03,194 --> 00:13:06,444
These people have strange talents.

200
00:13:07,084 --> 00:13:08,506
He won't.

201
00:13:08,795 --> 00:13:11,662
There is only one thought
in his head now,

202
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,629
that he has to survive
somehow.

203
00:13:16,116 --> 00:13:18,272
So,
he can kill people again.

204
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,639
- He's out.
- Already out.

205
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,053
Do you admit to all the accusations?

206
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,733
I,

207
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,949
told to the police,

208
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:39,295
the truth of every thing
which I have done.

209
00:13:39,366 --> 00:13:40,912
Without missing a single one.

210
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:43,858
Like what happened.

211
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:46,256
What kind of crime are you talking about?

212
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,116
I sincerely,

213
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,068
apologize,

214
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,498
to the victim,

215
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:55,636
who is hurt because of me.

216
00:13:58,906 --> 00:14:00,515
I was only 
trying to scare her.

217
00:14:00,569 --> 00:14:01,638
Only up to here.

218
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:03,951
- Wait a moment.
- Please step aside.

219
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:06,139
Do you feel guilty?

220
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:08,529
Lee Sung-Gon's investigation is complete
and sent to the prosecutor

221
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:11,920
It is known that he admitted to kidnapping
and attempted murder

222
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:15,944
Not admitting to the crime of impersonation

223
00:14:16,322 --> 00:14:18,350
What was your motive?

224
00:14:20,741 --> 00:14:22,092
Shit!

225
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:26,303
Didn't we predict that
he would come out with something like that?

226
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:29,453
The question is whether
Seoul Investigation Team,

227
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,333
have the desire to investigate
Lee Sung-Gon to the end.

228
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,357
The two of them would have definitely agreed,

229
00:14:35,382 --> 00:14:37,115
to do it this way, like that.

230
00:14:37,194 --> 00:14:42,397
However, in the end Kim Hyeong-Bok is
still a serial killer, right?

231
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:44,124
Damn, this makes no sense.

232
00:14:44,218 --> 00:14:46,772
Everything we found gave
to seoul team,

233
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:49,709
from that bus route map,
shouldn't Lee Sung-Gon be the culprit?

234
00:14:49,734 --> 00:14:52,568
Team leader, should we just keep quiet like this?

235
00:14:52,943 --> 00:14:54,794
The results of the investigation haven't come out yet, have they?

236
00:14:54,834 --> 00:14:57,849
- Let's take our time..
- What should we pay attention to?

237
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,779
It is clear. We know everything.

238
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,044
Isn't that what it should be done by our chief?

239
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:03,099
You punk.

240
00:15:03,202 --> 00:15:05,037
Why do you want to face the chief?

241
00:15:05,099 --> 00:15:06,865
Isn't the chief responsible for that job?

242
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,978
You said he wouldn't fall so easily.
So try talking to him.

243
00:15:10,045 --> 00:15:11,560
He have been nagging me,

244
00:15:12,076 --> 00:15:15,709
some time ago,
so I'm avoiding him.

245
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:20,283
Kang Do-Chang, Oh Ji-Hyeok you two
talk to the chief.

246
00:15:20,326 --> 00:15:23,591
If I'm the team leader, telling you guys
talk like that, definitely pass.

247
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,990
Why didn't this person give me
such a case?

248
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,412
Sir!

249
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:29,716
Detective,

250
00:15:29,830 --> 00:15:31,080
What should we do?

251
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,451
Because of puberty, these days
I have a lot on my mind.

252
00:15:37,137 --> 00:15:38,997
Give me some time to think.

253
00:15:40,451 --> 00:15:42,398
I'll go home first,
See you tomorrow.

254
00:15:46,381 --> 00:15:47,459
- Goodbye.
- Yes.

255
00:15:51,537 --> 00:15:52,849
What is it?

256
00:15:53,576 --> 00:15:55,474
- What puberty?
- You guys don't know puberty?

257
00:15:56,467 --> 00:15:58,279
This is a time for a storm of anger and frustration.

258
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,724
Very noisy.

259
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,052
- This.
- Is everything done?

260
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:08,266
Yes.

261
00:16:20,746 --> 00:16:22,282
You should also take this.

262
00:16:27,087 --> 00:16:28,133
And also...

263
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,818
Please eat this too.

264
00:16:56,717 --> 00:16:58,193
Diabetes,

265
00:16:58,263 --> 00:17:00,826
is not just an adult disease.

266
00:17:01,045 --> 00:17:04,693
This is also a disease that is even found in small children,

267
00:17:04,771 --> 00:17:06,467
for genetic or congenital reasons.

268
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,685
I didn't know at first.

269
00:17:09,248 --> 00:17:10,724
When you grow up,

270
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,263
you start to question it.

271
00:17:12,849 --> 00:17:14,685
When the other friends run,

272
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:18,138
why should I only suffer from this?

273
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:20,529
Why is there a devil,

274
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:23,381
which lives in my body since birth.

275
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:27,185
The devil demands,

276
00:17:27,248 --> 00:17:29,037
daily insulin injections.

277
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:30,865
And it takes away the feeling of happiness,

278
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,857
from daily life.

279
00:17:36,365 --> 00:17:38,201
Several times a day I ask,

280
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:41,115
to the devil inside of me.

281
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:43,943
Why should it be me?

282
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:45,990
Why did you,

283
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,523
choose me?

284
00:17:55,312 --> 00:17:56,851
Please answer that question,

285
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:59,997
to the children who suffer,

286
00:18:00,172 --> 00:18:01,969
same as me..

287
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:04,812
There's nothing wrong with you,

288
00:18:06,937 --> 00:18:08,351
I promise to plant,

289
00:18:09,617 --> 00:18:11,875
the tree of hope again in your body.

290
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,319
Thank you

291
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,289
Thank you for being here.

292
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,344
Thank you Thank you

293
00:18:25,601 --> 00:18:28,179
Isn't it obvious?
What does Na-Na want?

294
00:18:29,164 --> 00:18:31,539
This is an event
intended only for her.

295
00:18:31,929 --> 00:18:34,047
Because of loneliness.

296
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,289
I don't like the President's opinion.

297
00:18:37,758 --> 00:18:39,726
It's just an attempt
to change public opinion.

298
00:18:42,093 --> 00:18:44,053
Sacrifice for your father
while uncovering the bottle

299
00:18:44,091 --> 00:18:45,339
even the dirtiest?

300
00:18:46,953 --> 00:18:49,461
Then it must be beautiful.

301
00:18:51,539 --> 00:18:53,133
Geez!

302
00:18:53,445 --> 00:18:56,531
Geez! What brings you here, sir?

303
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,615
Hello.

304
00:18:57,898 --> 00:18:59,414
You must be busy,

305
00:18:59,547 --> 00:19:01,883
but thank you so much for coming.

306
00:19:01,942 --> 00:19:03,499
I had to come.
It's a good show.

307
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,945
Sir, should I take your picture?

308
00:19:05,086 --> 00:19:06,289
Yes, that's good.

309
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:09,196
Photos only when no one is nearby

310
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,272
Well.

311
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:16,015
I think you guys are pretty close
with our group,

312
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:17,812
am i the only one thinking
like that?

313
00:19:17,945 --> 00:19:19,570
I'm the picky type of person.

314
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,969
So, I'm wary of friends.

315
00:19:22,461 --> 00:19:24,367
Because it's clearly visible
there is a purpose.

316
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,289
How about this?

317
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,929
We won't be able to see you
comfortably until,

318
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:33,898
till your term is over.

319
00:19:36,961 --> 00:19:38,851
Please contact me
at the end of your term.

320
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:42,279
Because I thought we would have
more work to help.

321
00:19:45,523 --> 00:19:47,242
Hey, Im Chang-Soo.

322
00:19:47,609 --> 00:19:50,226
Honestly say.

323
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:52,926
Did you come to see me?
Or did you come for Na-Na?

324
00:19:54,504 --> 00:19:56,527
- Have you checked it?
- Yes.

325
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,600
I'm having trouble finding
edited version and check it out.

326
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:02,423
Yes, here.
In one hour,

327
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:05,129
- will appear in the program.
- Did you know about the PD program?

328
00:20:05,161 --> 00:20:07,809
Yes. I met him for a while
and suggest it,

329
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,692
- but he's not a very good friend.
- In that case, okay.

330
00:20:11,055 --> 00:20:14,579
Send text messages with mobile number of PD or any higher ups.

331
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:16,372
Fine, I understand.

332
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,920
Are you leaving now?

333
00:20:23,407 --> 00:20:25,056
Yes, you're busy.

334
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:26,563
I also have to do something.

335
00:20:26,587 --> 00:20:28,290
Okay.
Thank you for coming.

336
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:29,672
But is that okay?

337
00:20:29,827 --> 00:20:32,401
- The price of the art you bought is not cheap.
- Hey, come on.

338
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:33,698
No problem.

339
00:20:33,852 --> 00:20:35,178
I know my company's money.

340
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:37,214
- I'll call you later.
- Yes.

341
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:49,041
How much time till TJ's content being broadcast?

342
00:20:50,316 --> 00:20:51,818
4 minutes 58 seconds.

343
00:20:52,318 --> 00:20:53,710
But is it okay if
we broadcast it?

344
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:54,992
The response will be very strong.

345
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:56,891
There's no need to be afraid. Trust me.

346
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,975
Director!

347
00:21:07,145 --> 00:21:10,216
'Cause it seems you already know,
I'll get straight to the point.

348
00:21:10,412 --> 00:21:12,349
Call them and cancel the broadcast.

349
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:13,427
Yes?

350
00:21:13,575 --> 00:21:14,590
Suddenly?

351
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:17,010
You are eating your own flesh.

352
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,684
The President received a warrant of arrest.

353
00:21:18,755 --> 00:21:21,456
If the case of the vice president will be 
uncovered, the stock price will fall.

354
00:21:21,481 --> 00:21:22,318
Why?

355
00:21:22,815 --> 00:21:24,845
Did the vice president
make any mistake?

356
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,313
If the stock price falls,
this must be serious.

357
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:32,960
Did you tell
McQueen headquarters?

358
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,731
In this case, it seems that there are many who will want to talk to you.

359
00:21:41,910 --> 00:21:43,710
You love your wife, right?

360
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,720
It seems so.

361
00:21:47,553 --> 00:21:48,928
Na-Na is such a person.

362
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,228
Her husband is the one who will
do anything for her,

363
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:54,634
and she can do anything for him.

364
00:22:02,898 --> 00:22:04,485
Will it appear on TV broadcasts?

365
00:22:05,997 --> 00:22:09,197
You didn't invite many reporters
to this event.

366
00:22:10,924 --> 00:22:13,096
This event is not held
to broadcast on TV.

367
00:22:14,692 --> 00:22:16,238
If this is an event for the President,

368
00:22:16,345 --> 00:22:18,016
should not it be
known to the general public?

369
00:22:18,047 --> 00:22:20,024
I do this with a sincere heart.

370
00:22:20,204 --> 00:22:21,884
No other intentions.

371
00:22:22,601 --> 00:22:23,656
Really?

372
00:22:24,519 --> 00:22:27,104
In that case,
Woo Tae-Ho lied to me apparently.

373
00:22:29,128 --> 00:22:30,328
Deputy Director.

374
00:22:30,925 --> 00:22:32,803
Let's talk for a moment.

375
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,689
Okay.

376
00:22:38,926 --> 00:22:39,941
What are you talking about?

377
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:42,914
How did he know?

378
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,214
Some time ago,
I was contacted by the Japan branch office.

379
00:22:45,314 --> 00:22:48,578
That you are caught in a fraud case.

380
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:53,318
This case will be broadcast
on the news program in an hour.

381
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:56,805
What kind of person is he really?

382
00:22:56,829 --> 00:22:58,962
The one who knows my weakness.

383
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,894
McQueen.

384
00:23:03,515 --> 00:23:04,635
He can be crazy.

385
00:23:05,384 --> 00:23:06,642
I will be humiliated,

386
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,626
and if Daddy finds out, he won't even
treat me as a human.

387
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,125
Woo Tae Ho.

388
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:14,704
Please save me.

389
00:23:18,441 --> 00:23:20,806
I really beg you.

390
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,038
We've messed up enough already
because of no ads,

391
00:23:23,185 --> 00:23:25,710
is there any reason
for us to reject it?

392
00:23:26,601 --> 00:23:30,057
Please think again
for the company's income.

393
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,597
I beg.

394
00:23:40,227 --> 00:23:41,078
What did he say?

395
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:44,157
Did he threaten you
to remove all the ads?

396
00:23:45,391 --> 00:23:47,628
- We have to reduce the duration.
- Yes?

397
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:52,303
Suddenly a lot of ads will be
aired after our program.

398
00:23:52,834 --> 00:23:54,334
We have to eliminate
more than five minutes

399
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,865
and edit the rest properly.

400
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:04,322
Thank you

401
00:24:04,643 --> 00:24:06,777
With this I have decided.

402
00:24:06,961 --> 00:24:08,914
If you don't change your mind,

403
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:10,129
you and me,

404
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:13,001
we will walk till the end.

405
00:24:14,289 --> 00:24:15,304
Please go in.

406
00:24:16,722 --> 00:24:17,737
I am going.

407
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,642
This is the only one that didn't sell.

408
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,415
Is the price too high?

409
00:24:42,214 --> 00:24:44,785
Yet this is very good work.

410
00:24:45,122 --> 00:24:46,802
I blocked it.

411
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,769
I had to block it.

412
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,535
Why?

413
00:24:53,676 --> 00:24:54,691
Na-Na,

414
00:24:56,364 --> 00:24:59,026
do you think you can handle it
with your own strength?

415
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,656
You think Cheon Sang-Woo will
stop if you ask?

416
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,883
The President will never
let go of Cheon Sang-Woo.

417
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:10,568
I understand that more than anyone.

418
00:25:11,569 --> 00:25:13,678
you, could it be,

419
00:25:15,168 --> 00:25:17,768
You're not interested in Cheon Sang-Woo,

420
00:25:18,574 --> 00:25:20,014
but on the president?

421
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:23,870
Na-Na,

422
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:26,626
That's really crazy stuff.

423
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,530
What is your purpose in coming here?

424
00:25:33,086 --> 00:25:34,101
What?

425
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,132
Didn't you come because you're my husband?

426
00:25:37,903 --> 00:25:41,268
As a sister, I thank you
for the help you gave.

427
00:25:41,487 --> 00:25:42,948
as Son-in-law of Choi Sung-Dae,

428
00:25:43,128 --> 00:25:44,995
as brother-in-law of Choi Sang-Woo,

429
00:25:45,496 --> 00:25:47,496
everyone would be proud.

430
00:25:48,082 --> 00:25:50,215
And also as the husband of Cheon Na-Na.

431
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,685
Do you know why I chose you?

432
00:25:58,295 --> 00:26:00,365
You were the first one to lower your head.

433
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:02,660
In front of a prosecutor like you.

434
00:26:05,143 --> 00:26:06,583
It was Really cool that I,

435
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:09,748
Can't forget it.

436
00:26:11,005 --> 00:26:13,205
I won't forget that.

437
00:26:17,819 --> 00:26:20,710
There will be a closing party after this,
don't stay away from me.

438
00:26:39,829 --> 00:26:42,797
You caught Lee Sung-Gon, right?

439
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:44,649
Right.

440
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,560
Then that person named Lee Sung-Gon,

441
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,950
is he the culprit?

442
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:50,911
Or as the news said,

443
00:26:51,303 --> 00:26:53,169
he only scared people?

444
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:57,397
Lee Sung-Gon is indeed the culprit.

445
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:00,358
In that case,

446
00:27:00,861 --> 00:27:03,061
did he kill Hee-Joo too?

447
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,660
We also don't know for sure.

448
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:10,568
Haven't you been
caught many suspects before?

449
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:14,745
Didn't you catch him
because you are sure that he is the culprit?

450
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:19,606
You don't accuse someone who isn't
guilty of murder, right?

451
00:27:21,341 --> 00:27:22,356
No.

452
00:27:22,646 --> 00:27:25,162
You caught him
for some reason, right?

453
00:27:25,725 --> 00:27:26,740
I am begging you.

454
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,029
"That person did it."

455
00:27:29,507 --> 00:27:31,307
"That guy killed Hee-Joo."

456
00:27:31,937 --> 00:27:33,984
Please say that.

457
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:38,087
I don't know, I don't know either.

458
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,266
How can I know that
if that person killed your granddaughter?

459
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,731
I don't even know!

460
00:27:44,294 --> 00:27:46,520
Only the killer knows.

461
00:27:47,502 --> 00:27:49,702
Detectives aren't that great.

462
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,954
Unless we see the crime
with our own eyes,

463
00:27:53,119 --> 00:27:55,125
we don't know anything.

464
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:59,826
We also can't answer
whether he really did it or not.

465
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:07,407
it seems like I,

466
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,724
have put too much pressure on you.

467
00:28:13,125 --> 00:28:14,140
I...

468
00:28:15,034 --> 00:28:17,166
I've been too selfish.

469
00:28:17,768 --> 00:28:18,808
Forgive me.

470
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:26,349
Thanks for the tea.

471
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,549
Eun-Hye, over there is food
which I wrapped.

472
00:28:29,588 --> 00:28:31,533
- Bring it here and give it to Grandpa.
- No need.

473
00:28:31,784 --> 00:28:34,378
I do not want to trouble you more than this.

474
00:28:37,622 --> 00:28:39,017
Quickly give it to him!

475
00:28:39,086 --> 00:28:39,604
Yes.

476
00:28:41,558 --> 00:28:42,573
Grandpa.

477
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:49,577
Grandpa!

478
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:53,672
Please accept this.

479
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:57,034
Please dont be like this.

480
00:28:57,938 --> 00:29:00,594
Don't make me a shameless old man.

481
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:04,027
Yes.

482
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:07,074
Then, be careful on the road.

483
00:29:14,625 --> 00:29:15,694
Thank you

484
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:40,451
Why were you like that?

485
00:29:40,546 --> 00:29:42,069
What? What? Are you?

486
00:29:42,117 --> 00:29:44,421
You should speak with well manners with older people.

487
00:29:45,091 --> 00:29:47,614
He must be very sad
because he lost his granddaughter.

488
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,301
"The culprit has been caught.
now you can rest easy."

489
00:29:50,326 --> 00:29:54,661
- You could have told him like that.
- That's enough!

490
00:29:55,027 --> 00:29:57,231
Why should I take responsibility
for such a person?

491
00:29:57,289 --> 00:29:59,929
I'm tired. I feel like my brain is going to explode.

492
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,583
I also have to live in peace!

493
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:05,305
Then why did you become a detective,

494
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:07,441
If you live for yourself?

495
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,748
I don't know either.

496
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,511
Why do I have to live like this.

497
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:16,150
It is not like that,

498
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:20,266
why did you lose confidence?

499
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,094
You said detective
is a noble job.

500
00:30:22,141 --> 00:30:24,707
I don't fit, I dont fit at all.

501
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:27,694
That's why you left in the middle
your own wedding party,

502
00:30:27,736 --> 00:30:28,396
to catch the culprit.

503
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:29,420
Hey!

504
00:30:29,594 --> 00:30:30,695
Why are you bringing that up?

505
00:30:30,734 --> 00:30:32,983
you used to be,..
you said you have no regrets.

506
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:35,536
You were satisfied because you
managed to catch the culprit

507
00:30:35,547 --> 00:30:37,335
and soothe the victim's feelings.

508
00:30:38,351 --> 00:30:40,466
Isn't that the pride of a detective?

509
00:30:40,684 --> 00:30:42,379
At that time I just, I don't know.

510
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:43,449
Uncle,

511
00:30:43,981 --> 00:30:45,661
uncle you were even married?

512
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,126
Hey.

513
00:30:47,446 --> 00:30:50,217
You know how stupid this human is?

514
00:30:50,443 --> 00:30:52,029
In the midst of his wedding feast,

515
00:30:52,306 --> 00:30:54,442
The culprit was right in front of his eyes.

516
00:30:56,388 --> 00:30:58,425
Just try it ,if you
tell this to Eun-Hye,

517
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,861
I will throw you on the street!

518
00:31:01,514 --> 00:31:02,896
Eun-Hye please clean this,

519
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,969
if he drinks more in
In this situation, he will be really messed up.

520
00:31:04,993 --> 00:31:05,473
Okay.

521
00:31:05,503 --> 00:31:06,755
I haven't finished drinking yet.

522
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,169
Uncle, stop drinking
and rest.

523
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,215
Please.

524
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:15,007
I warn you,
don't tell her anything.

525
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:17,132
Brother,

526
00:31:17,593 --> 00:31:19,934
After thinking about it,
You can't work in an office.

527
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,325
There is no travel allowance
and too much overtime.

528
00:31:23,544 --> 00:31:27,631
Because we moved and got
lots of debt, there was no other choice.

529
00:31:27,656 --> 00:31:29,989
that you have to work in a strong team.

530
00:31:33,327 --> 00:31:34,342
What a mess.

531
00:31:41,934 --> 00:31:42,986
Aren't you curious?

532
00:31:43,168 --> 00:31:46,932
Why can't he marry and live
as a person with many problems?

533
00:31:46,957 --> 00:31:49,385
You're forbidden to tell.
else you will get thrown.

534
00:31:51,093 --> 00:31:54,303
His greatest achievement is
only bronze medal in local race.

535
00:31:54,803 --> 00:31:56,764
I'm a national gold medal holder.

536
00:31:56,827 --> 00:31:59,131
Who do you think
will be slammed into the street?

537
00:31:59,827 --> 00:32:02,427
Then you can tell me.

538
00:32:03,655 --> 00:32:05,359
The bride is coming.

539
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:21,028
Hey.

540
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:31,186
Do-Chang!

541
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:39,592
What are you doing here?

542
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:13,993
Hye-Ok!

543
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,721
Hye-Ok...

544
00:34:32,465 --> 00:34:34,265
I am really, really sorry.

545
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,240
There have been many victims
caused by that person.

546
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:41,200
I really had to
catch him as soon as possible.

547
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:46,222
But it seems that the person 
attended the wedding as an acquintance.

548
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:47,999
Then I saw...

549
00:34:49,554 --> 00:34:52,343
Hye-Ok, I am begging you to understand.

550
00:34:53,362 --> 00:34:55,162
I am really, really sorry.

551
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:57,627
Get out.

552
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:00,770
Dont dare to appear before me again.

553
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,586
Hye-Ok.

554
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:14,694
Wait.

555
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,801
Wait!

556
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,225
I think I'm really crazy.

557
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:34,883
Yes?

558
00:35:35,048 --> 00:35:36,235
Did you reach home?

559
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:37,644
Not yet, why?

560
00:35:38,003 --> 00:35:39,923
I have something to show you at the office.

561
00:35:40,786 --> 00:35:42,013
But if you're tired,
don't come here.

562
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:45,826
If you know I'm tired, you shouldnt have called me you punk.

563
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,685
You think I'm happy for
you to suck my blood like this?

564
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:49,773
you blood sucking leech!

565
00:35:50,682 --> 00:35:53,987
I quit being a nun
because I thought I dont deserve to be one.

566
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:57,163
After I came back to the states,
I kept thinking about, what I...

567
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:00,227
What I should do
for my brother, and...

568
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,101
You think I'm that helpless?

569
00:36:13,737 --> 00:36:14,777
It is not like that.

570
00:36:15,964 --> 00:36:17,404
I am alright.

571
00:36:17,709 --> 00:36:19,384
Don't worry about me, just go.

572
00:36:19,502 --> 00:36:20,978
Thanks for the oranges.

573
00:36:21,217 --> 00:36:22,897
Keep pushing my uncle.

574
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:26,221
Then maybe Uncle will
find out what you want to know.

575
00:36:26,246 --> 00:36:27,261
Okay.

576
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:29,011
I know he's a good person.

577
00:36:29,358 --> 00:36:33,716
I don't want to add to someone's burden
who already have a lot of work.

578
00:36:34,311 --> 00:36:36,787
I also don't have anyone
to share stories.

579
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:40,125
But Uncle listened to me.

580
00:36:41,135 --> 00:36:44,289
Uncle said he would prove my father is innocent.

581
00:36:44,594 --> 00:36:47,461
It's not something
that he had to do.

582
00:36:47,978 --> 00:36:49,813
He also doesn't need to be sweared at

583
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,022
But,

584
00:36:53,111 --> 00:36:54,281
he did.

585
00:36:55,828 --> 00:36:56,843
Is that so?

586
00:36:57,297 --> 00:36:59,358
You think I should depend on him?

587
00:36:59,726 --> 00:37:01,405
We have to rely in times of trouble.

588
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:04,011
Thats why he is paid by the country.

589
00:37:06,257 --> 00:37:08,991
Alright, alright. I'll think about it.

590
00:37:09,583 --> 00:37:11,916
It is late. You should go home.

591
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:13,847
Well.

592
00:37:13,872 --> 00:37:14,984
Take a rest.

593
00:37:15,176 --> 00:37:17,176
No, no. wait a moment.

594
00:37:17,308 --> 00:37:18,323
This.

595
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:20,049
How about you?

596
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:23,005
I am alright. Don't worry.
Take it.

597
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:27,280
Okay thank you.

598
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:54,787
What is that?

599
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:56,720
I bought an umbrella
from the mini market.

600
00:37:56,831 --> 00:37:59,729
After you gave this to me,
you have to go home in the rain.

601
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,132
It's not expensive.

602
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:06,125
Why you have to soak in
rain because of me?

603
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:09,084
Because If you get wet in the rain,
you will get the flu.

604
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,660
You know I can't sleep if I'm
Afraid that you dont return home soon,right?

605
00:38:13,762 --> 00:38:16,816
Stop working and hurry back home. Yes?

606
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:26,156
Its Raining , go in.

607
00:38:27,407 --> 00:38:28,764
Its raining, hurry back in!

608
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:29,804
I know!

609
00:38:29,968 --> 00:38:30,983
I am going 

610
00:38:50,598 --> 00:38:53,184
What do we get after coming this far?

611
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:54,904
What's good we got from there?

612
00:38:55,068 --> 00:38:56,451
Is a detective is same as a
businessman?

613
00:38:56,476 --> 00:38:58,233
to take advantage
of something like this.

614
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:59,343
Team Leader Oh.

615
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:03,184
What's the probability of 
Lee Sung-Gon opening his mouth?

616
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,356
About 10 percent.

617
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:05,685
In that case,

618
00:39:05,812 --> 00:39:08,678
what is the probability of me being promoted?

619
00:39:08,952 --> 00:39:11,030
How could I
predict it?

620
00:39:11,343 --> 00:39:12,358
Tell the truth,

621
00:39:12,847 --> 00:39:14,894
I won't be angry though even if
you say zero percent.

622
00:39:14,933 --> 00:39:18,901
If I tell you the truth,its 
not zero percent, but about...

623
00:39:20,954 --> 00:39:22,234
nine percent?

624
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,460
Okay thank you
for telling the truth.

625
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,569
In that case,
if Lee Sung-Gon opens his mouth,

626
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,400
then I report it to the head office,

627
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:34,457
If so, what is the probability of me being promoted?

628
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:36,121
Around...

629
00:39:36,935 --> 00:39:37,950
three percent?

630
00:39:39,227 --> 00:39:40,813
Then, actually...

631
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,220
Why should I join in
this mess, Kang Do-Chang?

632
00:39:45,436 --> 00:39:46,451
Team Leader,

633
00:39:46,476 --> 00:39:49,413
what is the probability that the chief will
still be respected by our detectives,

634
00:39:49,438 --> 00:39:51,881
if this case is successful?

635
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,805
If that,

636
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,419
ninety-nine percent.

637
00:39:58,558 --> 00:40:00,315
These bastards.

638
00:40:03,237 --> 00:40:04,255
Good grief.

639
00:40:04,876 --> 00:40:08,306
Thank you for taking your time
at a busy time like this.

640
00:40:08,673 --> 00:40:11,142
What happened exactly?

641
00:40:11,197 --> 00:40:12,447
Welcome.

642
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:15,060
Our detectives want to show
something to you.

643
00:40:15,131 --> 00:40:17,021
We've done all the investigations.

644
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,115
We have submitted the data to the prosecutor's office.

645
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,151
It's useless even if Lee Sung-Gon
changes his statement now.

646
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,826
He won't change either.

647
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,701
But, why are they like that
obsessed with him?

648
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:30,237
I don't know what the reason is.

649
00:40:30,864 --> 00:40:32,560
I also do not know.

650
00:40:32,987 --> 00:40:34,244
So you mean,

651
00:40:34,565 --> 00:40:39,424
You can't lead and control
the people under you?

652
00:40:40,954 --> 00:40:42,798
Kang Do-Chang, that person,

653
00:40:43,782 --> 00:40:45,415
on his wedding day,

654
00:40:45,512 --> 00:40:49,145
he is the one who went to catch
criminals at the time of his marriage.

655
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:52,257
Between us,

656
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,884
no police can
control that person.

657
00:40:58,029 --> 00:40:59,123
Please listen.

658
00:41:00,009 --> 00:41:02,625
What did your little sister say?

659
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:08,841
I quiet being a nun because,

660
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,104
I thought I dont deserve to be one.

661
00:41:11,638 --> 00:41:14,662
after I came back to the states I kept thinking about what I...

662
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,890
What I should do for my brother, and

663
00:41:18,630 --> 00:41:20,192
my brother said that,

664
00:41:21,997 --> 00:41:24,200
that he killed people because of me.

665
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,853
This crrazy woman.

666
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,257
I have done him wrong.

667
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,156
too much wrong,

668
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,466
my life has been too happy,

669
00:41:31,491 --> 00:41:34,554
in a way that he has never been able to feel or experience.

670
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:38,596
I never did I ever considered the amount of pain,

671
00:41:38,632 --> 00:41:40,366
that he must have went though

672
00:41:41,502 --> 00:41:43,462
I'm so sorry.

673
00:41:43,504 --> 00:41:45,329
What is she talking?

674
00:41:45,873 --> 00:41:48,556
What are you doing? Yes?

675
00:41:49,374 --> 00:41:51,712
If you show this,

676
00:41:52,313 --> 00:41:54,790
do you think i will confess?

677
00:41:56,131 --> 00:41:58,021
I didn't kill anyone.

678
00:41:58,785 --> 00:42:00,580
You already told Laura Caine.

679
00:42:00,621 --> 00:42:02,394
that You killed people because of her.

680
00:42:04,667 --> 00:42:05,760
So what?

681
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,371
So, what can she do?

682
00:42:08,395 --> 00:42:09,405
Yes?

683
00:42:09,429 --> 00:42:12,961
Bring her here. Bring her and tell her to
say this to people.

684
00:42:13,033 --> 00:42:15,232
I'm just saying I didnt kill.

685
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:16,365
Yes?

686
00:42:16,403 --> 00:42:18,361
It will not happen.
I can confirm it.

687
00:42:18,416 --> 00:42:19,716
She won't come.

688
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,351
Why will she come here from America?

689
00:42:21,375 --> 00:42:22,285
Yes?

690
00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:23,371
She must be crazy to do that.

691
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:24,854
Because this is someone else's business.

692
00:42:24,978 --> 00:42:26,408
She definitely won't come.

693
00:42:27,648 --> 00:42:28,952
Yes. She won't come.

694
00:42:29,216 --> 00:42:31,466
because she cant come here.

695
00:42:32,376 --> 00:42:33,954
Because she's dead.

696
00:42:36,181 --> 00:42:38,345
Because she had committed suicide.

697
00:42:41,672 --> 00:42:42,703
What?

698
00:42:45,363 --> 00:42:46,433
What are you saying?

699
00:42:57,713 --> 00:42:59,213
I know,

700
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,032
I know how much my brother loved his dad.

701
00:43:04,916 --> 00:43:07,421
And I know how much pain he feels just,

702
00:43:07,491 --> 00:43:09,983
just to see me live and go on.

703
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:12,577
Please tell my brother that,

704
00:43:13,353 --> 00:43:15,818
that i'm sorry I left him when I remember,

705
00:43:15,849 --> 00:43:17,756
how much he cared for me,

706
00:43:17,962 --> 00:43:21,259
and I didnt come looking for him sooner.

707
00:43:21,595 --> 00:43:24,814
And there's no need for him to hate anyone.

708
00:43:24,838 --> 00:43:26,841
Because because its me,

709
00:43:26,866 --> 00:43:28,459
who messed up,

710
00:43:29,576 --> 00:43:30,623
Just,

711
00:43:31,607 --> 00:43:32,795
Just hate me.

712
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:38,588
So please...

713
00:43:39,853 --> 00:43:41,572
Please stop.

714
00:43:46,211 --> 00:43:47,515
Why?

715
00:43:52,412 --> 00:43:54,224
Why? Why?

716
00:43:54,271 --> 00:43:55,646
Why?

717
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,379
Why?

718
00:44:02,887 --> 00:44:04,793
Why did she do that?

719
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:06,582
I don't know.

720
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:09,584
She sacrificed herself for you.

721
00:44:10,672 --> 00:44:12,492
To make you stop.

722
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:29,876
Crazy woman!

723
00:44:30,963 --> 00:44:34,050
The mad woman died as she pleased!

724
00:44:34,074 --> 00:44:35,614
Crazy woman.

725
00:44:35,642 --> 00:44:37,627
Because who am I like this?

726
00:44:38,009 --> 00:44:40,514
Because who am I like this?

727
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:46,083
Because who am I like this?
Because who?

728
00:44:49,443 --> 00:44:51,927
Because who am I killing people?

729
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:53,568
Because who?

730
00:44:57,248 --> 00:44:58,756
What? Sacrifice?

731
00:44:59,099 --> 00:45:00,787
Don't say nonsense.

732
00:45:01,498 --> 00:45:04,459
If it weren't for this woman and her mother,

733
00:45:04,637 --> 00:45:07,863
my father would not have died
and I would not have killed people.

734
00:45:08,706 --> 00:45:10,744
All of this happened because of this woman.

735
00:45:10,768 --> 00:45:13,370
So, what does sacrifice mean?
Don't say nonsense!

736
00:45:14,451 --> 00:45:15,506
Shit.

737
00:45:17,518 --> 00:45:19,760
Shit.. Very good.

738
00:45:20,128 --> 00:45:21,807
Yes. Very good.

739
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,198
She really is a crazy woman.

740
00:45:24,798 --> 00:45:27,677
she knew why I kill people.

741
00:45:27,763 --> 00:45:28,943
Very good.

742
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:30,178
Shit.

743
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:32,171
Shit.

744
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:41,634
Kang So Jung.

745
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:44,396
20 years old.

746
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,330
A new employee.

747
00:45:47,945 --> 00:45:49,816
Jung Hye-Jin. 26 years old.

748
00:45:49,992 --> 00:45:51,088
A bank employee.

749
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54,721
Choi Yoon Ah. 25 years old.

750
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,115
A kindergarten teacher.

751
00:45:58,469 --> 00:45:59,616
Park Seon Mi.

752
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,362
21 years old. A student.

753
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,639
And,

754
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:07,387
Jung Hee-Joo.

755
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,724
28 years old.
A company employee.

756
00:46:10,867 --> 00:46:13,023
Kang So-Jung, Jung Hye-Jin,

757
00:46:13,449 --> 00:46:14,622
Choi Yoon Ah,

758
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:16,109
Park Seon Mi,

759
00:46:17,248 --> 00:46:19,420
and the unsuccessful Seong Ju-Ri
you kill.

760
00:46:19,746 --> 00:46:22,948
The five of them are people
who were on the city bus you drive.

761
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,136
But,

762
00:46:27,685 --> 00:46:30,090
Jung Hee-Joo never got on that bus.

763
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:31,543
Why?

764
00:46:33,371 --> 00:46:35,106
Why is only Jung Hee-Joo different?

765
00:46:37,493 --> 00:46:39,149
Is she Jung Hee-Joo?

766
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:45,333
Such a girl is not suitable
with red lipstick.

767
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,674
Someone else killed her.

768
00:46:56,914 --> 00:46:58,534
- Chief Woo.
- Yes.

769
00:46:59,784 --> 00:47:01,989
Today's statement was recorded, right?

770
00:47:02,034 --> 00:47:03,230
Yes. Of course.

771
00:47:03,269 --> 00:47:05,932
So, hand over this data
to these people.

772
00:47:05,959 --> 00:47:07,498
Yes. I will do it.

773
00:47:07,528 --> 00:47:11,004
If you are busy, we will deliver
directly to the prosecutor.

774
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:12,956
What should we do?

775
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,461
You've worked hard.

776
00:47:26,008 --> 00:47:27,296
Forever,

777
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,531
live with problems.

778
00:47:32,733 --> 00:47:34,061
Shit.

779
00:47:36,358 --> 00:47:40,077
Lee Sung-Gon who previously denied
his crimes,

780
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:43,257
he has confessed to the crime.

781
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:47,301
So, are the perpetrators of the five cases
is Lee Sung-Gon?

782
00:47:47,334 --> 00:47:48,352
No.

783
00:47:48,602 --> 00:47:50,859
The fourth murder is denied.

784
00:47:51,338 --> 00:47:55,072
The victim's name is Jung Hee-Joo.

785
00:47:55,142 --> 00:47:56,774
Was that Lee Sung-Gon's statement?

786
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:58,915
Or is this an exposed fact?

787
00:47:58,946 --> 00:48:00,723
Currently, we are
doing an investigation.

788
00:48:00,747 --> 00:48:03,183
Is this unrelated
with Kim Hyeong-Bok,

789
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,824
who was accused of being the culprit?

790
00:48:05,504 --> 00:48:06,574
Yes, right.

791
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:08,807
He has nothing to do with it at all.

792
00:48:09,325 --> 00:48:10,723
For this time,

793
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:15,268
to Kim Hyeong-Bok
who died unjustly,

794
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:17,899
I,representing the entire police force,

795
00:48:17,998 --> 00:48:22,309
I offer my apologies
and deep condolences.

796
00:48:22,333 --> 00:48:27,274
Lee Sung-Gon Case Press Conference

797
00:48:27,671 --> 00:48:30,544
Investigation Team Leader, apologizes
on the death of Kim Hyeong-Bok

798
00:48:32,437 --> 00:48:36,661
The detectives on the front lines,

799
00:48:37,818 --> 00:48:39,982
over-investigated,

800
00:48:40,663 --> 00:48:45,458
we plead guilty
on the death of Kim Hyeong-Bok.

801
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,388
- Good grief.
- The cause of Kim Hyeong-Bok's death,

802
00:48:48,451 --> 00:48:50,474
we will investigate
overall,

803
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:55,088
and we will be responsible
for everything.

804
00:48:55,869 --> 00:48:56,892
Hey, you.

805
00:48:57,968 --> 00:48:59,006
Hey, you.

806
00:48:59,075 --> 00:49:02,412
What should we do
with this situation?

807
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:04,155
What should I do?

808
00:49:04,278 --> 00:49:06,465
We have to find
perpetrator of the Jung Hee-Joo case.

809
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,365
That's not the problem.

810
00:49:08,390 --> 00:49:12,552
They say the death of Kim Hyeong-Bok was
due to over-investigation.

811
00:49:12,586 --> 00:49:14,279
Is not that true?

812
00:49:14,421 --> 00:49:15,965
- What?
- Hey, you.

813
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:19,335
It happened when Kim Hyeong-Bok was
on the run. Why do we...

814
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,891
If the inspection team makes a problem,
please leave it to me.

815
00:49:21,929 --> 00:49:24,924
You just wait for my instructions.

816
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:28,239
Don't you now owe someone
for moving and selling shop?

817
00:49:28,268 --> 00:49:30,880
How will you handle it
if there is a pay cut?

818
00:49:30,904 --> 00:49:34,707
Do not worry about me.
You just take care of your own life.

819
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:36,910
So, how about this?

820
00:49:36,944 --> 00:49:41,291
How about we leave it to
the richest among us...

821
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:42,358
Right. Right.

822
00:49:42,382 --> 00:49:46,372
Among us, there are people whose credit card has no limit,

823
00:49:46,398 --> 00:49:47,460
To that person...

824
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,432
This pay cut wont be an issue.

825
00:49:49,456 --> 00:49:51,421
This is because there is a problem with the promotion.

826
00:49:51,446 --> 00:49:54,100
Are there any between us?
who doesn't care about promotions?

827
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,797
It's for people who have
family responsibilities.

828
00:49:56,836 --> 00:50:00,305
Hey, you. There's nothing between us
people who...

829
00:50:00,667 --> 00:50:01,844
Yes, here.

830
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:04,892
I'm the first to know
whereabouts of Kim Hyeong-Bok.

831
00:50:05,205 --> 00:50:07,877
I'm the most responsible
for everything.

832
00:50:08,542 --> 00:50:10,542
Why do you say that?

833
00:50:10,811 --> 00:50:14,186
People will definitely think
I delegate the matter to my subordinates.

834
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:15,324
No.

835
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:16,497
The person under you?

836
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,918
You are the Assistant Inspector.

837
00:50:18,218 --> 00:50:21,273
He is the Inspector.
Who is taller?

838
00:50:21,588 --> 00:50:23,351
Detectives don't see rank.

839
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:24,625
The most important thing is experience.

840
00:50:24,655 --> 00:50:26,703
Just take it as I am
responsible.

841
00:50:27,224 --> 00:50:29,096
- Great.
- Great.

842
00:50:29,246 --> 00:50:31,590
- Great.
- Great.

843
00:50:32,032 --> 00:50:33,094
Hey, you.

844
00:50:33,133 --> 00:50:34,562
Why did you interfere?

845
00:50:34,601 --> 00:50:37,443
Compared to you, my rank
higher, my money more,

846
00:50:37,471 --> 00:50:39,924
academic, appearance.
I have nothing to lose.

847
00:50:40,507 --> 00:50:41,862
- Great.
- Great.

848
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:50,950
Is the exhibition over?

849
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,098
Yes,

850
00:50:52,717 --> 00:50:53,993
The content was good.

851
00:50:54,018 --> 00:50:56,865
Will people not
think we are too relaxed?

852
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:58,507
We've tried our best.

853
00:50:58,992 --> 00:51:00,860
Think in a good direction.

854
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:05,531
Tae-Ho, you can't even think.

855
00:51:05,763 --> 00:51:06,797
Yes?

856
00:51:07,164 --> 00:51:10,904
Don't think about paying too much to media.

857
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,109
Those people too,

858
00:51:12,516 --> 00:51:14,312
they also have their own limits.

859
00:51:14,341 --> 00:51:17,149
If we cross that line,
we will die together.

860
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,616
Because it happened suddenly,
we couldn't cover it.

861
00:51:20,453 --> 00:51:23,323
But, that's enough of a warning
to McQueen.

862
00:51:23,774 --> 00:51:27,164
I'm going straight to the broadcasting station
to avoid misunderstanding.

863
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:32,282
Looks like I gave a wrong habit to you.

864
00:51:32,462 --> 00:51:33,618
At least,

865
00:51:34,298 --> 00:51:37,958
I should teach you how to
solve the problem you created.

866
00:51:38,576 --> 00:51:40,795
- Yes.
- I think you're wrong.

867
00:51:41,668 --> 00:51:42,801
What?

868
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,372
Let your brother solve the problem.

869
00:51:45,405 --> 00:51:47,796
Because you keep covering it up,

870
00:51:47,999 --> 00:51:49,928
he keeps getting into trouble.

871
00:51:51,139 --> 00:51:52,702
Yes. I understand.

872
00:51:52,803 --> 00:51:54,014
going forward,

873
00:51:54,739 --> 00:51:56,747
don't force yourself to help me.

874
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:00,621
You are more important to the TJ Group.

875
00:52:01,622 --> 00:52:03,833
TJ Group will also fall together.

876
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,861
We have to change the appearance of TJ Group.

877
00:52:09,547 --> 00:52:11,212
From Cheomseongdae,

878
00:52:16,934 --> 00:52:18,338
to heaven.

879
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:25,225
It was to defend TJ Group.

880
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:43,789
That was the President's decision.

881
00:52:44,609 --> 00:52:46,500
Only the time is getting faster.

882
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:48,802
No problem.

883
00:52:50,768 --> 00:52:52,272
Because from the start,

884
00:52:53,193 --> 00:52:55,372
I'm invisible in their eyes.

885
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,149
Hey, Na-Na.

886
00:53:01,599 --> 00:53:04,260
This is the only way
which we can now choose.

887
00:53:06,693 --> 00:53:07,771
We?

888
00:53:09,315 --> 00:53:12,893
If you are in the place
appointed by the President,

889
00:53:13,293 --> 00:53:15,457
you and I are not us.

890
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,779
Why do we do it, the
Jung Hee-Joo's case?

891
00:53:25,803 --> 00:53:28,375
Seoul Investigation Team People should solve it.

892
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:29,406
Hey, Team Leader.

893
00:53:30,010 --> 00:53:32,121
We caught Lee Sung-Gon.

894
00:53:32,145 --> 00:53:34,239
We also received
Lee Sung-Gon's confession.

895
00:53:34,348 --> 00:53:37,426
Shouldn't we finish
last problem?

896
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:39,713
Isn't that right, Criminal Team Two?

897
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,167
- Yes.
- Yes.

898
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:43,234
You guys really are.

899
00:53:44,458 --> 00:53:46,559
First, Kim Hyeong-Bok,

900
00:53:46,975 --> 00:53:50,091
we must finish that over-investigation,

901
00:53:50,155 --> 00:53:52,764
Even though we face
disciplinary actions,

902
00:53:52,834 --> 00:53:55,744
Kim Hyeong-Bok's family will apply
complaints after seeing the news.

903
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:57,915
The problem will be serious.

904
00:53:58,045 --> 00:53:59,725
- Team leader.
- Yes?

905
00:54:00,107 --> 00:54:03,029
There's a package came for our team.

906
00:54:03,243 --> 00:54:04,642
Who sent it?

907
00:54:04,844 --> 00:54:06,586
Park Geum-Soon.

908
00:54:06,729 --> 00:54:08,104
Kim Hyeong-Bok's mother.

909
00:54:28,212 --> 00:54:32,134
Dongsan Church

910
00:54:32,482 --> 00:54:33,896
Good grief.

911
00:54:34,182 --> 00:54:36,209
My dear son.

912
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,282
My Hyeong-bok.

913
00:54:44,658 --> 00:54:47,423
You are going to a beautiful place.

914
00:54:49,713 --> 00:54:51,479
I believe that.

915
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,127
Good grief.

916
00:54:55,162 --> 00:54:57,193
I miss you.

917
00:55:00,701 --> 00:55:02,982
My kind son.

918
00:55:25,108 --> 00:55:26,668
Can you drink?

919
00:55:27,975 --> 00:55:30,342
I only drink when I feel good.

920
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:33,590
Should we be happy?

921
00:55:34,020 --> 00:55:35,796
Aren't detectives like that?

922
00:55:37,155 --> 00:55:38,459
giving pain,

923
00:55:39,272 --> 00:55:40,591
and then give medicine.

924
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,500
This time, we're not the ones giving the medicine.

925
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:46,227
Kim Hyeong-Bok's mother gave us medicine.

926
00:55:49,216 --> 00:55:50,458
Geez.

927
00:55:51,348 --> 00:55:52,586
The medicine is too sweet.

928
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:56,290
You're so annoying.

929
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:12,949
Hey, Na-Na.

930
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:14,879
Hey, Na-Na!

931
00:56:15,295 --> 00:56:16,486
Let me go!

932
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,115
What are you doing?

933
00:56:19,187 --> 00:56:20,710
Leave me alone.

934
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,787
Who are you?

935
00:56:26,803 --> 00:56:28,850
Why are you like a child?

936
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:32,203
Why?

937
00:56:32,735 --> 00:56:34,876
Can't i eat when I want to eat,

938
00:56:34,954 --> 00:56:36,813
and do what i want to do?

939
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,235
Hey, Na-Na.

940
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:57,505
Can't you feel satisfied
with what you have now?

941
00:56:58,738 --> 00:57:00,613
You can be happy.

942
00:57:02,910 --> 00:57:03,957
Are you tired?

943
00:57:03,982 --> 00:57:05,160
No.

944
00:57:05,734 --> 00:57:06,437
Yes.

945
00:57:07,846 --> 00:57:09,135
Yes. I'm tired.

946
00:57:09,630 --> 00:57:11,106
Am I too,

947
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:14,493
making you feel tired ?

948
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:29,630
Please tell me.

949
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:34,442
With your own mouth.

950
00:57:38,611 --> 00:57:40,057
"In this world,

951
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:43,213
You're not alone."

952
00:57:44,658 --> 00:57:47,502
"You don't have to live in loneliness."

953
00:57:49,330 --> 00:57:50,686
"So,

954
00:57:54,236 --> 00:57:57,103
Don't live alone."

955
00:58:14,624 --> 00:58:17,073
I'm sorry for leaving you alone.

956
00:58:22,669 --> 00:58:24,058
Don't try too hard.

957
00:58:34,945 --> 00:58:36,312
Yes. I understand.

958
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:39,196
I'll call you again.
See you.

959
00:58:40,224 --> 00:58:42,107
Dont you have a lot of free time now a days?

960
00:58:42,322 --> 00:58:44,213
Let's have a drink in a nice place .

961
00:58:44,858 --> 00:58:45,944
Yes, good.

962
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,400
Seems like it would be hard to expect from the
Seoul Investigation Team.

963
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:55,752
Team leader has been suspended.

964
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,197
- How is Jung Hee-Joo's investigation?
- Of course starting from scratch.

965
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:00,487
It will be handed over to the local police.

966
00:59:00,512 --> 00:59:02,184
- Incheon Police?
- Yes.

967
00:59:02,604 --> 00:59:04,510
Is there anyone
who can be contacted there?

968
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:09,082
For now, no connection is there which will benefit us.

969
00:59:09,948 --> 00:59:11,043
Oh Ji-Hyeok.

970
00:59:11,541 --> 00:59:14,853
- He can't be controlled?
- Yes.

971
00:59:20,524 --> 00:59:22,570
Let's think about Jung Hee-Joo's case.

972
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:25,909
Most likely he will use the
case of Jung Hee-Joo,

973
00:59:25,933 --> 00:59:27,815
to link
with the case two years ago.

974
00:59:28,365 --> 00:59:30,103
Don't let him into the company.

975
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,244
Yes, understood.

976
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,473
But, if they brought
warrant...

977
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,038
Warrants will not be issued.

978
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:37,610
Yes. I understand.

979
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,368
- Please go.
- Yes.

980
00:59:48,076 --> 00:59:50,599
Legal Team Leader, Woo Tae-Ho

981
00:59:51,701 --> 00:59:54,053
Who killed Jung Hee-Joo?

982
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,301
This.

983
01:00:01,990 --> 01:00:03,615
These are Jung Hee-Joo's item's.

984
01:00:03,789 --> 01:00:05,367
The company sent it.

985
01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:08,384
You haven't checked the contents?

986
01:00:08,408 --> 01:00:09,494
Yes, not yet.

987
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:10,954
Yes. I understand.

988
01:00:10,978 --> 01:00:13,723
We will return it
after we are done with checking.

989
01:00:13,747 --> 01:00:15,338
- Come on.
- Yes.

990
01:00:32,117 --> 01:00:33,640
That day,

991
01:00:34,136 --> 01:00:35,729
I was little frustrated.

992
01:00:36,112 --> 01:00:37,518
I apologize.

993
01:00:38,307 --> 01:00:40,917
You really are a fool.

994
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,018
Yes?

995
01:00:42,209 --> 01:00:45,685
You should have just said it is Lee Sung-Gon
who killed Jung Hee-Joo.

996
01:00:46,013 --> 01:00:49,431
You don't have to look for anyone
who killed Jung Hee-Joo then.

997
01:00:50,117 --> 01:00:54,350
You are a person
who create your own problems.

998
01:00:56,346 --> 01:00:58,326
Eun-Hye said that to me.

999
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:00,540
That I can expect from you.

1000
01:01:00,761 --> 01:01:03,097
That's why the state gives you a salary.

1001
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:06,521
Good grief. Why did she say things
which are not important?

1002
01:01:08,327 --> 01:01:10,835
Thank you for choosing
hard road.

1003
01:01:12,736 --> 01:01:15,003
I know what you want.

1004
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:16,396
A little bit more...

1005
01:01:16,977 --> 01:01:19,099
You just need to be patient a little longer.

1006
01:01:19,162 --> 01:01:20,177
Yes. Okay.

1007
01:01:37,557 --> 01:01:40,416
October two,
Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho's police call

1008
01:01:43,437 --> 01:01:46,155
October five,
Design-related data collection

1009
01:01:49,285 --> 01:01:52,121
October six, the morning meeting of the legal team

1010
01:01:54,678 --> 01:01:56,060
You are beautiful.

1011
01:01:57,714 --> 01:02:00,423
Looks like that position is
only for beautiful people.

1012
01:02:01,619 --> 01:02:03,218
The previous person was also beautiful.

1013
01:02:03,257 --> 01:02:04,428
Just like you.

1014
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:08,037
Did you mean Jung Hee-Joo?

1015
01:02:08,061 --> 01:02:10,288
Who passed away sometimes ago.

1016
01:02:10,428 --> 01:02:11,646
Do you feel uncomfortable?

1017
01:02:11,943 --> 01:02:13,424
I can transfer you, if it's not convenient.

1018
01:02:13,449 --> 01:02:14,746
Not. Not.

1019
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:16,899
Nothing to do with work.

1020
01:02:17,373 --> 01:02:21,206
Have you never worked
in law before?

1021
01:02:21,967 --> 01:02:22,621
Yes.

1022
01:02:22,646 --> 01:02:25,928
But, why Manager Choi
recommend to the legal team?

1023
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,211
Yes?

1024
01:02:28,070 --> 01:02:31,694
I heard one of your family member works in this field.

1025
01:02:31,718 --> 01:02:33,479
My father is a police chief.

1026
01:02:33,503 --> 01:02:34,664
Really?

1027
01:02:34,688 --> 01:02:35,465
Where?

1028
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:37,528
West Incheon Police.

1029
01:02:37,864 --> 01:02:39,091
Really?

1030
01:02:39,823 --> 01:02:42,628
Do you know Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok?

1031
01:02:43,012 --> 01:02:44,410
Yes.

1032
01:02:44,698 --> 01:02:46,307
- A little...
- How do you know?

1033
01:02:46,581 --> 01:02:48,640
I didn't know before.

1034
01:02:48,665 --> 01:02:51,279
I know him because he has something to do
with the legal team here.

1035
01:02:51,310 --> 01:02:52,853
Isn't he very handsome?

1036
01:02:55,118 --> 01:02:57,157
- Don't know.
- If You are close to him,

1037
01:02:57,407 --> 01:02:59,825
can you provide information
about him?

1038
01:03:00,214 --> 01:03:01,311
Yes?

1039
01:03:01,397 --> 01:03:03,639
I'm just curious.

1040
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:05,553
Yes. Okay.

1041
01:03:05,647 --> 01:03:07,811
I will look for information.

1042
01:03:08,842 --> 01:03:10,092
But,

1043
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:12,450
there's something I want to ask.

1044
01:03:13,293 --> 01:03:16,684
After I investigated,
the case about Jung Hee-Joo,

1045
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:19,506
the person in charge is the one who is serving my father.

1046
01:03:19,867 --> 01:03:20,938
It,

1047
01:03:21,301 --> 01:03:23,723
Was that the reason,
am I in this position?

1048
01:03:24,737 --> 01:03:25,790
Besides that,

1049
01:03:25,815 --> 01:03:29,292
I can meet people of
high ranks like you,

1050
01:03:29,673 --> 01:03:31,011
is that the reason?

1051
01:03:31,035 --> 01:03:32,221
How old are you?

1052
01:03:32,612 --> 01:03:34,135
I, 24 years old.

1053
01:03:34,414 --> 01:03:36,161
Shouldn't you understand?

1054
01:03:36,650 --> 01:03:38,712
Nothing is by chance in this world.

1055
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:40,454
Just decide for yourself.

1056
01:03:40,762 --> 01:03:41,879
But,

1057
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:46,095
company wants people
who are willing to work for the company.

1058
01:03:46,990 --> 01:03:48,537
You just need to remember that.

1059
01:03:48,901 --> 01:03:49,940
Yes. Okay.

1060
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:52,013
I understand.

1061
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:54,061
You're interesting.

1062
01:04:02,318 --> 01:04:05,162
Fingerprints are left when ripping it off.

1063
01:04:05,523 --> 01:04:07,059
What does it mean?

1064
01:04:07,374 --> 01:04:08,794
Is it like a password?

1065
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:12,325
Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho's police call

1066
01:04:12,499 --> 01:04:14,194
Yes. Thank you

1067
01:04:14,221 --> 01:04:15,257
Yes.

1068
01:04:16,724 --> 01:04:18,772
Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho
called the prosecutor that day.

1069
01:04:18,828 --> 01:04:22,411
During the investigation, there was a search
against TJ Group's legal team.

1070
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:26,671
They carried out searches
when there was no Team Leader.

1071
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:29,808
There would definitely be a commotion
during a legal team search.

1072
01:04:29,837 --> 01:04:33,243
She wrote in an emergency
and tore it up.

1073
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,874
What's with this number?

1074
01:04:38,694 --> 01:04:41,224
You know the prosecutor and the police are separate organizations, right?

1075
01:04:41,249 --> 01:04:42,412
Yes. I know.

1076
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:45,019
I was a policeman
but now in the prosecutor's office.

1077
01:04:45,146 --> 01:04:46,990
Don't make my position difficult.

1078
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,279
Only I will know.

1079
01:04:48,303 --> 01:04:49,443
Thank you

1080
01:04:57,265 --> 01:04:59,460
Have you opened this?

1081
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:00,968
Yes. I've opened and checked.

1082
01:05:00,993 --> 01:05:02,696
But, I can't open this for you.

1083
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,037
No need to do that.

1084
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:05,141
This. This...

1085
01:05:22,276 --> 01:05:24,807
Call Details List

1086
01:05:29,755 --> 01:05:32,460
That day, Woo Tae-Ho
called Jung Hee-Joo.

1087
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:34,477
The time is the same as the search time.

1088
01:05:34,501 --> 01:05:38,329
Woo Tae-Ho gave the password
to Jung Hee-Joo.

1089
01:05:39,002 --> 01:05:41,541
Jung Hee-Joo took something
from the safe.

1090
01:05:41,575 --> 01:05:42,841
In the call list,

1091
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:45,643
an interesting name is there.

1092
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,183
Who?

1093
01:05:48,054 --> 01:05:49,922
Person I can't reach.

1094
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,045
What?

1095
01:06:08,916 --> 01:06:11,454
West Incheon Police.

1096
01:06:25,986 --> 01:06:27,580
The phone is not being picked up.

1097
01:06:28,183 --> 01:06:30,035
Are there any other suspicious numbers?

1098
01:06:30,205 --> 01:06:32,088
There are numbers that don't have names.

1099
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:33,770
Looks like a disposable phone.

1100
01:06:33,794 --> 01:06:34,875
Try calling.

1101
01:06:37,265 --> 01:06:40,179
I can't go out today
because i feel bit sick.

1102
01:06:41,571 --> 01:06:44,680
Lately I have a lot of
mental difficulties.

1103
01:06:45,205 --> 01:06:46,510
See you later.

1104
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:43,277
You killed him because of me, right?

1105
01:07:43,311 --> 01:07:44,889
I'm talking about Jung Hee-Joo.

1106
01:07:44,920 --> 01:07:46,983
You told the detective?

1107
01:07:47,008 --> 01:07:48,344
What's your relationship?

1108
01:07:48,368 --> 01:07:51,347
Something to do with the case two years ago
with the Jung Hee-Joo case.

1109
01:07:51,371 --> 01:07:53,615
Have you found the
perpetrator of the case?

1110
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:55,334
I suspect someone.

1111
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:57,453
Should I think about him?

1112
01:07:57,477 --> 01:07:59,579
Where did you get these photos from?

1113
01:07:59,613 --> 01:08:01,213
There is a possibility of forgery.

1114
01:08:01,238 --> 01:08:03,650
Send Na-Na to America.
It's better that she's doesnt stay here.

1115
01:08:03,684 --> 01:08:06,262
This is a shitty investigation.

1116
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:09,399
If you bring important evidence,

1117
01:08:09,423 --> 01:08:11,479
we can make a deal.
