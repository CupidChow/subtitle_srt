00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:22,408
Sorry Hee-Joo.

7
00:00:23,657 --> 00:00:25,499
In his world now,

8
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:28,327
Hee-Joo will also definitely
beg for forgiveness.

9
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,773
Excuse me, Director Cheon.

10
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:33,267
What do I have to do?

11
00:00:33,296 --> 00:00:34,483
I will serve him.

12
00:00:34,508 --> 00:00:35,889
He is an honored guest.

13
00:00:37,547 --> 00:00:38,925
Would you like some coffee?

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,125
Yes thank you.

15
00:00:41,766 --> 00:00:43,218
Please wait a moment.

16
00:00:47,454 --> 00:00:50,399
Yes, it's okay.
Please speak, Director Cheon.

17
00:00:56,305 --> 00:00:57,446
All right, Director.

18
00:00:57,477 --> 00:00:58,494
I'll be there soon.

19
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,758
Oh my gosh, Hee-Joo.

20
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,750
Good grief.

21
00:01:05,797 --> 00:01:07,016
Why don't you answer my phone?

22
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,775
Did something happen?

23
00:01:14,007 --> 00:01:15,541
Director Cheon.

24
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,291
Yes

25
00:01:22,261 --> 00:01:24,393
Are you Director Cheon?

26
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,667
That's what they call me.

27
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:27,925
is

28
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,480
Hee-Joo also calls you like that?

29
00:01:29,505 --> 00:01:30,543
Right.

30
00:01:31,291 --> 00:01:32,319
But,

31
00:01:32,403 --> 00:01:34,848
why are you suddenly asking that?

32
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,325
Oh ,, Yeah 

33
00:01:36,645 --> 00:01:38,661
I suddenly remembered

34
00:01:39,293 --> 00:01:40,949
when Hee-Joo said

35
00:01:40,974 --> 00:01:43,020
"Director Cheon" on the phone.

36
00:01:45,263 --> 00:01:46,723
Come to think of it,

37
00:01:46,778 --> 00:01:48,895
I remember talking to her
on the phone.

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:51,825
Jung Hee-Joo
tenders her resignation from the company.

39
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:54,567
I wanted to hold her
so I asked to meet.

40
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:56,552
I do not want

41
00:01:56,599 --> 00:01:58,957
lost talented people
due to personal problems.

42
00:02:00,302 --> 00:02:02,059
Is that right?

43
00:02:30,217 --> 00:02:31,262
<i>Episode 13</i>

44
00:02:31,295 --> 00:02:33,044
- Who is that man?
- Yeah, so it's like this.

45
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,668
You know the guy who stole the cash

46
00:02:34,693 --> 00:02:36,904
at Cheonma-dong's pool, right?

47
00:02:36,935 --> 00:02:38,724
The culprit is this man.

48
00:02:38,795 --> 00:02:39,833
Okay.

49
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:41,237
You found the gun?

50
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:42,378
It...

51
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,058
- Here's the gun.
- Okay.

52
00:02:44,136 --> 00:02:46,347
But, that's not it.

53
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:47,698
Hey!

54
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:48,977
you hit

55
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,169
behind the owner's head.

56
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:52,004
Everything was caught on CCTV cameras.

57
00:02:52,029 --> 00:02:54,057
It's a regular billiard ball.

58
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,436
The ball I use

59
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:57,526
to hit is billiard ball.

60
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,279
It's the same.

61
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,915
Of course it's different.
The billiard ball is much smaller.

62
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,018
Stop it.

63
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:04,475
You guys playing around?

64
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:06,090
Check the CCTV,

65
00:03:06,115 --> 00:03:07,550
and find the right weapon!

66
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,628
Well.

67
00:03:09,723 --> 00:03:10,760
Well.

68
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,175
Do-Chang.

69
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:15,441
What did the prosecutor say?

70
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,129
Did Cheon Sang-Woo appeal?

71
00:03:17,168 --> 00:03:18,581
Isn't that obvious?

72
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:20,692
Hey, if we lose here,

73
00:03:20,734 --> 00:03:22,050
wouldn't our position be difficult?

74
00:03:22,098 --> 00:03:23,634
Didn't you hear what the Chief said?

75
00:03:23,659 --> 00:03:25,074
We don't need to care about it.

76
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:26,309
How can you not care?

77
00:03:26,334 --> 00:03:29,177
If Cheon Sang-Woo comes back to life,
we will die.

78
00:03:29,743 --> 00:03:31,599
- Jae-Hong.
<i>- Seriously.</i>

79
00:03:31,841 --> 00:03:33,083
Jae-Hong.

80
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:35,099
We both have caught the culprit!

81
00:03:35,124 --> 00:03:37,240
Moreover, within the day
after the murder.

82
00:03:37,271 --> 00:03:39,044
Well, good job.

83
00:03:39,271 --> 00:03:40,536
There is an article about us.

84
00:03:40,584 --> 00:03:42,669
Criminal Team at Incheon West Office

85
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:46,134
seems to have been active to
reveal Cheon Sang-Woo's crimes.

86
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,189
Dong Wook.

87
00:03:47,214 --> 00:03:49,190
They can't
just call it "Criminal Team."

88
00:03:49,238 --> 00:03:51,940
They should have made it clear
that it was Team Criminal 2.

89
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,503
- Where's that?
- Hey.

90
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:59,464
Hey! You think because the pool ball
is smaller it makes your penalty smaller?

91
00:03:59,496 --> 00:04:00,649
Your story is over.

92
00:04:00,674 --> 00:04:01,791
Follow me.

93
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:08,632
<i>Yoo Ji-Sook, Cheon Sung-Dae's brother, is the founder of
Ketua TJ Group</i>

94
00:04:10,123 --> 00:04:13,420
<i>At the scene there is also Cheon Na-Na
who is Yoon Ji-Sook's daughter.</i>

95
00:04:13,474 --> 00:04:15,966
Everyone just saw something
high.

96
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:18,325
Do you think people will see
perpetrators hitting people

97
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:21,232
with a billiard ball versus
a big company guy?

98
00:04:21,257 --> 00:04:23,717
I don't know if they
make a big difference.

99
00:04:24,006 --> 00:04:25,552
They are the same,

100
00:04:25,577 --> 00:04:28,404
be it the leader of a large corporation,
or a robber.

101
00:04:28,709 --> 00:04:30,459
The ratings are slightly different.

102
00:04:31,209 --> 00:04:32,747
Everything looks the same to me.

103
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,044
One person was hit six times,
and the other was hit five times.

104
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:38,943
These days, your standard of living
is a lottery draw.

105
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:40,904
Life is a lottery draw.

106
00:04:42,514 --> 00:04:44,014
Oh, itu Eun-Hee!

107
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,443
What the hell is that?

108
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,037
Looks like Eun-Hee has a boyfriend.

109
00:04:48,062 --> 00:04:49,334
Ajussi 

110
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:50,765
Can She be like that?

111
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,829
She is a mother.

112
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:53,048
Who cares?

113
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,460
She can date for herself

114
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,532
Good grief.

115
00:04:55,813 --> 00:04:57,296
The car is very good.

116
00:04:57,335 --> 00:04:59,116
- Looks like he's a rich man.
- Hey, Ji-Woong.

117
00:04:59,148 --> 00:05:00,890
You don't know that kind of face?

118
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:03,202
"I'm a bad person."
Are you really a detective?

119
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:06,274
He looks like a bad guy.

120
00:05:06,299 --> 00:05:08,079
We have to investigate that person.

121
00:05:08,174 --> 00:05:09,283
But,

122
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:12,182
why today
Eun-Hee looks so beautiful?

123
00:05:12,689 --> 00:05:15,134
What are they doing?

124
00:05:25,126 --> 00:05:26,946
Are you Director Cheon?

125
00:05:26,985 --> 00:05:28,204
<i>Na-Na.</i>

126
00:05:30,491 --> 00:05:32,430
<i>You killed Woo Tae-Ho, didn't you?</i>

127
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,547
I wonder
what Woo Tae-Ho thinks

128
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,124
before he died.

129
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,201
Father has come?

130
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:06,950
Meanwhile,

131
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:08,755
I will not go forward.

132
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,810
Dad should go out and rest.

133
00:06:10,964 --> 00:06:12,401
Dad's been in trouble.

134
00:06:12,436 --> 00:06:15,210
Seems like it doesn't need to be like that.

135
00:06:15,421 --> 00:06:17,917
I'll be keeping an eye on the situation
for a while.

136
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:20,187
What would you do?

137
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:22,508
I don't know either.

138
00:06:22,578 --> 00:06:24,250
What should I do?

139
00:06:25,805 --> 00:06:27,164
What should I do

140
00:06:27,196 --> 00:06:28,214
to you?

141
00:06:30,149 --> 00:06:31,914
Sang-Woo keeps blaming you.

142
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:35,071
Na-Na, I think you have made the situation
like this.

143
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:37,039
I'm not doing well.

144
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,485
But,

145
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,914
I didn't do
anything wrong either.

146
00:06:41,373 --> 00:06:43,154
It was Sang-Woo's fault.

147
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,795
He must take responsibility

148
00:06:44,834 --> 00:06:46,702
and handle it yourself.

149
00:06:48,397 --> 00:06:50,076
You think I don't know

150
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:51,500
what have you done?

151
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,318
Ayah.

152
00:06:55,951 --> 00:06:57,483
- I...
- Na-Na.

153
00:06:57,592 --> 00:07:00,319
Shouldn't
you be thanking me?

154
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:03,657
I have accepted you
as my daughter.

155
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:04,866
Therefore,

156
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:08,051
You just need to have
what I give you.

157
00:07:08,106 --> 00:07:10,066
When you want something else,

158
00:07:10,668 --> 00:07:13,371
You are not qualified
to be my daughter.

159
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,486
You have to be lower.

160
00:07:16,918 --> 00:07:18,059
Humble yourself

161
00:07:18,098 --> 00:07:20,809
to the bottom and shrink.

162
00:07:20,856 --> 00:07:21,926
Only that

163
00:07:22,246 --> 00:07:24,621
how to make you

164
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:26,493
still be my daughter.

165
00:07:39,998 --> 00:07:41,576
<i>I've tried calling him,</i>

166
00:07:41,629 --> 00:07:42,655
<i>but he won't talk.</i>

167
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,203
He didn't pick up the phone again.

168
00:07:44,848 --> 00:07:46,293
It could happen.

169
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:49,222
He is the most innocent person
among his friends.

170
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,558
Perhaps he was afraid
of harming the detectives.

171
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,879
He can't talk.

172
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:56,152
Right after Woo Tae-Ho's accident,

173
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:58,660
The Traffic Crimes Department
moved him to the countryside.

174
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,355
There must be a reason.

175
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:02,613
<i>Police station</i>

176
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,269
- A man?
- Right.

177
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:15,164
Eun-Hee went out with the guy last night.

178
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:16,383
It...

179
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,632
There's no law Eun-Hee
can't date a man.

180
00:08:18,675 --> 00:08:20,347
You can't blame me for that, can you?

181
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,698
Right.

182
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,347
But when I checked the car,

183
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,144
it is a rental car.

184
00:08:28,081 --> 00:08:29,925
This fool girl 

185
00:08:30,253 --> 00:08:32,870
She really doesn't have
good male taste.

186
00:08:33,097 --> 00:08:34,230
What will we do?

187
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,894
We have to investigate.

188
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,776
You might be
even more humiliated if you missed it.

189
00:08:39,636 --> 00:08:41,042
I'm back.

190
00:08:42,198 --> 00:08:43,597
Have you met him?

191
00:08:43,706 --> 00:08:45,065
Yes, I met him.

192
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:46,152
What did he say?

193
00:08:47,395 --> 00:08:49,050
Woo Tae-Ho didn't kill himself.

194
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:51,667
What do you want to talk about?

195
00:08:53,253 --> 00:08:57,525
What's with this bad premonition
that isn't even a hopeful story?

196
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,675
Today,

197
00:08:58,925 --> 00:09:02,776
I, Oh Ji-Hyeok, Shim Dong-Wook
met a policeman.

198
00:09:02,847 --> 00:09:05,760
His name is Kim Chang-Seo.

199
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:09,316
He is a friend of the
Traffic Criminal Investigation section

200
00:09:09,363 --> 00:09:13,229
who had investigated
the case of Woo Tae-Ho's death.

201
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:16,606
Now he is expelled,
and is in the local district.

202
00:09:16,645 --> 00:09:20,005
Are you going to reveal
Woo Tae-Hoo's death?

203
00:09:22,772 --> 00:09:24,131
Why my bad feeling

204
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:26,295
never wrong?

205
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,201
- Then?
- Hey, Dong-Wook.

206
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:31,009
Tell me what you heard
from your partner.

207
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,636
I heard there's an inspection

208
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:34,876
against the car involved
in Woo Tae-Ho's death.

209
00:09:34,942 --> 00:09:37,009
They found two fingerprints on the car.

210
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,480
Woo Tae-Ho who died,
and Cheon Na-Na who also came.

211
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:42,033
Isn't that an obvious thing?

212
00:09:42,064 --> 00:09:44,025
We found Cheon Na-Na's fingerprints

213
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:46,525
on the seat belt switch and steering wheel.

214
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:48,658
It was Woo Tae-Ho who was driving at the time of the accident.

215
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,439
Married couples
can take turns driving.

216
00:09:51,471 --> 00:09:53,064
What's wrong with that?

217
00:09:53,089 --> 00:09:55,760
Cheon Na-Na was drunk in an accident.

218
00:09:55,785 --> 00:09:57,424
It was confirmed at the hospital

219
00:09:57,463 --> 00:09:58,854
where Cheon Na Na was treated.

220
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,527
A situation where he can't drive.

221
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,564
Not that it's proof

222
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:05,472
to reverse the case, right?

223
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,510
<i>This is our best way.</i>

224
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,877
<i>Just do</i>
<i></i><i>what I want this time.</i>

225
00:10:10,361 --> 00:10:12,025
<i>I'll take care of everything.</i>

226
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,578
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

227
00:10:15,921 --> 00:10:18,726
<i>I don't believe you.</i>

228
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:20,581
You heard it in the middle of the conversation, right?

229
00:10:20,644 --> 00:10:22,512
It was the sound of unbuckling the seat belt.

230
00:10:22,785 --> 00:10:24,245
Cheon Na-Na stated

231
00:10:24,277 --> 00:10:26,933
that Woo Tae-Ho had
unbuckled his own seat belt.

232
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,739
If Cheon Na-Na's fingerprint
is from that switch,

233
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:31,356
that means he let her go.

234
00:10:31,403 --> 00:10:32,497
Then,

235
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:34,708
Cheon Na-Na took over the steering wheel,
and changed direction.

236
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:36,778
Towards a truck coming from the other direction.

237
00:10:37,278 --> 00:10:38,848
Therefore,

238
00:10:38,973 --> 00:10:40,895
we got
Cheon Na-Na's fingerprint from the steering wheel.

239
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:41,981
Hey.

240
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,731
It's because of you, Oh Ji-Hyeok

241
00:10:45,012 --> 00:10:48,473
think that Cheon Na-Na
killed Woo Tae-Ho,

242
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,885
so he adapts
everything you think.

243
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,456
That's your own opinion.

244
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,994
Detective Oh isn't the only one
who thinks that way.

245
00:10:56,034 --> 00:10:58,994
My partner also has the same suspicions
as Detective Oh.

246
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,840
That's why the Traffic Crime Department questioned this,

247
00:11:01,926 --> 00:11:03,362
and became the reason
why my friend got kicked out.

248
00:11:03,387 --> 00:11:05,518
He was under external pressure.

249
00:11:06,033 --> 00:11:08,135
But he asked the
unnecessary question,

250
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,870
so I told him to move.

251
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:12,737
Isn't that a familiar scenario?

252
00:11:14,487 --> 00:11:17,018
So, what's the bottom line?

253
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:21,396
We're going to arrest the top brass of TJ Group

254
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,709
on charges of murder.

255
00:11:24,194 --> 00:11:25,701
Then, we catch Cheon Na-Na,

256
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:28,256
daughter of the chairman of TJ Group,

257
00:11:28,295 --> 00:11:32,303
for the murder of her husband?

258
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,443
Is that it ?

259
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,975
Hey guys 

260
00:11:36,412 --> 00:11:39,248
Chairman Cheon Sung-Dae is free.

261
00:11:39,655 --> 00:11:43,217
We sent his son
who was like gold into prison,

262
00:11:43,256 --> 00:11:45,076
and she only has an only daughter.

263
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:50,127
If we catch Cheon Na-Na
as the murderer of her husband,

264
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,173
do you think they will let us?

265
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,849
He has wealth

266
00:11:54,874 --> 00:11:56,769
over trillions of won.

267
00:11:57,276 --> 00:11:59,595
Ten billion for each of your necks,

268
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,572
won't make him poor.

269
00:12:01,612 --> 00:12:03,284
Do you still want to do it?

270
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:06,891
Okay.

271
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,197
In that case,

272
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,939
let's redefine it.

273
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,993
Raise your hand

274
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:16,384
if you risk your life

275
00:12:16,454 --> 00:12:17,837
to investigate again.

276
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:20,775
One two three...

277
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,189
Because there are eight people inside...

278
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:24,790
Why all of a sudden you?

279
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:26,384
Dong-Wook was investigating, wasn't he?

280
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:27,960
I'm his mentor.

281
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,140
As his mentor, I was a little embarrassed.

282
00:12:31,352 --> 00:12:32,422
Okay.

283
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:34,016
All right, like that.

284
00:12:34,054 --> 00:12:35,345
Four.

285
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,467
What's wrong with you?

286
00:12:37,492 --> 00:12:39,663
I'm the Team Leader.

287
00:12:39,726 --> 00:12:41,398
After I heard,

288
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:45,320
it's not a baseless story.

289
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:46,757
It's already five people.

290
00:12:46,782 --> 00:12:48,115
That's more than half, Mr. Head.

291
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,234
But,

292
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:51,554
in a case like this,

293
00:12:51,593 --> 00:12:53,085
it's not the majority.

294
00:12:53,242 --> 00:12:56,343
There must be the approval
of more than one third of the quorum.

295
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,835
- What's wrong with you?
- I...

296
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:01,429
I don't like the number five.

297
00:13:01,468 --> 00:13:03,686
One two three four five six.

298
00:13:03,757 --> 00:13:05,733
- Looks like it's already perfect.
- I also?

299
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:08,304
Put your hands down.
I only need six figures.

300
00:13:08,351 --> 00:13:09,482
That's a bonus.

301
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:11,357
Seven in total?

302
00:13:25,828 --> 00:13:28,257
Even though the Head has given permission,

303
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:31,023
we still haven't had a chance.

304
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,847
If we investigate everything
for no reason,

305
00:13:32,883 --> 00:13:36,469
just like the Chief of Police said,
only we can run into trouble.

306
00:13:37,054 --> 00:13:39,734
Well.
I'll be looking for further clues .

307
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,242
Looks like we should go
and move together then.

308
00:13:42,297 --> 00:13:44,079
Everyone believes in you.

309
00:13:44,104 --> 00:13:46,149
If you have no hope,
quickly give up.

310
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:48,172
It's a way for the whole team.

311
00:13:49,415 --> 00:13:50,555
Well.

312
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:52,994
Please come in. See you tomorrow.

313
00:14:09,884 --> 00:14:10,954
What is it?

314
00:14:10,992 --> 00:14:12,015
Ya, how do-chang.

315
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,017
The rental car I said before,

316
00:14:14,071 --> 00:14:15,508
the car owner right now,

317
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,860
 Is in the shop.

318
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:18,051
What?

319
00:14:36,319 --> 00:14:38,397
- Hello.
<i>- Let's meet.</i>

320
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:40,389
<i>I want to ask you something.</i>

321
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:43,787
Where are you?

322
00:14:47,454 --> 00:14:48,622
You must

323
00:14:48,694 --> 00:14:50,217
make time tomorrow.

324
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,553
Yeah, I'll go
when I've closed everything.

325
00:14:52,584 --> 00:14:54,209
I'll be there soon.

326
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,670
Thanks for the fried chicken.

327
00:14:56,748 --> 00:14:59,013
Yes, enjoy.

328
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:03,212
Wait.

329
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:04,902
I forgot something.

330
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,142
That Jerk 

331
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:14,611
Wait a minute.

332
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,962
We'll catch him together.

333
00:15:17,025 --> 00:15:18,291
Let's follow them.

334
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:20,455
He must have left the car
somewhere.

335
00:15:21,956 --> 00:15:24,954
Just because you drive a rental car,
that doesn't mean you're a criminal.

336
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:27,938
Of course. Maybe he
brought his friend's car to a date

337
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,524
That is enough.
We continue with the next case 

338
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:33,829
please

339
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:36,898
I can go crazy seeing things like that.

340
00:15:43,243 --> 00:15:45,243
Excuse me.

341
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:47,914
Do you own this car?

342
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,095
Can.

343
00:15:50,485 --> 00:15:51,766
Right, this is my car.

344
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,673
We are detectives from...

345
00:15:57,067 --> 00:15:58,121
Hey!

346
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,651
Why did you run?

347
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,799
why did you run away you stupid jerk 

348
00:16:16,987 --> 00:16:19,853
What did you do to make you run?

349
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:22,604
Can't you be nice?

350
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,877
Good grief.

351
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,612
Why does it have to be a man like you?

352
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,615
Why?

353
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:38,315
Who are you?

354
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:40,870
Ak Oh Ji-Hyeok from Incheon West Office.

355
00:16:40,925 --> 00:16:42,166
Yes, I heard about you.

356
00:16:42,198 --> 00:16:43,331
Please come in.

357
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:44,551
Open the door.

358
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,834
Please sit there.

359
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,577
What do you want to ask of me?

360
00:17:16,186 --> 00:17:17,873
Protect me.

361
00:17:18,522 --> 00:17:21,483
I want you to stop being a detective
and protect me.

362
00:17:22,436 --> 00:17:24,327
Tell me your requirements.

363
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:25,709
I will listen to everything.

364
00:17:25,764 --> 00:17:26,991
Forgive me.

365
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,960
That's a request I can't accept.

366
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,584
My offer is only once.
I will never do it again.

367
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:33,720
I already told you that
this request is unreasonable.

368
00:17:35,108 --> 00:17:37,639
Then you will become my enemy.

369
00:17:38,163 --> 00:17:39,608
You

370
00:17:40,045 --> 00:17:43,529
know the reason why I could die.

371
00:17:45,834 --> 00:17:49,147
If my dad finds out what I did
to Sang-Woo,

372
00:17:49,381 --> 00:17:51,491
my father will kill me.

373
00:17:51,522 --> 00:17:52,990
Just you and me,

374
00:17:54,385 --> 00:17:56,393
who knows about this.

375
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,970
I already promised.

376
00:17:59,134 --> 00:18:01,321
I won't do anything
to harm you.

377
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:04,392
Then you should
n't have turned down my offer.

378
00:18:04,509 --> 00:18:05,930
There's nothing I can do.

379
00:18:06,962 --> 00:18:09,782
If you don't believe me,

380
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:12,502
I am your enemy
as you say.

381
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,985
So, now we have finished
our relationship.

382
00:18:18,087 --> 00:18:19,720
Too bad.

383
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:23,485
I thought you were the only friend

384
00:18:23,985 --> 00:18:26,696
who has the same past
as me.

385
00:18:28,571 --> 00:18:31,782
Your mother died because of you, right?

386
00:18:31,962 --> 00:18:34,892
My mother also killed herself because of me.

387
00:18:37,274 --> 00:18:39,634
We are both murderers.

388
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,414
A killer who kills

389
00:18:41,477 --> 00:18:43,243
her mother.

390
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:47,059
Is...

391
00:18:49,793 --> 00:18:53,075
You really think
your mother died because of you?

392
00:18:54,272 --> 00:18:57,418
Isn't it because you're looking for an excuse
to satisfy yourself?

393
00:18:59,191 --> 00:19:01,386
Your mother, Yoon Ji-Sook,
is preparing a lawsuit

394
00:19:01,411 --> 00:19:04,455
against Chairman Cheon Sung-Dae.

395
00:19:05,035 --> 00:19:08,410
It was a demand
to have you as an official princess.

396
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:11,521
Your mother thinks that Cheon Sung-Dae
and Cheon Sang-Woo are after money.

397
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:13,161
You put pressure on your mother.

398
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:14,897
That's the reason why

399
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:16,574
your mother committed suicide.

400
00:19:18,025 --> 00:19:19,885
It's because of me.

401
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:22,795
She died to save me.

402
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,066
They sent me to America.

403
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,920
My mother sacrificed herself
to protect me.

404
00:19:30,889 --> 00:19:33,178
You were there at the time of the suicide.

405
00:19:33,483 --> 00:19:34,818
You just left her

406
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:39,610
You think your mother is an object
to be recognized as a princess.

407
00:19:39,904 --> 00:19:42,652
I was on a plane
to the United States at the time.

408
00:19:42,677 --> 00:19:44,349
It's your past being manipulated.

409
00:19:44,863 --> 00:19:48,399
A past made up
to hide the truth.

410
00:19:48,924 --> 00:19:50,128
No

411
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,561
At that time, my father and brother
only spoke to the press

412
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:56,351
to hide their sins.

413
00:20:01,211 --> 00:20:02,367
Do not tell,

414
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:06,500
you really believe in the past

415
00:20:07,296 --> 00:20:08,696
that you fake?

416
00:20:15,226 --> 00:20:17,031
Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok.

417
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:19,171
You can go now.

418
00:20:19,453 --> 00:20:21,557
I already know enough
what you think of me.

419
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,038
So, hurry up and go.

420
00:20:28,178 --> 00:20:29,702
Remember that.

421
00:20:31,226 --> 00:20:34,078
You were the one who strangled me first.

422
00:21:45,309 --> 00:21:46,621
<i>Remember well.</i>

423
00:21:49,512 --> 00:21:52,254
<i>You strangled me first.</i>

424
00:21:54,074 --> 00:21:57,090
You were the one who strangled me first.

425
00:22:00,606 --> 00:22:01,840
Because of that...

426
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:10,864
Because of that...

427
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,155
<i>Open the door.</i>

428
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:39,091
<i>Don't behave too much,</i>
<i></i><i>quickly open the door!</i>

429
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:43,052
<i>I know what you're thinking.</i>

430
00:22:43,724 --> 00:22:46,810
<i>I know you're after money!</i>

431
00:22:47,411 --> 00:22:49,138
<i>It won't go your way!</i>

432
00:22:49,163 --> 00:22:52,068
<i>It won't! Hurry</i>
<i></i><i>give up and open the door!</i>

433
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:53,992
<i>Open the door!</i>

434
00:22:58,904 --> 00:23:00,217
Mother

435
00:23:04,366 --> 00:23:05,491
Na-Na.

436
00:23:07,577 --> 00:23:09,397
You want to go with mom?

437
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,358
You want to go with mom?

438
00:24:09,272 --> 00:24:11,482
I wasn't here at that time.

439
00:24:17,701 --> 00:24:20,068
I wasn't here at that time.

440
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,928
I wasn't here at that time.

441
00:24:33,342 --> 00:24:35,482
He's been a criminal five times.

442
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:39,037
I haven't done it.

443
00:24:39,062 --> 00:24:41,428
I am currently doing a legal business.

444
00:24:41,453 --> 00:24:43,647
- Why bring a fake license plate car?
- It...

445
00:24:44,303 --> 00:24:46,553
I bought it to save tax.

446
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:47,982
Then why did you run away?

447
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,967
He's a car insurance scammer.

448
00:24:51,992 --> 00:24:54,709
You must be using a fake license plate car,

449
00:24:55,014 --> 00:24:56,326
because I want to cheat again.

450
00:24:56,351 --> 00:24:58,717
Did you know I'm a detective

451
00:24:58,803 --> 00:25:00,936
and deliberately approached my sister?

452
00:25:01,068 --> 00:25:02,678
You think I'm crazy?

453
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:05,670
I'm so unlucky.

454
00:25:05,695 --> 00:25:07,553
You Jerk,, what do you say?

455
00:25:07,578 --> 00:25:08,818
Enough already.

456
00:25:09,013 --> 00:25:10,644
It's okay if he doesn't know that.

457
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,561
From now on you better
not see my sister.

458
00:25:13,889 --> 00:25:15,732
If she finds out you're a bad person,

459
00:25:15,904 --> 00:25:19,350
not me, but my sister
who will finish you off.

460
00:25:19,375 --> 00:25:21,998
Sis Eun-Hee is
a national judo gold medal holder.

461
00:25:22,023 --> 00:25:24,061
He can finish you off
with just one hand.

462
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:25,162
Understand?

463
00:25:25,187 --> 00:25:26,334
Really?

464
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,381
I do not know that.

465
00:25:28,669 --> 00:25:30,224
Even though she looked very weak.

466
00:25:32,045 --> 00:25:34,693
In your eyes my sister looks weak?

467
00:25:34,718 --> 00:25:35,811
Yes

468
00:25:35,975 --> 00:25:38,100
Honestly I have no other intentions.

469
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:39,646
She looks lonely.

470
00:25:39,899 --> 00:25:43,133
Therefore, I just wanted to cheer her up.

471
00:25:47,071 --> 00:25:48,329
Investigate this person.

472
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,227
And all,

473
00:25:50,252 --> 00:25:52,766
find out also the provider
of fake car plates for him,

474
00:25:52,791 --> 00:25:54,180
and we caught them all.

475
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:56,672
- I go first.
- Goodbye.

476
00:25:56,697 --> 00:25:57,820
Goodbye.

477
00:25:58,407 --> 00:26:00,047
Where did you get that fake license plate from?

478
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,039
You must have stolen it
and then replaced the plate, right?

479
00:26:03,219 --> 00:26:04,790
I really don't know.

480
00:26:05,251 --> 00:26:07,305
I bought it on the internet.

481
00:26:07,391 --> 00:26:08,555
Hey.

482
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:11,796
You want me to investigate this?
You want me to make you open your mouth?

483
00:26:11,821 --> 00:26:13,118
No, no.

484
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:14,711
I will say.

485
00:26:24,829 --> 00:26:27,094
- You have eaten?
- I have no appetite.

486
00:26:27,813 --> 00:26:31,289
Gosh, why aren't you eating yet?

487
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:34,446
I brought leftover chicken, will I just give you that?

488
00:26:36,727 --> 00:26:37,790
That man 

489
00:26:38,657 --> 00:26:40,102
I caught him today.

490
00:26:41,445 --> 00:26:42,610
Who?

491
00:26:43,532 --> 00:26:44,860
the man you are meeting 

492
00:26:44,985 --> 00:26:46,727
the man who kissed your forehead.

493
00:26:50,399 --> 00:26:51,454
Why?

494
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,055
He's a swindler with fake license plates.

495
00:26:54,844 --> 00:26:57,360
If you want to date
people, be picky about the people.

496
00:26:57,385 --> 00:26:59,743
Why do you always date
a moron like that?

497
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:03,312
Did you know for sure?

498
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:04,828
He committed the crime 5 times.

499
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:07,040
Damn!!

500
00:27:07,485 --> 00:27:09,079
That Jerk

501
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,337
It's not that I can't understand you.

502
00:27:16,362 --> 00:27:18,063
But isn't it a bit too fast?

503
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:20,063
You just got divorced.

504
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,844
I did that because I was lonely.

505
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,212
Can't I really feel lonely?

506
00:27:28,321 --> 00:27:29,422
Indeed I...

507
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,258
have to go on living just take care of you?

508
00:27:32,307 --> 00:27:34,602
Did someone tell you to take care of me?

509
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:37,665
Therefore I beg you,

510
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,047
Brother is also looking for a companion.

511
00:27:40,532 --> 00:27:42,188
Let me also live my life.

512
00:27:42,555 --> 00:27:44,227
We both live like this,

513
00:27:45,766 --> 00:27:47,516
don't you think it's sad?

514
00:27:51,993 --> 00:27:54,039
- Uncle are you home?
- Yes.

515
00:27:54,064 --> 00:27:56,313
Jae-Woong, you still haven't slept?

516
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:01,454
Why are you drinking alcohol again?

517
00:28:01,868 --> 00:28:03,633
You also play games in the bathroom.

518
00:28:03,837 --> 00:28:07,203
Mother told me
to play only one hour a day.

519
00:28:07,532 --> 00:28:10,055
Why are you taking your anger out on him?

520
00:28:10,719 --> 00:28:13,047
Let's go out, uncle
will buy some good food.

521
00:28:14,211 --> 00:28:17,336
Jae-Woong is my son,
why did his uncle interfere?

522
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:20,313
Brother just do your job.

523
00:28:20,485 --> 00:28:23,212
Do not do anything unnecessary.

524
00:28:23,244 --> 00:28:24,281
please

525
00:28:24,306 --> 00:28:27,508
Let's get out. Today your mother
is not happy.

526
00:28:28,329 --> 00:28:31,688
When out, play the game for a while
. Mom said just one hour.

527
00:28:34,431 --> 00:28:35,611
Jae-Woong,

528
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,674
do you feel
uncomfortable living with uncle?

529
00:28:39,306 --> 00:28:41,017
I'm fine, but...

530
00:28:41,884 --> 00:28:43,174
I'm fine, but...?

531
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,790
Mother...

532
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:48,431
Tell me that mom feels sorry for uncle.

533
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,330
He says uncle will not be
able to marry because of us.

534
00:28:52,884 --> 00:28:54,033
Why is that?

535
00:28:54,767 --> 00:28:56,916
Uncle is quite famous among women.

536
00:28:57,384 --> 00:28:59,377
Not that I can't, I just don't want to.

537
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:01,119
But...

538
00:29:02,814 --> 00:29:07,127
Mom says my uncle
is getting old and ugly.

539
00:29:08,368 --> 00:29:09,524
And...

540
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:11,283
Mom too...

541
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:14,627
So?

542
00:29:15,283 --> 00:29:17,049
I didn't think of that before.

543
00:29:20,056 --> 00:29:21,822
It's because of stupid uncle.

544
00:30:03,797 --> 00:30:05,211
What's this?

545
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:07,953
132N 1193.

546
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:09,859
<i>- It's me...</i>
- Please check this car.

547
00:30:09,884 --> 00:30:11,290
<i>... There's a car in front of the warehouse.</i>

548
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:12,797
Fine I understand.

549
00:30:13,719 --> 00:30:15,484
The car was reported stolen yesterday.

550
00:30:16,446 --> 00:30:17,493
Oh Ji-Hyeok.

551
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,977
Go there and check it out.

552
00:30:20,477 --> 00:30:21,516
Okey

553
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,141
- This isn't your car?
- No.

554
00:30:24,704 --> 00:30:26,321
Oops, sorry.

555
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,266
- Good grief.
- Is this your car?

556
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:30,055
- Yes, I needed to pee.
- Move quickly.

557
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,164
Okey

558
00:30:31,743 --> 00:30:32,868
Hey Hey.

559
00:30:33,258 --> 00:30:34,446
What are you doing?

560
00:30:35,743 --> 00:30:36,821
Hey.

561
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:39,344
What are you doing?

562
00:30:45,047 --> 00:30:46,219
Run!

563
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:13,688
Do-Chang.

564
00:31:15,875 --> 00:31:17,336
Come in and check it out.

565
00:31:17,601 --> 00:31:19,210
Why? What is it?

566
00:31:19,899 --> 00:31:21,086
Why?

567
00:31:22,985 --> 00:31:25,383
I'm looking for traces of deleting machine numbers,

568
00:31:25,961 --> 00:31:27,297
but there's something strange in here.

569
00:31:29,391 --> 00:31:31,039
- It's a tracker, right?
- Yes.

570
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:32,244
Position tracker.

571
00:31:35,516 --> 00:31:37,532
Yesterday I drank too much.

572
00:31:37,696 --> 00:31:39,508
Yes Haha, damn.

573
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:41,008
No

574
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:43,633
Nothing happened, right?

575
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:45,905
Ah
subtitles provided by : Summer fouad

576
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:49,992
Just send it to another team.

577
00:31:50,758 --> 00:31:53,203
I'll tell the Team Leader over there.

578
00:31:53,742 --> 00:31:54,821
Ok

579
00:31:58,712 --> 00:32:00,212
<i>The trunk of the car opens</i>

580
00:32:25,125 --> 00:32:26,727
Damn.

581
00:32:27,992 --> 00:32:31,367
There are also some
fake account holders who agree.

582
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:33,594
The money that was confiscated was
sent by me.

583
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,633
You said you wanted to send it
by account, right?

584
00:32:35,658 --> 00:32:37,969
If it's from an account, will it be easy to find out?

585
00:32:37,994 --> 00:32:39,735
Wouldn't it be safer to use this way?

586
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,961
It must have been recorded that someone
put money in the trunk.

587
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:43,773
If it is revealed,

588
00:32:44,055 --> 00:32:46,297
it will be proof i
accept corruption...

589
00:32:49,149 --> 00:32:50,938
Oh, on purpose?

590
00:32:50,963 --> 00:32:52,844
What Team Leader Choi Young-Geun said,

591
00:32:52,899 --> 00:32:55,000
what agreement is there between us?

592
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:58,266
I moved only
because I trusted the team leader...

593
00:32:58,664 --> 00:32:59,922
I don't know the details.

594
00:33:00,172 --> 00:33:02,289
He says will be my hands and feet.

595
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,305
But now my hands
and feet are tied.

596
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,715
Then
shouldn't someone replace it

597
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:08,649
role to keep
the deal going?

598
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:12,156
I will do it.

599
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,657
Your assessment is very fast.

600
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:20,469
From now on, I will
determine how the money will be given.

601
00:33:20,494 --> 00:33:22,111
Team Leader Jang and I,

602
00:33:22,438 --> 00:33:24,586
in a way that only the
two of us know.

603
00:33:25,444 --> 00:33:26,616
Yes

604
00:33:34,407 --> 00:33:35,532
Ki Dong-Jae?

605
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:37,352
This was recorded on the day Ki Dong-Jae was released.

606
00:33:37,812 --> 00:33:39,178
Then 3 hours later,

607
00:33:39,203 --> 00:33:41,313
the same car is recorded
from the opposite direction.

608
00:33:42,524 --> 00:33:43,625
What's this?

609
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,414
You know Gu Jae-Chun, right?
Gangnam gang boss.

610
00:33:46,632 --> 00:33:47,836
That's his subordinate.

611
00:33:48,422 --> 00:33:50,180
According to the person who was caught earlier,

612
00:33:50,205 --> 00:33:51,360
he sold the car.

613
00:33:51,392 --> 00:33:53,509
So Ki Dong-Jae went
with this car,

614
00:33:53,572 --> 00:33:56,062
then Gangnam gang people brought him again?

615
00:33:56,087 --> 00:33:57,875
They killed Ki Dong-Jae
then snatched his car

616
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,405
Because it's a shame if the car is thrown away.

617
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,600
Then sold.

618
00:34:00,656 --> 00:34:03,022
So it was Gu Jae-Chun who
killed Ki Dong-Jae.

619
00:34:03,047 --> 00:34:04,871
Lucky to avenge Jo Sang-Pil.

620
00:34:05,027 --> 00:34:06,800
Obviously the reason to kill him.

621
00:34:06,825 --> 00:34:10,214
But Ki Dong-Jae had no
reason to see Gu Jae-Chun.

622
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:13,354
Someone handed Ki Dong-Jae
to Gu Jae-Chun.

623
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,738
- Who?
- In the car that Ki Dong-Jae was riding,

624
00:34:15,763 --> 00:34:17,386
there is a position tracking device.

625
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:19,331
I've checked the data.

626
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,683
Among the recorded positions,

627
00:34:20,708 --> 00:34:22,691
there is a prison where Ki Dong-Jae was released.

628
00:34:23,324 --> 00:34:25,175
After checking the nearby CCTV,

629
00:34:25,441 --> 00:34:26,574
i found this.

630
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,183
Oh.

631
00:34:28,722 --> 00:34:31,558
So Ki Dong-Jae got a car from here.

632
00:34:32,058 --> 00:34:33,519
The one who gave the car,

633
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:38,582
is Jang Ki-Jin.

634
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:44,143
Jang Ki-Jin, Chief of the Seoul Investigation Team?

635
00:34:44,308 --> 00:34:47,683
He gives this car to
Ki Dong-Jae after installing the tracking device.

636
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,816
Then he told
Gu Jae-Chun his position,

637
00:34:51,128 --> 00:34:52,707
and got Ki Dong-Jae killed.

638
00:34:52,752 --> 00:34:54,479
Even though it was Gu Jae-Chun who did it,

639
00:34:54,504 --> 00:34:56,925
but the one who actually killed
Ki Dong-Jae was Jang Ki-Jin.

640
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:07,665
Looks like you need surgery.

641
00:35:08,384 --> 00:35:12,009
You should have had surgery when
you were hospitalized before.

642
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,829
It's really getting worse.

643
00:35:16,267 --> 00:35:18,993
I can't go straight into surgery right now.

644
00:35:20,095 --> 00:35:23,306
I still have something to do.

645
00:35:27,212 --> 00:35:28,345
What is this, sir?

646
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,118
You've been working hard all this time.

647
00:35:30,143 --> 00:35:33,462
Please eat together
with your friends.

648
00:35:33,487 --> 00:35:36,329
Nope. We cannot
accept this kind of thing. And also...

649
00:35:36,642 --> 00:35:38,454
We've made you suffer so much,

650
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:40,212
how can we accept this?

651
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,876
If you don't want to accept it,
it means I still owe it.

652
00:35:43,173 --> 00:35:45,048
It means you put me in debt.

653
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:47,735
I give this to make
me feel comfortable.

654
00:35:50,197 --> 00:35:51,470
Yes thank you.

655
00:35:51,751 --> 00:35:53,453
I will use it well.

656
00:35:57,454 --> 00:36:00,626
Wait, my shoes do
n't fit you?

657
00:36:01,845 --> 00:36:03,907
Detectives rarely wear shoes like that.

658
00:36:03,932 --> 00:36:05,784
Because we had to run
to catch the culprit.

659
00:36:05,876 --> 00:36:07,493
Oh, that's right.

660
00:36:07,526 --> 00:36:09,079
I forgot that.

661
00:36:11,329 --> 00:36:14,009
But when I go anywhere
else, I definitely wear those shoes.

662
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:16,165
Because of those shoes,

663
00:36:16,439 --> 00:36:18,861
my colleagues say
I'm like the boss of the company.

664
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:21,157
Good luck.

665
00:36:25,001 --> 00:36:26,900
By the way, Detective Kang.

666
00:36:28,337 --> 00:36:30,259
The reason my grandson died,

667
00:36:30,798 --> 00:36:34,048
nothing to do
with Director Cheon, right?

668
00:36:34,073 --> 00:36:36,657
You mean Director Cheon is
Cheon Na-Na?

669
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:37,915
Yes

670
00:36:38,548 --> 00:36:41,048
Based on the results of our investigation
, there is no connection.

671
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:44,306
She even helped with our research.

672
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,814
If she wasn't there,

673
00:36:45,907 --> 00:36:48,352
we won't be able to
catch Cheon Sang-Woo.

674
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:50,845
Oh I see. Good luck.

675
00:36:51,517 --> 00:36:52,790
The main thing is,

676
00:36:53,228 --> 00:36:56,439
Cheon Sang-Woo had
people kill my grand daughter

677
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,134
And Ki Dong-Jae who
killed my grand daughter

678
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:03,236
- Keep it that way, right?
- Yes that's right.

679
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,626
- Please wait a moment.
- Yes.

680
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:10,056
Halo?

681
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:11,447
Have you caught him?

682
00:37:12,142 --> 00:37:13,853
All right, I'll be right there. Wait.

683
00:37:14,689 --> 00:37:16,829
Good grief.

684
00:37:17,517 --> 00:37:21,720
Again I keep people
busy for too long. Please go.

685
00:37:21,939 --> 00:37:23,400
Fine, then excuse me.

686
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,626
Thank you

687
00:37:35,345 --> 00:37:36,603
Sir 

688
00:37:37,243 --> 00:37:40,361
I will come to
your shop with chicken.

689
00:37:41,392 --> 00:37:45,134
I'll tell you a lot of
things while we drink.

690
00:37:46,064 --> 00:37:48,322
Thank you, thank you very much.

691
00:37:48,845 --> 00:37:50,142
Excuse me.

692
00:38:00,314 --> 00:38:01,861
Yes, I'm there.

693
00:38:14,548 --> 00:38:16,642
This car that Ki Dong-Jae brought,

694
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:19,103
you brought it back.

695
00:38:20,118 --> 00:38:22,579
<i>After that Ki Dong-Jae</i><i></i><i>disappeared without a trace.</i>

696
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:25,407
<i>You killed Ki Dong-Jae?</i>

697
00:38:25,432 --> 00:38:26,767
<i>Why are you like this?</i>

698
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:28,736
Why should I kill brother Dong-Jae?

699
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:31,251
If it wasn't you,
someone else would have killed him.

700
00:38:31,845 --> 00:38:33,400
Tell me who killed him.

701
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,579
I do not know.

702
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,009
Then why did you bring the car
that Ki Dong-Jae brought?

703
00:38:38,034 --> 00:38:39,376
It...

704
00:38:39,579 --> 00:38:41,704
 Brother Dong-Jae gave
the car to me.

705
00:38:41,729 --> 00:38:43,118
And he asked me to sell it.

706
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,586
So I sold the car.

707
00:38:45,611 --> 00:38:49,453
Hey, it said recently that you guys wanted to
capture and kill Ki Dong-Jae.

708
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:54,359
But Ki Dong-Jae asked the person
who wanted to kill him to sell the car?

709
00:38:54,486 --> 00:38:55,867
You think that makes sense?

710
00:38:57,429 --> 00:38:58,804
Jae-Chun?

711
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:01,023
Surely Jae-Chun killed Ki Dong-Jae,

712
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,687
then told you to take care of the car.

713
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,398
Because it's a shame to throw it away.

714
00:39:04,423 --> 00:39:07,648
So sold to be able to add money.

715
00:39:07,718 --> 00:39:10,999
- Right?
- I admit I sold the car.

716
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,992
But I really do
n't know anything other than that.

717
00:39:15,017 --> 00:39:16,289
Think carefully.

718
00:39:16,796 --> 00:39:20,445
If you're stubborn,
you might end up doing it all on your own.

719
00:39:20,828 --> 00:39:22,742
From now on, on
this CCTV day,

720
00:39:22,767 --> 00:39:25,343
tell me what you
did, who did you meet,

721
00:39:25,655 --> 00:39:27,343
tell me everything.

722
00:39:27,368 --> 00:39:29,538
If it doesn't match, we
'll investigate you right away.

723
00:39:31,047 --> 00:39:33,062
Has Si Dong-Jae's body been found?

724
00:39:35,351 --> 00:39:38,047
Don't you know that
he's dead or not yet?

725
00:39:39,382 --> 00:39:41,429
I'm sure that Ki Dong-Jae was murdered.

726
00:39:41,454 --> 00:39:43,304
It was obvious, seeing
him mention corpses.

727
00:39:43,329 --> 00:39:45,078
Otherwise, he wouldn't have said that.

728
00:39:45,103 --> 00:39:49,437
You know how difficult it is to
prove murder without a corpse.

729
00:39:49,507 --> 00:39:52,679
We could be tired of investigating
but ended just like that.

730
00:39:52,712 --> 00:39:54,515
But the reason for killing him is clear.

731
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,802
It doesn't make sense for us
to let go of our hands even though we know that.

732
00:39:56,981 --> 00:39:59,286
Ki Dong-Jae is a murderer.

733
00:39:59,311 --> 00:40:02,763
But Ki Dong-Jae's family,
too, deserves to know why he died,

734
00:40:02,788 --> 00:40:05,452
and how he could die.

735
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:09,255
Is not that,

736
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:13,013
we should also know the reason Jang Ki-Jin
gave Ki Dong-Jae to Gu Jae-Chun?

737
00:40:13,038 --> 00:40:14,865
Therefore before Cheon Sang-Woo's trial,

738
00:40:14,926 --> 00:40:16,918
is it possible to
protect Cheon Sang-Woo?

739
00:40:16,943 --> 00:40:18,738
That's not the whole reason
Ki Dong-Jae died.

740
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,581
By the day Woo Tae-Ho died,

741
00:40:20,606 --> 00:40:22,262
Woo Tae-Ho meets Ki Dong-Jae.

742
00:40:22,441 --> 00:40:25,308
It seemed until before that, he
assumed Cheon Sang-Woo was the culprit.

743
00:40:25,762 --> 00:40:27,347
But after meeting Ki Dong-Jae,

744
00:40:27,372 --> 00:40:29,738
whatever he thought, he
immediately met Cheon Na-Na.

745
00:40:30,237 --> 00:40:31,808
Then he called us.

746
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,370
He said he had something to say.

747
00:40:33,605 --> 00:40:34,823
Then,

748
00:40:35,738 --> 00:40:36,980
he had an accident.

749
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,941
Indeed,
what did he hear from Ki Dong-Jae,

750
00:40:40,315 --> 00:40:42,128
to suddenly do that?

751
00:40:42,153 --> 00:40:43,785
Isn't that obvious?

752
00:40:43,988 --> 00:40:46,090
What else
would Ki Dong-Jae say?

753
00:40:46,871 --> 00:40:48,551
"I never killed her."

754
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:50,504
I think so

755
00:40:51,097 --> 00:40:53,019
"I didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo."

756
00:40:53,044 --> 00:40:54,222
The culprit is someone else.

757
00:40:54,745 --> 00:40:56,721
The reason Ki Dong-Jae died was

758
00:40:56,932 --> 00:40:58,964
because he said that to Woo Tae-Ho.

759
00:41:17,425 --> 00:41:18,662
Excuse me.

760
00:41:18,816 --> 00:41:20,152
Welcome.

761
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:23,930
We're from the Incheon West Office Criminal Team .

762
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:26,937
What's the matter?

763
00:41:26,995 --> 00:41:28,847
Is it true that you are
Ki Dong-Jae's older brother?

764
00:41:29,726 --> 00:41:30,372
Right.

765
00:41:30,668 --> 00:41:32,456
Are you related
to your brother?

766
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,547
As you know,

767
00:41:33,914 --> 00:41:35,100
that person is dead.

768
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:37,267
Then when was the last time
you met?

769
00:41:38,146 --> 00:41:39,850
I have never met that idiot yet.

770
00:41:41,706 --> 00:41:43,175
The last time I saw him,

771
00:41:44,252 --> 00:41:46,590
was at my father's ancestral ceremony
about ten years ago.

772
00:41:46,978 --> 00:41:48,759
Have you ever been contacted
by telephone?

773
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:50,979
Why should I answer
a call from an assassin?

774
00:41:52,127 --> 00:41:56,033
Like you said, we thought
Ki Dong-Jae was dead too.

775
00:41:56,364 --> 00:41:59,003
But shouldn't we
find the body?

776
00:41:59,564 --> 00:42:01,872
If you have anything
to help with the investigation,

777
00:42:01,912 --> 00:42:02,971
please tell me.

778
00:42:03,245 --> 00:42:05,167
That way, we can
find the killer...

779
00:42:05,206 --> 00:42:06,854
Please don't look for the killer.

780
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,380
Don't even look for his body.

781
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,846
If you please 

782
00:42:13,979 --> 00:42:15,053
But...

783
00:42:15,675 --> 00:42:17,362
There's nothing more we can get.

784
00:42:17,526 --> 00:42:18,612
Just leave him be

785
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:26,330
I will leave
my same card here.

786
00:42:26,534 --> 00:42:28,667
Please contact me if you
remember anything.

787
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:30,134
<i>Oh Ji-Hyeok</i>

788
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,141
I'm a little confused.

789
00:42:37,979 --> 00:42:40,753
Who
are we actually doing all this for now?

790
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,614
The truth must be revealed.

791
00:42:43,969 --> 00:42:44,924
We have to reveal it.

792
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:46,033
The hidden truth.

793
00:42:46,088 --> 00:42:48,667
Hasn't the truth been revealed?
The culprit was Cheon Sang-Woo.

794
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:50,198
That person is the killer

795
00:42:50,321 --> 00:42:53,257
 Whoever killed her with his own hands
nothing has changed.

796
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:02,066
Do you think Ki Dong-Jae
is not Jung Hee-Joo's killer?

797
00:43:04,409 --> 00:43:06,120
Think carefully.

798
00:43:06,627 --> 00:43:10,377
Like you said, if Ki Dong-Jae
didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo,

799
00:43:10,471 --> 00:43:12,810
then we managed to figure it out,

800
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,526
Cheon Sang-Woo could be
said to be innocent.

801
00:43:20,362 --> 00:43:22,307
Come on let go of this,

802
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:24,304
and try this one.

803
00:43:24,989 --> 00:43:26,119
Try it, try it.

804
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:27,878
Right?

805
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,378
Yes, it's convenient.

806
00:43:31,526 --> 00:43:33,497
How do you know my son's shoe size?

807
00:43:33,636 --> 00:43:37,401
Grandpa could tell shoe size
by just looking at a person's feet.

808
00:43:37,503 --> 00:43:38,541
Oh God.

809
00:43:38,603 --> 00:43:40,377
Is it true that by just looking
at one's feet,

810
00:43:40,404 --> 00:43:42,171
You can immediately find out
the shoe size.

811
00:43:42,303 --> 00:43:45,009
Yes. Because it's my job.

812
00:43:45,042 --> 00:43:47,518
Then, sorry, but...

813
00:43:47,643 --> 00:43:51,360
Can you tell
my shoe size?

814
00:43:53,183 --> 00:43:56,474
For that, please
try these shoes.

815
00:43:57,352 --> 00:44:00,491
Oh my, how is this.
If so...

816
00:44:01,592 --> 00:44:03,404
- I will try it.
- Yes.

817
00:44:03,581 --> 00:44:05,643
Will this fit?

818
00:44:08,350 --> 00:44:09,300
Good grief.

819
00:44:09,675 --> 00:44:11,042
Good grief. This is just right!

820
00:44:11,253 --> 00:44:13,175
Gosh, this is so awesome!

821
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:15,128
It fits perfectly, Grandpa!

822
00:44:15,167 --> 00:44:17,604
I am very grateful.

823
00:44:17,714 --> 00:44:19,471
These shoes are very beautiful.

824
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,417
Jae-Woong quickly stood up,

825
00:44:22,542 --> 00:44:24,026
and say thank you to Grandpa.

826
00:44:24,425 --> 00:44:26,143
Thank you

827
00:44:26,214 --> 00:44:27,706
Oh, over and over.

828
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,034
You must listen to
your mother's words carefully.

829
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,815
If you don't listen to
your mother's words and make her sad,

830
00:44:33,057 --> 00:44:36,111
These shoes will narrow
and make your feet hurt.

831
00:44:36,427 --> 00:44:38,479
Is it true?

832
00:44:38,542 --> 00:44:40,003
These are magic shoes!

833
00:44:40,104 --> 00:44:42,869
Magic shoes for a kind child.

834
00:44:43,008 --> 00:44:46,015
Did you hear?
You should listen to mom carefully.

835
00:44:46,151 --> 00:44:49,955
Otherwise these shoes will make
your heels peel off all over.

836
00:44:50,007 --> 00:44:50,949
Do you understand?

837
00:44:52,006 --> 00:44:52,910
Yes

838
00:44:53,995 --> 00:44:56,714
Grandpa, how can I repay him.

839
00:44:56,761 --> 00:45:01,214
Oh no. Nothing
compared to what I got.

840
00:45:01,456 --> 00:45:04,128
You gave me fried chicken.

841
00:45:04,253 --> 00:45:07,300
That makes me very happy.

842
00:45:07,518 --> 00:45:10,175
The chicken is not much.

843
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,026
I have to say goodbye now.

844
00:45:13,729 --> 00:45:17,034
If later the shoes feel uncomfortable,
please contact me immediately.

845
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,950
No, how do you just walk
away?

846
00:45:19,354 --> 00:45:22,221
Eun-Hye don't let
grandpa just leave.

847
00:45:22,315 --> 00:45:23,737
- Yes.
- No need...

848
00:45:31,432 --> 00:45:34,665
Please wait a moment,
I'll make a nice snack.

849
00:45:34,749 --> 00:45:35,719
Okay.

850
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:40,524
Welcome.
For how many people?

851
00:45:40,667 --> 00:45:43,636
- There will be two more.
- Okay, please sit over there.

852
00:45:50,786 --> 00:45:52,909
Why do the detectives
want to see us again?

853
00:45:52,934 --> 00:45:54,550
It's because of Brother Dong-Jae.

854
00:45:54,823 --> 00:45:57,198
Was it because of Jung Hee-Joo's murder?

855
00:45:57,977 --> 00:45:59,370
Isn't that over?

856
00:45:59,925 --> 00:46:02,799
- He's not the killer.
- What?

857
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:05,292
While drinking he had told
me everything.

858
00:46:05,553 --> 00:46:07,287
He said that
he wasn't the killer,

859
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:09,670
and he just doing a favor for someone 

860
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:11,498
Damn

861
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,841
Was he just making excuses?

862
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:15,849
Hey, the proof is there!

863
00:46:16,279 --> 00:46:18,248
Brother gave it to me,

864
00:46:18,596 --> 00:46:21,767
and he said he would hand it over
one day so that he would be free from accusations.

865
00:46:22,055 --> 00:46:22,935
By the way,

866
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:25,763
Don't tell
the detectives about this later.

867
00:46:26,067 --> 00:46:28,439
Brother is dead,
so what's the point now?

868
00:46:28,637 --> 00:46:29,912
This only bothers us.

869
00:46:30,541 --> 00:46:32,142
Hello

870
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:33,959
- Welcome!
- Sister!

871
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:36,943
- Did you two come alone?
- No, we have an appointment here.

872
00:46:36,990 --> 00:46:38,256
- All right.
- Yes.

873
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,270
Long time no see.

874
00:46:43,709 --> 00:46:44,756
How are you guys doing?

875
00:46:45,753 --> 00:46:48,740
- You missed us, didn't you?
- Why did you guys call us again?

876
00:46:48,792 --> 00:46:51,760
We just wanted to see you friend,
haven't we seen each other for a long time?

877
00:46:51,811 --> 00:46:53,677
- Looks like you're skinny.
- Is that true?

878
00:46:53,731 --> 00:46:56,426
Hey, isn't this great?

879
00:46:56,667 --> 00:47:00,003
While drinking we can talk
about the idiot Ki Dong-Jae.

880
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:03,521
Shouldn't you be looking for
your brother?

881
00:47:03,942 --> 00:47:06,739
Determine whether it is alive
or dead.

882
00:47:07,844 --> 00:47:09,013
I just saw you.

883
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,365
I was in the packaging department.

884
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:12,857
Really? I do not know.

885
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:16,875
- Hello.
- Hello.

886
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:20,291
Excuse me.

887
00:47:21,389 --> 00:47:24,962
Is it true that Ki Dong-Jae
is not Jung Hee-Joo's killer?

888
00:47:25,162 --> 00:47:28,850
They just talk to each other,
you can't believe it.

889
00:47:29,128 --> 00:47:33,167
Still, there's some reason
for them to say that, right?

890
00:47:33,385 --> 00:47:37,417
Then we will ask
and confirm it first.

891
00:47:37,768 --> 00:47:40,144
You don't have to think about it.

892
00:47:40,344 --> 00:47:42,971
We will do
a thorough research.

893
00:47:42,996 --> 00:47:46,557
- and also check the evidence.
- I confirmed it in court too.

894
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:47,813
Nonetheless,

895
00:47:48,003 --> 00:47:50,323
that's what i heard.

896
00:47:50,348 --> 00:47:51,815
If I may be honest,

897
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:54,765
if what they say is true,
things will get more complicated.

898
00:47:54,889 --> 00:47:57,127
If something went wrong, it was likely that
Cheon Sang-Woo would also be free.

899
00:47:57,182 --> 00:47:58,354
That can't happen.

900
00:47:58,429 --> 00:48:00,627
I heard it myself

901
00:48:00,682 --> 00:48:03,354
that Cheon Sang-Woo told him
to kill my grandson.

902
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,323
That absolutely cannot happen.

903
00:48:09,137 --> 00:48:12,760
The children from the Incheon West Office
arrested one of our children.

904
00:48:13,050 --> 00:48:14,870
They are looking for Ki Dong-Jae.

905
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:17,042
His body will never be found.

906
00:48:17,167 --> 00:48:21,214
But, we will narrow down the investigation
and clear the existing accusations.

907
00:48:22,635 --> 00:48:24,385
The problem was Oh Ji-Hyeok.

908
00:48:24,410 --> 00:48:25,971
He will continue to bite until the end.

909
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,635
That's your business.

910
00:48:28,589 --> 00:48:32,296
I never told
you to kill Ki Dong-Jae.

911
00:48:33,042 --> 00:48:34,284
Right.

912
00:48:36,326 --> 00:48:39,169
But we're not the only ones who have
reasons for his murder, right?

913
00:48:39,634 --> 00:48:42,172
You guys should have
killed him too, right?

914
00:48:43,738 --> 00:48:46,844
There was a story he told me
before he died.

915
00:48:47,026 --> 00:48:49,052
<i>Brother Please help...</i>

916
00:48:49,143 --> 00:48:50,948
listen to my explanation first.

917
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:53,350
Brother , I'm hiding something.

918
00:48:53,617 --> 00:48:56,492
It could change your life.

919
00:48:57,318 --> 00:49:00,457
Look, if it's nothing,
fine, I won't kill you.

920
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:03,893
Here.

921
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:05,792
Hyungnim, Brother 

922
00:49:06,063 --> 00:49:08,211
One of TJ's Cheon family members,

923
00:49:08,385 --> 00:49:10,253
has killed someone.

924
00:49:10,721 --> 00:49:12,510
I have the proof.

925
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:15,553
Then?

926
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:18,651
Let me make
just one phone call,

927
00:49:18,721 --> 00:49:20,729
and it's with my older brother he can get it.

928
00:49:21,251 --> 00:49:23,589
Then if you threaten TJ with that,

929
00:49:23,706 --> 00:49:26,557
Brother can earn
a very large amount of money.

930
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,256
Alright, give it a try then.

931
00:49:52,343 --> 00:49:53,672
<i>Dong-Jae</i>

932
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:06,190
 Didn't pick up?

933
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:09,026
I'll try it one more time.

934
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:10,642
Stop being rude!

935
00:50:10,894 --> 00:50:15,263
You're right bastard, you dragged your brother
so you can live?

936
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,685
You're such a fool, little fool.

937
00:50:19,533 --> 00:50:21,372
Get rid of this nonsense!

938
00:50:22,667 --> 00:50:23,674
Hyungnim , Brother 

939
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:25,532
Hyungnim , Brother 

940
00:50:25,676 --> 00:50:28,301
Someone from the Cheon family
that Ki Dong-Jae spoke of,

941
00:50:28,843 --> 00:50:32,416
Didn't the tycoon order
and hand over Ki Dong-Jae to us?

942
00:50:33,717 --> 00:50:35,092
Team Leader.

943
00:50:35,252 --> 00:50:37,119
We are both on the same side.

944
00:50:41,956 --> 00:50:44,495
You're also a really
tough little brat.

945
00:50:55,936 --> 00:50:57,007
There it is.

946
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:00,370
He is Ki Dong-Su, who you say is
Ki Dong-Jae's older brother.

947
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:01,486
Okay.

948
00:51:05,446 --> 00:51:07,151
You've worked hard.

949
00:51:21,862 --> 00:51:23,968
There's evidence.

950
00:51:24,523 --> 00:51:26,570
He handed it over to his brother.

951
00:51:26,767 --> 00:51:30,040
and he said to hand him over for
a moment so that he would be freed from the accusation.

952
00:51:33,441 --> 00:51:35,779
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

953
00:51:37,437 --> 00:51:38,541
Can I help you?

954
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:43,954
Yes, I am the grandfather of a child
named Jung Hee-Joo.

955
00:51:44,854 --> 00:51:45,856
Then?

956
00:51:46,805 --> 00:51:50,461
I'm here to talk about something.

957
00:51:50,761 --> 00:51:52,529
Are you here
to apologize?

958
00:51:52,719 --> 00:51:54,586
My brother is guilty of murder.

959
00:51:55,032 --> 00:51:57,071
I'm sorry for my younger brother's  mistake.

960
00:51:57,551 --> 00:51:58,569
Is that enough?

961
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:03,741
I don't have any feelings
for your family.

962
00:52:03,805 --> 00:52:05,586
So what do you want?

963
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,801
It...

964
00:52:07,011 --> 00:52:11,854
Do you have anything
that your younger brother left with you?

965
00:52:12,861 --> 00:52:14,285
There isn't any.

966
00:52:14,365 --> 00:52:17,152
I didn't mean
to do anything with it.

967
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:20,240
I just want to know.

968
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:22,993
Who exactly killed my grand daughter ?

969
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:27,170
I need to know that because then
I close my eyes comfortably.

970
00:52:27,256 --> 00:52:28,857
Isn't the trial over?

971
00:52:30,164 --> 00:52:31,702
The police have also disclosed it.

972
00:52:32,028 --> 00:52:33,880
It's true if my brother is the idiot
who killed her

973
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:36,407
I don't know why you came
and did this to me.

974
00:52:36,443 --> 00:52:37,482
Why should I...

975
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:41,145
I don't understand why
I have to suffer again,

976
00:52:41,345 --> 00:52:43,111
because of that bastard?

977
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:46,560
Is my coming...

978
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:49,076
make you suffer?

979
00:52:49,935 --> 00:52:51,287
I've forgotten it.

980
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,425
I had forgotten the fact
that that bastard was my younger brother

981
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:57,595
However, you just...

982
00:52:58,125 --> 00:52:59,990
made me remember
the stupidity again.

983
00:53:00,045 --> 00:53:02,182
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry.

984
00:53:02,388 --> 00:53:03,943
I don't think...

985
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:06,326
I didn't think about your position.

986
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:10,170
Just because of my greed.
I have wronged you.

987
00:53:10,357 --> 00:53:12,177
I'm sorry.

988
00:53:13,908 --> 00:53:15,846
Why is Grandpa like this?

989
00:53:16,447 --> 00:53:18,341
The case regarding your grand daughter 
has been resolved, hasn't it?

990
00:53:18,846 --> 00:53:22,052
The culprit has been caught
and Dong-Jae is also dead.

991
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:25,145
Aren't you now enough
to live comfortably?

992
00:53:25,334 --> 00:53:27,438
Why are you even thinking
about other unimportant things?

993
00:53:27,607 --> 00:53:29,787
This will only annoy you.

994
00:53:30,327 --> 00:53:32,444
This is because I still have regrets
inside of me.

995
00:53:36,430 --> 00:53:40,237
"I can die peacefully
without any regrets now."

996
00:53:41,038 --> 00:53:44,265
I just wanted to die
after saying that one sentence.

997
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,746
Okay.

998
00:53:49,262 --> 00:53:53,653
So, he didn't leave
anything to you.

999
00:53:55,169 --> 00:53:56,020
Yes

1000
00:53:56,535 --> 00:53:57,855
I understand.

1001
00:53:58,599 --> 00:54:00,925
I didn't know that someone
who lost a family member,

1002
00:54:01,355 --> 00:54:03,894
or a member of the murderer's family,

1003
00:54:04,395 --> 00:54:08,910
can feel the pain together.

1004
00:54:11,532 --> 00:54:12,536
Okay.

1005
00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:16,540
I won't look for you anymore.

1006
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:44,602
Dong-Jae, he doesn't entrust
anything to me.

1007
00:54:44,701 --> 00:54:46,130
I found something,

1008
00:54:47,167 --> 00:54:49,206
which he hid while cleaning
his things.

1009
00:54:51,372 --> 00:54:54,745
If you open it, your
regrets will disappear.

1010
00:55:00,548 --> 00:55:02,386
The one who killed Grandpa's grand daughter ..

1011
00:55:03,584 --> 00:55:04,788
is Dong-Jae.

1012
00:55:06,654 --> 00:55:08,492
Now you don't have to
think about anything else.

1013
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:12,263
Be careful on the road.

1014
00:55:32,616 --> 00:55:34,348
Hee-Joo.

1015
00:55:55,436 --> 00:55:56,640
Halo.

1016
00:55:58,031 --> 00:56:00,554
Jeez, what need did you come?

1017
00:56:01,175 --> 00:56:02,947
I have something to give.

1018
00:56:05,879 --> 00:56:09,887
Wait for a while. Wait for a while.

1019
00:56:15,867 --> 00:56:18,819
This time, we plan
to create a scholarship foundation,

1020
00:56:18,867 --> 00:56:21,396
- on behalf of Jung Hee-Joo.
- Yes?

1021
00:56:22,653 --> 00:56:24,102
So what?

1022
00:56:24,193 --> 00:56:27,440
That means we sincerely apologize
for Jung Hee-Joo's death,

1023
00:56:27,746 --> 00:56:29,807
and remind us
not to forget it.

1024
00:56:30,759 --> 00:56:32,435
Is that true?

1025
00:56:32,944 --> 00:56:35,514
There will be a celebration event
for the foundation's establishment.

1026
00:56:35,646 --> 00:56:38,803
Before that, I came
to get permission from Grandpa.

1027
00:56:38,943 --> 00:56:40,638
Of course.

1028
00:56:41,649 --> 00:56:43,755
Maybe Hee-Joo will be happy too.

1029
00:56:44,051 --> 00:56:46,057
Then I assume
that you have allowed it.

1030
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,194
Yes, please.

1031
00:56:47,753 --> 00:56:49,583
I really didn't think,

1032
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:52,371
that the Director would think
of Hee-Joo like this.

1033
00:56:52,482 --> 00:56:55,615
Thank you very much.

1034
00:57:02,974 --> 00:57:04,974
goodbye 

1035
00:57:18,829 --> 00:57:20,423
Can I help you?

1036
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:22,994
What, what are you guys doing?

1037
00:57:23,133 --> 00:57:24,281
What is this?

1038
00:57:25,195 --> 00:57:27,297
What do you want to do?

1039
00:57:27,406 --> 00:57:29,797
- What is this?
- Close the door!

1040
00:57:30,203 --> 00:57:31,508
What is this?

1041
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:38,445
What do you want to do?

1042
00:57:43,945 --> 00:57:46,551
Are you Dong-Jae's brother?

1043
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:50,688
Answer!

1044
00:57:50,751 --> 00:57:51,797
What?

1045
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:54,926
Are you sure that grandpa
took it?

1046
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:57,539
I understand.

1047
00:57:57,594 --> 00:57:59,039
I'll think about it,

1048
00:57:59,927 --> 00:58:01,732
and call you in a minute.

1049
00:58:02,156 --> 00:58:03,711
This will take a lot of time.

1050
00:58:22,348 --> 00:58:23,375
Thank you

1051
00:58:26,053 --> 00:58:28,426
Have you notified
Team Leader Choi Yong-Geun?

1052
00:58:29,557 --> 00:58:30,461
About?

1053
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:32,697
The method of sending money has changed.

1054
00:58:33,127 --> 00:58:35,099
No, I haven't.

1055
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:38,469
Actually that is
not too necessary to do either.

1056
00:58:40,368 --> 00:58:42,940
What's the reason you called me
to check it out?

1057
00:58:43,871 --> 00:58:47,445
No, I just want to know.

1058
00:58:48,142 --> 00:58:51,582
It's true that Ki Dong-Jae killed
Jung Hee-Joo, right?

1059
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:53,918
Right.

1060
00:58:56,851 --> 00:58:59,690
Did you find
the clothes Jung Hee-Joo was wearing,

1061
00:58:59,742 --> 00:59:01,478
when Ki Dong-Jae killed Jung Hee-Joo?

1062
00:59:02,851 --> 00:59:03,930
No

1063
00:59:04,659 --> 00:59:07,064
But why
did Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather have it?

1064
00:59:10,735 --> 00:59:13,481
How do you know that?

1065
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:15,072
I just checked it too.

1066
00:59:15,245 --> 00:59:17,445
I have seen it
with my own eyes.

1067
00:59:17,547 --> 00:59:19,109
Today at Jung Hee-Joo's grandfather's shop.

1068
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:23,314
How did you know that it
was Jung Hee-Joo's clothes?

1069
00:59:25,946 --> 00:59:28,519
I met Jung Hee-Joo
on the day she was murdered.

1070
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,721
It was the same outfit she was wearing
back then.

1071
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:33,458
On that day you met Jung Hee-Joo?

1072
00:59:34,255 --> 00:59:36,594
Is it weird for me
to meet my employees?

1073
00:59:36,646 --> 00:59:37,881
No, it's okay.

1074
00:59:40,294 --> 00:59:42,033
But, what makes you curious?

1075
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:45,951
Honestly I'm worried.

1076
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:49,340
Perhaps because of
the late evidence,

1077
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:51,912
will change the outcome of the trial.

1078
00:59:52,373 --> 00:59:55,680
I hope it stays the way it is now.

1079
00:59:56,644 --> 00:59:59,217
The fact that the grandfather had evidence,

1080
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:01,799
meaning he hasn't
told the detectives about it.

1081
01:00:01,971 --> 01:00:05,564
I hope the evidence does
n't reach the detectives.

1082
01:00:07,054 --> 01:00:10,862
Because I don't know what
Cheon Sang-Woo will do with it.

1083
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:14,103
After all, if he is free,

1084
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:16,978
I don't know what
he will do to me.

1085
01:00:17,565 --> 01:00:19,537
Maybe he will kill me.

1086
01:00:19,765 --> 01:00:20,671
No

1087
01:00:21,322 --> 01:00:22,674
He will kill me.

1088
01:00:25,239 --> 01:00:28,780
Please get rid of that evidence.
All traces.

1089
01:00:31,212 --> 01:00:33,317
Okay. I will do it.

1090
01:00:37,850 --> 01:00:39,174
Starting today,

1091
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,993
you will be my savior.

1092
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,747
By the way

1093
01:00:51,732 --> 01:00:53,671
have you ever killed anyone?

1094
01:00:56,303 --> 01:00:56,941
what?

1095
01:00:57,012 --> 01:00:59,442
Detectives have
killed people too, haven't they?

1096
01:01:00,544 --> 01:01:02,426
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

1097
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:05,917
No matter how easily
a detective kills,

1098
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:08,464
killing someone
is not an easy thing.

1099
01:01:09,049 --> 01:01:10,288
I never did.

1100
01:01:11,285 --> 01:01:12,190
For now.

1101
01:01:25,928 --> 01:01:28,506
Are you saying that you
and I are on the same side?

1102
01:01:28,611 --> 01:01:30,182
<i>Yes, that's what I said.</i>

1103
01:01:30,292 --> 01:01:32,408
<i>I mean, let's help each other.</i>

1104
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:34,341
<i>Because we're on the same ship.</i>

1105
01:01:37,061 --> 01:01:39,050
That's from your point of view.

1106
01:01:39,517 --> 01:01:41,994
From my point of view,
I brought you guys.

1107
01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:44,268
On the ship I ride.
Do you understand?

1108
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,652
<i> Yes. That's right.</i>

1109
01:01:47,555 --> 01:01:48,760
<i> The Team Leader is correct.</i>

1110
01:01:51,192 --> 01:01:53,397
Then do as I say.

1111
01:02:52,453 --> 01:02:53,841
<i>Eun-Hye</i>

1112
01:02:57,825 --> 01:03:00,565
There is no evidence that Ki Dong-Jae
was not the culprit.

1113
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:04,015
However, there is also no evidence
that Ki Dong-Jae is the killer.

1114
01:03:05,232 --> 01:03:08,272
This is taken from the direction of the murder scene.

1115
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,377
No Jung Hee-joo.

1116
01:03:10,738 --> 01:03:12,743
He says he brought
Jung Hee-Joo who has been killed.

1117
01:03:12,962 --> 01:03:14,296
I mean, you don't kill,

1118
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:16,202
Jeong Hee-Joo in a neglected place.

1119
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:18,460
If you see this,

1120
01:03:18,811 --> 01:03:23,124
Choi Yong-Geun asks Ki Dong-Jae
where is he and Jung Hee-Joo's corpse?

1121
01:03:23,617 --> 01:03:26,190
He asked for sure because he already knew
Jung Hee-Joo's death, right?

1122
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,427
He doesn't even ask
how Jung Hee-Joo died.

1123
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:31,866
Judging by just looking at
these recordings,

1124

By disguising a slain corpse
as a serial killer victim,

1125

it looks like Ki Dong-Jae is only in charge
of leaving the corpse.

1126
01:03:37,975 --> 01:03:41,186
So someone else
killed Jung Hee-Joo,

1127
01:03:41,602 --> 01:03:46,043
and there is a possibility that Ki Dong-Jae
was only used as a scapegoat.

1128

Right.

My goodness.

1144
01:07:22,942 --> 01:07:24,240
Truly!

1145
