8
00:00:24,095 --> 00:00:25,235
This was our case.

9
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:27,344
Are we a joke?

10
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:29,463
Do we look like losers to you?

11
00:00:29,488 --> 00:00:31,481
You punk!

12
00:00:31,752 --> 00:00:33,154
Why did you let him go?

13
00:00:33,185 --> 00:00:34,517
He is a killer.

14
00:00:34,542 --> 00:00:35,258
Why?

15
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:36,503
You want me to be rude?

16
00:00:36,528 --> 00:00:37,349
You punk!

17
00:00:37,603 --> 00:00:38,570
Are you crazy?

18
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:40,187
You know where this is?

19
00:00:40,212 --> 00:00:40,753
Let me go!

20
00:00:42,706 --> 00:00:43,770
This is our base!

21
00:00:46,323 --> 00:00:47,294
Shut up!

22
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:49,619
If you continue like this...

23
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,238
Come here!

24
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:53,830
- Shut up.
- Let me go!

25
00:00:55,698 --> 00:00:56,298
Shit!

26
00:00:57,617 --> 00:00:58,544
- Let go!
- Shut up!

27
00:00:58,569 --> 00:00:59,319
Let me go!

28
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:01,360
Please stop!

29
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:06,534
What are you waiting for? Handcuff them all!

30
00:01:06,559 --> 00:01:07,822
Hey, you!

31
00:01:08,474 --> 00:01:10,559
Why should we be in handcuffs..

32
00:01:10,588 --> 00:01:12,411
Then go straight to jail.

33
00:01:13,273 --> 00:01:13,942
Shit!

34
00:01:14,551 --> 00:01:16,553
Why are they acting like madmen?

35
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,245
Hey!

36
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,699
If that's how you want to live,

37
00:01:21,163 --> 00:01:22,545
you should be a goon.

38
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,001
Why did you become a cop?

39
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:25,521
If you set him free,

40
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:27,655
all the victims,

41
00:01:27,699 --> 00:01:28,813
and families of the victims,

42
00:01:28,903 --> 00:01:30,065
will feell like being killed for a second time.

43
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:31,400
First by Ki Dong-Jae,

44
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,233
and then,

45
00:01:32,537 --> 00:01:33,524
by a thug cop like you.

46
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:36,149
Killed by a loser cop like you!

47
00:01:36,663 --> 00:01:37,132
You know that?

48
00:01:41,861 --> 00:01:42,945
You killed him too, didn't you?

49
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:47,469
Lee Dae-Cheol was accused of murder
then sentenced to death.

50
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,115
Kim Hyeong-Bok was also made a murderer
then killed.

51
00:01:52,527 --> 00:01:54,153
If the investigation was carried out
correctly,

52
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,150
they wouldnt have died.

53
00:01:57,677 --> 00:01:59,996
You brag about catching the real culprit,

54
00:02:00,147 --> 00:02:02,245
and made the son-in-law of the rich family 
die because of you.

55
00:02:02,795 --> 00:02:03,552
Victim...

56
00:02:04,368 --> 00:02:06,702
I'm trying to catch the culprit
for the victim's family.

57
00:02:06,727 --> 00:02:07,835
But you...

58
00:02:09,449 --> 00:02:11,973
You're victimizing other families.

59
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,643
Police like you.

60
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:16,991
Shit.

61
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:30,259
Haven't I said clearly?

62
00:02:30,723 --> 00:02:31,958
don't visit me again.

63
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,089
You and Jung Hee-Joo,

64
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:36,622
and deputy chief Cheon Sang-Woo,

65
00:02:36,647 --> 00:02:38,058
we found out the connection.

66
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,867
We already know everything,

67
00:02:42,311 --> 00:02:45,766
from the recording of you and woo tae ho's conversation.

68
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:49,797
We know,

69
00:02:50,559 --> 00:02:52,043
the promise made by Woo Tae-Ho.

70
00:02:52,356 --> 00:02:52,873
That promise,

71
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:55,989
let the police take care of it.

72
00:02:56,473 --> 00:02:58,450
There is a police force in America.

73
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:00,355
Your daughter, Su-Yeon,

74
00:03:01,033 --> 00:03:03,113
we can find her and
bring her back.

75
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,019
Then,

76
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,242
what do you want from me?

77
00:03:08,511 --> 00:03:09,697
The story you told to Woo Tae-Ho,

78
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:11,650
please testify that in court.

79
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:13,257
No.

80
00:03:14,756 --> 00:03:16,470
You won't be able
bring Su-Yeon back.

81
00:03:17,818 --> 00:03:19,493
I said this
because you don't know,

82
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:20,445
what a guy like Cheon Sang-Woo is capable of.

83
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:22,844
Then why did you tell it
to Woo Tae-Ho?

84
00:03:23,577 --> 00:03:24,382
Because he had,

85
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,503
the ability to
bring back Su-Yeon.

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,396
for me.

87
00:03:32,946 --> 00:03:35,119
Jung Hee-Joo went through that
while looking for your child.

88
00:03:35,533 --> 00:03:37,125
Don't you feel guilty?

89
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,737
Why are you only thinking about
yourself?

90
00:03:40,725 --> 00:03:41,608
I...

91
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,377
Feel guilty.

92
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:48,186
But, aren't you too,

93
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,540
only thinking about yourself?

94
00:03:51,766 --> 00:03:54,315
You think you just need to catch
the killer, right?

95
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,587
You don't care what happens
to other people,

96
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:59,688
you just think of
catching the killer.

97
00:04:01,207 --> 00:04:01,896
I..

98
00:04:03,043 --> 00:04:04,479
am thinking about going to America.

99
00:04:05,847 --> 00:04:07,322
Even though I can't find her,

100
00:04:08,303 --> 00:04:09,807
I still want to see her from afar.

101
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:11,554
But...

102
00:04:13,746 --> 00:04:15,284
now everything is useless.

103
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,243
Because that person...

104
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:19,336
Will...

105
00:04:21,662 --> 00:04:23,551
hide Su-Yeon somewhere else.

106
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,925
Sis Eun-Hye.

107
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,278
There's something I want to ask.

108
00:04:42,403 --> 00:04:43,174
What?

109
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,321
 it's hard?

110
00:04:44,556 --> 00:04:46,431
No, that's not it.

111
00:04:48,427 --> 00:04:49,911
Can I,

112
00:04:52,342 --> 00:04:54,426
show dad
that I got a perfect score?

113
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:56,841
Of course, dad would be happy.

114
00:04:58,815 --> 00:04:59,581
No.

115
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,290
Looks like mom will be angry.

116
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:03,351
Why do she have to be angry?

117
00:05:04,203 --> 00:05:05,003
It is not like that.

118
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:07,188
Mom just doesn't like it when
I meet dad.

119
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:08,585
Because...

120
00:05:10,412 --> 00:05:12,590
I am the child only for my mother.

121
00:05:14,016 --> 00:05:15,832
Mom always says it,

122
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:18,176
that she lived because of me.

123
00:05:18,466 --> 00:05:19,716
Of course like that.

124
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,928
Because for your mother there is only you.

125
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,467
Then do I have to live
for my mom too?

126
00:05:25,054 --> 00:05:26,699
So that mom won't be angry.

127
00:05:27,044 --> 00:05:29,089
do i have to always
get a perfect score?

128
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:32,872
I also want to play <i>games</i>,

129
00:05:32,956 --> 00:05:34,791
play with friends,

130
00:05:36,362 --> 00:05:38,808
and also want to meet dad.

131
00:05:39,741 --> 00:05:40,419
That...

132
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:43,905
You're home?

133
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,818
Yes

134
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,422
Geez, Jae-Woong.

135
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:49,711
Are you studying again?

136
00:05:49,736 --> 00:05:50,635
You are.

137
00:05:51,446 --> 00:05:54,848
You are always doing good things.

138
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:57,785
I live only for you.

139
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,629
What is it?

140
00:06:05,057 --> 00:06:06,434
You don't like being kissed by me?

141
00:06:07,736 --> 00:06:09,230
You can't be like that.

142
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:09,898
Because of you...

143
00:06:09,923 --> 00:06:10,456
Uncle.

144
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:13,140
There are a few things I want to ask.

145
00:06:13,463 --> 00:06:15,244
If you're tired,
I'll ask tomorrow.

146
00:06:15,309 --> 00:06:16,503
It's okay, just say it.

147
00:06:17,047 --> 00:06:19,312
Even today, Grandpa didn't come to the shop.

148
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,658
He doesn't seem to be eating well either.

149
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,059
It seemed he was hurt deeply.

150
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,118
Why he have to meet Cheon Sang-Woo,

151
00:06:26,143 --> 00:06:27,949
and treated like that?

152
00:06:28,172 --> 00:06:30,188
Have you found
Hee-Joo's killer?

153
00:06:30,854 --> 00:06:34,135
I think grandpa's condition will be stable
if the culprit is caught.

154
00:06:34,446 --> 00:06:35,598
That...

155
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,868
Catching him is not easy.

156
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,935
Grandpa really believes in you.

157
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:43,063
I also believe in you that you can
catch the culprit.

158
00:06:44,901 --> 00:06:45,887
Eun Hye.

159
00:06:47,176 --> 00:06:49,164
I'm not a great detective.

160
00:06:49,834 --> 00:06:51,538
You even managed to close
my father's case.

161
00:06:51,718 --> 00:06:55,218
Thanks to you, my father was able to leave
more peacefully.

162
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,748
- Therefore, even grandfather...
- Eun-Hye.

163
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:03,948
I couldn't save your father.

164
00:07:04,978 --> 00:07:07,297
What's the point of leaving in peace?

165
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,473
- I can't investigate well..
- If you keep thinking like that,

166
00:07:11,498 --> 00:07:13,629
you really made daddy
died a murderer.

167
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,560
Why did you let
innocent people die?

168
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:20,294
Why do you make my heart tight
every time I think about my dad?

169
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,260
I don't hate you, Uncle.

170
00:07:24,191 --> 00:07:27,355
I just don't like
when you always blame yourself,

171
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,507
while trying to do
better for people.

172
00:07:33,668 --> 00:07:35,150
Tell the truth.

173
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,326
Did Tae-Ho really do
suicide?

174
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,447
Why did you suddenly
announced divorce?

175
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,651
and hurt him ?

176
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:49,406
The story is just made up of by people.

177
00:07:49,431 --> 00:07:50,598
It was just an accident.

178
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,129
Of course.

179
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,735
He's not a person who will crash on purpose.

180
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,544
He's a very calm person,

181
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,920
and not a person who likes to cause trouble.

182
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,161
Anyway I am
very grateful to him.

183
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,907
He left with all the burdens.

184
00:08:09,247 --> 00:08:12,106
You don't have to worry either
about divorce.

185
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:13,840
You talk so much nonsense.

186
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:16,261
What?

187
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,892
Your sister became a widow.

188
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:20,461
Why are you not thinking
in that way?

189
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:26,484
You also never
thought of Woo Tae-Ho as your husband.

190
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:34,545
I thought people change after they become fathers.

191
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:36,123
But apparently they are still the same.

192
00:08:41,748 --> 00:08:43,896
What do you mean?

193
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,764
He was someone
who always took care of you.

194
00:08:48,618 --> 00:08:49,536
It means,

195
00:08:49,931 --> 00:08:53,701
there is no one now who will take care of you.

196
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,688
According to me,

197
00:08:57,118 --> 00:08:59,764
- you misunderstood.
- Thank you for the food.

198
00:09:01,185 --> 00:09:03,016
I will be going first, my appetite is gone.

199
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:18,394
<i>Why are you so obsessed
with this case?

200
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:23,311
<i>Looks like you're going to kill yourself
if you can't catch the culprit.

201
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,375
<i>You're just thinking about
just catching the culprit, right?

202
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:28,817
<i>You don't care what happens
to other people,

203
00:09:29,768 --> 00:09:32,043
<i>you're just thinking
to catch the culprit, right?

204
00:09:38,493 --> 00:09:39,230
What do you need?

205
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:40,956
Nothing.

206
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:54,153
Do you think
you are a good person?

207
00:09:55,662 --> 00:09:57,009
Do not dream.

208
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:59,656
You can't be a good person.

209
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:02,551
Detectives can't.

210
00:10:14,938 --> 00:10:16,124
It seems like...

211
00:10:16,827 --> 00:10:19,147
Na-Na knows my weakness.

212
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:21,145
You mean?

213
00:10:24,733 --> 00:10:27,794
I thought people change after they become fathers.

214
00:10:28,568 --> 00:10:29,451
But apparently it's still the same.

215
00:10:34,491 --> 00:10:36,795
Things that can't be
known to her.

216
00:10:38,196 --> 00:10:39,861
But it turns out she already knows.

217
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,966
<i> I'm sorry, sir.

218
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,255
Team leader Woo Tae-Ho asked me
to send it,

219
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,711
only to Director Cheon Na-Na..

220
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:53,333
Is this a serious thing?

221
00:10:53,358 --> 00:10:55,741
Is this something
what the police can't know?

222
00:10:55,766 --> 00:10:57,609
Not that big of a deal,

223
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,237
it just worries me.

224
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:04,401
Alright, I'll try
to control it.

225
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:05,289
Control?

226
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:07,961
You mean...

227
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:09,948
You, will be,

228
00:11:10,758 --> 00:11:14,313
able to control Na-Na?

229
00:11:17,025 --> 00:11:19,149
Of course not, how can I...

230
00:11:19,719 --> 00:11:20,715
What I mean is,

231
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:23,850
I will try to keep an eye
so you don't get into any trouble

232
00:11:24,202 --> 00:11:26,052
from inside and outside.

233
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:33,827
Have you checked the USB,

234
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,334
left by
Team Leader Woo Tae-Ho?

235
00:11:35,926 --> 00:11:36,727
Yes.

236
00:11:37,498 --> 00:11:39,109
Was there any secrets?

237
00:11:40,295 --> 00:11:42,682
Most of the secrets were
about my family.

238
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,153
There are some things I didn't know either,

239
00:11:45,178 --> 00:11:47,023
I think it will help a lot.

240
00:11:47,569 --> 00:11:48,202
Okay.

241
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:50,873
Apart from that, is there anything else?

242
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:52,821
There is nothing that you need to worry about.

243
00:11:52,846 --> 00:11:54,101
You don't have to worry.

244
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,663
Okay.

245
00:11:58,767 --> 00:12:01,052
There's something I want to ask.

246
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:05,487
Why was it revealed that
Woo Tae-Ho committed suicide?

247
00:12:06,492 --> 00:12:10,063
Isn't that something that can 
hurt the Director and you?

248
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,868
Jung Hee-Joo's case too
should be buried immediately.

249
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:14,858
Regardless of my opinion,

250
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:17,706
looks like it's not something that
you can decide for yourself.

251
00:12:20,581 --> 00:12:23,003
Do you think I'm afraid of you?

252
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,624
Forgive me.

253
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:30,707
Because it's related to the police,

254
00:12:30,736 --> 00:12:33,495
so i thought i can
solve it myself.

255
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:36,483
Sorry if you are offended.

256
00:12:39,292 --> 00:12:42,922
The plan is just postponed
because he had an accident.

257
00:12:43,436 --> 00:12:46,717
You will get what you want
without a hitch.

258
00:12:47,924 --> 00:12:49,550
All right, I understand.

259
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,848
<i>Choi Yong-Geun, Legal Team Leader</i>

260
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:57,749
<i>Will TJ's owner change?
It will be decided at the shareholders' meeting.</i>

261
00:13:18,765 --> 00:13:22,402
This chicken restaurant was going to be famous.

262
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,141
There were many guests coming.

263
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,039
There were lot of orders through phone too.

264
00:13:26,127 --> 00:13:28,393
When the culprit fled before my eyes,

265
00:13:28,418 --> 00:13:30,194
another order came over the phone.

266
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:31,852
Never had a taste like this.

267
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,621
was this a rib or a whole chicken?

268
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:35,510
That's right, this was a whole chicken.

269
00:13:35,974 --> 00:13:38,279
I didn't even know why I
was selling chickens,

270
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,445
It was going smoothly.

271
00:13:40,503 --> 00:13:42,911
The culprit was running away in front of my eyes..

272
00:13:43,418 --> 00:13:44,895
No, though...

273
00:13:45,196 --> 00:13:47,794
The detective must catch the criminal,
why sell chicken?

274
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:51,706
Hello, Grandpa.

275
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:52,839
Eun Hye.

276
00:13:53,342 --> 00:13:54,460
You've come,

277
00:13:55,339 --> 00:13:58,217
try to listen to
Detective Kang's story.

278
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:01,209
This is Detective Kang's story
while being undercover.

279
00:14:01,454 --> 00:14:02,841
The story is very fun.

280
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:05,799
Have you experienced it firsthand?

281
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:09,575
Did you finally
catch the culprit?

282
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:12,049
Of course I did
and managed to catch him.

283
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:14,334
But suddenly I said like this.

284
00:14:14,372 --> 00:14:15,563
"Haven't you eaten yet?"

285
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:17,314
Then the culprit said,

286
00:14:17,779 --> 00:14:18,907
"I've eaten a lot."

287
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:20,894
He spoke with an accent.

288
00:14:22,997 --> 00:14:23,910
"I Have eaten a lot."

289
00:14:28,227 --> 00:14:29,233
Was it boring?

290
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,867
It was so much fun.

291
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:35,659
At least.

292
00:14:37,169 --> 00:14:38,306
"I Have eaten a lot."

293
00:14:40,015 --> 00:14:41,890
If you had to imitate,
just copy one.

294
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:45,371
If you put it all here and there,
the story is so inconsistent, right?

295
00:14:45,857 --> 00:14:47,898
It's because I never
watched a movie to the end.

296
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:51,106
It's just a little story.

297
00:14:54,485 --> 00:14:56,111
Grandpa, why are you outside?

298
00:14:56,348 --> 00:14:58,916
Get in immediately so you don't catch a cold.

299
00:14:59,432 --> 00:14:59,891
Go home.

300
00:15:00,287 --> 00:15:01,097
Let's go.

301
00:15:01,587 --> 00:15:03,911
Looks like he will only go in
after we leave.

302
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:04,391
Okay.

303
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:10,312
Haven't I told you?

304
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:12,619
Don't try too much
to be a good person.

305
00:15:13,005 --> 00:15:14,124
What do you mean?

306
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,359
I'm a bad detective.

307
00:15:15,842 --> 00:15:17,820
I even got a shoe bribed,

308
00:15:18,412 --> 00:15:20,623
from the victim's family.

309
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:25,344
Mine is more expensive
than you received, Eun-Hye.

310
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,492
Not all large sizes are expensive.

311
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:29,632
Should we ask him
which one is more expensive?

312
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,550
Isn't it obvious?

313
00:15:33,934 --> 00:15:35,028
Mine is good too.

314
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:38,176
But looks like old stuff.

315
00:15:39,453 --> 00:15:40,518
Not really.

316
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:41,900
It's very convenient.

317
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,601
You were following me, right?

318
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:55,554
You know whose house this is?
And you're still following me?

319
00:16:56,195 --> 00:16:58,325
This is the police chief's house, you idiot.

320
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,373
This is the head of the incheon office's house!

321
00:17:03,404 --> 00:17:04,920
You picked the wrong person, you know?

322
00:17:06,045 --> 00:17:07,310
Stupid loser.

323
00:17:09,748 --> 00:17:12,263
Looks like those in West Incheon
will not give up easily.

324
00:17:12,955 --> 00:17:15,221
To be honest, individually each of
them are nothing,

325
00:17:15,658 --> 00:17:18,987
but sometimes they come together
for your life.

326
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:24,908
First, we have to choose
and destroy one by one.

327
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:28,852
I'm also thinking of
hitting their boss.

328
00:17:29,711 --> 00:17:30,258
Superior?

329
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:31,133
Yes.

330
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:35,132
Coincidentally, their head of office's daughter
is one of our employees.

331
00:17:35,336 --> 00:17:36,961
When it comes to his daughter,

332
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,211
wouldn't the head of office also be
on our side?

333
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:43,413
I don't want to disturb a 
detective's family.

334
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:45,944
Because it's a very sensitive thing.

335
00:17:46,257 --> 00:17:47,382
Wouldn't that be dangerous?

336
00:17:47,585 --> 00:17:49,163
No need to worry.

337
00:17:49,444 --> 00:17:51,241
I already have the safety device.

338
00:17:51,741 --> 00:17:55,069
I've checked all accounts
on behalf of Choi Yong-Geun.

339
00:17:55,209 --> 00:17:58,101
I've searched all over
list of his recent phone calls,

340
00:17:58,646 --> 00:18:01,333
but there are no related traces
with Ki Dong-Jae .

341
00:18:01,677 --> 00:18:06,021
I've checked all CCTV
in a place he frequently visits.

342
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,177
but he is never seen
with Ki Dong-Jae.

343
00:18:08,457 --> 00:18:09,675
Of course.

344
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,957
It's been more than 20 years
he lives as a detective

345
00:18:12,316 --> 00:18:14,128
I'm sure he deleted it all 
first.

346
00:18:14,191 --> 00:18:15,269
One thing is confirmed.

347
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:19,862
There is an apartment with his real name,
not where he is now.

348
00:18:20,389 --> 00:18:23,066
We have confirmed that
Jang Ki-Jin lives there.

349
00:18:23,265 --> 00:18:25,180
They definitely work together.

350
00:18:25,272 --> 00:18:29,122
Serial murder case photos
which Choi Yong-Geun sent to Ki Dong-Jae,

351
00:18:29,158 --> 00:18:31,352
was also sent to choi yong geun by Jang ki jin.

352
00:18:31,377 --> 00:18:35,802
In return, Choi Yong-Geun
gave the apartment to Ki-Jin.

353
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:38,990
I came to understand why Jang Ki-Jin
is trying to set Ki Dong-Jae free.

354
00:18:39,724 --> 00:18:41,505
It was because of Choi Yong-Geun's orders.

355
00:18:42,099 --> 00:18:43,568
If I catch Choi Yong-Geun,

356
00:18:43,629 --> 00:18:45,719
and confront him,
won't something happen?

357
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:47,161
Don't you need
something more certain,

358
00:18:47,194 --> 00:18:49,981
to face those two?

359
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:53,052
Will they surrender
only with photos sent by post?

360
00:18:53,077 --> 00:18:56,817
Jang Ki-Jin needs to find something
before he let go of Ki Dong-Jae.

361
00:18:57,068 --> 00:19:01,568
If only one is missing,
everything just goes to waste.

362
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:02,818
As the team leader said,

363
00:19:02,843 --> 00:19:05,600
there seems to be nothing to hope
from Choi Yong-Geun.

364
00:19:06,662 --> 00:19:08,584
Doesn't that mean there's still something left near Ki Dong-Jae?

365
00:19:08,609 --> 00:19:12,291
That's right, it looks like Ki Dong-Jae is
holding something.

366
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:15,228
Something that can make things turn around.

367
00:19:15,478 --> 00:19:18,588
Haven't you searched all of
Ki Dong-Jae's hideouts?

368
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,373
Nothing appeared on the computer,

369
00:19:21,398 --> 00:19:22,764
except the photo of the murder scene
which is deleted.

370
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:25,311
Good grief..

371
00:19:25,499 --> 00:19:28,967
I don't know if this
will help or not.

372
00:19:29,069 --> 00:19:31,444
On the day I got hit
by Ki Dong-Jae...

373
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:50,661
So you saw what he handed over?

374
00:19:50,694 --> 00:19:51,807
That...

375
00:19:52,307 --> 00:19:54,416
I don't think it's too small.

376
00:19:55,338 --> 00:19:56,401
Is...

377
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:58,135
a cell phone?

378
00:19:58,165 --> 00:20:00,501
Yes, it looks like a cell phone.

379
00:20:00,526 --> 00:20:03,059
Ki Dong-Jae found out
he was being followed by detectives.

380
00:20:03,293 --> 00:20:04,746
He handed over his cell phone
to his subordinates

381
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,387
just in case detectives catch him.

382
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:08,465
There must be something on that phone.

383
00:20:08,637 --> 00:20:11,496
Just in case he's the only one
accused of murder.

384
00:20:11,521 --> 00:20:13,092
Did you see the faces of his subordinates?

385
00:20:13,136 --> 00:20:14,182
If I see them
I definitely will recognize him right away.

386
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,244
Come on, catch him.

387
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,448
If we catch him,
the phone will appear.

388
00:20:17,618 --> 00:20:20,055
We'll do it.

389
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,136
Please trust us.

390
00:20:21,161 --> 00:20:22,761
We have to do it.

391
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:25,823
We can catch Ki Dong-Jae again
if you find that phone.

392
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,850
We'll do it.

393
00:20:30,131 --> 00:20:30,912
We...

394
00:20:31,709 --> 00:20:33,444
Will find that phone
no matter how.

395
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,162
Byun Ji-Woong and Ji Man-Goo
we will do it.

396
00:20:37,834 --> 00:20:39,615
No one can interfere in
our investigation. Understand?

397
00:20:39,709 --> 00:20:40,600
Understand.

398
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:42,522
We've done it before, right?

399
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:44,330
We have to turn things around
with our own hands.

400
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:45,549
Of course.

401
00:20:45,627 --> 00:20:47,783
We are the strongest comrades
in the universe.

402
00:20:48,627 --> 00:20:50,377
Because you keep saying that,

403
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:53,720
isn't it Superman and Batman
the strongest in the universe?

404
00:20:55,248 --> 00:20:57,295
Yes that's right.

405
00:20:57,655 --> 00:20:59,280
They are elsewhere.

406
00:20:59,561 --> 00:21:01,530
No one else but you, are
greatest comrades in the universe now

407
00:21:05,795 --> 00:21:07,545
Batman and Robin.

408
00:21:15,659 --> 00:21:18,506
Hey! Why did you come here?

409
00:21:24,318 --> 00:21:25,352
Hey, Man-Goo.

410
00:21:33,927 --> 00:21:34,947
Long time no see.

411
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:36,922
We want to ask you something.

412
00:21:38,884 --> 00:21:41,657
Hey, the day when Ki Dong-Jae
made me like this,

413
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,134
That day you received something
from him, right? Now where is that thing?

414
00:21:45,229 --> 00:21:46,835
What are you talking about?

415
00:21:48,742 --> 00:21:50,900
Look at the wound, you bastard!
Hey, look at my head!

416
00:21:54,004 --> 00:21:56,004
You know why we 
got this wound?

417
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,425
Hey, I am asking again.

418
00:21:59,386 --> 00:22:01,460
The thing you got from Ki Dong-Jae,

419
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:05,105
on the day he hit me
so like this. Where is that thing?

420
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:12,100
We have to take painkillers full dose in the hospital.

421
00:22:12,723 --> 00:22:15,383
We almost went crazy because of the medicine.

422
00:22:15,939 --> 00:22:18,423
I will ask again
while I'm sane.

423
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:22,170
Items that Ki Dong-Jae gave to you,

424
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,041
Where is it now?

425
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,610
I asked where, you bastard!
Where's that stuff?

426
00:22:42,928 --> 00:22:44,521
Yes, I'm now entering the cafe.

427
00:22:44,932 --> 00:22:45,958
What should I do?

428
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,619
Yes, Team Leader?

429
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,688
I just dropped by
to Lawyer Choi .'s office

430
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,120
and now stopping by the cafe
for a cup of coffee.

431
00:23:10,588 --> 00:23:13,204
I'll be back in the office in a moment.
What's the matter, Chief?

432
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:16,022
Ah, I missed some paperwork.

433
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,614
I'll send it via <i>e-mail</i>.

434
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:21,537
Print the document and show it
to Lawyer Choi.

435
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,139
Don't let Lawyer Choi save it
in the form of <i>e-mail</i> or computer files.

436
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:27,206
You understand, right?

437
00:23:27,508 --> 00:23:29,013
In that case, I'll send it first.

438
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:35,119
Yes, I have received it.

439
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,404
This is very important. If
it falls into the hands of the opponent

440
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,708
we can lose the lawsuit.

441
00:23:43,656 --> 00:23:49,242
You can be hacked, so after you print
delete the document immediately.

442
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:50,603
<i>Do you understand?</i>

443
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,008
<i>This is a billion dollar lawsuit.</i>

444
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,186
<i>Remember that.</i>

445
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,809
Fine, I understand.

446
00:23:56,475 --> 00:23:57,511
Okay.

447
00:24:05,789 --> 00:24:06,822
<i>Yes, Team Leader?</i>

448
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,903
<i>What about Oh Ji-Hyeok?</i>

449
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:12,050
The data obtained has been submitted
to the hearing officer's office.

450
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:13,658
<i>He's being summoned now
and processed.</i>

451
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:18,025
Then, get one by one of them
down like this.

452
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:31,419
My laptop?

453
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:43,729
<i>One and two, one and two. House bell.</i>

454
00:24:44,251 --> 00:24:45,671
<i>No answer.</i>

455
00:24:51,717 --> 00:24:52,520
<i>Yes?</i>

456
00:24:52,688 --> 00:24:53,728
There is progress?

457
00:24:53,892 --> 00:24:57,975
We urged his subordinate,
so he told us.

458
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,932
He got it that day and
gave it to Ki Dong-Jae's girlfriend.

459
00:25:01,235 --> 00:25:02,847
Have you met his girlfriend?

460
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:06,438
We are now in front of her house,
but she's not here.

461
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:09,105
I will stay here
until she comes.

462
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:11,144
Call us whenever you need help.

463
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,880
I'll be on standby with Dong-Wook.

464
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:14,707
Make sure to eat regularly.

465
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:16,749
Good work.

466
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:20,056
Bo-Kyung.

467
00:25:20,956 --> 00:25:21,990
Excuse me.

468
00:25:22,425 --> 00:25:24,792
Detective Oh is in the main office.

469
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:27,738
- I...
- can you try calling him?

470
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:28,798
- Oh, yes.
- Hey, forget it.

471
00:25:28,823 --> 00:25:30,492
He must be talking about something important,

472
00:25:30,517 --> 00:25:33,517
with the main office person. You think
that selfish person will pick up the phone?

473
00:25:33,964 --> 00:25:35,957
Basically, all humans are like that.

474
00:25:36,041 --> 00:25:39,401
If he needs anything,
he will do.

475
00:25:39,426 --> 00:25:41,094
So now it's all out?

476
00:25:41,119 --> 00:25:42,537
Immediately deleted.

477
00:25:42,752 --> 00:25:45,818
Then what should i do?
This is very urgent.

478
00:25:45,947 --> 00:25:47,027
What is it? What is the problem?

479
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,970
I have to find my laptop.

480
00:25:49,117 --> 00:25:53,054
Otherwise, I will be in trouble. My life is on line.

481
00:26:08,697 --> 00:26:09,777
What should I do?

482
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,267
We have to catch that person
and find my laptop.

483
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,575
We have to find him today.
I'm in big trouble.

484
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,633
We'll find him.

485
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:19,801
You just drink coffee
by the window over there.

486
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,221
By the sun goes down,
you will get a call from me.

487
00:26:25,449 --> 00:26:27,676
I will catch him
and find your laptop.

488
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:28,929
Really?

489
00:26:30,499 --> 00:26:31,526
Let's start moving.

490
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:33,681

she's Office Head Sang-Beom's daughter.

Why didn't you tell me first?
This is very dangerous.

So, what are you going to do?

It's not that I don't want to do it
even though it was at this point.

I mean, there has to be an extra fee
because it is very dangerous.

I'll send the money now,
so send the laptop now.

Ah no. Just throw it somewhere
so that no one finds it.

When will you become human?
It's time to sober up.

How much longer do I have to carry you?

00:39:07,843 --> 00:39:09,605
She is thankful for I helping her.

651
00:39:09,630 --> 00:39:11,072
She left it for me then left.

652
00:39:11,285 --> 00:39:13,226
No wonder she said she had business.

653
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:17,991
She didnt come tobmeet Head Sang-Beom,
but came to give this to me.

654
00:39:18,623 --> 00:39:20,335
However, there is no sender's name.

655
00:39:20,391 --> 00:39:22,622
That's actually Bo-Kyung's style.

656
00:39:22,663 --> 00:39:24,197
She likes it that way, not too obvious.

657
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,426
She is shy to show
her heart just like that.

658
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:29,810
She puts it quietly then leaves.

659
00:39:30,127 --> 00:39:31,160
Now do you understand?

660
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:35,193
What is the real feelings of Bo Kyung?

661
00:39:36,404 --> 00:39:38,910
Then, we can eat it
together.

662
00:39:39,439 --> 00:39:40,466
Hey.

663
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:43,104
She left it
to give to me.

664
00:39:44,038 --> 00:39:45,084
Father.

665
00:39:46,561 --> 00:39:48,575
When I was little,

666
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:51,447
I didn't understand why you were
always chasing criminals,

667
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,692
and did not stay at home.

668
00:39:53,183 --> 00:39:55,256
Your fellow detectives were just like you.

669
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:57,745
But, I understand now.

670
00:39:57,879 --> 00:39:58,985
What do you understand?

671
00:39:59,367 --> 00:40:00,754
You're like that out of anger.

672
00:40:00,986 --> 00:40:02,553
It's like there's a fire burning in your chest.

673
00:40:02,718 --> 00:40:05,171
Your chest looks like it's about to explode
if you don't catch the culprit.

674
00:40:05,290 --> 00:40:06,202
You?

675
00:40:07,415 --> 00:40:08,949
Actually, what happened today?

676
00:40:09,607 --> 00:40:11,581
There seems to be
urgent work today.

677
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,940
I just received an emergency call
from the Head of Office.

678
00:40:14,015 --> 00:40:16,662
Want to be annoyed, how else?
It's work.

679
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Say I'm sorry I can't be
with my daughter on her birthday.

680
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:22,970
I already bought a cake
and put it in the office.

681
00:40:23,498 --> 00:40:25,147
Please take it and...

682
00:40:25,181 --> 00:40:26,623
Why did you eat it?

683
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:28,921
Happy birthday!

684
00:40:30,151 --> 00:40:31,291
Where is everyone?

685
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:33,507
Oh, yes.

686
00:40:33,663 --> 00:40:35,240
Byun Ji-Woong and Ji Man-Goo
is on stake out.

687
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,371
The rest will come soon.

688
00:40:37,431 --> 00:40:38,731
Tell them to come quickly.

689
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:41,141
I Want TJ or whatever it is,
I need all of them.

690
00:40:41,757 --> 00:40:43,904
How dare they burn my daughter's chest.

691
00:40:44,681 --> 00:40:47,021
I will destroy
everything, you bastard.

692
00:40:49,316 --> 00:40:52,077
I heard he's home?
You like it, right?

693
00:40:52,846 --> 00:40:53,880
Yes, I see.

694
00:40:58,588 --> 00:41:01,472
Buy your home appliances with this.

695
00:41:01,662 --> 00:41:03,115
Change your child's computer too.

696
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,971
You killed Ki Dong-Jae, right?

697
00:41:10,437 --> 00:41:11,470
Who knows.

698
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:14,241
Maybe like that.

699
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,486
Yes, he's an bastard
who deserved to die a hundred times.

700
00:41:19,369 --> 00:41:23,261
But, is the Team Leader of a big company
have to do such a thing?

701
00:41:27,122 --> 00:41:28,822
At first, it was all like this.

702
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:31,977
If one layer is peeled off,
all gets muddy.

703
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,562
Brother.

704
00:41:41,366 --> 00:41:43,842
If you tell me to go 
into the mud, I will enter.

705
00:41:43,989 --> 00:41:44,783
But...

706
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:48,152
I should know too
what's in it

707
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:51,712
so that I can be strong
and be able to carry my own body.

708
00:41:58,416 --> 00:41:59,625
Loan account.

709
00:42:01,577 --> 00:42:04,211
Too big to manage alone.

710
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,277
That's why I need you.

711
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,407
Looks like it was almost
ten years ago.

712
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:22,047
You and I are partners again.

713
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:25,943
Toast.

714
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,223
Let's continue together. Forever.

715
00:42:35,093 --> 00:42:39,413
From today on, I will supervise the Jung Hee-Joo case myself.

716
00:42:41,795 --> 00:42:43,987
There's no need to be afraid even if your opponent is TJ.

717
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:47,648
They are the ones who touched our family.

718
00:42:48,001 --> 00:42:49,617
We have to hit them.
do not care about anything.

719
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,323
You have to be ready to
break their heads.

720
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:55,517
Otherwise, we
couldn't get over TJ. Understand?

721
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:56,650
Yes.

722
00:42:57,468 --> 00:42:58,834
- Team Leader Woo.
- Yes?

723
00:42:59,112 --> 00:43:01,288
Report progress of
investigation so far.

724
00:43:01,313 --> 00:43:04,113
We have revealed the accusations until
Ki Dong-Jae and Choi Yong-Geun.

725
00:43:04,155 --> 00:43:08,201
I think we put two people
behind and get the strands.

726
00:43:08,337 --> 00:43:11,670
The problem is, Ki Dong-Jae who was
imprisoned has now been released.

727
00:43:11,798 --> 00:43:12,831
What?

728
00:43:14,225 --> 00:43:17,294
- What? Why them?
- The Seoul Investigation Team requests the Prosecutor

729
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:18,538
so as not to sue them.

730
00:43:18,685 --> 00:43:21,538
Additional demands that we provided
still not processed.

731
00:43:21,689 --> 00:43:23,375
The prosecutors were really in trouble.

732
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,210
Things related to TJ Group is
very difficult.

733
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:28,535
They intervened for him to be released.

734
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:30,608
Seoul Investigation Team
made up the reason.

735
00:43:30,641 --> 00:43:32,318
Because of Cheon Na-Na and Woo Tae-Ho's problems,

736
00:43:32,343 --> 00:43:34,866
 the murder of Jung Hee-Joo case too getting less attention.

737
00:43:34,899 --> 00:43:37,773
Prosecutors have to make Jung Hee-Joo's case
back into the center of attention.

738
00:43:40,616 --> 00:43:41,636
How?

739
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:43,169
There must be a problem, right?

740
00:43:43,194 --> 00:43:45,941
The Hearing Office called earlier.

741
00:43:45,966 --> 00:43:47,276
This sounds absurd,

742
00:43:47,758 --> 00:43:49,399
looks like they will continue to interfere.

743
00:43:49,424 --> 00:43:50,626
Don't worry about it.

744
00:43:51,565 --> 00:43:54,348
I will go after the Chief Director General
and try to stop him.

745
00:43:54,407 --> 00:43:56,559
You're going to stop the Chief Director General?

746
00:43:56,591 --> 00:43:59,070
Who is the Head of Office afraid of?

747
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:01,147
Who is the bravest in our office?

748
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,254
KMMI.

749
00:44:02,288 --> 00:44:04,075
The commander who surrendered became the inspector.

750
00:44:04,366 --> 00:44:05,826
Nothing can bother him.

751
00:44:06,013 --> 00:44:07,706
Greatest Head of Office.

752
00:44:08,431 --> 00:44:11,107
I never said
I am KMMI.

753
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:12,327
It's official, KMMI.

754
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,624
give applause
to the head of the office, Moon Sang-Beom.

755
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,213
- Great!
- KMMI!

756
00:44:17,257 --> 00:44:18,768
- You guys...
- I didn't say,

757
00:44:18,808 --> 00:44:20,732
to stop investigating
my alleged corruption.

758
00:44:21,046 --> 00:44:24,945
Please make my corruption
look very big.

759
00:44:34,722 --> 00:44:35,769
Hello.

760
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:38,126
Hello! Gosh, nice to see you!

761
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,847
I've seen the broadcast.

762
00:44:41,355 --> 00:44:43,101
- I'm your fan now.
- Oh yes.

763
00:44:44,354 --> 00:44:45,460
That's me...

764
00:44:45,528 --> 00:44:47,061
There's something I want to tell you,

765
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:49,088
this is going to be a hit
if you can broadcast it.

766
00:44:49,445 --> 00:44:52,519
You see, I do a broadcast,
not to grant a request.

767
00:44:53,617 --> 00:44:55,903
I already know the price, come on...

768
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:01,267
Hey.

769
00:45:01,292 --> 00:45:02,333
I understand.

770
00:45:05,779 --> 00:45:07,218
If the price is right,
you will broadcast, right?

771
00:45:08,227 --> 00:45:09,254
Do you agree?

772
00:45:09,812 --> 00:45:12,979
<i>The death of the son-in-law of the Chaebol family is
very interesting to see.</i>

773
00:45:13,337 --> 00:45:16,504
<i>But, there's more behind it
something astonishing.</i>

774
00:45:16,607 --> 00:45:19,823
<i>Here, another important character appears.</i>

775
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,170
<i>That is, the police.</i>

776
00:45:21,747 --> 00:45:24,700
<i>One policeman on duty was
handling Jung Hee-Joo's case.</i>

777
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:27,904
<i>Based on accurate information,</i>

778
00:45:28,181 --> 00:45:31,281
<i>that police guy is being investigated
on suspicion of bribery.</i>

779
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:34,828
<i>They're trying to take advantage
his friend's daughter's job as a policeman</i>

780
00:45:34,865 --> 00:45:37,500
<i>so that the child can be expelled
of this case.</i>

781
00:45:37,708 --> 00:45:40,441
<i>This is clearly a corruption case,
because of the problem...</i>

782
00:45:41,106 --> 00:45:43,852
<i>This policeman keeps receiving things
from TJ Group,</i>

783
00:45:44,341 --> 00:45:46,941
<i>and trying to close
Jeong Hee-Joo's murder case.</i>

784
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:49,597
<i>So...</i>

785
00:45:49,866 --> 00:45:52,475
<i>Jung Hee-Joo was an employee of TJ Group.</i>

786
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:55,982
<i>For TJ's company, this is just
</i>

787
00:45:56,010 --> 00:45:57,690
<i>But, why? Why?</i>

788
00:45:59,255 --> 00:46:00,595
<i>Why TJ Group</i>

789
00:46:00,964 --> 00:46:04,831
<i>is meddling in this case
and bribing</i>

790
00:46:05,644 --> 00:46:06,957
<i>to the police on duty?</i>

791
00:46:07,853 --> 00:46:08,759
This...

792
00:46:08,855 --> 00:46:10,649
Can we type like this?

793
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:12,239
Don't worry.

794
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,723
The money will come out
from the account of the building owner in Gangnam.

795
00:46:15,865 --> 00:46:17,205
Just write.

796
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:22,272
Do you want wine?

797
00:46:23,498 --> 00:46:25,207
No, no.

798
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,468
I have a meeting today.

799
00:46:30,342 --> 00:46:32,414
Is there no news?
of vice chairman Cheon Sang-Woo?

800
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:35,005
Not at all. If anything,
I won't pick it up.

801
00:46:35,378 --> 00:46:36,815
The shareholders' meeting is coming soon.

802
00:46:37,495 --> 00:46:40,108
I want to avoid
unnecessary meetings.

803
00:46:42,644 --> 00:46:44,950
How about McQueen?
Already know the direction?

804
00:46:46,204 --> 00:46:47,251
What do you think?

805
00:46:49,381 --> 00:46:50,407
Cancel.

806
00:46:52,239 --> 00:46:53,272
Okay.

807
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:54,997
I'll tell them your opinion.

808
00:46:58,197 --> 00:47:00,537
After the meeting is over,
I'm planning to go to America for a bit.

809
00:47:00,992 --> 00:47:02,279
To calm my feelings.

810
00:47:03,510 --> 00:47:06,643
Before that, I want a meeting
with chairman McQueen.

811
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:08,536
Can you arrange it?

812
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:13,458
Yes.

813
00:47:13,894 --> 00:47:14,954
I have to do it.

814
00:47:15,191 --> 00:47:16,631
He likes beautiful women.

815
00:47:23,081 --> 00:47:24,921
Tae-Ho's problem is huge.

816
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:26,933
How are you going to fix it?

817
00:47:28,094 --> 00:47:29,133
This is only temporary.

818
00:47:29,612 --> 00:47:31,452
Later the problem will subside.

819
00:47:32,143 --> 00:47:33,249
What do you think, Na-Na?

820
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,953
This is not a problem
which is easy to solve for me.

821
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:37,690
Looks like it will take quite some time.

822
00:47:38,771 --> 00:47:41,098
You don't need to think about this.

823
00:47:41,511 --> 00:47:43,591
I'll take care of it myself.

824
00:47:45,594 --> 00:47:47,060
Give compensation,

825
00:47:48,001 --> 00:47:49,648
to his family so that they wont be sad.

826
00:47:49,773 --> 00:47:50,840
He's not an ordinary person.

827
00:47:52,265 --> 00:47:53,292
Indeed...

828
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:56,609
What has he done
for us?

829
00:47:57,161 --> 00:47:59,095
In fact he is a person
who wants to take all.

830
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,682
We must put family first.

831
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,490
That's etiquette for the dead.

832
00:48:04,772 --> 00:48:05,792
Yes.

833
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:07,752
I already contacted
major shareholder.

834
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:12,291
I conveyed to them that
you can do better management.

835
00:48:13,197 --> 00:48:15,164
They all agreed..

836
00:48:16,723 --> 00:48:19,492
We just have to convince McQueen.

837
00:48:19,566 --> 00:48:21,419
I'll take care of that.

838
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:24,116
What do you mean?

839
00:48:24,795 --> 00:48:26,262
- your college friend, Michael?
- Yes.

840
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:28,268
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

841
00:48:29,981 --> 00:48:31,355
I really thought

842
00:48:32,465 --> 00:48:34,518
I have unlucky children.

843
00:48:35,468 --> 00:48:36,648
It turned out to be that one of my child,

844
00:48:37,425 --> 00:48:38,550
has..

845
00:48:39,117 --> 00:48:40,404
grown up very well.

846
00:48:48,631 --> 00:48:49,665
What did Na-Na say?

847
00:48:50,416 --> 00:48:52,669
She wants to meet 
with chairman McQueen.

848
00:48:53,151 --> 00:48:54,538
This means she wants to step over me.

849
00:48:54,611 --> 00:48:55,818
What do you think her purpose is?

850
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,664
What Na-Na wants
is to be a leader.

851
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:01,064
So?

852
00:49:01,267 --> 00:49:03,407
But her Desire and ability doesnt fall in line.

853
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:05,897
And also that is the official position
McQueen's main office.

854
00:49:05,939 --> 00:49:07,632
Na-Na will definitely be sad.

855
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:08,812
Even though you are friends.

856
00:49:08,837 --> 00:49:10,931
The reason I followed her advice before,

857
00:49:11,015 --> 00:49:12,448
was not because I'm close to her.

858
00:49:13,399 --> 00:49:16,032
But because beside her
there was Woo Tae-Ho.

859
00:49:16,617 --> 00:49:20,140
Honestly to McQueen,
Cheon Sang-Woo wasn't the right person.

860
00:49:20,715 --> 00:49:22,301
I preferred Director Cheon,

861
00:49:22,901 --> 00:49:24,101
who had a leader beside her,

862
00:49:24,543 --> 00:49:26,322
Compared to now that director Cheon
without Woo Tae-Ho.

863
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:28,382
So you mean Woo Tae-Ho's death,

864
00:49:28,996 --> 00:49:31,289
is good for me and Sang-Woo?

865
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:34,468
When 
people like Woo Tae-Ho appears again,

866
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,597
I will change my choice.

867
00:49:39,170 --> 00:49:40,637
There will be no such thing.

868
00:49:42,739 --> 00:49:45,193
Soon there will be a reporter
from the TV.

869
00:49:45,346 --> 00:49:47,952
You can answer their questions
as written here.

870
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,377
Whoa, what is this?

871
00:49:50,457 --> 00:49:51,937
This is not a fake story.

872
00:49:53,613 --> 00:49:55,680
This isn't a bad story.

873
00:49:56,373 --> 00:49:57,606
good grief...

874
00:49:58,401 --> 00:49:59,568
Detective Kwon can too, right?

875
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,326
Yes, I can, just enough...

876
00:50:02,353 --> 00:50:03,966
Why is it not there for me?

877
00:50:04,132 --> 00:50:07,606
People like you and me
cannot attend the interview.

878
00:50:07,732 --> 00:50:08,752
Find out later.

879
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:10,959
Like? Why...

880
00:50:11,159 --> 00:50:12,599
You could think that...

881
00:50:13,245 --> 00:50:14,325
Yes, Bo-Kyung?

882
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:16,719
Oh yes.

883
00:50:17,223 --> 00:50:18,870
He is still a bit lacking...

884
00:50:19,214 --> 00:50:20,243
That kid really!

885
00:50:20,268 --> 00:50:23,192
I really want to curse him,
but I can't because it will be broadcast.

886
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:30,479
This place is

887
00:50:31,552 --> 00:50:33,819
my grandfather's birthplace,

888
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:36,887
the family company's founder,
Cheon Tae-Ju.

889
00:50:37,125 --> 00:50:38,178
Then

890
00:50:38,788 --> 00:50:40,177
100 years later, on this day,

891
00:50:40,349 --> 00:50:41,449
I, Cheon Sang-Woo

892
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:44,166
will start my journey here,

893
00:50:44,628 --> 00:50:47,074
as the third leader of the company.

894
00:50:47,498 --> 00:50:48,618
The road ahead,

895
00:50:49,118 --> 00:50:50,631
will be hard and not easy.

896
00:50:51,199 --> 00:50:54,512
However, every time
I feel trouble and get exhausted,

897
00:50:55,829 --> 00:50:57,623
I will remember this place.

898
00:50:58,942 --> 00:51:02,055
<i>I will explore</i>

899
00:51:03,082 --> 00:51:05,335
<i>TJ's achievements over the past 100 years.</i>

900
00:51:06,597 --> 00:51:07,358
<i>Inauguration Ceremony
Vice Chairman Cheon Sang-Woo</i>

901
00:51:30,927 --> 00:51:32,461
Brother,you can't do that,

902
00:51:32,614 --> 00:51:33,747
without my permission.

903
00:51:36,299 --> 00:51:37,926
<i>Me and TJ's history</i>

904
00:51:38,741 --> 00:51:40,208
<i>will start from here.</i>

905
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,432
<i>This is the first step
to be number one.</i>

906
00:51:43,485 --> 00:51:45,671
Can we,

907
00:51:46,785 --> 00:51:48,012
catch that person?

908
00:51:49,144 --> 00:51:50,163
It seems like...

909
00:51:51,306 --> 00:51:53,520
picking up the stars in the sky which is more easier.

910
00:51:53,823 --> 00:51:56,483
<i>We will become stronger together.</i>

911
00:51:58,009 --> 00:51:59,036
Thank you.

912
00:51:59,113 --> 00:52:03,472
<i>First interview conducted
at the birth house of the founder of TJ Group</i>

913
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:05,731
He has very high self esteem.

914
00:52:05,967 --> 00:52:09,034
When TJ collapses,
then Korea will also collapse.

915
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:13,382
But TJ's current situation is not easy.

916
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:16,427
President Cheon Sung-Dae
is being imprisoned.

917
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:19,387
There is also the case of the death of the son-in-law
because of a tragic accident.

918
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:23,656
There is also news about the relationship between son in law and
TJ employee murder case

919
00:52:23,925 --> 00:52:25,439
whose name is Jung Hee-Joo.

920
00:52:25,661 --> 00:52:28,974
Right, that's what we got
from broadcasts on the internet, right?

921
00:52:29,009 --> 00:52:30,049
Right.

922
00:52:30,184 --> 00:52:33,717
This is talked about not only on the internet,
but also by people <i>offline</i>.

923
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:36,673
And we've looked deeper into it.
Let's take a look at the screen.

924
00:52:37,598 --> 00:52:41,078
He's from the Seoul Investigation Team
and came to our office one year ago.

925
00:52:41,546 --> 00:52:44,107
He's so stupid, so I don't know
what does he feel.

926
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:45,418
<i>I think I've heard,</i>

927
00:52:45,605 --> 00:52:49,127
<i>he's looking into the case about TJ Group
while still in the Seoul Investigation Team.</i>

928
00:52:49,919 --> 00:52:52,959
<i>Come to think of it, big company
like TJ Group</i>

929
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,882
<i>trying to bribe the senior detective?</i>

930
00:52:56,121 --> 00:52:57,827
<i>The difference is quite big.</i>

931
00:52:58,068 --> 00:53:01,928
<i>Even though I don't know
if the upper party accept it too.</i>

932
00:53:02,644 --> 00:53:04,470
<i>I don't know exactly.</i>

933
00:53:04,694 --> 00:53:06,260
<i>I heard it's a top person</i>

934
00:53:06,461 --> 00:53:10,821
<i>from TJ Group's legal team.</i>

935
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:12,966
<i>This is just a story I heard.</i>

936
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,180
<i>More details... This is not a fact.</i>

937
00:53:17,629 --> 00:53:20,989
What nonsense they're talking about.

938
00:53:21,014 --> 00:53:23,311
<i>Says there's a gift in Gangnam.</i>

939
00:53:23,928 --> 00:53:25,441
<i>In Gangnam.</i>

940
00:53:26,283 --> 00:53:27,930
<i>He owns a building in Gangnam.
He doesn't even know the credit card limit.</i>

941
00:53:29,058 --> 00:53:31,277
<i>Can it really be bought
with a detective's salary?</i>

942
00:53:31,683 --> 00:53:33,978
<i>He thinks money can 
get everything done.</i>

943
00:53:34,032 --> 00:53:37,605
<i>He's really materialistic.</i>

944
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,960
<i>He's crazy about money and women,
really trash.</i>

945
00:53:41,298 --> 00:53:43,425
<i>We can be fooled by seeing his face.</i>

946
00:53:44,299 --> 00:53:46,579
<i>I made a mistake.</i>

947
00:53:47,442 --> 00:53:51,295
<i>I arranged a meeting between him
and the top management of the company.</i>

948
00:53:51,605 --> 00:53:53,299
<i>In a secret place.</i>

949
00:53:54,558 --> 00:53:55,718
<i>I...</i>

950
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:58,818
<i>really didn't expect
cops can be sociopaths like that.</i>

951
00:53:58,897 --> 00:54:01,761
In the end, this bribed detective,

952
00:54:01,986 --> 00:54:05,750
have a secret deal
with one of the TJ executives

953
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:08,307
and this is related
with the murder of Jung Hee-Joo

954
00:54:08,434 --> 00:54:11,214
who was an employee of TJ.

955
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:13,594
Still unconfirmed regarding
case relationship.

956
00:54:13,714 --> 00:54:15,628
But, with the emergence of this corruption case,

957
00:54:15,699 --> 00:54:19,546
Jung Hee-Joo's murder case is
back to attention.

958
00:54:19,632 --> 00:54:24,226
Currently there are more than 100 thousand petitions
who asked for the Blue House,

959
00:54:24,431 --> 00:54:26,704
to reveal the truth
regarding the death of Jung Hee-Joo.

960
00:54:27,152 --> 00:54:28,406
Fine, I understand.

961
00:54:32,279 --> 00:54:34,266
Prosecutors will grant additional charges.

962
00:54:35,172 --> 00:54:37,932
Arrest Ki Dong-Jae and we will investigate
formally.

963
00:54:38,581 --> 00:54:40,414
It would be difficult to catch Ki Dong-Jae.

964
00:54:42,090 --> 00:54:45,844
We have to catch him.
He have to admit that for everything to go smoothly.

965
00:54:45,917 --> 00:54:49,230
They didnt let go of Ki Dong-Jae
to keep him safe.

966
00:54:49,267 --> 00:54:51,734
They released him so he can be killed.

967
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:53,329
Then how?

968
00:54:53,496 --> 00:54:55,596
After all, he's not the mastermind.

969
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:58,214
We will start with Choi Yong-Geun, then...

970
00:55:00,233 --> 00:55:01,993
We must pluck the stars in the sky.

971
00:55:07,538 --> 00:55:09,378
Ki Dong-Jae has been released,

972
00:55:10,948 --> 00:55:13,061
I think he has run away.

973
00:55:15,447 --> 00:55:16,509
Good grief.

974
00:55:16,868 --> 00:55:18,588
I'm afraid we will just wait..

975
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:20,589
and yield nothing.

976
00:55:21,053 --> 00:55:24,020
No, I have a good feeling.
Looks like we're going to be great.

977
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,941
What can be great about me.

978
00:55:27,284 --> 00:55:31,024
What do you lack?
You were third in the lottery right?

979
00:55:32,017 --> 00:55:33,643
What's so great?

980
00:55:33,991 --> 00:55:36,624
The first winner won one billion.

981
00:55:36,658 --> 00:55:37,871
Because of only one number...

982
00:55:38,605 --> 00:55:42,824
I lost 99,999,000 Won!
Even though it was so close.

983
00:55:43,865 --> 00:55:44,576
Good grief.

984
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,291
After that, my life became shit.

985
00:55:48,341 --> 00:55:49,361
She's coming!

986
00:55:49,581 --> 00:55:50,948
Thats great news for us.

987
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,763
If we can catch her,
that's just great.

988
00:55:59,614 --> 00:56:00,634
Please wait.

989
00:56:03,085 --> 00:56:04,151
Excuse me.

990
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:09,850
What do you need?

991
00:56:10,304 --> 00:56:13,490
Do you know 
It is illegal to hide evidence?

992
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:15,352
Yes? What's that?

993
00:56:15,402 --> 00:56:16,442
So that means

994
00:56:17,103 --> 00:56:19,329
Ki Dong-Jae had already killed people.

995
00:56:19,354 --> 00:56:20,879
Two policemen were hurt by him.

996
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:23,293
And the proof is all on the phone.

997
00:56:23,479 --> 00:56:25,119
If anyone
who hid the cell phone,

998
00:56:25,167 --> 00:56:26,924
then he or she can be caught
for hiding evidence.

999
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:30,590
But, if the phone is handed over
to the police,

1000
00:56:31,261 --> 00:56:36,606
she will be considered cooperating
and receive a good citizen award.

1001
00:56:37,422 --> 00:56:39,922
And there's prize money too.

1002
00:56:40,279 --> 00:56:42,859
A number with three lottery winners prizes.

1003
00:56:42,921 --> 00:56:44,208
Why is that...

1004
00:56:45,926 --> 00:56:46,966
Please select.

1005
00:56:47,495 --> 00:56:49,968
You will choose this, or do you want to choose

1006
00:56:50,008 --> 00:56:52,375
a prize worth one million won without tax?

1007
00:56:53,362 --> 00:56:55,015
I don't know.

1008
00:56:55,527 --> 00:56:56,607
Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok

1009
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,653
went on vacation.

1010
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,506
to Antarctica.

1011
00:57:01,024 --> 00:57:02,910
He went to see penguins in Antarctica.

1012
00:57:03,426 --> 00:57:04,486
Already?

1013
00:57:04,973 --> 00:57:06,466
That is not me.

1014
00:57:07,374 --> 00:57:09,934
Why are you cursing me?
That is not me!

1015
00:57:10,207 --> 00:57:11,227
Alright, I'm hanging up.

1016
00:57:12,764 --> 00:57:14,417
Turn off all office phones.

1017
00:57:18,428 --> 00:57:19,981
It seems this problem is too big.

1018
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,753
There are only suspicions without evidence.

1019
00:57:22,691 --> 00:57:26,011
Everything will be okay if I
show this is my father's legacy.

1020
00:57:26,928 --> 00:57:28,035
But...

1021
00:57:28,641 --> 00:57:30,600
Well, he's the owner of the building.

1022
00:57:31,752 --> 00:57:32,805
Hello?

1023
00:57:33,719 --> 00:57:34,899
<i>Detective Oh...</i>

1024
00:57:35,596 --> 00:57:37,916
- Director.
<i>- Please save me.</i>

1025
00:57:41,913 --> 00:57:43,786
This is Oh Ji-Hyeok
of the West Incheon Police.

1026
00:57:43,932 --> 00:57:46,586
Gyeonggi-do, Siheung-si, Seongsa-gu,
Ocheon-ro, number 101.

1027
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:49,168
Please send help there
and call an ambulance too.

1028
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:51,626
There is a woman who need emergency help.

1029
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,390
<i>It looks like it's in Gyeonggi-do.</i>

1030
00:58:05,424 --> 00:58:07,917
<i>I'll tell you after getting into the car.</i>

1031
00:58:08,147 --> 00:58:10,215
- Said Ki Dong-Jae's cell phone was found?
- Right.

1032
00:58:11,107 --> 00:58:12,173
Where?

1033
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,231
<i>Here... Like...</i>

1034
00:58:15,387 --> 00:58:16,980
<i>It looks like it's in Gyeonggi-do.</i>

1035
00:58:17,776 --> 00:58:20,142
<i>I'll tell you after getting into the car.</i>

1036
00:58:20,432 --> 00:58:21,945
<i>What about Jung Hee-Joo's corpse?</i>

1037
00:58:25,035 --> 00:58:26,852
<i>Not much difference
with the one in the picture.</i>

1038
00:58:26,921 --> 00:58:28,808
<i>I think he killed her too.</i>

1039
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,205
<i>- You're wearing gloves, right?
- Of course.</i>

1040
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,926
<i>- Your shoes?
- I already wrapped it</i>

1041
00:58:34,031 --> 00:58:35,084
<i>so that there are no footprints.</i>

1042
00:58:35,327 --> 00:58:37,592
<i>Okay, your DNA too
could be left on the dress.</i>

1043
00:58:37,647 --> 00:58:40,320
<i>Be careful holding with direct hands.</i>

1044
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:42,182
<i>I cleaned my clothes,</i>

1045
00:58:42,805 --> 00:58:44,965
<i>and put on gloves.
It won't happen.</i>

1046
00:58:45,402 --> 00:58:46,602
<i>You remember the way to go, right?</i>

1047
00:58:46,869 --> 00:58:48,396
<i>Go down that road again.</i>

1048
00:58:49,164 --> 00:58:52,404
<i>There might be scratches on the tree
by touch,</i>

1049
00:58:52,464 --> 00:58:54,904
<i>pick anything suspicious
and burn.</i>

1050
00:58:55,273 --> 00:58:56,326
<i>Okay.</i>

1051
00:58:56,522 --> 00:58:59,965
<i>Turn on auto steering mode
and sink the car.</i>

1052
00:59:00,271 --> 00:59:03,291
<i>DNA can be left in the car,
make sure you drown it.</i>

1053
00:59:04,759 --> 00:59:07,550
<i>Before drowning, check
carefully whether there is any physical evidence.</i>

1054
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:11,313
<i>Burn everything you own to dust.</i>

1055
00:59:11,699 --> 00:59:12,733
<i>Okay, I understand.</i>

1056
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:18,640
Choi Yong-Geun, You are done.

1057
00:59:19,191 --> 00:59:21,124
Now I can,

1058
00:59:21,531 --> 00:59:23,590
meet 
Jung Hee-Joo's grandpa quickly.

1059
00:59:36,476 --> 00:59:38,889
Oh Ji-Hyeok from West Incheon Police.
What is the situation?

1060
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,159
When we came,
the situation is over.

1061
00:59:41,474 --> 00:59:43,039
She has <i>diabetes mellitus.</i>

1062
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:45,361
- What about the woman?
- She is inside.

1063
00:59:45,386 --> 00:59:47,196
we will go now,
she said her friend was coming.

1064
00:59:48,119 --> 00:59:50,221
Okay, you guys have worked hard.

1065
01:00:26,557 --> 01:00:28,306
<i>Why are you bothering me?</i>

1066
01:00:29,112 --> 01:00:29,776
<i>Why?</i>

1067
01:00:30,372 --> 01:00:32,177
<i>What have I done to you?</i>

1068
01:00:33,076 --> 01:00:33,584
What?

1069
01:00:35,309 --> 01:00:36,350
Why?

1070
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,306
I told you to pick it up
what is he hiding.

1071
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:41,521
Did I tell you to use it?

1072
01:00:42,215 --> 01:00:43,246
What do you want?

1073
01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:45,155
Money?

1074
01:00:45,929 --> 01:00:48,524
Or do you want him to divorce
and come to you?

1075
01:00:48,569 --> 01:00:50,133
Please return Min-Ji's child.

1076
01:00:53,713 --> 01:00:54,964
You are...

1077
01:00:55,876 --> 01:00:59,071
Why do you care about Min-Ji's child?

1078
01:00:59,426 --> 01:01:01,503
She has nothing
to talk to me.

1079
01:01:02,677 --> 01:01:04,779
I've given her enough.

1080
01:01:04,804 --> 01:01:06,397
You...

1081
01:01:06,698 --> 01:01:08,832
have robbed all of Min-Ji's property.

1082
01:01:09,101 --> 01:01:10,121
Then?

1083
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,544
If I don't return the child,

1084
01:01:13,631 --> 01:01:17,036
You will hand over the CCTV footage
to the police?

1085
01:01:19,702 --> 01:01:20,722
Yes.

1086
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:26,109
Yes, give it a try.

1087
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:30,525
I can get out with the help of a lawyer.

1088
01:01:30,637 --> 01:01:32,401
But what will you do after that?

1089
01:01:33,734 --> 01:01:36,103
Maybe your future

1090
01:01:37,173 --> 01:01:38,737
will be like hell.

1091
01:01:41,624 --> 01:01:42,983
I'm ready for that.

1092
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:46,379
Really?

1093
01:01:48,089 --> 01:01:49,863
Your grandfather owns that shoe shop,

1094
01:01:50,577 --> 01:01:52,475
looks like he will be disabled.

1095
01:01:53,794 --> 01:01:56,567
What do you mean ?

1096
01:01:56,620 --> 01:02:00,051
I mean, your grandfather could be
first

1097
01:02:00,876 --> 01:02:02,425
to see hell.

1098
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:06,820
Should I send,

1099
01:02:08,219 --> 01:02:10,085
that video to Director Cheon?

1100
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,402
Then the Chief would definitely see it too.

1101
01:02:14,962 --> 01:02:17,470
Aren't you more afraid of them
than the police?

1102
01:02:18,853 --> 01:02:19,884
What?

1103
01:02:20,842 --> 01:02:24,011
And when the Chief finds out
the truth you harassed Min-Ji,

1104
01:02:24,864 --> 01:02:26,357
wouldn't he be very disappointed?

1105
01:02:30,005 --> 01:02:31,102
Are you,

1106
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:33,325
are you threatening me now?

1107
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:35,656
How dare,

1108
01:02:36,823 --> 01:02:38,156
someone like you threaten me?

1109
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:40,070
You're used to it,

1110
01:02:40,609 --> 01:02:41,706
with a threat like this.

1111
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,606
What are you saying?

1112
01:02:43,898 --> 01:02:47,072
You beat an innocent woman to death.

1113
01:02:47,474 --> 01:02:50,064
To hide that
You took the child and then threatened her

1114
01:02:51,333 --> 01:02:54,190
You're also threatening an old man
who have no power.

1115
01:02:55,298 --> 01:02:56,390
Compared to that,

1116
01:02:56,899 --> 01:02:58,463
this is still not a threat.

1117
01:02:59,230 --> 01:03:00,271
You are really...

1118
01:03:01,928 --> 01:03:03,774
Do you want to die?

1119
01:03:03,828 --> 01:03:04,936
Sit down!

1120
01:03:05,549 --> 01:03:07,149
Bring back Min-Ji's child.

1121
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:10,402
This is your last chance.

1122
01:03:12,905 --> 01:03:13,951
Hey!

1123
01:03:14,842 --> 01:03:15,888
Hey!

1124
01:03:16,409 --> 01:03:17,978
Stop there!

1125
01:03:48,311 --> 01:03:49,660
Just Kill Jung Hee-Joo.

1126
01:03:51,755 --> 01:03:55,027
I will give you money
which will be enough for your descendants too!

1127
01:03:55,762 --> 01:03:57,459
Kill Jung Hee-Joo.

1128
01:03:58,601 --> 01:04:00,707
Section Chief Choi will take care of the rest

01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:02,722
therefore you, Ki Dong-Jae,

01:04:03,382 --> 01:04:05,531
you just kill her.

1131
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,461
You understand?

1132
01:04:08,534 --> 01:04:09,954
Thank you for saving me.

1133
01:04:11,095 --> 01:04:12,136
This is your gift.

<i>We will try to catch him.</i>

1136
01:04:46,766 --> 01:04:48,935

<i>If there was no Tae-Ho, what
will you be at this point?</i>

1139
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,601
<i>You're the one who usually hides things,</i>

1140

<i>Just show your real self now.</i>

<i>Why did Woo Tae-Ho die?</i>

1145
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:06,983
<i>How are you going to handle it?</i>

1146
01:05:07,060 --> 01:05:09,773
<i>Are you going to say the name of real culprit,</i>

1147
01:05:09,853 --> 01:05:11,360
<i>or did I make you do it?</i>

1148
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:13,620
<i>The police have issued a summons
for the Chief.</i>

1149
01:05:13,654 --> 01:05:15,470
<i>Please have me on the President's side.</i>
