Here.

10
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:52,450
I said come here!

11
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,320
What are you doing!

12
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,800
Why did you do that?

00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,260
Have you come?

Please help me.

16
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,090
He's in this photo, right?

17
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:48,210
who is he ?

18
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
Should you pretend that you don't know

19
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,600
So it's true he's in this photo.

20
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,730
I don't know.

21
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,210
Since it's been a long time,
I can't remember his face.

22
00:02:57,570 --> 00:03:00,980
You said you last saw him
last weekend?

23
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,900
- It's only a few days difference.
- It...

24
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,140
I only met them briefly in
the corridor. I really don't remember anything.

25
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,630
Take a closer look again.

26
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,850
If you're not sure,
you don't need to open your mouth.

27
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,460
I'm sorry

28
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,040
No matter how many times I think about it, I can't remember.

29
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,080
If so, I say goodbye.

30
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,680
Yes. Go away.

32
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,480
Yes, Team Leader?

33
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,220
Go to the hospital and
check the victim's condition.

34
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:10,090
Refer the case to
the investigative team.

35
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,720
Then, don't let the kids get involved.

36
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,830
You understand?

37
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,880
You take care of that.

38
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,960
I'll take care of the rest when I
get there.

39
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,500
I hung up.

40
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,350
Give me the brow brace.

41
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:47,650
- Too much blood, sorry.
- Stop the bleeding. This side.

42
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,590
Hold this.

- Good.

46
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,690
- Up a little more.
- Good.

47
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,600
What was the situation at the time of the rescue?

48
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,700
Who knows. The patient is in critical condition,

49
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:12,870
so we don't pay much attention to the crime scene.

<i>Ketua Tim Choi Yong-Geun</i>

51
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:19,120
Okay. We will contact you again
if there is anything that needs to be confirmed.

52
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:22,500
- Hello.
- How is the victim doing?

53
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:24,130
Her internal organs were damaged

54
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,990
looks like she's been raped

55
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,060
I mean, is  she  still alive, you idiot!

56
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:32,030
Yes, looks like she's safe

57
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,700
Good then.

58
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,990
The police investigation is going
well, isn't it?

59
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:39,110
Yes ,, ok

60
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,100
Wait there until I arrive.

61
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,470
Don't do anything.

62
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,000
Don't interfere and
mess things up.

63
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,990
But Team Leader, this is no
ordinary case of violence.

64
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,580
This is attempted murder.

65
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,480
You don't understand my words?
Don't be rash, you bastard.

66
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,350
Hung up now

67
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,560
Let me check the CCTV.

68
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,510
Sorry, but we do not install CCTV,

69
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:33,860
for protecting guest privacy.

70
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,030
- Who cleaned the crime scene?
- It...

71
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,910
Maybe someone will clean it up.

72
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,430
Don't you know that if
you carelessly touch a crime scene,

73
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:45,030
you will destroy
and destroy the evidence?

74
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,850
That's not my job.

75
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,510
I was also not on site
when the attack occurred.

76
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,510
Excuse me.

77
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,690
Yes,, sir

78
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,510
I have handed it over to the Vice President.

79
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,560
Not long after I entered the toilet,
I heard a groan.

80
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:11,520
I heard women moaning
in the men's restroom and I thought it was weird.

81
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,340
Then I went out to make sure.

82
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,910
Turns out there was a woman passed out
next to the toilet.

83
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,740
Things were bad, so I
immediately called 119.

84
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,160
How is the condition of the victim?

85
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,310
Looks like she's been abused.

86
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,390
Please explain more specifically.

87
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,100
There were many bruises on her face.

88
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,530
She seems to have had a little nosebleed too.

89
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,440
Her internal organs were ruptured and
her reproductive organs were badly injured.

90
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,570
When she arrived at the hospital, she had
been bleeding seriously.

91
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:45,790
A slight nosebleed does not cause
serious bleeding.

92
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm just saying what
I saw at the time.

93
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,210
Hey, Oh Ji-Hyeok!

94
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,390
I told you to wait
at the hospital until I arrive

95
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:02,060
Why didn't you pick up the phone?

96
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,770
I'm just doing the basic investigation
I should have done.

97
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:08,320
I can't pick up the phone because
I'm asking the reporter.

98
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,450
So you reported it?

99
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,120
Yes

100
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:17,120
Go out. Let me
continue the investigation.

101
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,460
Hurry out!

102
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:35,560
Because you are responsive to contact the police,
so the victim can be saved.

103
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,900
- Thank you.
- Team Leader.

104
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,500
- Yes?
- That detective,

105
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,520
he's unruly, isn't he?

106
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,960
Good afternoon.

107
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:01,620
- I am busy.
- Just a moment.

108
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,100
There are a few statements that don't fit,
so I'm here to make sure.

109
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:09,500
Why were you in the club at
the time of the incident?

110
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,850
Isn't it obvious why
someone is in a club?

111
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,120
So do you have an alibi?

112
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,470
I can't say.

113
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,200
He went to the club with me.

114
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,310
It happened while we
were drinking alcohol.

115
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:23,040
Is my explanation sufficient?

116
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,830
TJ Group's eldest daughter, Cheon Na-Na, married Prosecutor Woo Tae-Ho!

117
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,940
I know you're upset, but just hold
on for once.

118
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,450
Isn't this a family problem?

119
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,390
Family?

120
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,520
What does family really mean?

121
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,540
Feel this.

122
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:46,440
Feel it!

123
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,780
Feel this!

124
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:52,580
You die!

125
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:55,320
Why did you do that?

126
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,240
Are you okay?

127
00:11:06,190 --> 00:11:08,130
I'm Oh Ji-Hyeok,
from the Seoul Investigation Team.

128
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:14,080
If you are not comfortable talking, just answer
yes or no to my question.

129
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:19,510
Did you see the culprit's face?

130
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,940
Don't you remember at all?

131
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,090
Who owns the car?

132
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:41,170
Park Seong-Wook, representative the legal team of TJ Group.

133
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,860
I understand. Thank you

134
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:49,940
Hurry ,, follow me

135
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,030
Have you cleared everything up?

136
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,510
- Yes. He had confessed everything.
- Bring him here.

137
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,460
- Fast!
- Not me!

138
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,950
Fast!

139
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,450
He is my friend and informant.

140
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,980
So?

141
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:11,770
Doesn't that mean you two are familiar?

142
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:16,360
Hey.

143
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,910
Looks like you should be checked too.

144
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,870
<i>Oh Ji-Hyeok</i>

145
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,500
Please understand.

146
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,510
I can't do anything either.

147
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:31,160
The doctor gave me medicine
and confessed everything.

148
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:35,840
I'll take him
to the National Forensic Service myself.

149
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:39,120
to avoid people
messing around here.

150
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,170
Hey.

151
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,170
Why are you taking so much
medicine from the hospital?

152
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:50,030
You also received some
psychotropic drugs.

153
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:52,420
Why?

154
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,100
Can't you control
your mind now with just a small dose of medicine?

155
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,780
You seem to have
prepared a lot.

156
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:08,200
Don't waste time.
Hurry up and get your card out.

157
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,610
Let me see and I'll choose
what to do.

158
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,240
truce

159
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,100
Leave application

160
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,240
Please release my innocent informant .

168
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,210
He was transferred to another hospital

The Seoul Investigation Team really
received a lot of insults.

176
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:08,280
I heard there's a vacancy at headquarters.

Why should we?

-But it's profitable.

I just want to live a simple life while
catching the ginseng thief in Incheon.

184
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,230
The current direction of the investigation focuses on
the sexual tendencies of the perpetrators.

185
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:35,020
They are too fixated on
the available evidence and become misguided.

186
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,030
Don't touch it. That's not our realm.

187
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
The perpetrators are serial killers
who prefer,

188
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,870
killing rather than
committing sexual violence.

189
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,940
He continued to use
the same killing methods,

190
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,810
so there was a high possibility
that he was just showing off.

191
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,060
Hey, Oh Ji-Hyeok.

192

Lately I can't sleep
because of insomnia because of you.

193
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,010
If my life ends while chasing
the culprit, will you take responsibility?

194
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,120
The culprit will continue to kill,

00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,250
and the sacrifice will continue to increase.

196

to us. Take it easy.

- Where's Man-Gu?

203
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,420
His stomach hurts, so he defecates.

204
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:28,720
Why does he always pee
every time he comes to a crime scene?

205
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:30,170
What does he want to mark?

206
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,390
Stop it.

207
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,460
My goodness.

208
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:57,220
Can we really catch him
when it's this dark?

209
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,260
This is where we can collect
the entire ginseng field.

210
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,510
- I can not see.
- I can see it.

211
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,260
What do you mean you can see it
through binoculars?

212
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,670
These are infrared binoculars. I can
see it at night.

213
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:10,450
Where did you get that from?

214

Buy it.

215
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:15,420
So if we don't have money, we
can't catch the culprit? Irritating.

- Shall we catch him ?

Do not. We'll wait until he
's caught stealing.

and the dress are out,

316
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,670
all produced by
different companies.

317
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,110
- Then...
- What is the conclusion?

318
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,670
That means there's nothing to
pick up, right?

319
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,830
So what have you been doing all this time?

320
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:11,970
What do you guys already know?

321
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,430
That the culprit is conscientious
and intelligent? What else?

322
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,210
This is a case without a clear motive.

323
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,220
- It must take a long time...
- Never mind.

324
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,390
There's already no time
to waste!

325
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,200
Form a special investigative team
in each region.

326
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,320
Then work together in research.

327
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,510
Sir, expanding the investigation
will only distract from the focus.

328
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:39,220
- Better put together.
- What if it happens again?

329
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,320
It took a long time for
another crime to appear.

330
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,210
A moment...

331
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,680
On what basis?

332
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,140
The perpetrator even took into account

333
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:48,460
investigation period after
committing a crime.

334
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,960
He must have felt threatened that his identity
would be exposed in a situation like this.

335
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,270
He will stop for now.

336
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,480
Can you guarantee?

337
00:25:56,570 --> 00:25:59,840
I haven't slept in
pursuit of him for three months.

338
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:01,810
I can predict
that kind of tendency.

339
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:03,640
This case has grown.

340
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:06,520
The bigger the case,
the bigger your responsibility.

341
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:09,260
If we can't, no
one else can either.

342
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:15,200
Gosh, is this greed
or self-confidence?

343
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:16,360
Both of them.

344
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,330
My goodness.

345
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,400
I will
trust you again.

346
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:24,480
But only one week.
One week only!

347
00:26:31,930 --> 00:26:33,610
Hey, don't worry about it.

348
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,830
Just do as I command.

349
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,390
He's gonna get caught, got it?

350
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,000
- Yes, got it.
- Yes, got it.

351
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,460
Yes

352
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,170
What?

353
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:03,130
Wow, this idiot is crazy, yes.

354
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:05,760
Focus on times like this.

355
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,580
Don't be swayed by outside talk.

356
00:27:08,770 --> 00:27:10,640
Only we can
catch it. Understand?

357
00:27:10,690 --> 00:27:12,020
- Yes, got it.
- Yes, got it.

358
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,700
Once evidence emerges, immediately
request an emergency check.

359
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:18,050
Don't leave the location until
something is certain. Understand?

360
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:19,500
- Yes, got it.
- Yes, got it.

361
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,650
I'm a detective.

362
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,270
I'll show you later.

363
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,310
Halo.

364
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,600
I'm Woo Bong-Sik,
Head of Criminal Team Two,

365
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,490
from the West Incheon Office.
- Then?

366
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:41,140
This is our territory and
we receive the report first.

367
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,520
You don't bring a team,

368
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:44,710
- just because this is your territory, right?
- Certainly not.

369
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:47,780
- I told them to wait below.
- The research team is enough,

370
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:51,800
So wait in the west
until there is a request for cooperation.

371
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:53,620
You will only
mess up the investigation.

372
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,490
Hey, cow!

373
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,800
You didn't control
the location properly, did you?

374
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:02,560
The lowly humans so come
and leave unimportant traces.

375
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,920
<i>Let's handle location properly.</i>

376
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,020
How?
Have you checked the body?

377
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:18,200
It seemed like it had only been about three
days since his murder.

378
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,100
When do we catch
the thief?

379
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,780
- Three days ago.
- Well, then,

380
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:24,830
The thug Kim Hyeong-Bok
could be the serial killer.

381
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:28,960
Have you told the Investigation Team that
we caught the thief three days ago?

382
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh Ji-Hyeok.

383
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,900
You caught the thief
, right? What is he like?

384
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:38,040
If he killed someone,
wouldn't he want to run away?

385
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,120
- Who knows.
- Did you tell the Investigation Team?

386
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,010
They didn't give me a chance.

387
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,290
They look down on me,
what can I say?

388
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,590
So what if
he really is a serial killer?

389
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,210
- How will you endure it?
- Why am I the one in charge?

390
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,810
Why did you release the
arrested?

391
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:56,530
If we keep him in check, we've
caught the serial killer.

392
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,720
Is Kim Hyeong-Bok
still unreachable?

393
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:01,210
Yes, I can't.

394
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:03,830
The number is not registered.
Looks like he changed his phone.

395
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,230
Unlucky. At this rate,
it could get messy.

396
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,550
Let's go back first. This is not
something we can decide.

397
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:13,730
Well.

398
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,490
Have you found anything?

399
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,660
Looks like there's a fight
here.

400
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:35,160
There was also
a trail of falling down there.

401
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,590
Then there's this.

402
00:29:42,130 --> 00:29:46,150
Why is Criminal Team Two
like this again?

403
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,080
It's been quiet all this time, right?

404
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,620
Why do you want to trouble me so much?

405
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,890
You know the county office heads
should resign,

406
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:00,190
for releasing a
serial killer, right?

407
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,230
But isn't that case a little different?

408
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,740
Nor did he qualify
because of our fault.

409
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,590
Because there was a misunderstanding...

410
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,660
This isn't a mistake?

411
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:17,140
What if he is proven guilty and
you are asked the reason for letting him go?

412
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:21,990
You want to say it happened because
you were chased by wild boars?

413
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:24,630
Use another way.

414
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,550
Re-arrest Kim Hyeong-Bok.

415
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,900
Either way,
catch him.

416
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:35,190
If a member of the Investigation Team goes ahead of
you and catches that person...

417
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,010
Hello, Sim Dong-Wook.

418
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,060
- You're the youngest, right?
- Right, sir.

419
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:41,780
How long have
you been a cop?

420
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,330
- It's been three years.
- Isn't it unfair?

421
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,470
If you have to resign with me
who has worked for 25 years.

422
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,540
Very dirty.

423
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,790
Do-Chang, take a look at this.

424
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:25,220
Driver license 

425
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:30,510
Gosh, what mistake did
Hyeong-Bok make to have to be like this?

426
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,410
Did he make a big mistake?

427
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,090
If you know your son's phone number , please report it.

428
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,670
It might not be a problem
if we can get in touch with him.

429
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,600
If you hide it,
the problem can get bigger.

430
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:47,270
I do not know. If I knew,
I would have told you.

431
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:50,270
How about this?
This is not a knife for mountain climbing.

432
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,490
The thickness of the blade used in
the murder was as thin as a razor.

433
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,940
The National Forensic Service also
suspected it was some kind of <i>cutter</i>.

434
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,440
Even so,
let's take it first.

435
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:03,770
Hyeong-Bok killed someone?

436
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:08,100
- Oh, that's...
- No, no.

437
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:12,740
Hyeong-Bok is not that kind of person.

438
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,140
He couldn't even
kill an insect.

439
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:22,590
I know Hyeong-Bok
did a lot of bad things,

440
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,780
but he couldn't possibly
kill someone.

441
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,080
Wait for a while.

442
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:36,300
Hyeong-Bok was even active
in the church until the 3rd grade of middle school.

443
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,060
Good grief.

444
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:47,250
This. There must be a photo here.

445
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,770
Look at this.

446
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:50,810
Good grief.

447
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:52,750
Here he is.

448
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,520
There's a picture of him in the church, right?

449
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,890
He also prays before eating.

450
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:05,370
How could he do that?
He could be a big sinner.

451
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,130
Yes, it is true.

452
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,660
Can we take this photo?

453
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:21,300
Look at the photo album.
If someone shows up

454
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:23,290
more than twice,
immediately search and contact.

455
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:27,120
And disassemble the entire computer,
save if there is data that can be evidence.

456
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,750
Well. But it seems
better not to expect much.

457
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,530
- Why?
- He didn't even set a password.

458
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,280
If he is hiding something,
where could this delay be?

459
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:39,340
Don't jump to conclusions
and just give it a try.

460
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,910
You guys don't go and
try to investigate around here.

461
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:44,980
He's a native here,
so people must know him.

462
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,540
- Well.
- Dong-Wook.

463
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:49,100
You stay, because
he could come back.

464
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:50,170
Yes, fine.

465
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:55,080
Excuse me...

466
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,400
This.

467
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,550
- What's this?
- You've all worked hard,

00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:05,050
so don't
forget to fill your stomach.

469
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:11,060
This is from the oldest
and famous restaurant in the area.

470
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:14,090
Well,
I'll take it.

471
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:17,780
Please let us know when
Hyeong-Bok calls you.

472
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:19,660
Of course.

473
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,670
Detective.

474
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:32,100
Do you really think,

475
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:35,610
Hyeong-Bok killed someone?

476
00:34:36,870 --> 00:34:39,540
No, definitely not.

477
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:42,700
Right?
No, right?

478
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,020
You think so too, right?

479
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:56,380
What do you think is the probability that
Kim Hyeong-Bok is a serial killer?

480
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,750
We cannot rule it out.

481
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:04,380
Because there must be a reason he suddenly
changed his phone and went into hiding.

482
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:09,110
My hunch is not good. Looks like
this time will also be convoluted.

483
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,190
Like these donuts.

484
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,360
Is it good?

486
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,690
Right.

487
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:21,810
Hyeong-Bok recently
bought this at our shop.

488
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,780
- Oh I see. You know Kim Hyeong-Bok?
- Yes, because he's my junior.

489
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,700
Did he say his goal was to buy a motorbike?

490
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:32,370
I don't know, maybe
to deliver the goods.

491
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,470
It...

492
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:38,980
Even though there are people who buy
used motorbikes for money...

493
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,560
- Insurance scam?
- But he's never fixed it.

494
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:44,190
So I can't really tell.

495
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,550
Okay.

496
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,170
If you see him

497
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,770
- please just call.
- Oh, fine.

498
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,960
- Excuse me .
- Yes,you're welcome

499
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:01,330
According to the Mayor's Office, <i>CCTV</i>
has been requested by the Seoul Investigation Team.

500
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,850
He must have the real data, right?
Can't be duplicated?

501
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,980
Looks like they blocked it completely.

502
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,940
Area detectives can't enter
the location and can't see <i>CCTV</i>,

503
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,630
what are they?

504
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:14,900
Their careers are more important
than catching the perpetrators?

505
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:15,510
So?

506
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,690
Why are you mad at me?
Am I the Investigation Team?

507
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,590
Bastard.

508
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:24,680
- Hey, punk. How dare you.
- What's he talking about, anyway?

509
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,830
Hey, why are you like that?

510
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:34,970
This is <i>CCTV</i> footage near the site.
He points to the location.

511
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:37,410
- The license plate?
- Looks like it's going to be hard to figure it out.

512
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,400
Hey!

513
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:43,240
Don't say it's hard to see
with your eyes.

514
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:46,430
If your eyes can't, take
advantage of technology. Understand?

515
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:47,930
yes

516
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,040
Look for a shirt similar
to the one he's wearing.

517
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:54,800
Then compare the buttons
with the buttons from the location.

518
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:58,490
If the buttons are the same, he's the culprit.

519
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:03,070
This case is considered
immoral close relationship

520
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,060
between
capitalism and politics.

Please explain why I

It seems that some of our secrets have
been leaked to the outside.

536
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:21,520
It's my responsibility failing to
manage it properly.

537

I will find the culprit and make sure
this doesn't happen again.

Of course you have to believe.

Please hold on
until the second trial.

542
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:46,650
The evidence given by the prosecutor
this time is considered illegal.

543
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,830
I will prove it
and set you free.

544
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:57,210
If I continue to languish here,
who will like it the most?

00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:05,580
Why?
Too many?

546
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:11,660
Or is there something that comes to your mind,
but is difficult to answer?

Ayah.

548
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,080
I am a subordinate of the President.

549
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,340
But right now I don't
want to do that.

550
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,280
Right now I'm just,

Right now I'm not free enough
to think about who my enemy is.

553
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,780
Didn't think of anything.

554
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,820
This just feels heavy.

555
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,200
It's hard for me to
deal with this situation.

556
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,000
This is heavy.

557
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,080
On the day of the incident,
he was moving on his motorbike.

Shouldn't you just go home
and rest?

566
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,210
Not. I'm more uncomfortable at home.

567
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,900
I'll rest for a bit and then leave.

568
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,520
Can you go alone?

569
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:53,520
- Do you want me to accompany you?
- No need. Go.

570
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,800
Hello? Did you find out?

571
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:19,870
- Yes. I've been looking for it.
- Which side?

572
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,530
That is not the evidence
prosecutors obtained from the investigation.

573
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,110
It seemed the Blue House knew
but ignored it.

574
00:41:26,870 --> 00:41:29,510
That means someone
reported it to the Blue House.

575
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,490
Can you find out who reported it?

576
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,780
I've said all
I can reach.

her but his phone is off.

She was killed.

585
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,790
I also only found out this morning
after seeing the broadcast from the police.

586
00:42:18,850 --> 00:42:20,410
She was killed?

587
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:26,600
Yes According to the police,
this is the act of a serial killer.

588
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,920
- Chief Woo?
- Oh, yes.

589
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,710
In that case, okay.

590
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:38,020
In that case...

591
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,500
Call the police first,

592
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,510
but don't let them know
she's a member of our team.

593
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:49,110
The problem is that the media may relate it
to the Previous case.

594
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,110
- Please handle it well.
- Well. I have done it.

595

Well. Thank you very much.

pregnancy, so be careful.

597
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,720
I will think about it first.

598
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:15,110
What does that mean?

599
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,910
Is this something worth celebrating…

600
00:43:23,710 --> 00:43:27,560
Please remember well.
He brought this.

601
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,550
Have you ever seen him
deliver orders?

602
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:32,120
Who knows.
I've seen it before but...

603
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:36,280
When the food couriers arrive,
just ask them.

604
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,520
- They'll be here soon.
- In that case, okay.

608
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,960
- Can we be like this?
- What do you mean?

609
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,200
Isn't it the rule that we
have to contact...

610
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,220
Seoul Investigation Team and
investigate together?

611
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,680
- That's the rule.
- Is not it?

612
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:08,210
Then you call them,
then we just leave it to them.

613
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:12,410
Hey. If we hand it over to them,
and they catch him

614
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:14,710
achievement will be on them alone.

615
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:17,440
But if it fails,
we will also be in trouble.

616
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:20,890
- Do you still not understand the situation?
- Not.

617
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:23,720
This case is too big
for us to handle.

618
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:26,710
Big cases like this...

619
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:29,010
If we investigate on our own
and without involving other teams,

620
00:44:29,090 --> 00:44:31,550
Then we
caught the guy, and it turns out...

621
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,500
He is the culprit.
What do you think will happen?

622
00:44:35,350 --> 00:44:38,800
We'll get a promotion.
You still want to give it up?

623
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:42,710
Certainly not. Who would want to
turn this case over to them?

624
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,680
You said that.
You said that's the rule.

625
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:51,900
Think about it. They are the ones
who won't let us into the crime scene.

626
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,550
All the evidence at the crime scene they took.
They have no manners.

627
00:44:55,570 --> 00:44:56,950
Why do we have to obey the rules?

628
00:44:56,970 --> 00:44:59,010
You were the one who said
to hand over the case!

629
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,250
- Do you know your weakness?
- What's that?

630
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:05,220
You're obsessed with the past.
Forget it. Forget the past.

631
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:06,500
Welcome.

632
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,610
We're from the Seoul Investigation Team.

633
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,820
Oh, there...

634
00:45:13,490 --> 00:45:15,410
This is from the CCTV footage up front.

635
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,510
This person is seen coming
to this restaurant.

636
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:21,670
- Do you remember?
- Well...

637
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,730
This was taken three days ago, at six in the afternoon.

638
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,610
He came by motorbike
and ate here.

639
00:45:25,630 --> 00:45:28,610
It was a busy time for visitors.

640
00:45:28,790 --> 00:45:33,030
Wait. Why did the detectives
come together…

641
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:37,350
Hello. I'm Byung Ji-Woong
from the Incheon Police Criminal Team 2.

642
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:38,900
So what?

643
00:45:40,930 --> 00:45:45,310
Why did the Seoul Investigation Team
come to our area?

644
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,330
Are you looking for people?

645
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:49,120
Who's that? Who are you looking for?

646
00:45:49,190 --> 00:45:52,920
We can't
reveal it yet. Sorry.

647
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,380
Oh it's like that.

648
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:58,300
Could it be because of that case?

649
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,760
Ah, that case.
The white dress serial murder case?

650
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,850
- That's right.
- That's right.

651
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,390
You guys came to look for a suspect.

652
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:10,790
The Seoul Investigation Team always
snatches cases from other teams

653
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,120
and want to win alone.

654
00:46:15,080 --> 00:46:17,360
Did you manage to find the suspect?

655
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:19,530
I said goodbye because I had urgent
business.

656
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,190
- Show us the photo.
- Show me a second.

657
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,720
- Sorry we disturbed your meal.
- No, just show it for a second.

658
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,260
- Maybe it's someone I know.
- We just want to help.

659
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,260
We can help.

660
00:46:34,690 --> 00:46:36,560
Hello. Have you checked?

661
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,560
Kim Hyung-bok. The address?

662
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:40,620
It's close here.

663
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,500
Okay. We go first,
you guys follow there soon.

664
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:46,900
Good grief.

665
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,200
Oh yes, the photo.

666
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:50,090
Is the photo
they showed this person?

667
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:51,410
Yes that's right.

668
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:12,840
They really looked into it.

669
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,700
When you've seen it,
let's go immediately.

670
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:23,160
I would be in trouble if it was discovered that
there were other detectives besides the Investigation Team.

671
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,810
Hey! I'm the Criminal Team in this region…

672
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:31,420
That's enough. I'm done looking,
I'm leaving.

673
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:37,300
Sir, here.

674
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:46,210
This is where I
met Kim Hyung-Bok.

675
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:49,070
I'm sure there's a clue
about Kim Hyung-Bok here.

676
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:52,020
We have to catch Kim Hyung-Bok
with all the clues at hand.

677
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:57,830
How about Kim Hyung-Bok
kill over there,

678
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:00,190
will he run here
when someone is chasing?

679
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,600
If he could, wouldn't he run
as far from the crime scene as possible?

680
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:07,170
Wouldn't that be possible if
he didn't know the geography of this place?

681
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,340
Night and in the mountains.

682
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:11,920
The perpetrator did not leave
any traces at the previous crime scene.

683
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:16,410
Before the murder,
he must have investigated this place.

684
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:18,320
He is not one
to make mistakes.

685
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:22,500
Hello Jae-Hong.

686
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,870
Seoul Investigation Team is looking for Kim Hyeong-Bok.

687
00:48:27,270 --> 00:48:29,410
How did they find out
about Kim Hyeong-Bok?

688
00:48:29,570 --> 00:48:32,520
On the day of the incident, he left
the house at 4 pm

689
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:35,510
headed to the Chinese restaurant by motorbike
then went to the crime scene.

690
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:36,960
Have you checked the plate?

691
00:48:37,010 --> 00:48:38,800
Already. The owner is Kim Hyeong-Bok.

692
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:39,820
Have you called?

693
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,060
Can not. Looks like
he's wearing a fake number.

694
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:44,130
The house? You've
got the address, right?

695
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:46,620
We've been there.
But it turned out to have been searched.

696
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,220
- By whom?
- Incheon Police Criminal Team 2

697
00:48:50,590 --> 00:48:52,820
How did they find out
about Kim Hyeong-Bok?

698
00:48:54,410 --> 00:48:58,020
The Seoul Investigation Team
asked to cooperate.

699
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,100
Out of the blue?

700
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,000
Why now?

701
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,110
From the information of our men,
they are also after Kim Hyeong-Bok.

702
00:49:09,340 --> 00:49:12,520
Did they also know that we
caught him but he ran away?

703
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,310
They don't seem to know about it.

704
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:19,230
They only know
that we are also after Kim Hyeong-Bok.

705
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:23,010
Sorry for a moment.

706
00:49:25,690 --> 00:49:26,510
Halo?

707
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:32,810
Yes I am now at the Police Station.

708
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,200
Please wait a moment below.
I will be there soon.

709
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:42,300
This is the Head of the Investigation Team.
How about this?

710
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:43,610
What to do?

711
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:47,620
This is your job so
you are also responsible.

712
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:51,660
Yes If so… according to the facts.

713
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:53,480
Don't involve me.

714
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,320
You didn't report it to me and
you messed it up yourself.

715
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:59,630
Doesn't that make sense?

716
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:02,100
Serial murder
is a big case,

717
00:50:02,120 --> 00:50:04,220
but we didn't report it
to the Chief of Police,

718
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,870
- will they believe that?
- Make them believe.

719
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:11,940
The Seoul Investigation Team
is filled by the best detectives,

720
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,390
will they believe?

721
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:16,810
Do you want to drag me along and
ask me to die together?

722
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:18,890
Not.
We don't mean that.

723
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:23,120
Okay. In that case,
Criminal Team 2 only...

724
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,790
who will be
responsible and will be punished.

725
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,140
- Let's go.
- Hey, wait.

726
00:50:32,390 --> 00:50:35,400
Wish you a long life, Chief of Police.

727
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:39,010
Hey! Hey!
Your base...

728
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,650
Gosh. My goodness.

729
00:50:43,690 --> 00:50:47,630
How about this? Should we
blame Team 2?

730
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:50,660
- Do you want to blame me too?
- Not. There's no way I'd dare.

731
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,580
However, I'm a little
worried about...

732
00:50:54,610 --> 00:50:57,680
your image that
turns evil…

733
00:50:57,700 --> 00:50:59,010
You are…

734
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,500
You are the same as Kang Do-Chang.

735
00:51:03,470 --> 00:51:07,750
You discuss it yourself first.
I want to clear my head first.

736
00:51:07,780 --> 00:51:10,110
In that case, okay.

737
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,060
What did he say?

738
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,790
Let's just wait.
He wanted to clear his head.

739
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,740
- Good then.
- What is good about it?

740
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:27,260
Can you still trust him?
He would just wash his hands in the end.

741
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,130
Do you know his nickname before?
Lightning rod.

742
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:33,860
He wouldn't dodge the lightning.
It was the lightning that evaded him.

743
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:37,560
What business is there in the middle of the night?

744
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,710
We would like to apologize
for what happened at the crime scene some time ago.

745
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,610
As you know,
this is case sensitive.

746
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:48,460
So I feel
a huge burden.

747
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,890
I see.

748
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,520
The reason we are here,
maybe you already know…

749
00:51:53,570 --> 00:51:55,240
Hey, you! What are you doing?

750
00:51:55,310 --> 00:51:58,920
There are guests from Seoul,
you should serve them coffee.

751
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,080
Okay.

752
00:52:00,850 --> 00:52:04,180
- Would you like to drink something?
- Up to you.

753
00:52:04,200 --> 00:52:05,910
There's nothing up here.

754
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:10,010
There is only instant coffee.
If there is only one tea left.

755
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:12,510
So you two can't drink tea.

756
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,330
Then two coffees.

757
00:52:14,530 --> 00:52:20,320
Hey, be nice to him.
You have to look good if you want to be successful,

758
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:23,210
Who knows, you might
end up being selected to the Seoul Investigation Team.

759
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,900
Can being included in the Investigation Team
be considered a success?

760
00:52:25,950 --> 00:52:30,660
I might just be a subordinate there.
Just like an errand boy, right?

761
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:32,580
Oh, basic.

762
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:39,780
We recently saw
CCTV near the scene…

763
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,410
Ah, I remember something about CCTV.

764
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:45,110
Hey Byung Ji-Woong, didn't I
tell you to get the CCTV footage?

765
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:46,400
So there's a punk...

766
00:52:47,690 --> 00:52:53,210
I mean, there's a party blocking me
from being able to get CCTV footage.

767
00:52:53,260 --> 00:52:56,360
This is our case, you should be able
to get it any way.

768
00:52:56,390 --> 00:53:00,790
We can at least help them,
don't embarrass yourself.

769
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,710
We will help if
there is a source of information.

770
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:05,300
Our information is only from the media.

771
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,640
You guys find out. If the CCTV footage
is not available, look for the suspect.

772
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:13,510
If you can't enter the crime scene,
you break through and take your own photo.

773
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:16,610
That's very dangerous.
There are a lot of wild boars these days.

774
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,900
Why come to the wild boar?
Didn't get there.

775
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,110
Why are you guys chasing Kim Hyeong-Bok?

776
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,010
What do you want to know from him?

777
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,010
You are guests here.
Keep your manners.

778
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,090
Dogs just don't bark
in a stranger's yard.

779
00:53:33,870 --> 00:53:37,510
Detective Oh Ji-Hyeok who, huh?

780
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:38,590
I am.

781
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:41,370
Why did you find out about
Kim Hyeong-Bok on the day of the incident?

782
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:42,390
Because I need.

783
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,620
What's your reason?

784
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,510
Maybe you have something to hide.
In that case, okay.

785
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:51,320
I understand you guys want to catch the culprit
so you guys investigate it yourself.

786
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,900
But if you
ignore the rules,

787
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,270
then something goes wrong, what
are you going to do?

788
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:05,090
I won't beat around the bush.
Leave Kim Hyeong-Bok's file to us.

789
00:54:05,590 --> 00:54:08,110
I'll turn a blind eye to the
rules you've ignored.

790
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:11,610
I will not
hold you accountable. I promise.

791
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:13,250
She is coming. Attention!

792
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:15,230
Hey, Criminal Team 2.

793
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:17,630
What are you doing?

794
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,550
There's another call from Uncle.

795
00:54:20,990 --> 00:54:23,790
Hey, Kang Do-Chang.
You said you'd catch him soon?

796
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,010
- Sorry?
- That ginseng thief!

797
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:32,190
Ah, that, we're trying.

798
00:54:32,250 --> 00:54:33,790
You said you were
investigating a suspect?

799
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:37,310
You said Kim Hyeong-Bok
is the most suspicious?

800
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,410
So we searched
Kim Hyeong-Bok's house,

801
00:54:42,470 --> 00:54:44,710
There wasn't a single ginseng there.

802
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:47,710
So, you think so?

803
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,810
There are other suspects besides Kim Hyeong-Bok,

804
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:52,170
If there is progress
I will report immediately.

805
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,220
Make sure you catch him.

806
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,420
The victim of this theft
is my Uncle...

807
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:59,310
who paid for me to go to college
by selling ginseng.

808
00:54:59,390 --> 00:55:02,240
Catch him and
save my dignity.

809
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:03,690
Please, do you understand?

810
00:55:03,750 --> 00:55:05,220
Well.

811
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:10,610
Who are these people?

812
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,480
Good night. I'm Jang Ki-Jin,
Chief of the Seoul Investigation Team.

813
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:17,010
You must be very busy,
what business are you doing here?

814
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:20,720
They are looking for Kim Hyeong-Bok too.

815
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:26,560
Why? Is the Seoul Investigation Team
also looking for my uncle's ginseng thief?

816
00:55:42,870 --> 00:55:45,710
<i>Serial Murder Case</i>

817
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:30,150
- Sir!
- Try checking the CCTV.

818
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,610
The colors and designs are exactly the same.

819
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,110
I've been looking into
the manufacturer,

820
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,320
only they
have such a design.

821
00:56:44,380 --> 00:56:46,210
Give me a photo of the button
found at the crime scene.

822
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,490
Search for Kim Hyeong-Bok all over the country.

823
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,030
Oh, right there.

824
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,800
7332.

825
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:11,870
7332.

826
00:57:15,830 --> 00:57:17,390
This is different from the number listed.

827
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:22,530
Doesn't this license plate look brand new
compared to the condition of the motorcycle?

828
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:24,500
Could it be that he just
changed his license plate?

829
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,390
Impossible.

830
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:26,600
How can you be sure?

831
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:27,720
Kim Hyeong-bok…

832
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,650
- Are you the owner?
- Yes.

833
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:40,060
Kim Hyeong-Bok is not a smart person
who will change his number.

834
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:42,710
I think we have the same thoughts.

835
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:45,880
Don't judge someone too easily .

836
00:57:45,910 --> 00:57:50,520
There might be a demonic side
to Kim Hyeong-Bok that we don't know about.

837
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:53,770
Do you think that Kim Hyeong-Bok
is the serial killer?

838
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:54,910
I told you I don't know.

839
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:58,210
I'm not God, how can I
know what's on that person's mind.

840
00:58:13,140 --> 00:58:15,400
Sorry, we're not open yet.

841
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:19,530
Just make some ramen then.
I'm in a hurry about it.

842
00:58:19,590 --> 00:58:21,730
- Hello.
- Hello.

843
00:58:22,520 --> 00:58:24,420
Where is ramen at a chicken restaurant?

844
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,420
I'll pay.
I'll give you the price of one chicken.

845
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:33,920
- Thanks very much.
- Yes.

846
00:58:37,990 --> 00:58:41,410
- Should I fry the chicken?
- No need. No time to eat.

847
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,560
How is this? Shortly...

848
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:48,840
I can't see Detective Oh's handsome face .

849
00:58:49,820 --> 00:58:51,160
- Sorry?
- You don't know?

850
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:54,210
- You didn't say?
- Don't make it up.

851
00:58:54,260 --> 00:58:56,150
- No definite decision yet.
- What do you mean?

852
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:58,700
You said no more field work
after consulting?

853
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,890
Sis, go when it's set.

854
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:06,640
At your age, if you can't sleep
and drink all the time, you could die.

855
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,190
You've worked really hard.

856
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:13,140
You're enough of a detective for Korea.
Now it's time to stop.

857
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:16,440
Hey! Isn't it time to open?
Why not just fry the chicken there?

858
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,860
Don't even call Eun-Hye
if the restaurant is busy later.

859
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:25,890
Why do you care about Eun-Hye?
Think about yourself first.

860
00:59:28,270 --> 00:59:29,710
Welcome!

861
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:35,210
If you are sick, who will
take care of you? Eun-Hye and I won't.

862
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:38,930
What do you want to order?

863
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:43,880
- Hyung nim ,older brother...
- Don't talk.

864
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:46,110
I will take care of my business myself.

865
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,910
Incheon Police with Oh Ji-Hyeok.

866
00:59:53,090 --> 00:59:55,400
Yes
Oh, really?

867
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,620
When was the case reported?

868
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:02,310
The accident victim's
name is Kim Hyeong-Bok, right?

869
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,900
Then can you tell me
the hospital Kim Hyeong-Bok is being treated?

870
01:00:24,180 --> 01:00:25,620
Who did you get the call from?

871
01:00:25,850 --> 01:00:29,630
Insurance company. I called
first then told him the license plate.

872
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:31,870
I asked them to contact me in
case of an accident.

873
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,710
How do you know if
he's going to get into an accident?

874
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,330
You heard it too, right?

875
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:44,610
There are people who buy used goods
to steal and earn money,

876
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:46,030
Insurance scam?

877
01:00:46,710 --> 01:00:50,780
Weren't you on the phone at the time?

878
01:00:51,990 --> 01:00:53,770
We have two ears.

879
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,400
Now you like to show off more
with your body gestures.

880
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:03,500
You got the address, right?
Kim Hyeong-Bok over there, go quickly.

881
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:05,820
Oh, don't be.
What's your name? Min Ji?

882
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:06,940
Your name is beautiful too.

883
01:01:10,550 --> 01:01:13,080
- Hyeong-Bok, just a moment.
- That's it.

884
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:17,590
Step aside!

885
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,800
Hyeong-Bok! Hi! Hi!

886
