violence, and the risk of imitation.

6
00:00:23,323 --> 00:00:27,737
Do you remember the students who took the bus
around eight o'clock last night?

7
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,180
This is Seongwol-dong, right?

8
00:00:32,213 --> 00:00:33,260
Right.

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:35,485
Yes I remember.

10
00:00:35,565 --> 00:00:37,792
Because no one got into the bus there.

11
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:40,711
so i remember
she got off the bus alone.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,997
Do you...

13
00:00:43,551 --> 00:00:46,331
Remember the person who wore
bags like this in that stop?

14
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:49,473
I can't remember every
passenger's bag.

15
00:00:50,205 --> 00:00:52,340
So, is there a man who got off the bus alone,

16
00:00:52,365 --> 00:00:54,340
last night before this student dropped off?

17
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,890
I'm not sure about that.

18
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:01,430
Isn't checking the bus CCTV more accurate
than what I remember?

19
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:10,825
To be honest, there is no evidence that man,
the one carrying the bag is the killer.

20
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:15,206
Maybe he just happened to pee there
and the bag was caught off guard.

21
00:01:15,275 --> 00:01:19,607
Or maybe he was drunk,
and we are overreacting.

22
00:01:19,632 --> 00:01:20,366
Yes.

23
00:01:20,917 --> 00:01:22,904
Right. It could happen.

24
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:24,091
What? Hey!

25
00:01:24,832 --> 00:01:26,429
So all this time you
didnt think about it?

26
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:28,805
but was sure that the man with
the bag was the culprit?

27
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:31,160
When did I say I was sure of that?

28
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:34,092
This bastard.

29
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,307
How? Is there any sign of the perpetrator?

30
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:46,919
The culprit...

31
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,738
He was standing here, facing the bus stop

32
00:01:49,763 --> 00:01:51,778
waiting for the victim to go down.

33
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:55,659
Then he saw the headlights
and hid behind the wall.

34
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,316
If he steps aside
to avoid the bus,

35
00:01:59,528 --> 00:02:03,148
see a bus coming and can turn around to avoid the bus easily

36
00:02:05,569 --> 00:02:07,676
- Related?
- Maybe it could happen.

37
00:02:07,742 --> 00:02:09,516
How do you know this?

38
00:02:09,557 --> 00:02:11,210
Take a look at this.

39
00:02:11,446 --> 00:02:13,866
- This is outrageous.
- How can people do this?

40
00:02:14,101 --> 00:02:17,885
If a driver sees a passenger
carrying this bag, immediately call the police!

41
00:02:18,472 --> 00:02:20,448
- Passengers with bags.
- Isn't this a great idea?

42
00:02:20,948 --> 00:02:22,762
Criminal Team 2, Oh Ji-Hyeok

43
00:02:22,805 --> 00:02:25,513
- Checking the CCTV in the bus.
- Right.

44
00:02:26,257 --> 00:02:28,704
Last night you went to the crime scene
with the detectives, right?

45
00:02:28,901 --> 00:02:30,128
Right.

46
00:02:30,671 --> 00:02:34,817
Detective said you wanted to go
go there first, is that true?

47
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,370
- Yes that's right.
- In that case,

48
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:38,525
what's the reason you wanted to go there?

49
00:02:38,565 --> 00:02:40,319
My granddaughter died there.

50
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:42,728
I went there,

51
00:02:42,828 --> 00:02:45,148
to comfort her lonely soul.

52
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,240
But why that day,

53
00:02:48,335 --> 00:02:50,490
after quite a while since her murder?

54
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:51,794
Why suddenly?

55
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:55,944
was my granddaughter,

56
00:02:56,801 --> 00:03:00,694
lying there like
the woman I saw?

57
00:03:02,339 --> 00:03:04,899
Hee-Joo called me,
then I came and saw it.

58
00:03:05,642 --> 00:03:09,548
I wanted to see with my own eyes
how she died.

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:12,638
Sir.

60
00:03:12,994 --> 00:03:14,747
There might be a misunderstanding.

61
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:18,046
Now, we police see
this case, as a crime,

62
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:21,037
by a different person from
the one who killed your granddaughter.

63
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:23,442
What are you saying,

64
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:26,194
can you prove it?

65
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:28,205
The culprit in this case
will soon be arrested.

66
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:31,243
- That'll be proof, right?
- Right.

67
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:35,034
So, if you find
perpetrator of this case,

68
00:03:35,464 --> 00:03:37,384
make sure you call me.

69
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:40,617
There are many things I want to ask this person.

70
00:03:40,657 --> 00:03:41,710
Okay.

71
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:44,720
This is enough for today.
Thank you very much.

72
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,953
Okay.

73
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:49,490
Detective Park, please take him.

74
00:03:49,524 --> 00:03:50,937
No need.

75
00:03:51,498 --> 00:03:54,904
I'm not old enough to
get help from anyone.

76
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:56,681
I will go alone.

77
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:04,603
Team Leader,

78
00:04:04,645 --> 00:04:06,775
I just got an email
from the National Forensic Service.

79
00:04:06,809 --> 00:04:07,962
What's the result?

80
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,416
It...

81
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:12,015
What did they say, you punk?

82
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:14,370
with the previous case,

83
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,681
killing methods are almost 100% consistent.

84
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,740
They concluded that the culprit is the same.

85
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,002
This is really crazy!

86
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,161
Call them!

87
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,898
If they interfere
in investigation,

88
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:27,213
tell them to
come and investigate themselves

89
00:04:27,837 --> 00:04:30,850
What do those bastards know who only know about how to cut the corpse?

90
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,006
If anyone sees,
call the police immediately!

91
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:34,117
What does this mean?

92
00:04:35,913 --> 00:04:37,741
We've checked everything,

93
00:04:37,955 --> 00:04:40,295
This is not a photo taken from the bus CCTV.

94
00:04:40,893 --> 00:04:42,497
Where did this photo come from?

95
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:45,799
Hey, why did you put
your business card there?

96
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:48,205
It will be confusing to
those who have,

97
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,613
clear goals for investigation.

98
00:04:50,638 --> 00:04:54,221
Did you guys find anything
at the scene that day?

99
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:57,502
Didn't you find this
based on that?

100
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:00,028
What are the strengths of the Seoul Investigation Team?

101
00:05:00,193 --> 00:05:02,537
Didn't you come to find out
information from us?

102
00:05:02,577 --> 00:05:05,325
If you yell at us like this,
do you think we will tell you?

103
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,094
Hey! Are we here
to play around?

104
00:05:08,404 --> 00:05:11,057
We are now asking to
cooperate with the investigation.

105
00:05:11,082 --> 00:05:12,643
Then ask officially!

106
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,363
If not, please find out yourself.

107
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:16,870
Are you refusing to cooperate?

108
00:05:17,595 --> 00:05:19,561
Wouldn't that be
big problem later?

109
00:05:19,908 --> 00:05:21,021
Right?

110
00:05:21,095 --> 00:05:22,861
If so, we will have some conditions.

111
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:26,205
Provide all the serial murder case records
so far to us.

112
00:05:26,954 --> 00:05:29,207
After that, I will tell
source of this photo.

113
00:05:31,893 --> 00:05:33,933
Do you really want to catch the culprit?

114
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,013
- Right?
- To be honest,

115
00:05:37,866 --> 00:05:40,433
the murder happened
right before my eyes.

116
00:05:41,608 --> 00:05:43,543
I have to catch him
with my own hands.

117
00:05:43,725 --> 00:05:45,072
If I can't catch him,

118
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,427
I would be so embarrassed
as a detective.

119
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,850
So, that's the reason why
I want to catch the culprit.

120
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,084
But, to leak
case notes for now...

121
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,490
That's pretty messed up.

122
00:05:56,515 --> 00:05:59,642
I don't need all
the bad case notes you wrote.

123
00:05:59,762 --> 00:06:01,048
Only...

124
00:06:01,581 --> 00:06:05,106
Do not interfere with our investigation.

125
00:06:08,068 --> 00:06:10,904
Good grief. This is very nice.

126
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,507
What would happen if I didnt come to this shop?

127
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,561
But, what about the cost?

128
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,337
you believe in
this shop and buy it,

129
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:21,206
so of course I have to be
responsible till the end.

130
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:23,090
Forget about the cost.

131
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,650
Gosh, Only you can be like this.

132
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,537
Thank you very much.

133
00:06:28,665 --> 00:06:30,938
Well. You're welcome.

134
00:06:31,803 --> 00:06:33,230
You will live long, right?

135
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:38,099
- Yes, see you.
- Thank you.

136
00:06:38,265 --> 00:06:39,792
I will come back.

137
00:06:39,821 --> 00:06:41,114
- Well.
- See you again.

138
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,013
It's really hard to spot,
But is he really the culprit?

139
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,793
The spot and time are also unclear.

140
00:07:40,882 --> 00:07:43,490
To be honest, there is no definite reason
for the culprit to be the one with bag, right?

141
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,764
What did the Incheon West Office say?

142
00:07:44,864 --> 00:07:46,500
They said that he is the culprit.

143
00:07:46,532 --> 00:07:48,378
- They were sure like that.
- They're right.

144
00:07:48,534 --> 00:07:49,780
It's the bag from the perpetrator.

145
00:07:50,164 --> 00:07:53,093
For now, focus here.
That would narrow the investigation.

146
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:55,304
Limit investigation to people
around the victim, Park Seon-Mi.

147
00:07:55,329 --> 00:07:57,270
- Understand?
- Okay, got it.

148
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,516
Except for Park Seon-Mi's case,
this is from the first to the fourth case,

149
00:08:08,876 --> 00:08:12,049
In total there are 180 hours of CCTV along the route
that the victims went through.

150
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:14,990
On the day of the incident,
CCTV footage from around

151
00:08:15,015 --> 00:08:17,728
where the body was found
collected for 98 hours.

152
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:21,517
The total is 278 hours.

153
00:08:22,318 --> 00:08:25,045
How many days will it take
to see all this in 24 hours?

154
00:08:27,304 --> 00:08:28,624
More than 10 days.

155
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:30,897
Why can't you count them?
This is your area.

156
00:08:31,578 --> 00:08:34,681
One two three four five six.

157
00:08:35,036 --> 00:08:36,916
278 hours divided for 6 people.

158
00:08:37,249 --> 00:08:38,496
46 hours 20 minutes.

159
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:42,781
It was incredible.
But why does it suck?

160
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:45,002
After all, we need
less than two days per person.

161
00:08:45,027 --> 00:08:47,757
- Aren't you going to eat?
- You can see while you are eating 

162
00:08:48,144 --> 00:08:50,070
Isn't there a possibility
it's a fake crime,

163
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,020
as claimed
by the Seoul Investigation Team?

164
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:57,613
In general, dumping bodies at crime scenes
is a strange thing, isn't it?

165
00:08:57,638 --> 00:08:59,545
Let's focus on the case of Park Seon-Mi.

166
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:03,476
Right, it's a little ridiculous for
see the whole case.

167
00:09:03,514 --> 00:09:06,407
It's from people who believed
Kim Hyung-Bok is the culprit,

168
00:09:06,447 --> 00:09:09,294
we knew that
Kim Hyung-Bok wasn't the culprit, right?

169
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:13,659
However, we must
investigate everything from scratch.

170
00:09:13,895 --> 00:09:16,169
- I found it.
- What?

171
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:18,532
It's true, right?

172
00:09:18,557 --> 00:09:20,783
Right, it's the same. Thank you

173
00:09:20,945 --> 00:09:23,885
Check CCTV and find the bag,
The culprit will appear.

174
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,519
Rock Paper Scissors!

175
00:10:33,266 --> 00:10:34,493
Rock Paper Scissors!

176
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:36,299
Rock Paper Scissors!

177
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:27,895
Good morning everyone!

178
00:11:28,762 --> 00:11:30,495
Team Leader, are you here already?

179
00:11:30,596 --> 00:11:31,816
Great,

180
00:11:31,849 --> 00:11:33,356
You all are great.

181
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:06,672
Eat a lot!

182
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:09,748
Where did you get sashimi
what did you bring as evidence?

183
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:13,417
- Where did that come from?
- Where?

184
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:15,358
Search quickly.

185
00:12:15,611 --> 00:12:17,844
Here, no blood on this.

186
00:12:18,648 --> 00:12:20,448
- Unlucky!
- Good grief!

187
00:12:21,497 --> 00:12:23,864
In less than one week's time,

188
00:12:23,888 --> 00:12:26,624
a serial killer
who scared the whole nation,

189
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:29,536
Another murder case happened in
the same way.

190
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,062
The police saw it as
imitation of the previous case...

191
00:12:32,104 --> 00:12:33,823
This person is very good at making up stories.

192
00:12:33,894 --> 00:12:36,694
They should mobilize all the police force
to catch the culprit.

193
00:12:45,033 --> 00:12:47,653
Do you know what
what are they doing now?

194
00:12:47,963 --> 00:12:50,683
About that matter...

195
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:55,463
Seems like everyone is coming to office
because of some work.

196
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,569
They are on vacation
why do they have to come to work?

197
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,279
- Are they...
- I'll try to tell,

198
00:13:01,332 --> 00:13:03,178
them not to come to work.

199
00:13:03,269 --> 00:13:06,036
It doesn't have to be like that.

200
00:13:06,561 --> 00:13:08,395
- Just leave it.
- But still,

201
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:12,554
I'm afraid they will
make trouble for you.

202
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:16,288
Will they even listen to me
or to you?

203
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:19,467
Just let them do
what they want to do.

204
00:13:19,626 --> 00:13:21,900
Are you sure to
leave them like that?

205
00:13:21,929 --> 00:13:25,162
I gave up on them.
Let them do what they want.

206
00:13:25,187 --> 00:13:26,493
Fine, I understand.

207
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,823
One more,

208
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,846
I've spoken
with Chief Detective,

209
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,135
even after the holidays are over,

210
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,883
he said to not to give this case
to them for a while.

211
00:13:33,908 --> 00:13:35,728
- No problem?
- Why do you ask?

212
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:39,694
Tell them to catch the real culprit.
or better stop.

213
00:13:43,777 --> 00:13:46,491
I see.
I will tell them to do

214
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:51,567
according to what you ordered.

215
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,753
All boys
in this neighborhood recognize her, right?

216
00:14:30,573 --> 00:14:32,627
Don't be too focused
on the environment,

217
00:14:32,652 --> 00:14:35,726
but take a closer look at the factory, location
construction, and workers.

218
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,492
Right.

219
00:14:38,272 --> 00:14:39,852
- Okay.
- Team leader!

220
00:14:39,927 --> 00:14:41,073
Look at this.

221
00:14:56,863 --> 00:14:58,932
Almost nothing can
determine exactly.

222
00:14:59,212 --> 00:15:01,445
There were about 30 of the same bags appeared.

223
00:15:01,535 --> 00:15:04,859
Okay. Now all that's left is
just running on foot.

224
00:15:05,078 --> 00:15:06,479
Let's work even more!

225
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,386
- Well.
- All right, Chief.

226
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,226
We're wasting time for
two full days at the table,

227
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:14,794
at least let us go to the sauna and
give us time to warm up.

228
00:15:14,844 --> 00:15:17,497
Yes alright. Just do it then.

229
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:22,081
And being on vacation means
no investigation fees, right?

230
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,341
This is for going to the sauna.

231
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:31,347
And this is for the cost of the meal.

232
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,042
Buy food at the convenience store.

233
00:15:33,122 --> 00:15:34,835
- This...
- Good grief.

234
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,156
There are four people.

235
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:40,324
Return.

236
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:44,490
Hey, give me your wallet.

237
00:15:44,628 --> 00:15:46,424
I also have no cash.

238
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:47,591
Give it to me.

239
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,206
Let me.

240
00:15:53,521 --> 00:15:54,567
What are you?

241
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,227
- For me.
- Hey.

242
00:15:56,394 --> 00:15:57,573
You, the youngest.

243
00:15:57,827 --> 00:16:02,620
Others can't be trusted,
you save and use it as needed.

244
00:16:02,764 --> 00:16:04,364
Okay.

245
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:12,608
Trust this to me.
Detective Oh, what's the limit for this card?

246
00:16:12,682 --> 00:16:13,814
Limit?

247
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,050
Is there such a thing?

248
00:16:17,149 --> 00:16:20,762
I never heard
there is a limit on the card.

249
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:27,011
That sucks.

250
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,833
Young policeman, Country
believe in you. Spirit!

251
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,502
- Spirit!
- Spirit.

252
00:16:47,307 --> 00:16:49,407
He always talks about young cops.

253
00:16:49,449 --> 00:16:50,949
Please tell him,

254
00:16:50,974 --> 00:16:52,381
to stop talking like an old man.

255
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,146
He is very annoying.

256
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:55,271
Let's eat something!

257
00:16:55,406 --> 00:16:57,993
Your back must be sore.
Do you want to rest somewhere?

258
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,659
That's okay.

259
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,840
I'm more comfortable running outside
instead of sitting inside.

260
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,265
It means you can't
work indoors.

261
00:17:06,312 --> 00:17:08,417
I also do not know.

262
00:17:08,914 --> 00:17:10,914
When my body is comfortable, my heart isn't.

263
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,492
When my heart is comfortable, my body is not.

264
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,784
Oh Ji-Hyeok from Incheon Criminal Team.

265
00:17:18,561 --> 00:17:20,708
Right, I left
business card at the office.

266
00:17:23,097 --> 00:17:24,190
Really?

267
00:17:25,056 --> 00:17:27,383
I'll be there soon.
It won't be long.

268
00:17:27,912 --> 00:17:29,066
Well.

269
00:17:29,119 --> 00:17:30,639
- What is it?
- Bus driver.

270
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:32,113
He saw the black bag.

271
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:38,109
What would you do? Seon-Mi
asked Ji-Young to go on a blind date.

272
00:17:38,227 --> 00:17:40,140
- What? That's right?
- Yes.

273
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,814
Not that this was the first time for Ho-Jun.

274
00:17:42,189 --> 00:17:44,282
Already. Just forget it.

275
00:17:44,336 --> 00:17:46,062
Aren't you tired of one-sided love?

276
00:17:46,311 --> 00:17:47,447
It doesn't matter.

277
00:17:47,489 --> 00:17:50,484
No need to worry,
I will introduce to others.

278
00:17:53,203 --> 00:17:55,009
Are you Choi Ho-Jun
Biology major?

279
00:17:55,163 --> 00:17:56,356
Right.

280
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:57,982
You must come with us.

281
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,162
What's this?

282
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,350
Why are you doing this?

283
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,653
Seongwol-Dong, 819

284
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:18,644
Hello.

285
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,810
In Morning when I came to work,

286
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:27,944
I saw,
it's there.

287
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:30,913
I don't remember for sure,

288
00:18:31,019 --> 00:18:33,586
But I wanted to inform,
so I called you.

289
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:37,262
Do you remember that black bag?

290
00:18:37,954 --> 00:18:40,554
Actually, I didn't remember
what I saw

291
00:18:41,223 --> 00:18:43,081
But I suddenly remembered when
heard that girl,

292
00:18:43,105 --> 00:18:46,640
who got off at Seongwol-dong, died.

293
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:48,913
Were you the one running this bus?

294
00:18:49,153 --> 00:18:50,832
Yes, we do it alternately.

295
00:18:51,056 --> 00:18:54,649
So you see the passengers
who wears the bag while driving?

296
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:55,979
Right.

297
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:58,028
It's definitely not easy to
remember passengers,

298
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:01,015
with that bag, how
do you remember?

299
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:04,790
For that, I thought something needs to be done.

300
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,277
So, I remembered it.

301
00:19:06,318 --> 00:19:09,271
At that time, there were no other passengers
apart from those two.

302
00:19:10,492 --> 00:19:11,632
Two persons?

303
00:19:12,397 --> 00:19:13,549
Yes

304
00:19:15,369 --> 00:19:17,543
I'm going down. Don't follow me.

305
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:21,050
Hey, I've come this far.
Where should I go?

306
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,196
If my mother sees, I will die.

307
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,246
And why are you following me? Why?

308
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:28,035
You and I, we're not a couple.

309
00:19:28,072 --> 00:19:29,825
Let me take you home.

310
00:19:30,245 --> 00:19:33,585
- This street is dangerous.
- It's enough. Irritating.

311
00:19:33,825 --> 00:19:35,199
I already said it.

312
00:19:35,584 --> 00:19:39,363
You and I were only for limited time.
There is nothing between us.

313
00:19:52,767 --> 00:19:55,214
Sir, can you please
reopen the bus door?

314
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,004
Seon-Mi.

315
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:08,602
- Seon-Mi.
- Let go of my hand.

316
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:10,497
Because the street was very lonely,

317
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:11,740
- Get out of the way.
- Seon-Mi.

318
00:20:11,765 --> 00:20:15,558
I watched it to ensure
nothing happened to the girl.

319
00:20:21,336 --> 00:20:23,003
Right.

320
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,109
I'm certain. That's right, this is the bag.

321
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,975
We checked the black box of this bus,

322
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:32,076
but it doesn't seem to exist
any statement.

323
00:20:32,199 --> 00:20:36,106
Maybe it happened
about a month ago.

324
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,683
There may not be a record for it.

325
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,309
Did he make it better or worse?

326
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,013
Detective.

327
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:52,102
You're not going to suspect that kid
because of what I said,right?

328
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,066
We have to wait and see.

329
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:55,952
I'm just worried.

330
00:20:56,687 --> 00:20:58,713
The young boy looked
like a good boy.

331
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:03,004
I don't know if I made
the wrong person a suspect.

332
00:21:03,331 --> 00:21:05,362
Don't worry.
We will investigate thoroughly

333
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:07,744
thorough and ensure
it's not going to happen.

334
00:21:07,939 --> 00:21:10,579
Okay then.
It's time to go.

335
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:16,040
Can you come to testify?

336
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:19,354
When you have time, you
can come as a witness

337
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:22,229
and talk about it like
that you told us earlier.

338
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,193
If I have to,
I will come.

339
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:30,235
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

340
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,073
Dont we need to find the
motive first?

341
00:21:47,121 --> 00:21:49,941
It's Park Seon-Mi's phone , the person who was killed.

342
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,778
Explain why this is in your bag.

343
00:21:53,053 --> 00:21:54,919
I don't know.

344
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:57,007
- I really do not know.
- Hey!

345
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:59,436
If the bag owner doesn't know,
Who knows?

346
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,651
You mean her phone
in your own bag?

347
00:22:01,676 --> 00:22:03,116
I totally...

348
00:22:05,122 --> 00:22:08,662
Did Seon-Mi unintentionally
put her phone...

349
00:22:08,687 --> 00:22:09,740
Seriously.

350
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:13,583
The place where the phone was turned off is nearby
Seon-Mi's house,When she was kidnapped.

351
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,876
If it's you,

352
00:22:15,995 --> 00:22:18,648
you put it in
your bag before she was killed.

353
00:22:18,994 --> 00:22:22,646
to let us know that
You killed her before she died.

354
00:22:22,673 --> 00:22:23,713
Not me.

355
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,346
Why would I kill Seon-Mi?

356
00:22:25,775 --> 00:22:27,481
I like Seon-Mi.

357
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:29,973
I like her, why would I kill her?

358
00:22:29,998 --> 00:22:31,513
You like Seon-Mi,

359
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,046
doesn't Seon-Mi hate you?

360
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,542
You killed her
for not listening to you.

361
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,433
Not.

362
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:38,976
Not. I didn't kill her.

363
00:22:40,904 --> 00:22:43,770
I'm not the killer.
I didn't do it.

364
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,665
Mi Bong-San.

365
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,844
- What?
- Mi. bong. San.

366
00:22:52,271 --> 00:22:52,899
What?

367
00:22:52,972 --> 00:22:56,109
That's the name of the mountain place where
You killed Park Seon-Mi.

368
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,718
I don't know. I'm
first time hearing it, really.

369
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,483
Where did you hide the gun?

370
00:23:06,585 --> 00:23:08,222
What about the victim's belongings?

371
00:23:09,706 --> 00:23:12,492
You didn't do it alone, did you?

372
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,824
You must have a gang.

373
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:18,452
You guys must have made it to look like
white dress serial murder case.

374
00:23:19,434 --> 00:23:20,501
Is not it?

375
00:23:21,634 --> 00:23:23,270
Say something!

376
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:30,975
There is no point for
you to be quiet like this.

377
00:23:34,813 --> 00:23:38,514
Is he the one? What did he say?
Did he admit what he did?

378
00:23:38,817 --> 00:23:40,850
- No, not yet.
- I heard he said...

379
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,187
victim's cell phone was found out from his bag.

380
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:45,491
- Right, sir.
- If like this...

381
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:48,358
I think your words that
he is a copycat is true.

382
00:23:48,748 --> 00:23:50,508
We haven't confirmed it yet.

383
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,721
We have to check his alibi.

384
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:56,182
- And he does have a point.
- Let's finish quickly.

385
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,438
The media is increasingly making strange news.

386
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,941
Understand?
You can tell the truth.

387
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,922
- Okay, let's wait a little longer.
- Yes.

388
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,023
This bag.

389
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,006
- It's Ho-Jun's, right?
- Yes.

390
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:14,756
- Ho-Jun?
- Yes. Choi Ho-Jun, our major friend.

391
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,268
So, he was the friend
with Park Seon-Mi?

392
00:24:17,395 --> 00:24:18,196
Right.

393
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:21,186
Where is Choi Ho-Jun right now?
Can you contact him?

394
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:23,106
He's been taken away by other detectives.

395
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:31,126
Looks like they're from the Investigation Team.
Should we confirm it?

396
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:33,881
Right now let's trust the Investigation Team.

397
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:36,045
We just have to keep investigating.

398
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:50,390
What is this?

399
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:56,488
Sir! Sir, please stop the bus.

400
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,329
I will drop you
at the next stop.

401
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:03,570
What the hell. Quickly stop the bus.

402
00:25:04,796 --> 00:25:06,522
I've pressed the bell.

403
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:11,433
- Why do you keep driving?
- It's not a bus stop here. I can't.

404
00:25:11,850 --> 00:25:14,717
Sir, I pressed the bell earlier.

405
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:15,954
You pressed it when we were past the stop.

406
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:19,481
Looks like you're too late to see it.
Quickly put me down!

407
00:25:20,339 --> 00:25:22,998
Wait a little longer.
We are close to the next stop.

408
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,618
It's very far from my house.

409
00:25:28,327 --> 00:25:30,664
Sir! Quickly stop!

410
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:35,202
What?

411
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:38,895
What would you do
with that look of yours?

412
00:25:40,228 --> 00:25:45,028
I am very scared. Really scary.

413
00:25:47,146 --> 00:25:48,244
Stop.

414
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:52,653
Stop before I curse you.

415
00:25:54,019 --> 00:25:56,419
Seriously. Are you deaf?

416
00:25:57,022 --> 00:25:59,790
Quickly put me down!

417
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,985
Driver, let her get off. This is dangerous.

418
00:26:16,851 --> 00:26:17,724
Down.

419
00:26:20,913 --> 00:26:22,182
I'm not going down.

420
00:26:31,691 --> 00:26:34,574
- Get off
- You should have dropped me off earlier.

421
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,961
Continue.

422
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:40,935
Drop me off where I asked you to.

423
00:26:41,003 --> 00:26:42,990
Otherwise, I won't get off
even if I die.

424
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,925
Thank you sir.

425
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:29,825
What is it?

426
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:33,983
Do you want to sleep with me?

427
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,709
Don't be ignorant,

428
00:27:38,883 --> 00:27:41,193
live like that.

429
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,132
Crawl on the floor. All your life.

430
00:27:51,422 --> 00:27:54,168
Good grief. Young people know nothing.

431
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:57,008
Be patient, Mr. Driver.

432
00:28:08,222 --> 00:28:11,535
- I am leaving
- Take this.

433
00:28:12,157 --> 00:28:14,127
I just wrapped it with a simple side dish.

434
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:15,681
Understood, okay?

435
00:28:16,163 --> 00:28:19,141
I can't sleep well
because of you yesterday.

436
00:28:19,232 --> 00:28:23,012
I can buy lunch at the convenience store.

437
00:28:23,907 --> 00:28:25,160
Thank you

438
00:28:25,572 --> 00:28:28,991
Eun-Hye, I slept late last night. I will
come back immediately after brushing my teeth.

439
00:28:29,106 --> 00:28:30,599
- Wait a minute.
- No need.

440
00:28:30,742 --> 00:28:33,243
I can go alone.
There is still enough time until the exams starts

441
00:28:33,312 --> 00:28:36,964
- I'll take the bus.
- I can take you by car.

442
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,554
Please let me go alone.
It's more comfortable.

443
00:28:41,054 --> 00:28:44,554
Okay. You should go too, 
You're just making her feel bad.

444
00:28:44,618 --> 00:28:46,418
- Are you really going to be okay?
- Yes.

445
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:49,362
Remember what we talked about last time?

446
00:28:49,387 --> 00:28:52,985
Don't try too hard,
do to the best of your ability.

447
00:28:53,332 --> 00:28:54,925
You just have to go through it,

448
00:28:55,089 --> 00:28:56,373
So, eat comfortably.

449
00:28:57,236 --> 00:29:00,653
It's enough. Enough.
Aren't you nagging too much...

450
00:29:00,707 --> 00:29:03,792
- that's why she wants to go alone?
- Why are you telling me to shut up?

451
00:29:04,309 --> 00:29:06,312
Don't worry.
I will do well.

452
00:29:06,343 --> 00:29:08,663
- I'm pretty confident.
- Okay.

453
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:11,148
Eun Hye...

454
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:12,917
Thank you

455
00:29:22,628 --> 00:29:23,661
Lee Eun Hye.

456
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:29,100
- Are you really Lee Eun-Hye?
- Yes.

457
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,580
I'm Lee Eun-Hye.

458
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,236
Please let me go, sir.

459
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,082
Today is my exam.

460
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:49,184
I will finish my exam
and come back here. Please believe me.

461
00:29:49,251 --> 00:29:51,370
You ever been to police station previously?

462
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:53,100
- It...
- Your trick, right?

463
00:29:53,267 --> 00:29:55,307
You put the book
that you didn't read in the bag.

464
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:56,841
and Acted like a student who is reading
read it while walking.

465
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,267
- Jang Yu-Na, you...
- That's right.

466
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:04,838
She stole with me. But only I was
caught and she ran away.

467
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:08,872
Don't put on a innocent face.
It's useless here.

468
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:16,945
Do not accept other guest's reservation.
Someone will come at ten o'clock.

469
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:17,680
Okay ma'am.

470
00:30:19,334 --> 00:30:20,768
We'll just leave it until the afternoon.

471
00:30:20,917 --> 00:30:23,151
Think it like we are only accepting only
one customer today.

472
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,728
It won't be comfortable if someone is
passing by around her right?

473
00:30:25,918 --> 00:30:27,258
Fine, we'll do it.

474
00:30:28,556 --> 00:30:29,440
Good afternoon.

475
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:32,257
Sorry, we are
not taking anymore reservations today.

476
00:30:32,343 --> 00:30:37,304
Long time no see.
When did you come back from America?

477
00:30:37,655 --> 00:30:40,302
- Who are you?
- You don't remember me?

478
00:30:42,074 --> 00:30:43,210
Two years ago.

479
00:30:46,278 --> 00:30:49,632
Forgive me. I don't remember anything.

480
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,033
Looks like you got the wrong person.

481
00:30:54,453 --> 00:30:55,606
I'm a detective.

482
00:31:00,734 --> 00:31:01,800
You don't remember it?

483
00:31:07,108 --> 00:31:10,208
Did you see the culprit's face?

484
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:13,983
Please come with me.

485
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:23,880
Have you ever worked
in this field before?

486
00:31:24,408 --> 00:31:27,415
I am a
hairdresser from scratch. At that time...

487
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:32,865
I did a part time job
at night. It's enough?

488
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:36,799
You made a lot of money
from part time work, it seems.

489
00:31:37,232 --> 00:31:40,379
It's quite big especially in Gangnam area.

490
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:43,586
We got investment.

491
00:31:44,436 --> 00:31:46,934
I am the manager
but not the owner.

492
00:31:47,915 --> 00:31:50,449
The investigation was stopped because
You suddenly went to America.

493
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:51,850
Not stopped, but done.

494
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:52,937
Aren't you annoyed?

495
00:31:54,668 --> 00:31:55,701
I beg.

496
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:58,633
I've forgotten it.

497
00:32:00,263 --> 00:32:01,843
I don't want to remember it anymore.

498
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:05,120
This is a criminal case.

499
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:08,546
I have to continue the investigation
even if the victim doesn't want it.

500
00:32:10,844 --> 00:32:14,320
You received a call from TJ's secretary,

501
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,400
and went to the club then, right?

502
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:19,535
Vice chairman Cheon Sang-Woo was there .

503
00:32:22,274 --> 00:32:24,594
Madam, the customer has arrived.

504
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:26,143
All right, I'll be right there.

505
00:32:29,564 --> 00:32:32,265
I ask for help.
Don't come here anymore.

506
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:48,399
I'm Oh Jin-Hyeok from Seoul West Office.

507
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:50,426
Yes, Sir.

508
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:54,261
I know Eun-Hye.

509
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,578
- Is your hair okay?
- Seems fine.

510
00:32:57,995 --> 00:32:59,482
Then see you again.

511
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,290
He went to the club with me.

512
00:33:24,205 --> 00:33:25,318
He is handsome.

513
00:33:26,655 --> 00:33:27,302
Right?

514
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:29,607
I don't
forget people I've seen.

515
00:33:38,564 --> 00:33:39,197
Eun Hye.

516
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,507
Forgive me.

517
00:33:45,075 --> 00:33:47,015
No. You did well.

518
00:33:49,012 --> 00:33:52,352
You made the right decision to give
my contact to the detective.

519
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:05,115
Because Eun-Hye is close to the detective,
you thought it will be easy to be released.

520
00:34:05,382 --> 00:34:08,135
Then you thought to
be released with her.

521
00:34:10,403 --> 00:34:14,746
I'm just saying the facts.

522
00:34:15,253 --> 00:34:18,025
I'm close with Eun-Hye. We are Family.

523
00:34:19,086 --> 00:34:23,359
It means now you are involved with the detective's family.

524
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:28,476
Detectives have no power,
Can't exonerate the guilty.

525
00:34:28,938 --> 00:34:29,498
But...

526
00:34:32,807 --> 00:34:34,794
We won't let
someone who touched our family.

527
00:34:37,187 --> 00:34:38,681
You made a mistake.

528
00:34:41,777 --> 00:34:44,919
We just caught and talked
with a suspected gang,

529
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,094
We also...

530
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,812
Do you know Kang Do-Chang
from the Incheon West Office?

531
00:34:49,345 --> 00:34:51,092
Yes. I know him well.

532
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,322
Eun-Hye is his daughter.

533
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:54,270
Do-Chang isn't even married yet.

534
00:34:54,912 --> 00:34:57,532
Where is the child from?
Their names are also different.

535
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,862
He considers Eun-Hye as his daughter.

536
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,028
Eun-Hye's home address is his house.

537
00:35:03,802 --> 00:35:06,556
- I'll ask him directly.
- Wouldn't it be better not to?

538
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,626
You know his nature.

539
00:35:10,143 --> 00:35:12,463
He will run here
and screw everything up.

540
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:20,003
Still, if problems arise later...

541
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,054
I'm Oh Jin-Hyeok from the Criminal Team
Incheon West Office.

542
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:27,640
If Lee Eun-Hye is involved with a gang, I will arrest her and held responsible.

543
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:32,598
If Lee Eun-Hye runs away, I, Oh Ji Hyeok will take responsibility.

544
00:35:33,387 --> 00:35:36,506
I'll send you the sound recording.
Your number is 010, then?

545
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,563
8867...

546
00:35:46,611 --> 00:35:47,916
Why don't you ask?

547
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,951
It could be that I am in the gang.

548
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:57,688
I don't believe you,
but I believe in myself.

549
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,430
A detective's hunch.

550
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:05,092
You must have had a lot
dealing with bad people.

551
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:08,506
I'm a bad girl.

552
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:10,099
Really bad.

553
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,762
Can I change?

554
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,687
I want to change...

555
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:18,934
But it looks like I can't.

556
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:23,395
Because my past will
stop me from changing.

557
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:26,786
Do not be weak.

558
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:30,086
Don't be in a hurry to make
conclusion about your life,

559
00:36:30,714 --> 00:36:32,900
just because you went through
hard times.

560
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:35,826
You didn't make your past.

561
00:36:41,262 --> 00:36:43,428
This is not the bag we were looking for.

562
00:36:43,517 --> 00:36:46,281
He started to get suspicious when I tried
extract information from it,

563
00:36:46,368 --> 00:36:47,515
but this is what i got.

564
00:36:47,633 --> 00:36:50,393
I think I can
smell the culprit again.

565
00:36:50,418 --> 00:36:52,013
You have to go on vacation often.

566
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:56,093
I will give you a vacation,
if you catch the culprit.

567
00:36:56,781 --> 00:37:00,206
Team Leader. After being found out, this person
have a drug criminal record.

568
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:03,402
If we keep digging, they
will come out one after another.

569
00:37:03,457 --> 00:37:06,237
- Shall we try it?
- Should?

570
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:10,179
Is there any progress or not?

571
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:11,937
What's this?

572
00:37:12,697 --> 00:37:13,565
Belongs to the culprit?

573
00:37:13,766 --> 00:37:17,703
Oh, that. Different suspects...

574
00:37:18,503 --> 00:37:20,200
different from what the Chief wanted.

575
00:37:23,475 --> 00:37:26,316
Sir, but these kids are already
trying hard to catch the culprit.

576
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:28,285
Are you dwarves?

577
00:37:28,357 --> 00:37:30,597
If we open it properly,
maybe something big will come up.

578
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:33,618
- Who are you guys?
- Yes, Sir?

579
00:37:34,652 --> 00:37:37,189
We are Division Two Criminal Team
Incheon West Office.

580
00:37:37,245 --> 00:37:40,138
Right. Then, what do you think...

581
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:45,254
such a small person deserves to be
in Division Two at the Incheon West Office?

582
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:47,611
Yes I understand.

583
00:37:50,114 --> 00:37:51,534
Leave that person to the
Department of Drugs.

584
00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,548
- Why?
- We're not giving it up.

585
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:58,259
He's not on our level!

586
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:06,001
Gosh, my daughter. You called Dad?

587
00:38:08,386 --> 00:38:09,115
What?

588
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,508
Why suddenly resign?

589
00:38:14,886 --> 00:38:20,113
Hey, This is the company
that matches your skills.

590
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:24,746
You've had a hard time getting in too
to the big company.

591
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:28,742
Are you drunk?

592
00:38:30,074 --> 00:38:31,503
Hey, Bo-Kyung?

593
00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:38,513
She hasn't acted up like this in a long time,
what's up this time?

594
00:38:42,643 --> 00:38:44,809
The number you dial...

595
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:48,049
Anyway it seems
this will be a big problem.

596
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,600
It feels good.
You are definitely a customer here.

597
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,711
The atmosphere is good too.
It's Comfortable to talk.

598
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:15,069
I think your father-in-law should
be in prison for a little longer.

599
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,733
The mood of the leaders is not good.

600
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:22,752
It will have a big impact
on our economy.

601
00:39:22,869 --> 00:39:24,049
It's time to change.

602
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:28,038
Isn't it old fashion now?
to pass the business on to his children?

603
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:29,968
We have to change.

604
00:39:30,568 --> 00:39:31,402
But...

605
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,403
Why should it be like this?

606
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,636
Who do you think owns TJ?

607
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:42,331
TJ is one of
the most important part,

608
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,796
if you look at it from the point of view
of running the country.

609
00:39:45,139 --> 00:39:50,919
If TJ's owner is like that, that
would be a very big loss.

610
00:39:51,356 --> 00:39:56,184
The problem is, we have no right
stop the tyranny of the owner.

611
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,165
There is only one way to stop.

612
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:01,513
Restructure,

613
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,668
TJ's management.

614
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:11,311
The owner who talks to me is like
from the Blue House and McQueen group.

615
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,811
They are the ones who want to keep me here longer.

616
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:18,113
That would be a good reason
to take over TJ.

617
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:19,950
Blue House. McQueen.

618
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:23,319
Their desires are different, but they are
not on the same side as us.

619
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:28,726
It's about McQueen.

620
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:30,625
What would you do...

621
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:34,730
If you want to be a manager?
Wouldn't you be greedy?

622
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:38,268
That's impossible.

623
00:40:38,649 --> 00:40:42,416
But, TJ is something I raised
my entire life.

624
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:46,707
Compared to others, isn't it
you better do it?

625
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,547
Mr. Chairman.

626
00:40:50,114 --> 00:40:51,784
You still think there's no chance?

627
00:40:55,753 --> 00:40:58,346
McQueen is stronger than me right now.

628
00:40:58,628 --> 00:40:59,995
If you embrace it,

629
00:41:00,725 --> 00:41:02,392
You can take over TJ.

630
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,929
What kind of answer do you want?

631
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,065
Do I have to answer
"I can do it"?

632
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:11,501
There must be someone inside of us,

633
00:41:12,152 --> 00:41:16,019
who thought the same thing
with what I just said.

634
00:41:19,344 --> 00:41:20,478
Find the person.

635
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,614
If you don't find him...

636
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,067
the answer is you.

637
00:41:33,904 --> 00:41:34,936
What should we eat?

638
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:37,427
Whatever you like.
Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.

639
00:41:37,762 --> 00:41:39,162
- Thai food?
- Agree.

640
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,730
You remember Kao Jai Thai restaurant
at a New York highway?

641
00:41:43,203 --> 00:41:45,837
First time 
we meet in person was that place.

642
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:47,978
And also the last time.

643
00:41:48,773 --> 00:41:51,139
- Come on, I know a lot of Thai restaurants.
- Okay.

644
00:41:52,944 --> 00:41:53,866
Wait a moment.

645
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,481
Yes?

646
00:41:58,232 --> 00:42:00,433
Forgive me. I have an appointment today.

647
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,087
I'll call you when I have free time.

648
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,408
Well.

649
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:12,862
Your husband's voice is really nice to hear.

650
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:14,530
You fell in love because of his voice?

651
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,660
I'll have to make a call
Wait in the car.

652
00:42:18,998 --> 00:42:19,576
Of course.

653
00:42:27,945 --> 00:42:29,112
What are you doing there?

654
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,383
Watching you.

655
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,901
I'm going to the office
after dinner appointments.

656
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,888
I'll go ahead and wait for you.

657
00:42:58,876 --> 00:42:59,943
Find the person.

658
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:02,112
If you don't find him...

659
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,580
the answer is you.

660
00:43:16,872 --> 00:43:18,169
The number you dialed is inactive...

661
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,533
Is it me or you?

662
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:28,044
The number you dialed is inactive...

663
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:40,081
Chief, why are you here till now?

664
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,422
Chief?

665
00:43:47,266 --> 00:43:51,006
Please help me trace the
phone location for me, Bong Sik.

666
00:43:57,475 --> 00:43:58,350
The bag is same.

667
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,391
Good grief. When can we find him?

668
00:44:06,577 --> 00:44:07,411
Yes, Sir?

669
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,566
We can get to that location right away. We...

670
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,117
Fine, I understand.
Okay sir.

671
00:44:17,255 --> 00:44:20,388
The Team Leader asked us to
looking for Chief's daughter.

672
00:44:21,394 --> 00:44:25,042
- What nonsense is that?
- Just search. Maybe her phone is turned off.

673
00:44:25,402 --> 00:44:25,955
Good grief.

674
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:31,527
Why use detective to
look for his daughter? Are we his servants?

675
00:44:32,274 --> 00:44:33,657
- Yes.
- Hey.

676
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:37,300
Just ignore.
I suddenly felt annoying.

677
00:44:37,764 --> 00:44:39,464
Hey. This is the Chief's daughter.

678
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:49,485
Now where is she.

679
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:52,593
We have to find her.
It's been very dangerous lately.

680
00:44:54,592 --> 00:44:56,263
She looks like an artist.

681
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:00,033
- I don't want to go home!
- All right, all right.

682
00:45:00,067 --> 00:45:03,941
- I don't want to go home with you.
- Your father is getting worried.

683
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,480
Today I'm really not drunk.
I only...

684
00:45:06,804 --> 00:45:08,100
Just a moment...

685
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:09,576
Can you walk straight?

686
00:45:09,676 --> 00:45:11,364
- Just carry her.
- Cradle?

687
00:45:11,473 --> 00:45:14,543
- Okay, carry.
- One two three.

688
00:45:15,943 --> 00:45:17,005
Carry her.

689
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:19,935
I'm actually really angry right now.

690
00:45:19,974 --> 00:45:23,153
First let's go to Dong-Chang,
tell him to meet us at shop.

691
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:24,975
- Yes.
- I was the one who carried you.

692
00:45:25,158 --> 00:45:29,822
I found it.
Her current condition is not good.

693
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,310
I think Chief 
have to come here alone.

694
00:45:36,486 --> 00:45:38,791
- Thank you.
- Yes.

695
00:45:48,434 --> 00:45:50,103
- Is he your girlfriend?
- If only it were true.

696
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:52,017
- He's the chief's daughter.
- Oh Lord.

697
00:45:53,845 --> 00:45:55,736
She looks very much like her mother.

698
00:45:57,188 --> 00:46:01,028
- Hello, Chief?
- Yes, hello. Are you...

699
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,998
Hey, Bo-Kyung.

700
00:46:05,267 --> 00:46:08,064
- Father.
- What's wrong with you?

701
00:46:08,611 --> 00:46:11,017
Do you know
how worried I was?

702
00:46:11,181 --> 00:46:14,131
Who? Who's bothering you?

703
00:46:14,463 --> 00:46:17,275
Dad, what should I do?

704
00:46:17,314 --> 00:46:20,251
I know, don't you know
how hard I tried,

705
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,486
- to get into that company.
- Of course I know.

706
00:46:23,556 --> 00:46:26,884
I really regret it!

707
00:46:27,048 --> 00:46:30,775
Why should I work in the company,
who underestimated me like that?

708
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,616
What do they have better than me?

709
00:46:33,994 --> 00:46:37,782
No, doesn't everyone
make a mistake at first?

710
00:46:37,853 --> 00:46:41,009
is forgetting some numbers a big mistake?

711
00:46:42,119 --> 00:46:45,431
Dad, they said company
will be destroyed because of me.

712
00:46:46,798 --> 00:46:49,025
- Don't cry anymore.
- Said it would be ruined because of me.

713
00:46:49,103 --> 00:46:51,275
Don't cry, don't!

714
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,717
If the company is destroyed
just because you forgot some numbers,

715
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,697
don't work there. Why to
work in such a company?

716
00:46:59,752 --> 00:47:01,321
Stop, stop.
It doesn't matter.

717
00:47:01,478 --> 00:47:04,259
- Don't cry.
- Thank you dad.

718
00:47:04,291 --> 00:47:07,532
Only Father understands me.

719
00:47:07,661 --> 00:47:11,005
Thank you and Im sorry.

720
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:15,446
My son is also very lucky
because his face looks like mine.

721
00:47:15,509 --> 00:47:17,306
- Don't cry.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

722
00:47:17,377 --> 00:47:19,830
- Don't cry anymore.
- Forgive me.

723
00:47:20,134 --> 00:47:23,118
- Eun-Hee, did you get a call from Eun-Hye?
- There isn't any.

724
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:26,361
Where exactly is she this late?

725
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:28,072
What is wrong with her?

726
00:47:28,377 --> 00:47:31,282
The exam is over, she must be meeting
and playing with her friends.

727
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,588
She has been fighting hard.
Let her.

728
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:35,472
- Let her play.
- What is this?

729
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,959
What is this?

730
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:39,724
- Oh my God, my daughter.
- What is it?

731
00:47:40,091 --> 00:47:41,862
Chief?

732
00:47:45,051 --> 00:47:46,011
Sir?

733
00:47:47,277 --> 00:47:49,480
- Hello.
- Yes, hello. You came, apparently.

734
00:47:49,870 --> 00:47:51,004
Wait a moment.

735
00:47:52,665 --> 00:47:54,032
Who's this?

736
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:56,861
Apparently Bo-Kyung!

737
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,728
Yes, hello.

738
00:47:58,923 --> 00:48:00,931
You've grown up.

739
00:48:01,189 --> 00:48:02,775
Now you are more beautiful.

740
00:48:02,923 --> 00:48:04,525
- Is that true?
- Yes.

741
00:48:04,861 --> 00:48:06,611
Bo-Kyung, look at me.

742
00:48:06,687 --> 00:48:09,837
She is not a child anymore.

743
00:48:09,993 --> 00:48:11,634
Look at that look.

744
00:48:16,243 --> 00:48:17,056
Bo-Kyung.

745
00:48:18,483 --> 00:48:20,392
Rest at home today,

746
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:23,937
Tomorrow, let's talk to me
with a clear mind.

747
00:48:29,423 --> 00:48:32,383
Stop by the convenience store.
I have to Buy hangover pills.

748
00:48:32,596 --> 00:48:33,329
Well.

749
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:35,030
Father.

750
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,118
Are all detectives,

751
00:48:38,671 --> 00:48:40,321
handsome like that?

752
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:41,611
What?

753
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:46,093
- What are you talking about?
- I thought all detectives were like you dad.

754
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:48,695
Father.

755
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:52,520
Dad, if I leave the company,
I will be unemployed

756
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:54,824
can I come to your office sometimes?

757
00:48:54,964 --> 00:48:56,073
In fact,

758
00:48:56,214 --> 00:48:58,074
who do you mean handsome?
Who's he?

759
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:07,152
I have a hunch.

760
00:49:07,488 --> 00:49:11,152
This premonition fills my chest
like a tsunami.

761
00:49:11,254 --> 00:49:12,832
The chief's daughter, Bo-Kyung.

762
00:49:14,488 --> 00:49:15,839
Fell in love with me.

763
00:49:15,925 --> 00:49:17,714
What do you mean.
I don't think so.

764
00:49:17,761 --> 00:49:20,011
You are jealous?

765
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,050
That jealousy,

766
00:49:23,397 --> 00:49:25,600
can blind people.

767
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,504
You guys need to
pay more attention to me.

768
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:32,886
My father-in-law is Chief.

769
00:49:34,171 --> 00:49:38,312
Do-Chang, I think you should
stop giving him work.

770
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:41,730
- His ability has disappeared.
- Have a drink and go home quickly.

771
00:49:42,049 --> 00:49:43,173
Eun-Hee.

772
00:49:43,621 --> 00:49:46,222
- Can you try contacting Eun-Hye?
- Already.

773
00:49:46,511 --> 00:49:48,339
The signal is bad so
she didn't pick it up.

774
00:49:48,919 --> 00:49:51,191
is she crazy?

775
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:54,261
Is it okay to get along
with a stranger just because,

776
00:49:54,328 --> 00:49:55,429
the exam is over?

777
00:49:55,472 --> 00:49:57,418
It's not like that, don't worry.

778
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,125
Yoo-Na.

779
00:50:25,879 --> 00:50:27,464
Why did you do that to me?

780
00:50:27,574 --> 00:50:30,558
You're the one who brought me in
to save your father, right?

781
00:50:31,061 --> 00:50:32,099
Did you forget?

782
00:50:33,792 --> 00:50:36,136
I will drag you to the end.

783
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,824
You're not going anywhere.

784
00:50:39,003 --> 00:50:41,408
Why only I have to live
in this world like a beggar?

785
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,394
You have to feel it too.

786
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:45,212
Aren't we on the same side?

787
00:50:48,885 --> 00:50:49,925
Noona.

788
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:51,318
Noona

789
00:50:51,415 --> 00:50:52,488
Sis Eun-Hye.

790
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:55,582
Where are you going sister?

791
00:50:56,347 --> 00:50:58,668
No, big sister seems to be just
a little lost.

792
00:50:59,043 --> 00:50:59,831
Come on.

793
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,261
Hey, Oh Ji-Hyeok.

794
00:51:02,215 --> 00:51:05,152
- Try tracking Eun-Hye's cell phone whereabouts.
- That seems like an exaggeration.

795
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:09,433
The chairman also tracked the location of his daughter's cell phone
why can't i do it?

796
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:12,331
Eun-Hye is also my daughter. my daughter,
the most valuable of all.

797
00:51:17,516 --> 00:51:19,480
Eun-Hye, why were you
not picking up the phone?

798
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:21,449
Forgive me.

799
00:51:22,738 --> 00:51:24,089
Did your exam go well?

800
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,730
- It...
- She said the exam went well.

801
00:51:27,785 --> 00:51:29,256
She just messaged me.

802
00:51:29,433 --> 00:51:30,730
What?

803
00:51:30,832 --> 00:51:33,636
Who are you to Eun-Hye to
message you?

804
00:51:34,199 --> 00:51:36,894
Who are you to step on me
to receive a message from Eun-Hye?

805
00:51:36,925 --> 00:51:39,699
Even so for Eun-Hye,
I'm more comfortable than you.

806
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,368
Isn't that right, Eun-Hye?

807
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,882
So, on that day you drank
alcohol alone in your room?

808
00:51:57,363 --> 00:52:00,300
This is the most common excuse,
people without an alibi give

809
00:52:00,457 --> 00:52:01,730
That's right.

810
00:52:02,908 --> 00:52:03,941
Please believe me.

811
00:52:04,609 --> 00:52:06,535
Ho-Jun. Choi Ho-Jun.

812
00:52:07,127 --> 00:52:10,197
Let's solve this in a way
good for each other.

813
00:52:10,827 --> 00:52:11,730
Well.

814
00:52:11,983 --> 00:52:13,333
You have no plans.

815
00:52:13,558 --> 00:52:15,714
Due to the influence of alcohol,
you got angry and killed her.

816
00:52:15,754 --> 00:52:18,620
After killing her, you disguised yourself
as a serial killer.

817
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:22,418
In conclusion, this case is
unintentional infringement.

818
00:52:24,644 --> 00:52:29,418
No, anyone can see that
This case is a planned case.

819
00:52:30,043 --> 00:52:32,894
However, I don't see it that way.

820
00:52:34,312 --> 00:52:35,339
But...

821
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,574
The police see it as
unintentional crime,

822
00:52:39,394 --> 00:52:41,925
or premeditated crime,

823
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:44,627
is a difference like
between heaven and earth.

824
00:52:49,536 --> 00:52:50,833
I will do it.

825
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,073
How?

826
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:55,135
Just like that...

827
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,847
As the detective said,

828
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,428
I will say
that I did it.

829
00:53:03,988 --> 00:53:05,332
That's how it's done, right?

830
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:07,220
So,

831
00:53:08,277 --> 00:53:10,082
please stop.

832
00:53:10,883 --> 00:53:11,692
Please.

833
00:53:11,723 --> 00:53:14,323
First, we will report to the prosecutor's office for the indictment.

834
00:53:14,491 --> 00:53:16,317
- I think we've done it all.
- Once again.

835
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,001
Let's make sure one more time.

836
00:53:21,684 --> 00:53:23,577
Yes, I think I will be
a little late today.

837
00:53:24,104 --> 00:53:26,479
Yesterday I drank and left the car
on the scene.

838
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,675
Not. I haven't left yet.

839
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,652
I think I should take the bus.

840
00:53:32,652 --> 00:53:34,988
Fine, I'll go
after taking the bus.

841
00:53:35,983 --> 00:53:37,021
Violation Report

842
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:45,644
Seonghyununsu.

843
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:08,715
Born June 21, 1996, 25 years old.

844
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,283
Violation Report

845
00:54:20,876 --> 00:54:22,048
Not going down?

846
00:54:22,533 --> 00:54:24,533
Sorry, Mr. Driver.

847
00:54:24,695 --> 00:54:27,234
I pressed the wrong button.
I'll go down later.

848
00:54:27,269 --> 00:54:28,361
- Forgive me.
- Okay.

849
00:54:40,553 --> 00:54:41,431
Attention everyone.

850
00:54:43,283 --> 00:54:46,377
- Dong-Wook hasn't come yet?
- He took the bus. Coming soon.

851
00:54:47,556 --> 00:54:49,822
Today the official holiday has ended.

852
00:54:50,095 --> 00:54:53,447
As you know, Chief has
really high hopes on us.

853
00:54:54,066 --> 00:54:55,635
Let's keep going
our way.

854
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,454
He gave me a lot of money
for investigation.

855
00:54:57,564 --> 00:55:00,689
But if we can not catch him,

856
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:02,368
won't our performance value go down?

857
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,048
Do you feel unfair
the drug criminals you caught,

858
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:06,313
handed over to the Department of Drugs?

859
00:55:06,403 --> 00:55:08,976
- That is...
- The Chief has already told me.

860
00:55:09,148 --> 00:55:11,961
He will write your name
in the report.

861
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:13,415
Wow.

862
00:55:13,610 --> 00:55:16,416
Sir, our chief is indeed extraordinary.

863
00:55:17,103 --> 00:55:20,228
It seems all this time I've been
misunderstood him.

864
00:55:20,253 --> 00:55:22,590
The more we get to know him,
he really is a good person, right?

865
00:55:22,728 --> 00:55:24,713
Why did you suddenly become
Chief's fan?

866
00:55:24,791 --> 00:55:26,411
Is it time
to think about promotions?

867
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:28,529
You can judge people...

868
00:55:28,791 --> 00:55:31,103
by seeing their child.

869
00:55:31,128 --> 00:55:33,486
Chief really
raised her daughter well.

870
00:55:33,556 --> 00:55:35,814
His daughter really...

871
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:37,311
Oh!

872
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:38,912
Good morning sir.

873
00:55:41,486 --> 00:55:42,320
Aren't you?

874
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,846
- Yes?
- You carried my daughter from the bar, right?

875
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,415
Right sir. Why?

876
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,219
What's handsome
with this face?

877
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:54,424
Even though your face is like
grilled anchovy head.

878
00:55:54,484 --> 00:55:56,356
Did your daughter say
that I...

879
00:55:56,447 --> 00:55:58,533
You! I'm warning you!

880
00:55:59,385 --> 00:56:02,635
From now on you have to
keep a distance of 100 meters from my daughter.

881
00:56:02,877 --> 00:56:07,632
Otherwise, I will tear
your face that looks like a grilled anchovy.

882
00:56:08,836 --> 00:56:10,578
You should also keep an eye on this one.

883
00:56:10,650 --> 00:56:14,001
Don't let him get close to Bo-Kyung
even if only for a moment!

884
00:56:14,095 --> 00:56:15,118
Good.

885
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:19,713
Why should you, in between
the nonsense of this loser?

886
00:56:19,916 --> 00:56:21,048
Unlucky!

887
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,400
Isn't he also a loser?

888
00:56:26,116 --> 00:56:27,354
Gosh.

889
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:29,070
Yes, I have calculated it.
She must have fallen in love with me.

890
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,511
Most importantly,

891
00:56:30,753 --> 00:56:32,972
Bo-Kyung fell in love with my face.

892
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:37,698
He must be crazy.

893
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:39,120
Is he crazy?

894
00:56:39,196 --> 00:56:41,635
Giving his child who works
in a big company to a guy like you?

895
00:56:41,691 --> 00:56:42,514
Large companies?

896
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,440
Can you enter a big company
because of that beauty? What company is that?

897
00:56:46,673 --> 00:56:47,517
TJ.

898
00:56:49,206 --> 00:56:52,112
How much annual salary does he earn
if working at TJ?

899
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:57,519
Headquarters.

900
00:56:58,876 --> 00:57:00,854
Suddenly I was assigned
to TJ's headquarters.

901
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:03,127
Im very surprised!

902
00:57:04,292 --> 00:57:06,552
Of course. However,
this is the head office.

903
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:09,429
Moreover, this is the best division
there.

904
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,542
Why will I Stop working here?
Am I crazy?

905
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:16,336
Okay.

906
00:57:16,797 --> 00:57:17,980
I understand.

907
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:19,597
I love you dad.

908
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,509
Do you like your seat?

909
00:57:23,674 --> 00:57:25,646
Of course, sir.

910
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:29,949
In the future, we will
need your help.

911
00:57:30,050 --> 00:57:31,495
Please cooperate.

912
00:57:31,589 --> 00:57:32,127
Well.

913
00:57:38,592 --> 00:57:40,327
Seongwon-dong Department

914
00:57:41,581 --> 00:57:43,378
I said, I'm here
not to play.

915
00:57:43,464 --> 00:57:45,777
I have something to get.

916
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:48,836
It will be finished in an hour.

917
00:57:49,499 --> 00:57:51,705
I'll explain later.

918
00:57:52,715 --> 00:57:53,659
And also,

919
00:57:53,774 --> 00:57:56,548
until I come, order
everyone to stay in the office.

920
00:57:56,698 --> 00:57:58,979
I found something
which is really important.

921
00:58:03,503 --> 00:58:05,644
Violation Report

922
00:58:20,134 --> 00:58:21,470
Where is this?

923
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:23,704
Why did you bring me here?

924
00:58:23,737 --> 00:58:25,070
Don't pretend you don't know.

925
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:27,710
Isn't this the place where you
left Park Seon-Mi's body?

926
00:58:27,832 --> 00:58:30,219
No, no.
I don't want to go.

927
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,112
Because the body is gone.
You just need to check it out.

928
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,194
I don't want to go.
Don't want to.

929
00:58:36,084 --> 00:58:37,718
I don't want to go.

930
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:41,088
I'm not going to Park Seon-Mi.

931
00:58:41,509 --> 00:58:42,489
Hey.

932
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:43,824
Get up!

933
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:47,160
This is the procedure!
You gotta go there, you bastard!

934
00:58:47,290 --> 00:58:48,744
- Hey!
- I don't want to go.

935
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,406
Hey, look over here.

936
00:59:12,015 --> 00:59:13,854
- Take him back.
- What?

937
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:16,578
I said take him back!
He's not the culprit!

938
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:18,367
I said take him back!
You bastards!

939
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:19,817
Unlucky!

940
00:59:23,994 --> 00:59:27,501
These three triangular shapes are
location of the crime scene

941
00:59:27,585 --> 00:59:30,509
Then the blue one is
This is where we found the owner of the bag,

942
00:59:30,534 --> 00:59:32,472
by identifying
movement of each victim.

943
00:59:32,539 --> 00:59:34,413
Here are the victims
mostly work.

944
00:59:34,528 --> 00:59:35,798
Then the black one

945
00:59:35,879 --> 00:59:38,066
this is the neighborhood of
every victim.

946
00:59:38,140 --> 00:59:39,202
Then this is...

947
00:59:39,246 --> 00:59:42,043
centre of the map.

948
00:59:42,446 --> 00:59:43,884
At a glance,

949
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:47,154
it seems like there's no relationship
apart from being geographically close, right?

950
00:59:47,484 --> 00:59:50,406
But the bus I took all day,

951
00:59:50,996 --> 00:59:52,609
I will try to draw the bus route.

952
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,896
My bus departure point is here.

953
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:57,754
Seojin District

954
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,370
Fifth. Park Seon Mi.

955
01:00:05,072 --> 01:00:06,228
Third. Choi Yoo Na.

956
01:00:06,910 --> 01:00:08,254
Second. Jung Hye-Jin.

957
01:00:10,277 --> 01:00:11,714
First. Kang So-Gyeong.

958
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:21,455
Except for the stop near
the house of the fourth victim, Jung Hee-Ju.

959
01:00:22,686 --> 01:00:25,100
Everyone is connected.

960
01:00:30,393 --> 01:00:33,066
How did you find out?

961
01:00:33,133 --> 01:00:36,641
As Brother Do-Chang said,
You only know when you chase it.

962
01:00:36,746 --> 01:00:38,519
What did I say,

963
01:00:38,572 --> 01:00:42,246
if you listen to me,
sure you can do it.

964
01:00:42,649 --> 01:00:43,529
But,

965
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:47,004
why only one
who can't connect?

966
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:48,996
It seems because...

967
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:51,530
I think, she used a different means of transportation.

968
01:00:51,615 --> 01:00:55,255
So, the perpetrator did
most of the crimes

969
01:00:55,482 --> 01:00:56,949
while on this bus.

970
01:00:56,988 --> 01:00:59,691
But didn't we already check
all CCTV buses?

971
01:01:07,501 --> 01:01:11,399
You could say the criminal did
crime while riding the bus.

972
01:01:11,454 --> 01:01:13,954
He rides the bus all day.

973
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:18,712
Then shouldn't there be someone
that stands out in the bus CCTV?

974
01:01:19,197 --> 01:01:20,876
Maybe he doesn't stand out.

975
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:25,586
Someone who doesn't
attract the attention of others,

976
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,956
even though he was caught by CCTV
all day.

977
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:32,514
He is a bus driver.

978
01:01:34,344 --> 01:01:36,688
Seongwon-dong Department

979
01:02:10,594 --> 01:02:12,599
This is a black box
which I kept just in case.

980
01:02:12,996 --> 01:02:14,368
Is this really the bus?

981
01:02:14,682 --> 01:02:15,729
Yes, right.

982
01:02:16,299 --> 01:02:18,805
This was taken at place where the bodies were dumped.

983
01:02:18,914 --> 01:02:21,930
This is a really far away place
from the bus route earlier, right?

984
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:25,730
The perpetrator loaded the victim onto the bus.

985
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:28,148
then left the body.

986
01:02:28,321 --> 01:02:31,461
It's a city bus, so no cctv while passing by there.

987
01:03:17,211 --> 01:03:19,816
Two units on the way
over there now.

988
01:03:20,109 --> 01:03:23,515
One of them is only three stops away
before the last stop,

989
01:03:23,586 --> 01:03:25,071
so will be here soon.

990
01:03:25,618 --> 01:03:28,407
No time. We
will check both the buses which will come here.

991
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:30,829
You guys check the locatiom of buses running.

992
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:31,907
Well.

993
01:03:32,012 --> 01:03:33,512
But,

994
01:03:34,044 --> 01:03:36,121
there is a bus that suddenly broke down
while driving,

995
01:03:36,602 --> 01:03:38,547
and must be repaired.

996
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:41,688
Who is the bus driver?

997
01:03:55,031 --> 01:03:56,637
You guys go that way!

998
01:03:56,837 --> 01:04:00,196
Ji-Hyeok and I will go that way.

999
01:04:00,290 --> 01:04:02,102
You have to be careful! Understand?

1000
01:04:02,572 --> 01:04:03,338
- Well.
- Well.

1001
01:04:46,116 --> 01:04:46,761
Ready?

1002
01:05:24,124 --> 01:05:26,523
You still don't have a name, do you?

1003
01:05:58,273 --> 01:06:01,295
But why did you send
useless people?

1004
01:06:01,428 --> 01:06:04,584
- Save me!
- I'm looking at all the possible scenarios.

1005
01:06:04,640 --> 01:06:07,630
- Don't forget to add this one.
- This bastard can be against...

1006
01:06:07,768 --> 01:06:10,194
Is he really the culprit
that you can't secure?

1007
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:11,963
- He became the fifth offender.
- Please stop it.

1008
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:15,142
Aren't you guys like
leave food while eating?

1009
01:06:15,194 --> 01:06:18,985
- Did you catch the culprit?
- You think you can trick me?

1010
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:22,327
I can do anything to get what I want.

1011
01:06:22,382 --> 01:06:25,961
I think you keep on
just following Jung Hee-Joo's case.

1012
01:06:26,119 --> 01:06:30,213
Breathe slowly,
it's time to take it slow.
