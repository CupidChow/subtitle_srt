6
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:23,164
Ouch!

7
00:00:24,547 --> 00:00:27,703
He's in pain, Did you
sedate him properly?

8
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,031
I have given local anesthetic.

9
00:00:29,056 --> 00:00:30,516
Hey, don't overdo it.

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:31,867
The doctor said you were sedated.

11
00:00:31,892 --> 00:00:34,023
I just got stabbed with a knife,
which may not hurt!

12
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:36,016
The anesthetic is working fine.

13
00:00:36,041 --> 00:00:37,375
You won't feel sick.

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,211
I'm really in pain.

15
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:42,078
It felt like my colon had burst.

16
00:00:42,103 --> 00:00:43,925
Sis, don't you dare to defecate.

17
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,480
Is that so? Ah, yes it is possible.

18
00:00:46,505 --> 00:00:48,198
Ouch.

19
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:51,448
Ji Man-Goo, are you all right?

20
00:00:51,473 --> 00:00:53,815
It's a little sore, but I'm okay.

21
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,042
- Is he really okay?
- None of the organs were damaged.

22
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:57,527
He just lost
enough blood.

23
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,589
If it's sewn,
there will be no problem.

24
00:00:59,614 --> 00:01:00,745
Good luck.

25
00:01:01,073 --> 00:01:04,847
- What about Ji-Woong?
- His face is swollen from being hit,

26
00:01:05,652 --> 00:01:07,714
Patient Byun Ji-Woong
looks like it has to be operated on.

27
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,386
The results of the MRI scan are out.
and there is bleeding in the brain.

28
00:01:10,425 --> 00:01:12,292
- What?
- What?

29
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:16,925
How about Man-Goo?

30
00:01:16,964 --> 00:01:19,058
Man-Goo is fine,
he is fine.

31
00:01:19,433 --> 00:01:21,019
He's like that because of me.

32
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,354
Even though I told him to leave.

33
00:01:23,659 --> 00:01:25,534
Poor Man-Goo. Man-Goo.

34
00:01:25,613 --> 00:01:27,933
Man-Goo is fine,
you don't worry about anything.

35
00:01:28,253 --> 00:01:29,573
Think of yourself first.

36

00:01:32,872 --> 00:01:34,159
Man-Goo.

38
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,917
You can't die, Man-Goo.

39
00:01:38,128 --> 00:01:39,386
You have to live.

40
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:42,425
You have to live, Man-Goo.

42
00:01:48,269 --> 00:01:49,784
You have to live, Man-Goo.

43
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:53,386
Do not go.

You took us for granted because we are not west incheon team?

50
00:02:23,488 --> 00:02:25,363
Lets skip the formality.

51
00:02:25,388 --> 00:02:27,738
Lets come to the main point.

52
00:02:28,214 --> 00:02:29,808
You killed Jo Sang-Pil, right?

53
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,300
No.

54
00:02:32,503 --> 00:02:35,823
If there is another investigation,
won't it bother us both?

55
00:02:35,848 --> 00:02:37,144
The guy who killed the boss,

56
00:02:37,894 --> 00:02:39,925
is a guy from the Rotary Gang.

57
00:02:40,191 --> 00:02:42,855
Do I have to give up
this case to the Incheon office?

58
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,160
I'm sure they will be very
excited, otherwise...

59
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:46,472
Should I let you go?

60
00:02:46,497 --> 00:02:49,378
I'm sure the Gangnam Gang will come after you.

61
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,519
How?

62
00:02:53,003 --> 00:02:54,370

63

- I'm Choi Sang-Ho.

64
00:02:58,347 --> 00:03:00,667

4 years.

Wait,

72
00:03:29,839 --> 00:03:32,706
Why would you protect someone like that?

73
00:03:33,534 --> 00:03:36,417
That person has
something on us, TJ.

74
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:38,230
What's that?

75
00:03:38,255 --> 00:03:40,152
Is the sentence more than 4 years?

76
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:43,472
He has something to do with
with my boss in the group.

77
00:03:43,497 --> 00:03:45,382
If it's spread out, I'll be in trouble.

78
00:03:45,407 --> 00:03:46,875
What do you mean related?

79
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,281
is it a crime
like murder?

80
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:50,742
Not that heavy.

81
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,711
Okay.

82
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:54,398
I will investigate.

83
00:03:54,423 --> 00:03:55,602
But if for example...

84
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:59,408
If the problem is more
serious than i thought,

85
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:01,875
I will be forced to run
obligations as a police officer.

86
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,203
I hope you understand that.

87
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:20,758
What is your reason?

88
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,250
It's a choice,

89
00:04:23,275 --> 00:04:25,039
which I have to take for the sake of the family.

90
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,391
What did Tae-Ho say he would do?

91
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:29,516
McQueen Headquarters,

92
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,719
has appointed Tae-Ho
as successor manager.

93
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:33,195
It's just their deal.

94
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,086
Team Leader Woo also planned against Sang-woo.

95
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:39,281
CEO of McQueen Korea
is my college friend.

96
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:41,102
Through my friend,

97
00:04:41,313 --> 00:04:44,047
I knew that Tae-Ho did
dark deals with McQueen.

98
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:45,164
Then?

99
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:50,063
You want to say that you and
Tae-Ho has nothing to do?

100
00:04:50,088 --> 00:04:51,758
You said it, right?

101
00:04:52,398 --> 00:04:53,883
TJ Group's next leader,

102
00:04:53,908 --> 00:04:55,188
is brother.

103
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,633
If brother is arrested too,
TJ will have no future.

104
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:01,258
future of TJ,

105
00:05:01,906 --> 00:05:03,250
is my future too.

106
00:05:04,116 --> 00:05:05,476
For my future,

107
00:05:06,391 --> 00:05:08,250
I decided
to divorce him.

108
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,789
What do you think, without you,

109
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,804
Tae-Ho wont be able to
do anything?

110
00:05:14,859 --> 00:05:16,750
I still love that person.

111
00:05:19,172 --> 00:05:20,516
Even if it's only for a moment,

112
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:24,070
I only can
follow the person's movements.

113
00:05:24,836 --> 00:05:25,922
Forgive me.

114
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:27,625
I am really, really sorry.

115
00:05:30,008 --> 00:05:31,156
It hurts.

116
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,766
That choice was painful.

117
00:05:40,117 --> 00:05:41,883
But I do not want to,

118
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:44,570
lose father and
brother because of that person.

119
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,460
That person, knows our weakness...

120
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:52,406
since we started from the bottom.

121
00:05:52,563 --> 00:05:54,136
Even if we break
relationship with him,

122
00:05:55,281 --> 00:05:57,492
he is not a person who
we should take for granted.

123
00:05:57,671 --> 00:06:00,015
Because I
let go of the man's hand,

124
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:02,930
Because without me, that person,

125
00:06:04,468 --> 00:06:05,601
He is nothing.

126
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,445
It was a choice I had to make.

127
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:14,289
I had to aim at you.

128
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:17,328
That way, they will be
little careless about us.

129
00:06:17,648 --> 00:06:20,102
Shouldn't you have talked about
this with me, even once?

130
00:06:20,127 --> 00:06:22,906
It was just a media interview
which has no legal force.

131
00:06:22,931 --> 00:06:24,688
It can be changed at any time.

132
00:06:25,133 --> 00:06:27,633
Means you don't care about
my feelings?

133
00:06:29,163 --> 00:06:31,906
- Can you be confident?
- What?

134
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,563
I've called the reporters.

135
00:06:39,588 --> 00:06:41,258
Please do a separate interview.

136
00:06:41,727 --> 00:06:44,078
You have to look like a 
selfish trash.

137
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:46,179
Only then,

138
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:48,391
their side will
stop suspecting us.

139
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:51,256
What is the reason I have to do that?

140
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,812
Because I won't
ever leave you.

141
00:06:53,837 --> 00:06:55,460
Not you.

142
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,906
Have you never thought
that I can leave you?

143
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,117
That's not allowed.

144
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,531
In that case, it will mean that I lost to
That woman who is nothing, right?

145
00:07:12,249 --> 00:07:13,617
Don't be like that, I beg you.

146
00:07:24,838 --> 00:07:28,462
We're still not divorced
legally under the law.

147
00:07:28,822 --> 00:07:30,533
Of course my mistake was big.

148
00:07:31,205 --> 00:07:33,283
But it was not the reason for divorce.

149
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,877
I will try hard,

150
00:07:37,252 --> 00:07:38,744
in order to reach an agreement.

151
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:42,033
What would you do
if no agreement is reached?

152
00:07:43,236 --> 00:07:45,244
It's hard to answer that now.

153
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:48,127
Are you going to claim divorce alimony?

154
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,838
That's also hard to answer right now.

155
00:07:51,814 --> 00:07:53,041

<i>What about property matters?</i>

163
00:08:15,173 --> 00:08:17,025
She even left her husband.

00:08:19,314 --> 00:08:20,494
Very typical Na-Na.

00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,947
It was very unlike of him.

167
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,653
We've already stopped the bleeding in the brain, and the blood pressure is stable.

168
00:08:35,759 --> 00:08:38,059
We have to still wait for other test results to come,

169
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,114
but the operation went smoothly.

170
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:43,130
Doc, will there be any side effects?

171
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:44,692
I can't answer for sure.

172
00:08:44,763 --> 00:08:48,575
Because no matter how light the operation
brain, it can interfere with the nerves.

173
00:08:49,588 --> 00:08:51,192
The anesthetic will wear off soon.

174
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:54,489
If the patient feels
sick, just call the sisters.

175
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:57,810
Oh, yes. You have worked hard.

176
00:08:57,835 --> 00:08:59,755
Thank you

177
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:03,656
He'll be fine, right?

178
00:09:03,681 --> 00:09:05,060
This Ji-Woong,

179
00:09:05,085 --> 00:09:08,458
always fine all this time,
no matter how hard he hit.

180
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:10,700
he will be fine.

181
00:09:10,725 --> 00:09:14,247
Although not physically, still
there may be mental side effects.

182
00:09:14,272 --> 00:09:15,341
Right.

183
00:09:15,817 --> 00:09:17,317
Gosh, brother Ji-Woong.

184
00:09:17,342 --> 00:09:18,817
Even though he looks like this,

185
00:09:18,842 --> 00:09:20,677
but mentally not very strong.

186
00:09:21,356 --> 00:09:22,958
There must be a mental effect.

187
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:26,575
Hey, can a detective be affected
mentally because of something like this?

188
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,850
This child's brain is too simple,
so that can't happen.

189
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:34,155
No matter how simple the brain is,
there must be some trauma, right?

190
00:09:36,092 --> 00:09:38,561
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- Just...

191
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:40,209
Man-Goo.

192
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,717
- Man-Goo.
- Hey, are you awake?

193
00:09:43,092 --> 00:09:44,217
Are you in pain?

194
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:45,663
How about Man-Goo?

195
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,288
Man Goo?

196
00:09:47,491 --> 00:09:49,420
Man-Goo is fine.

197
00:09:50,452 --> 00:09:51,780
Dont lie.

198
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,428
You're lying
so I can calm down, right?

199
00:09:56,349 --> 00:09:58,013
Man-Goo is dead, right?

200
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:01,106
Man-Goo is dead, right?

201
00:10:02,794 --> 00:10:05,247
Why did Man-Goo have to die?

202
00:10:05,575 --> 00:10:08,809
He is only slightly injured. The wound is
already stitched, he's fine.

203
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,372
- Not.
- What?

204
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:12,231
Do not lie.

205
00:10:12,896 --> 00:10:15,528
Man-Goo is dead, right?

206
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:19,458
Man-Goo.

207
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:24,708
- Man-Goo.
- Brother!

208
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,853
I'm fine.

209
00:10:32,314 --> 00:10:33,556
Man-Goo.

210
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:37,142
You're not a ghost, are you?

211
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,619
I'm not the only one who can see him right?

212
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,814
I was the one stabbed by the knife,

213
00:10:44,939 --> 00:10:48,010
why are you even lying there?

214
00:10:48,035 --> 00:10:49,471
Here you are.

215
00:10:49,496 --> 00:10:51,338
Come here!

216
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:53,028
Hurry up here.

217
00:10:57,049 --> 00:10:58,369
You're Man-Goo, right?

218
00:10:58,394 --> 00:10:59,744
You're not a ghost, are you?

219
00:10:59,769 --> 00:11:01,517
What ghost?

220
00:11:02,573 --> 00:11:04,080
Come to your senses.

221
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:07,017
Forgive me.

222
00:11:07,986 --> 00:11:10,541
You're like this because of me.

223
00:11:11,408 --> 00:11:13,728
I'm really sorry, Man-Goo.

224
00:11:13,753 --> 00:11:15,674
Why are you like this bro?

225
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:19,204
You are injured more badly than me.

226
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:25,118
I'm only hurt
a little in the belly here.

227
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:28,892
No, it's still my fault.

228
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:33,135
It is my fault. Because of
me, you are like this.

229
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,072
From now on I will
do whatever you tell.

230
00:11:36,853 --> 00:11:40,721
If you tell me to come, I will.
If you tell me to shut up, I'll shut up.

231
00:11:40,947 --> 00:11:42,596
I'm guilty.

232
00:11:42,621 --> 00:11:44,588
Why do you keep blaming yourself?

233
00:11:44,972 --> 00:11:48,534
You have a hole in your head.

234
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:51,183
You must be sicker than me.

235
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,339
Why do you keep saying it's your fault?

236
00:11:53,364 --> 00:11:56,145
Please don't do that.

237
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:00,527
Thank you for being
still alive, Man-Goo.

238
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:07,871
Do we, have to
cry with them?

239
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:12,746
I really feel
sorry for them so...

240
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:14,738
but they are cute.

241
00:12:15,339 --> 00:12:18,058
This is detective friendship.

242
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,722
Not something to laugh at.

243
00:12:22,111 --> 00:12:23,587
- Man-Goo.
- Yes?

244
00:12:24,103 --> 00:12:25,431
You don't get sick, okay?

245
00:12:25,993 --> 00:12:27,236
If you're sick,

246
00:12:28,563 --> 00:12:29,860
I will be sicker.

247
00:12:34,071 --> 00:12:36,984
brother, you don't get sick alone.

248
00:12:37,806 --> 00:12:38,993
We're sick together, huh.

249
00:12:40,914 --> 00:12:42,094
Yes

250
00:12:42,431 --> 00:12:44,228
God, I will go crazy.

251
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,234
Good grief.

252
00:12:54,688 --> 00:12:57,313
This must be their mental side effect.

253
00:12:57,439 --> 00:12:59,931
We should
catch that damn Ki Dong-Jae.

254
00:12:59,956 --> 00:13:02,689
He made our team members injured
Why was he handed over to the Investigation Team?

255
00:13:02,714 --> 00:13:04,736
The Investigation Team handcuffed them.

256
00:13:04,761 --> 00:13:06,337
We have no reason to take him.

257
00:13:06,362 --> 00:13:08,696
They did that on purpose
so we can't investigate it.

258
00:13:08,721 --> 00:13:11,517
But the point is Ki Dong-Jae
is arrested, right?

259
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,900
We can take it
when they're done.

260
00:13:13,925 --> 00:13:16,439
They won't let go.
Ki Dong-Jae would also refuse.

261
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,962
Prosecutors will not issue
additional arrest warrant either.

262
00:13:19,087 --> 00:13:20,759
I don't understand court matters.

263
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:23,337
I will go and
take him, even if by force.

264
00:13:23,362 --> 00:13:25,595
- I won't let...
- I'm going too.

265
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,111
Hey, hey. Wait.

266
00:13:27,407 --> 00:13:30,228
Have you ever faced
Team Leader Jang Ki-Jin?

267
00:13:30,337 --> 00:13:32,462
Indeed, if we make a fuss,
will he follow us?

268
00:13:32,487 --> 00:13:33,751
But this is embarrassing.

269
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:36,111
Our team member got stabbed, and
one have brain surgery.

270
00:13:36,143 --> 00:13:37,033
Hey.

271
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,470
Team Leader Oh was right.

272
00:13:39,495 --> 00:13:43,462
We're talking anyway, Jang Ki-Jin
he won't listen to us.

273
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:47,712
We know him better than
you guys, we will try.

274
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,946
You take care of those who are hurt.

275
00:13:49,971 --> 00:13:51,000
Let's go.

276
00:13:51,134 --> 00:13:54,329
Hey, are you sure you can
deal with it with that trait of yours?

277
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,884
You will magnify the problem.

278
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,915
Of course I can.

279
00:13:58,173 --> 00:13:59,086
Let's go.

280
00:14:00,126 --> 00:14:02,556
Gosh, you bastard!

281
00:14:03,751 --> 00:14:04,796
You damn bastards!

282
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:07,493
How dare you!

283
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,872
How dare you attack
my team members? You bastard!

284
00:14:11,587 --> 00:14:12,829
You will die!

285
00:14:13,962 --> 00:14:15,118
Ki Dong Jae!

286
00:14:15,143 --> 00:14:16,478
Ki Dong Jae!

287
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,142
Ki Dong Jae! You bastard!

288
00:14:18,476 --> 00:14:19,406
shit!

289
00:14:19,454 --> 00:14:21,329
I will destroy everything!

290
00:14:25,062 --> 00:14:26,101
Ki Dong Jae!

291
00:14:26,173 --> 00:14:29,017
You will pay for this for the rest of your life!

292
00:14:29,095 --> 00:14:31,970
Damn it! You bastard!

293
00:14:32,387 --> 00:14:34,481
I will destroy you!

294
00:14:34,809 --> 00:14:35,791
shit!

295
00:14:35,816 --> 00:14:37,793
wait for your death! You bastard!

296
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:43,801
Ah, it's all a mess!

297
00:14:54,616 --> 00:14:55,757
It's done, come on.

298
00:14:55,782 --> 00:14:56,882
Well.

299
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,085
I will take revenge.

300
00:15:00,819 --> 00:15:02,218
Just relax.

301
00:15:02,428 --> 00:15:03,888
What would you do?

302
00:15:03,913 --> 00:15:05,577
I'll punch a hole in his head,

303
00:15:05,602 --> 00:15:07,929
I will do the same to him.

304
00:15:11,413 --> 00:15:12,741
In fact,

305
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:15,358
what is the reason you arrested Ki Dong-Jae?

306
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:18,580
If the charges are the same
with us, you,

307
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,968
can hand over Ki
Dong-Jae to us.

308
00:15:20,993 --> 00:15:22,280
Tell me your demands first.

309
00:15:22,787 --> 00:15:23,928
Why are you after him?

310
00:15:23,953 --> 00:15:26,919
You don't have any demands, do you? You
catch him first then sue him, right?

311
00:15:28,858 --> 00:15:30,960
Right now I'm really holding myself back.

312
00:15:31,093 --> 00:15:34,092
Convince me with
your excuse before I explode,

313
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,342
Why is he like this?

314
00:15:36,194 --> 00:15:37,733
you forgot what I
said before?

315
00:15:37,795 --> 00:15:41,881
Even dogs are not this careless before
barking at other people's houses.

316
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,873
Because of Jung Hee-Joo's murder case.

317
00:15:56,412 --> 00:15:58,270
You know the case
is our job, right?

318
00:16:00,147 --> 00:16:01,959
Looks like you have a clue.

319
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,367
Then leave it to us.

320
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,046
We will investigate together.

321
00:16:05,071 --> 00:16:06,468
That's a bit difficult.

322
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,483
the reason you caught,
Ki Dong-Jae was not clear.

323
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,679
Ki Dong jae was arrested here previously too.

324
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:18,264
He once hid behind the chairman
Choi Yong-Geun's team and finally free.

325
00:16:18,289 --> 00:16:20,344
That was very similar,

326
00:16:20,834 --> 00:16:21,998
With this case.

327
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:29,975
Moreover, you have a close relationship
with team leader Choi Yong-Geun, right?

328
00:16:33,545 --> 00:16:36,216
It's still early investigation, I
can't give a definite answer.

329
00:16:36,467 --> 00:16:37,826
I will see the situation first

330
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:40,327
if I need your opinion

331
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:41,866
I will call.

332
00:16:44,514 --> 00:16:47,030
Two of our detective team are injured,

333
00:16:47,186 --> 00:16:48,561
and now in the hospital.

334
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:53,819
That damn Ki Dong-Jae
stab and hit them.

335
00:16:55,218 --> 00:16:58,116
The two detectives are my comrades,

336
00:16:58,654 --> 00:17:02,014
but they are also
fellow cops like you.

337
00:17:08,091 --> 00:17:09,474
Let's dig about Ki Dong-Jae.

338
00:17:09,731 --> 00:17:11,036
We have to look for evidence.

339
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:13,763
That's the only way.
Prosecutors are after him too.

340
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,396
Behind this case, there is a former prosecutor
who is the son-in-law of a rich family.

341
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:18,872
Will it work?

342
00:17:18,897 --> 00:17:21,107
Since when do we think so
many things before we hit the road?

343
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,145
If there is a wall, we
just need to go through it,

344
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:25,654
if it's too high, we
can destroy it.

345
00:17:26,981 --> 00:17:28,270
Good grief.

346
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:30,044
You're out of puberty.

347
00:17:30,247 --> 00:17:32,310
You just need to let go
of menopause.

348
00:17:32,335 --> 00:17:33,966
I'm not menopausal.

349
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:35,904
I'm not even married,
menopause.

350
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,443
Sometimes there are cases like that.

351
00:17:37,468 --> 00:17:39,411
Menopause occurs in
unmarried people too.

352
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:40,653
That's the worst.

353
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,505
Even though you mock me,

354
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,912
I calmed down after seeing you.

355
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,607
Your future is like me too.

356
00:17:46,632 --> 00:17:47,825
I know it.

357
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:50,551
You will be 
worst human like me.

358
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:53,364
Why did you say
terrible thing like that?

359
00:17:53,389 --> 00:17:55,725
Wait for me, future Kang Do-Chang.

360
00:17:56,091 --> 00:17:57,958
- I hate it.
- Do-Chang.

361
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,340
Do-Chang.

362
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:02,778
The police from the West Incheon office came.

363
00:18:03,239 --> 00:18:05,004
They say reason they
chasing you is murder.

364
00:18:05,029 --> 00:18:08,341
I already said I
didn't kill Boss Sang-Pill.

365
00:18:08,794 --> 00:18:09,903
Not him.

366
00:18:10,278 --> 00:18:11,473
Jung Hee-Joo's murder case.

367
00:18:11,755 --> 00:18:14,208
Why do they blame it on me?

368
00:18:14,818 --> 00:18:17,223
- What is my relationship with that woman?
- Why?

369
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,504
You're also related to TJ.

370
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:22,200
Your lawyer is from TJ's legal team too.

371
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:24,622
I don't know, just talk to my lawyer.

372
00:18:24,724 --> 00:18:26,529
I don't want to talk
with you, detective.

373
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:28,927
Oh, yes.

374
00:18:29,872 --> 00:18:32,708
So you don't want to face
with a petty person like me?

375
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:35,372
Wow.

376
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,528
Who is that behind you?

377
00:18:38,396 --> 00:18:40,122
Why are you acting like that?

378
00:18:40,825 --> 00:18:43,849
You can even stab a detective and injure his head as you please,

379
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:46,029
It must be because you think
someone behind you, right?

380
00:18:46,997 --> 00:18:48,716
Do you think the world is that easy?

381
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:52,950
Team Leader.

382
00:18:53,857 --> 00:18:55,622
Don't think it's too complicated.

383
00:18:55,974 --> 00:18:57,849
gang crime,

384
00:18:58,279 --> 00:18:59,708
I admit it.

385
00:19:00,654 --> 00:19:02,880
You just need to do as
ordered...

386
00:19:04,677 --> 00:19:06,364
Hey, wake up.

387
00:19:08,138 --> 00:19:09,685
Stand right.

388
00:19:11,075 --> 00:19:12,215
Team Leader.

389
00:19:13,755 --> 00:19:15,005
You can't do this.

390
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,489
What? Why? You feel unfair?

391
00:19:18,693 --> 00:19:21,380
Oh I see? In that case...

392
00:19:21,638 --> 00:19:24,388
Well, already. You too,

393
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,364
hit me.

394
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,935
I'm a detective, but
like other people I too feel pain

395
00:19:32,052 --> 00:19:34,122
I said hit me fast, you bastard!

396
00:19:34,147 --> 00:19:35,443
Just stop it.

397
00:19:35,468 --> 00:19:37,380
This will not be good for you.

398
00:19:37,405 --> 00:19:38,497
I know.

399
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,216
But, how are you?

400
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:42,075
I'm ashamed.

401
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:44,294
If I just keep quiet,

402
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,796
look at you belittling,

403
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:48,372
detectives like dirt,

404
00:19:48,443 --> 00:19:50,661
I'm so embarrassed that
I can't live.

405
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:51,794
You bastard!

406
00:19:52,904 --> 00:19:56,739
What era is it now?
the detective beat the suspect?

407
00:19:56,801 --> 00:19:59,872
- Are you still sane?
- He dared to stab the detective.

408
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:02,129
One of them
even had brain surgery.

409
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:03,653
They're not our subordinates, right?

410
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:05,872
They're from the West Incheon office, right?

411
00:20:05,897 --> 00:20:07,505
Then why did you act?

412
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:10,122
Whoever it is, they are 
fellow police officer like us.

413
00:20:10,364 --> 00:20:12,661
So you're taking revenge on your comrades?

414
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:16,114
That is the job of the thugs.

415
00:20:16,139 --> 00:20:17,536
You are the police.

416
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:20,357
You should act
like a cop!

417
00:20:20,382 --> 00:20:21,719
So what,

418
00:20:21,836 --> 00:20:24,985
what is the reason I
risked my life all this time?

419
00:20:26,243 --> 00:20:27,673
It's because I trust my partner,

420
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:30,493
fellow police
who struggle together,

421
00:20:32,305 --> 00:20:34,610
will come forward to protect me.

422
00:20:37,351 --> 00:20:40,781
If a bastard like
Ki Dong-Jae is released,

423
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,210
they...

424
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:47,680
Will they,

425
00:20:48,602 --> 00:20:51,180
be able to run to the field with
risking their lives?

426
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,354
Attorney of Ki Dong-Jae,

427
00:21:00,917 --> 00:21:04,065
will sue you for violence.

428
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:06,089
I will attend the trial.

429
00:21:06,114 --> 00:21:07,964
Leave Ki Dong-Jae to another team,

430
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:09,831
you stay in your house.

431
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,087
What are you doing?

432
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:22,290
You still haven't told your wife?

433
00:21:23,571 --> 00:21:24,696
Brother,

434
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,126
Thank you for your good intentions.

435
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:29,540
But, this is not the place
for me to live in.

436
00:21:29,814 --> 00:21:31,400
It doesn't really suit me.

437
00:21:33,657 --> 00:21:34,806
Hey.

438
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:38,438
I talked with lawyers,
it's finished.

439
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,298
It will pass like the wind.

440
00:21:40,323 --> 00:21:41,673
No.

441
00:21:41,946 --> 00:21:43,368
I just want to rest.

442
00:21:44,493 --> 00:21:45,782
I'm fed up.

443
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:49,282
Can't you throw away
your annoying trait?

444
00:21:50,056 --> 00:21:53,103
You can do that
when you are young,

445
00:21:53,486 --> 00:21:55,181
but, you have a son now.

446
00:21:57,306 --> 00:22:00,688
At least 
think of your children.

447
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:06,329
Head of investigation office,

448
00:22:06,354 --> 00:22:08,212
will move
Ki Dong-Jae to another team.

449
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:10,415
Sorry I can't help.

450
00:22:15,353 --> 00:22:18,189
I want you to keep holding on to the case.

451
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:19,525
It will be difficult.

452
00:22:20,337 --> 00:22:21,681
It's too complicated..

453
00:22:22,243 --> 00:22:25,415
The head of the investigation office too
won't let this go.

454
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:30,775
I said I want you.

455
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,040
Brother.

456
00:22:32,189 --> 00:22:33,673
You and me,

457
00:22:34,368 --> 00:22:35,821
should better stop now.

458
00:22:36,587 --> 00:22:40,009
If it continues, it looks like it will
very uncomfortable for both of us.

459
00:22:48,587 --> 00:22:50,907
I said I want you.

460
00:23:05,915 --> 00:23:07,118
Team Leader.

461
00:23:07,275 --> 00:23:09,134
Head said this morning there will be a
transfer of personnel.

462
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,595
Oh I see?

463
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:12,329
Where to?

464
00:23:12,439 --> 00:23:14,790
If I can move to
a place where the air is clean,

465
00:23:15,681 --> 00:23:19,001
Not you, but
head of the investigative office.

466
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:38,318
If I knew this...

467
00:23:38,584 --> 00:23:40,920
I would be nicer to you.

468
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,490
You're the winner.

469
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:08,370
Please come in.

470
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,402
Come in.

471
00:24:20,172 --> 00:24:21,273
Just me.

472
00:24:54,213 --> 00:24:55,214
This...

473
00:24:56,095 --> 00:24:57,331
how could it get leaked?

474
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,971
Isn't this police data?

475
00:25:00,092 --> 00:25:02,495
Someone took it and gave it
to Ki Dong-Jae.

476
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:04,403
After he saw these photos

477
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,872
he faked a serial murder.

478
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,298
This means that the police are also involved.

479
00:25:10,332 --> 00:25:13,579
Most likely
of the Seoul Investigation Team.

480
00:25:17,451 --> 00:25:20,754
- Are you sure it's from Ki Dong-Jae's computer?
- Right.

481
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,362
I took it from the computer
at Ki Dong-Jae's hideout.

482
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:24,304
Okay.

483
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:28,527
Prosecutors may be able to issue
additional charges from this.

484
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,830
- Is it possible?
- Still not yet.

485
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:33,632
Feels like something is missing.

486
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,903
Like something was missing.

487
00:25:37,314 --> 00:25:39,071
- Meet?
- Yes.

488
00:25:48,695 --> 00:25:50,498
This is the last place he was spotted..

489
00:25:50,585 --> 00:25:51,865
He was not recorded again after that.

490
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:53,378
Have you tried tracking the car?

491
00:25:53,531 --> 00:25:55,888
-  the car is not in his name.
- What about the reverse side?

492
00:25:56,715 --> 00:25:57,783
There isn't any.

493
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:02,734
Carrying Jung Hee-Joo's corpse
to the hill and throw it away

494
00:26:02,761 --> 00:26:05,664
then disappeared with the car?

495
00:26:57,329 --> 00:26:58,433
Ji-Hyeok.

496
00:27:03,557 --> 00:27:04,362
Hey.

497
00:27:07,979 --> 00:27:09,049
It seems possible.

498
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:37,195
Shit.

499
00:27:43,148 --> 00:27:44,182
Jae-Hong.

500
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:48,767
- Can the DNA be found?
- Due to being submerged in water for too long,

501
00:27:48,867 --> 00:27:52,304
the bloodstains would be hard to find.
Even strands of hair must have been lost.

502
00:27:58,216 --> 00:27:59,283
Brother Do-Chang.

503
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,848
- What?
- This.

504
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,959
- Where did you find it?
- Looks like it's a lipstick cap.

505
00:28:05,984 --> 00:28:07,719
I got it from under the driver's seat.

506
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:20,103
We managed to get
evidence such as the following.

507
00:28:20,135 --> 00:28:20,910
That's it.

508
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:25,005
- That lipstick cap was found in the car?
- Right.

509
00:28:25,233 --> 00:28:27,463
- Are the results out yet?
- Already.

510
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:30,642
It's true that this is a lipstick product
used in the Jung Hee-Joo case.

511
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,714
More or less the story fits.

512
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,686
- Arrest Ki Dong-Jae and investigate.
- However,

513
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:40,449
The Seoul Investigation Team caught him,
it would be difficult to bring him here.

514
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:43,856
We will give this evidence to the prosecutor's office
for him to be charged with additional charges.

515
00:28:43,881 --> 00:28:46,859
He will get another charge,

516
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,408
but what is the motive of the murder?

517
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:52,598
Its not Ki Dong-Jae's personal will,
someone ordered it.

518
00:28:53,031 --> 00:28:55,575
We have to find it
to find out the motive for the murder.

519
00:28:55,646 --> 00:28:56,514
Who?

520
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:00,430
Who ordered it?

521
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,609
Woo Tae Ho.

522
00:29:03,809 --> 00:29:04,743
Cheon Sang Woo.

523
00:29:05,183 --> 00:29:06,028
One of them.

524
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:07,364
You mean...

525
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:12,818
people like Woo Tae-Ho and Cheon Sang-Woo,
that famous?

526
00:29:18,765 --> 00:29:21,201
You're going to report it to the prosecutor's office?

527
00:29:21,394 --> 00:29:22,427
Of course.

528
00:29:22,561 --> 00:29:25,130
Prosecutors are not easy to give
additional charges.

529
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,599
I'll report everything we have.

530
00:29:27,624 --> 00:29:29,914
Do you have proof that they did it?

531
00:29:29,967 --> 00:29:33,038
Should I show you?
You'll know if you see it.

532
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:36,675
- Detective Oh, get the evidence.
- No, no. No need.

533
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:37,876
No need.

534
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:39,838
Good grief.

535
00:29:41,813 --> 00:29:45,283
I'm sick of telling you guys
the same thing.

536
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,421
- Do you know who they are?
- We know.

537
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,369
Powerful people.

538
00:29:50,393 --> 00:29:57,062
The husband of my wife's sister also works
at the TJ building glass cleaning company.

539
00:29:57,396 --> 00:30:00,199
- If I fail I will be killed by my wife.
- Right.

540
00:30:00,301 --> 00:30:02,568
You already know that, but why?

541
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:05,404
- Why are you bothering them?
- You think...

542
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:07,573
 we want it?

543
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:11,010
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Head's daughter works at TJ.

544
00:30:11,034 --> 00:30:14,524
Especially one of the suspects
is his daughter's direct supervisor.

545
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:16,519
He will not just give up.

546
00:30:16,544 --> 00:30:17,944
I will give up.

547
00:30:18,617 --> 00:30:19,718
I give up.

548
00:30:19,952 --> 00:30:23,222
Therefore, don't bother TJ.

549
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,424
You don't know because you're not a parent.

550
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,937
He has a big heart actually.

551
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,329
I will be responsible
over Moon Bo-Kyung.

552
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:34,879
What? Who are you to bear responsibility for my daughter?

553
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:36,105
Who are you?

554
00:30:36,134 --> 00:30:38,337
- He has a lot of money.
- Good grief.

555
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,081
What does that have to do with a lot of money?

556
00:30:41,106 --> 00:30:44,052
How much money do you have?

557
00:30:44,078 --> 00:30:47,554
Recently, my college friend opened a 
law firm in Gangnam.

558
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,087
With the qualification of Miss Bo-Kyung, she
will definitely be accepted at any time.

559
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:53,285
Law firm in Gangnam?

560
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:56,521
- Can you arrange it?
- He'd have a hard time resisting it.

561
00:30:56,822 --> 00:30:59,124
The company...

562
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,560
building is in my name.

563
00:31:03,672 --> 00:31:04,956
In that case...

564
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,068
is there a contractor for
glass cleaning in your building,

565
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:11,003
Sir?

566
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,410
What are you doing?

567
00:31:16,508 --> 00:31:18,979
There is no more time.

568
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:22,748
Quickly submit the evidence to the prosecutor's office
and get additional charges.

569
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,317
Who's the culprit?

570
00:31:25,417 --> 00:31:26,685
I do not care.

571
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:28,787
- Send the proof.
- Okay.

572
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:29,755
Yes, sir.

573
00:31:43,995 --> 00:31:46,371
You have to come down
from the position of head of the legal team.

574
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,340
You can take it, can't you?

575
00:31:50,228 --> 00:31:51,496
Okay.

576
00:31:52,279 --> 00:31:53,779
However, give me some time.

577
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:56,498
Not because I still want to be there.

578
00:31:57,285 --> 00:31:59,026
To achieve our goal,

579
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,652
I have to be in that position.

580
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:04,723
I will inform the President.

581
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,094
That you insist.

582
00:32:07,826 --> 00:32:09,494
He would definitely understand.

583
00:32:10,168 --> 00:32:13,732
That you're the one who can't
just let it go.

584
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:20,157
Detectives handed over evidence
for the Jung Hee-Joo murder case.

585
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,540
They say,

586
00:32:22,851 --> 00:32:25,110
my name and Mr. Cheon Sang-Woo are there.

587
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:27,478
As the mastermind behind a serial murder.

588
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:30,055
You?

589
00:32:30,849 --> 00:32:31,809
Why?

590
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:37,415
The main thing is...

591
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,926
Detective suspects brother
as the mastermind behind the murder.

592
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:43,187
Right.

593
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,930
Make it a reality.

594
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,100
Make it true, even if it's not true.

595
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,982
Then you will be free from suspicion.

596
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:03,161
The prosecutor sent me the data.

597
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:05,784
After I finisb checking,

598
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,219
I will let you know.

599
00:33:10,589 --> 00:33:11,556

Not yet.

655
00:38:14,837 --> 00:38:16,661
I'll take care of it myself.

656
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,396
You pretend you don't know.

657
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:19,931
Okay.

658
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:22,801
- Please leave.
- Okay.

659
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:28,239
You see...

660
00:38:29,506 --> 00:38:31,078
Sorry,

661
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,678
but what's with Team Leader Woo?

662
00:38:33,778 --> 00:38:35,180
Sorry.

663
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:38,550
I should have told you first.

664
00:38:40,391 --> 00:38:44,261
Basically, it won't affect you
and our goals.

665
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:48,626
Will Mr. Chairman
resign?

666
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,295
Still not yet.

667
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,267
However, someday he will be.

668
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:57,902
Because now, he is an ordinary person
who has nothing to do with TJ.

669
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:00,222
Okay.

670
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:02,022
I understand.

671
00:39:12,312 --> 00:39:15,487
Ki Dong-Jae will keep his mouth shut,
You don't have to worry.

672
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,993
You know, right?

673
00:39:17,781 --> 00:39:21,528
If he fails, it's not just me
who will be destroyed.

674
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,011
Yes.

675
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,798
I see.

676
00:39:24,989 --> 00:39:27,825
You have to be careful
especially for internal control.

677
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:30,135
To be honest...

678
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,640
I'm more worried about that
than police.

679
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:37,442
Don't worry,
I will make sure there are no problems.

680
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:47,127
You're not home yet?

681
00:39:47,283 --> 00:39:48,520
Yes

682
00:39:49,154 --> 00:39:51,022
I have something to accept
from Manager Park.

683
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,524
Turns out he was home.

684
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,762
Okay.

685
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,460
You're not home?

686
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:57,262
Of course not..

687
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:37,137
<i>Last seen at 8:22 pm</i>

688
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,971
<i>At 8:24 pm</i>

689
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,120
<i>The door will be closed.</i>

690
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:02,006
Forgive me.

691
00:41:04,054 --> 00:41:05,823
<i>The door will be closed.</i>

692
00:41:13,195 --> 00:41:15,306
You parked your car in the 6th floor basement?

693
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,618
Yes

694
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:22,382
Isnt that a parking lot for
director position and above?

695
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,549
There was no place left.

696
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,920
Next time I will obey.

697
00:41:52,136 --> 00:41:54,104
I forgot that there was an appointment.

698
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,584
See you tomorrow.

699
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:15,239
Lawyer Choi in charge
on the Ki Dong-Jae case, right?

700
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:17,347
Looks like...

701
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,438
I have to meet
with Ki Dong-Jae soon.

702
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:52,903
It's finished.

703
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:54,772
Thank you

704
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,249
<i>Enter your PIN number.</i>

705
00:43:07,952 --> 00:43:11,089

708
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:26,004
Please.

709
00:43:32,002 --> 00:43:33,203
What is it?

710
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:38,316
<i>Resignation Letter</i>

711
00:43:39,684 --> 00:43:41,652
- Because of what?
- At that time,

712
00:43:41,753 --> 00:43:45,323
I shouldn't have said that
to you.

713
00:43:46,057 --> 00:43:48,226
That doesn't seem to be the reason.

714
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:50,837
Usually, I don't meddle
with my father's business.

715
00:43:51,976 --> 00:43:53,711
However, maybe because I am related to him,

716
00:43:53,998 --> 00:43:56,904
I will be distracted
with the Jung Hee-Joo case.

717
00:43:59,276 --> 00:44:02,073
Daddy's police.
The company where Mr. Chairman,

718
00:44:03,067 --> 00:44:04,702
I'm not helping anywhere.

719
00:44:05,202 --> 00:44:06,688
You keep getting annoyed...

720
00:44:07,908 --> 00:44:09,313
with the Jung Hee-Joo case.

721
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,485
It has nothing to do
with work.

722
00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:14,385
The case will be resolved soon.

723
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,690
Please reconsider...

724
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:18,825
until everything is done.

725
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,793
Will it be resolved quickly?

726
00:44:23,995 --> 00:44:26,466
You are the person who is needed
in this team.

727
00:44:28,519 --> 00:44:30,554
Like I trusted Jung Hee-Joo,

728
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,470
You are a trustworthy person.

729
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:37,114
Think it again.

730
00:44:38,109 --> 00:44:39,039
I ask.

731
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,251
I will reconsider.

732
00:44:45,702 --> 00:44:46,859
I know.

733
00:44:47,118 --> 00:44:50,924
Yes I know.
It's true that I was taken advantage of by them.

734
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:52,056
Then why?

735
00:44:52,924 --> 00:44:55,927
I just have to follow order here to get a good salary.

736
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:03,202
Hello.

737
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:06,907
Hello.

738
00:45:19,419 --> 00:45:20,620
Its thrilling.

739
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:24,288
It's like a blind date
during college.

740
00:45:24,714 --> 00:45:27,258
- I'm Cheon Na-Na.
- No need to introduce yourself.

741
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,994
There's no one who doesn't know you.

742
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:33,867
Sorry for not coming
for a blind date at that time.

743
00:45:34,070 --> 00:45:35,638
It's okay if I'm the only one pounding.

744
00:45:36,501 --> 00:45:38,136
What is your purpose?

745
00:45:40,438 --> 00:45:43,841
I'm interested in someone
named Oh Ji-Hyeok.

746
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:46,577
You're his cousin, aren't you?

747
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,516
Oh Ji-Hyeok is really great.

748
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:55,401
who an make a conglomerate princess come
meet me.

749
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:57,622
You two don't get along, do you?

750
00:45:58,022 --> 00:46:00,258
He's the one who got me here.

751
00:46:00,791 --> 00:46:02,229
whats there to get along with him?

752
00:46:04,493 --> 00:46:07,699
I will make him miserable for you.

753
00:46:08,399 --> 00:46:11,672
What should I do?
Tell me.

754
00:46:13,964 --> 00:46:15,659
You just have to kill him.

755
00:46:17,375 --> 00:46:20,444
- Sorry, but that's not possible...
- Then there is no point.

756
00:46:20,948 --> 00:46:23,083
Whatever you do ,he will not be miserable.

757
00:46:23,581 --> 00:46:25,512
I once stabbed him.

758
00:46:30,932 --> 00:46:32,890
He didn't even feel pain.

759
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,692
He's crazy.

760
00:46:37,507 --> 00:46:38,508
I will come again.

761
00:46:38,696 --> 00:46:41,165
Today I just wanted to say hello.

762
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:42,520
Are you sure...

763
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,271
you can make him miserable?

764
00:46:55,012 --> 00:46:57,648
He was the first to tease me.

765
00:46:59,250 --> 00:47:00,952
I can't stay still.

766
00:47:02,966 --> 00:47:04,172
You must...

767
00:47:05,122 --> 00:47:06,591
dig deeper.

768
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,594
You will find it.

769
00:47:10,674 --> 00:47:11,976
Mother.

770
00:47:13,497 --> 00:47:16,236
Who was destroyed because of the disobedience of son,

771
00:47:16,901 --> 00:47:18,191
Ji-Hyeok's mother.

772
00:47:20,771 --> 00:47:22,976
I didn't have time to pay attention to you
lately, right?

773
00:47:23,648 --> 00:47:25,476
I'm very busy. Sorry.

774
00:47:26,753 --> 00:47:27,902
It doesn't matter.

775
00:47:28,144 --> 00:47:30,136
I'm always grateful.

776
00:47:31,278 --> 00:47:34,520
Hee-Joo talked about you sometimes.

777
00:47:36,272 --> 00:47:38,249
she said you were in a lot of trouble because of the child.

778
00:47:38,874 --> 00:47:40,804
She felt so sorry,

779
00:47:41,368 --> 00:47:42,555
for not being able to help.

780
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,750
The top of your hair is stickingout a little.

781
00:47:46,508 --> 00:47:47,750
Should I cut it?

782
00:47:47,916 --> 00:47:50,111
Hee-Joo tried to help you before, right?

783
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:53,425
That's why she showed
the video to you.

784
00:47:56,228 --> 00:47:58,384
I will replace Hee-Joo
to help you.

785
00:47:58,466 --> 00:48:00,528
I will return the child
into her mother's arms.

786
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:02,458
Is...

787
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,686
It possible?

788
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:09,436
It's possible if we can make
Vice President Cheon confess.

789
00:48:10,347 --> 00:48:11,401
That person...

790
00:48:12,886 --> 00:48:15,113
He doesn't deserve to be a father.

791
00:48:16,755 --> 00:48:17,833
What

792
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:19,958
what do you want from me?

793
00:48:21,489 --> 00:48:24,020
You, Hee-Joo, and Vice President Cheon.

794
00:48:24,544 --> 00:48:27,457
You just need to tell me
what only the three of you know.

795
00:49:08,244 --> 00:49:10,244
Please show this
to Vice President Cheon.

796
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:12,910
If also he doesnt
not return your child,

797
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:15,254
just say that you
will reveal this.

798
00:49:15,973 --> 00:49:17,059
Hee-Joo.

799
00:49:17,188 --> 00:49:18,984
When I think you've been beaten,

800
00:49:19,062 --> 00:49:21,734
I want to take him to the police
for him to be punished.

801
00:49:23,891 --> 00:49:25,453
But, we must put your daughter first.

802
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:27,516
No.

803
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:31,327
It's because you don't know
how terrible that person is.

804
00:49:32,361 --> 00:49:33,720
I cant do that.

805
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,416
He won't let me go.

806
00:49:39,070 --> 00:49:40,125
I can't.

807
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:42,211
I'm scared.

808
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,883
Tell him I have it.

809
00:49:45,366 --> 00:49:48,921
If something happens to you,
I will immediately run to the police station.

810
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:51,809
That way, you and your child will be safe.

811
00:49:53,593 --> 00:49:56,569
- Hee-Joo.
- I miss Soo-Yeon too.

812
00:49:58,514 --> 00:50:00,467
She will be so beautiful
because she looks like you.

813
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:14,561
Hee-Joo.

814
00:50:18,577 --> 00:50:19,631
Forgive me.

815
00:50:22,783 --> 00:50:24,447
Forgive me.

816
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:30,344
Is this your father?

817
00:50:32,539 --> 00:50:34,352
He looks very good.

818
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,763
I just keep him in my heart.

819
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:40,145
Now I will take this to
keep with me.

820
00:50:40,170 --> 00:50:42,610
Okay. Your dad will like it too.

821
00:50:44,486 --> 00:50:46,298
Hee-Joo is a beautiful person.

822
00:50:49,078 --> 00:50:50,453
Her eyes are beautiful.

823
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,257
When I see her eyes, my heart is at peace.

824
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:57,782
You drew it very well.

825
00:50:58,282 --> 00:50:59,922
It's like he is smiling at you.

826
00:50:59,962 --> 00:51:01,024
Look.

827
00:51:02,194 --> 00:51:04,717
That's right. Daddy always used to smile
when he see me.

828
00:51:30,838 --> 00:51:31,916
You don't drink?

829
00:51:32,315 --> 00:51:33,400
Sorry.

830
00:51:34,057 --> 00:51:35,361
I have to drive back in.

831
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:38,547
Too bad.

832
00:51:45,202 --> 00:51:48,257
- What do you want to say?
- You and me,

833
00:51:49,959 --> 00:51:52,154
aren't we very similar?

834
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,997
There is sadness in your eyes.

835
00:51:56,750 --> 00:51:58,587
Just like my sadness.

836
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:03,634
My mother passed away.

837
00:52:05,915 --> 00:52:07,126
Because of me.

838
00:52:09,172 --> 00:52:11,359
I can't stop thinking about it my whole
lifetime.

839
00:52:12,140 --> 00:52:13,617
I can't forget ,

840
00:52:16,725 --> 00:52:18,717
Mother's face looking at me,

841
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,264
before she died.

842
00:52:24,231 --> 00:52:26,731
She looked like she was blaming me.

843
00:52:27,130 --> 00:52:29,450
As if she wants to say "I died because of you."

844
00:52:29,628 --> 00:52:30,722
Why did you,

845
00:52:32,745 --> 00:52:34,392
tell me that?

846
00:52:34,563 --> 00:52:36,313
Didn't I tell you?

847
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:39,603
I see my sadness in your eyes.

848
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:41,517
Do you,

849
00:52:44,962 --> 00:52:46,963
know something about me?

850
00:52:49,714 --> 00:52:53,253
I'm just telling a story.
I don't know anything about you.

851
00:53:02,755 --> 00:53:04,684
Looks like I overreacted
for being drunk.

852
00:53:05,786 --> 00:53:06,864
I'm asking for help,

853
00:53:07,885 --> 00:53:11,083
can you pretend you didn't hear
what I just said?

854
00:53:13,472 --> 00:53:14,605
That's embarrassing.

855
00:53:24,206 --> 00:53:26,667
<i>He will slowly sympathize with you.

856
00:53:27,909 --> 00:53:31,183
His heart pounds when he
meets people of the same type.

857
00:53:32,887 --> 00:53:35,223
Just like I am happy to see you
for the first time.

858
00:53:43,594 --> 00:53:44,664
Toast.

859
00:53:45,094 --> 00:53:46,703
Nice to meet you, Oh Ji-Hyeok.

860
00:54:25,970 --> 00:54:27,298
<i>The safe is open.</i>

861
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:24,865
We almost made it.

862
00:55:25,933 --> 00:55:27,900
Cheon Sang-Woo is about to be arrested.

863
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,014
On what charge?

864
00:55:30,965 --> 00:55:32,387
Conspiracy to kill Jung Hee-Joo.

865
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,083
By when?

866
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:38,272
I only need to meet one person
to make sure.

867
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:40,083
Even though he doesnt want to say it,

868
00:55:40,364 --> 00:55:42,466
the data i got so far
it's enough.

869
00:55:44,457 --> 00:55:45,934
Good job, Prosecutor Woo.

870
00:55:49,096 --> 00:55:51,651
I have to go to the police station directly
to testify.

871
00:55:52,010 --> 00:55:53,628
I have to admit that,

872
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,667
I falsified evidence
in the assault case two years ago.

873
00:55:56,998 --> 00:55:58,639
Thus the murder case,

874
00:55:59,725 --> 00:56:00,897
can be explained.

875
00:56:01,452 --> 00:56:03,343
What about me?
What should I do?

876
00:56:03,561 --> 00:56:04,647
you just need,

877
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:08,708
to pretend not to know.

878
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:11,302
Whatever.

879
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:17,029
Thank you

880

<i>Michael Cha</i>

881
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:46,165
Are you back?

882
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:56,402
I didn't kill Jung Hee-Joo.

883
00:56:58,645 --> 00:57:00,098
I've spoken to a lawyer.

884
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,200
You were observing her
for three to four years.

885
00:57:03,566 --> 00:57:04,739
That's enough.

886
00:57:05,192 --> 00:57:07,254
Not long ago, a senior
close to me,

887
00:57:07,279 --> 00:57:08,669
came to me from the prosecutor's office.

888
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:10,927
A friendly senior.

889
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:14,439
If he accepts it, a suspended sentence
can be obtained.

890
00:57:17,168 --> 00:57:18,872
What were you doing,

891
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,848
the day Hee-Joo was killed?

892
00:57:22,506 --> 00:57:25,060
I told you I didn't kill her,
Why are you asking that?

893
00:57:26,076 --> 00:57:28,755
We have reviewed the evidence submitted
by the Incheon West Office.

894
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:30,613
The lowest sentence for abandonment of corpses,

895
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,090
and higher sentence for killing
and abandonment of corpses.

896
00:57:33,458 --> 00:57:35,752
The prosecutor in charge
thinks the same as me.

897
00:57:36,396 --> 00:57:37,911
The evidence is clear.

898
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,443
If you are put on trial, you will be likely
found guilty.

899
00:57:43,795 --> 00:57:44,920
That verdict matters,

900
00:57:45,764 --> 00:57:46,826
will be much more severe.

901
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:51,725

it's up to me what I want to do with you.

902
00:57:52,835 --> 00:57:54,092
I'll ask one more time.

903
00:57:55,088 --> 00:57:56,564
What were you doing,

904
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,839
the day Hee-Joo was killed?

905
00:58:05,993 --> 00:58:07,774
If I can prove myself innocent,

906
00:58:09,543 --> 00:58:11,496
can I get away with only a probation?

907
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,027
If your testimony is confirmed to be true,

908
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:16,406
it's not impossible.

909
00:58:18,695 --> 00:58:19,788
Fact.

910
00:58:24,835 --> 00:58:27,241
Let me start with the 
the most obvious facts.

911
00:58:29,230 --> 00:58:31,035
The one who killed Jung Hee-Joo...

912
00:58:32,941 --> 00:58:34,128
is not me.

913
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:37,321
Then who?

914
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:40,974
I also do not know.

915
00:58:44,081 --> 00:58:46,597
Why should I believe what you say?

916
00:58:51,942 --> 00:58:53,044
Hello?

917
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:55,724
Give me the car keys.

918
00:58:56,418 --> 00:58:58,472
Shouldn't I 
take you there?

919
00:59:00,396 --> 00:59:02,724
It's because I need to
borrow President Cheon's car.

920
00:59:03,238 --> 00:59:04,441
Give it to me.

921
00:59:05,277 --> 00:59:06,355
Yes.

922
00:59:12,811 --> 00:59:13,857

Now it's your turn.

926
00:59:59,569 --> 01:00:01,124
Now there must be someone

927
01:00:02,999 --> 01:00:04,514
that popped into your head.

928
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,585
Who's he?

929
01:00:09,702 --> 01:00:10,827
That person.

930
01:01:32,761 --> 01:01:35,253
If you were going to divorce, why are you
asking for Woo Tae-Ho,

931
01:01:35,278 --> 01:01:36,675
to be the next CEO?

932
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,936
I should have pushed you from the start.

933
01:01:39,733 --> 01:01:42,944
If I do that, won't people
will think I am,

934
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:46,533
the one who imprisoned my father
and turn her brother into a murderer?

935
01:01:48,854 --> 01:01:51,494
It's not you. All of these
from Woo Tae-Ho's head?

936
01:01:51,854 --> 01:01:54,291
You will be the savior of TJ Group,

after you throw out
traitor Woo Tae-Ho?

938
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:59,134
If that's the case, wouldn't McQueen's side
will also lose?

939
01:02:01,641 --> 01:02:03,992
Does your husband agree with your thoughts?

940
01:02:04,336 --> 01:02:05,672
- Yes.
- Why?

941
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:08,261
There's nothing there for him.

942

will benefit you?

01:02:11,648 --> 01:02:12,914
So you have a chance.

944
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:18,060
Sorry. I don't want to give up everything
like your husband did.

will add charges?

It's still too early.

970
01:04:21,691 --> 01:04:24,292
- He asked what was the reason?
- since there was no motive for the murder.

971
01:04:24,317 --> 01:04:27,214
There's not enough motive
to murder. Thats,

972
01:04:28,473 --> 01:04:30,089
he kept saying.

973

Don't know anything about this case.

984
01:05:35,125 --> 01:05:36,171
Looks like Woo Tae-Ho,

985
01:05:36,834 --> 01:05:38,873
found decisive clues.

986
01:05:39,287 --> 01:05:42,068
He found a clue that
Cheon Sang-Woo is the culprit?

987
01:05:42,919 --> 01:05:44,005
If not that?

988
01:05:45,075 --> 01:05:46,161
Surrender?

989
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:04,557
Let's think one more time.

990
01:06:05,937 --> 01:06:07,023
It's too rushed.

991
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:10,499
This is the best way,

992
01:06:13,305 --> 01:06:15,188
Just this once, please follow my advice.

993
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:18,586
I'll take care of everything.

994
01:06:31,409 --> 01:06:32,510
Forgive me.

995
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,555
I can't believe you.

996
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,583
<i>The officer in charge was
considered guilty</i>

997
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:08,224
<i>for Woo Tae-Ho's suicide.</i>

998
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:10,077
<i>Why are you so obsessed
with this case?</i>

999
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:12,285
<i>Like you're going to die
if they do not catch the criminal.</i>

1000
01:10:12,310 --> 01:10:13,926
<i>Looks like Ki Dong-Jae
will be released soon.</i>

1001
01:10:13,966 --> 01:10:16,608
<i>Detectives can't
catch all the bad guys.</i>

1002
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:18,052
<i>Do you think we're joking?</i>

1003
01:10:18,077 --> 01:10:20,372
<i>Why were you the last one?</i>

1004
01:10:20,397 --> 01:10:23,145
<i>Did you come to the shop on purpose
to find out about my granddaughter?</i>

1005
01:10:23,170 --> 01:10:25,075
<i>What did you say?</i>

1006
01:10:25,100 --> 01:10:26,195
<i>I really mean it.</i>

1007
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,083
<i>I could have died like Woo Tae-Ho.</i>

1008
01:10:28,108 --> 01:10:29,811
<i>You must have taken something earlier
from the safe.</i>

1009
01:10:29,836 --> 01:10:31,828
<i>can't find any evidence
if I kill him.</i>

1010
01:10:31,883 --> 01:10:32,701
<i>You want to say that?</i>

1011
01:10:32,726 --> 01:10:34,225
<i>Are you sure you'll find it?</i>
