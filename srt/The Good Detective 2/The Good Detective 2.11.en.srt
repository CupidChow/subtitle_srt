﻿I'm returning the favor.

﻿Hello?

14
00:00:58,678 --> 00:01:00,236
We found Gi Dong-jae's phone.

15
00:01:00,768 --> 00:01:03,884
﻿As expected, it had a voice recording
of him and Choi Yong-geun.

16
00:01:04,633 --> 00:01:07,434
﻿It's about a call made when he disposed
of Jung Hee-joo's body.

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,640
﻿With this,

18

﻿we can certainly put a rem on Choi Yong-geun.

﻿I see.

20

﻿I'll be back at the office soon.

21
00:01:26,069 --> 00:01:29,584
﻿It could've been horrible
if you had not sent people here.

22
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:31,582
﻿I have a chronic illness, you see.

23
00:01:32,534 --> 00:01:34,811
﻿I need an everyday injection to sustain myself.

24
00:01:35,645 --> 00:01:38,089
﻿I think someone changed what was in it.

25
00:01:38,695 --> 00:01:40,213
﻿That's probably why I had a shock.

26
00:01:40,299 --> 00:01:41,576
﻿Are you saying somebody did it

27
00:01:42,996 --> 00:01:43,994
intentionally?

28
00:01:44,101 --> 00:01:44,860
﻿I'm not sure.

29
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,045
﻿This never happened before.

30

﻿If something like this happens again.

31

﻿Thank you for coming.

﻿It seems something came up at your work. Go on.

34
00:01:58,846 --> 00:02:00,043
﻿What I just saw.

35
00:02:01,151 --> 00:02:02,669
﻿Is it saved in that flash drive?

36
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:03,256
﻿Yes.

37
00:02:03,954 --> 00:02:05,671
﻿It's crucial evidence to prove the crime.

38
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:07,983
﻿You must hand it over to the police.

39
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:08,528
﻿Why?

40
00:02:09,277 --> 00:02:10,719
﻿Without it, the culprit won't be arrested.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,058
﻿But it was filmed illegally.

42
00:02:13,364 --> 00:02:15,295
﻿I could get into trouble.

43
00:02:19,677 --> 00:02:21,341
﻿All right. Now.

44
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:25,077
﻿I'm done with my part.

45
00:02:26,023 --> 00:02:28,020
﻿Only your part remains.

46
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:30,279
﻿Catch the culprit.

47
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:36,291
﻿It may be impossible

48
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:38,510
without that flash drive.

49
00:02:38,551 --> 00:02:39,693
﻿You must catch him.

50
00:02:40,549 --> 00:02:43,545
﻿You clearly saw who the culprit is.

51
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:47,406
﻿Will you let him slip through again?

52
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,897
﻿I doubt that's acceptable.

53
00:02:55,413 --> 00:02:57,170
﻿I'll be counting on you.

to dig into the copycat crime.

164
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:04,082
﻿There will be no way to prove it anyway.

165
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:07,749
﻿That is why you got photos
of the serial murder scene from the police.

166
00:10:08,549 --> 00:10:10,266
﻿Then you sent them to Gi Dong-jae.

167
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:12,979
﻿And after killing Jung Hee-joo,

168
00:10:13,344 --> 00:10:16,859
﻿he did as instructed by you.

169
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:24,411
﻿Was that what Gi Dong-jae told you?

170
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:26,928
﻿It was recorded on his phone.

171
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:30,564
﻿And we confirmed that the phone
belonged to him.

172
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:34,959
﻿Even without his confession, we can prove
you had ordered him to do it.

173
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:40,234
﻿So it turns out you were the abettor
of Jung Hee-joo's murder.

174
00:10:42,792 --> 00:10:44,269
﻿What could it be?

175
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:48,394
﻿Why would I have had Jung Hee-joo killed?

176
00:10:48,858 --> 00:10:51,873
﻿She was nothing but a subordinate of mine.

177
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:55,027
﻿Could that be the motive to kill?

178
00:10:58,118 --> 00:10:59,302
﻿Mr. Choi.

179
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:02,172
﻿You're extremely unlucky.

180
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:07,893
﻿If you had not dragged me into Kim Min-ji's
assault case two years ago,

181
00:11:08,653 --> 00:11:10,370
﻿finding the motive

182
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,126
to murder Jung Hee-joo would have been hard.

183
00:11:13,806 --> 00:11:16,606
﻿Senior Manager Woo Tae-ho, Director Cheon Na-na,

184
00:11:17,475 --> 00:11:18,444
﻿Chairman Cheon Sang-woo.

185
00:11:19,233 --> 00:11:21,781
﻿Those three bonded through that incident.

186
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,086
﻿Somehow, I became

187
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:27,376
familiar with the past and the present case.

188
00:11:30,534 --> 00:11:32,098
﻿It's up to you now.

189
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,855
﻿Will you become the abettor of the murder?

190
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:38,132
﻿Or will you reveal the real abettor

191
00:11:38,892 --> 00:11:41,648
﻿and be charged with instigating
abandoning the body?

192
00:11:44,285 --> 00:11:45,772
﻿I know there's a real abettor.

193
00:11:46,444 --> 00:11:50,199
﻿You only connected that person to Gi Dong-jae.

194
00:11:51,508 --> 00:11:54,474
﻿Will you say who the real criminal is,

195
00:11:54,995 --> 00:11:56,712
﻿or get blamed for it all?

196
00:11:58,182 --> 00:12:00,747
﻿It's a trick I used to use back in the day.

197
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:05,112
﻿The one who falls for it is naive.

198
00:12:05,153 --> 00:12:06,391
﻿Don't you agree?

199
00:12:07,391 --> 00:12:11,665
﻿That's for the judge to say in court,
﻿not for a detective to ask.

200
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:16,181
﻿You did a great job getting here.

201
00:12:16,461 --> 00:12:17,699
﻿But it ends here.

202
00:12:19,431 --> 00:12:21,148
﻿Take it easy from now on.

203
00:12:21,231 --> 00:12:23,545
﻿Leave the rest to the prosecutor and the judge.

204
00:12:24,253 --> 00:12:25,491
﻿Choi Yong-geun, that jerk.

205
00:12:25,771 --> 00:12:27,528
﻿(Make Seobu the Safest Place)

206
00:12:27,568 --> 00:12:29,939
﻿He's not going to deal with us anymore.

207
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,044
﻿Nor is he the type to confess.

208
00:12:32,564 --> 00:12:35,560
﻿This case might end at Choi Yong-geun,

209
00:12:35,561 --> 00:12:37,598
﻿and not even reach up to Cheon Sang-woo

210
00:12:38,455 --> 00:12:40,594
﻿Let's talk realistically.

211
00:12:40,809 --> 00:12:42,526
﻿Choi Yong-geun is a real scumbag.

212
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:45,349
﻿He even made my daughter lose her temper.

213
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,627
﻿But we did more than enough

214
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:49,904
against that great TJ

215
00:12:50,098 --> 00:12:51,296
by arresting Choi Yong-geun.

216
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:55,611
﻿So making a compromise with reality should--

217
00:12:55,636 --> 00:12:58,175
﻿No. I can't accept that.

218
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,490
﻿I saw and heard
Cheon Sang-woo order the crime.

219
00:13:08,765 --> 00:13:10,522
﻿Have you met with Mr. Choi?

220
00:13:10,984 --> 00:13:12,520
﻿-Yes. 
-What did he say?

221
00:13:12,801 --> 00:13:16,316
﻿That there is data on his computer
that you should check for yourself.

222
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,314
﻿And what the heck is that?

223
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:20,591
﻿The police probably have their hands on it now.

224
00:13:21,311 --> 00:13:23,348
﻿So you better check and make preparations.

225
00:13:27,012 --> 00:13:29,008
﻿He told me I would never see my child again.

226
00:13:30,422 --> 00:13:34,177
﻿And that he will order someone

227
00:13:34,937 --> 00:13:36,734
﻿to shut Hee-joo up.

228
00:13:38,213 --> 00:13:40,210
﻿He said since she had an affair with you,

229
00:13:41,097 --> 00:13:42,335
﻿she deserved death.

230
00:13:44,527 --> 00:13:47,562
﻿To figure out Cheon Sang-woo's motive
for inciting the murder,

231
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:50,720
﻿don't we need the video Detective Oh watched?

232
00:13:50,745 --> 00:13:52,733
﻿Do you think Cheon Na-na will give it to us?

233
00:13:52,758 --> 00:13:54,755
﻿She might get arrested for filming in secret.

234
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,472
﻿And even if she does,

235
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,970
﻿it'll get rejected at the court

236
00:13:58,766 --> 00:14:00,747
﻿for inadmissible evidence
as it was shot illegally.

237
00:14:00,788 --> 00:14:04,263
﻿But why did she show it to Detective Oh?

238
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,781
﻿It's obvious. "Arrest my brother."

239
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,057
﻿Once we do, who do you think will get his seat?

240
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:11,296
﻿Cheon Sung-dae is behind bars.

241
00:14:11,577 --> 00:14:13,054
﻿So if her brother goes to jail too,

242
00:14:13,095 --> 00:14:14,812
﻿the only family member left is Cheon Na-na.

243
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,610
﻿Cheon Na-na only had one intention.

244
00:14:16,851 --> 00:14:18,368
﻿"The abettor was Cheon Sang-woo."

245
00:14:19,128 --> 00:14:20,646
﻿She wanted to convince us of that.

246
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:23,922
﻿But she didn't have to. We already knew.

247
00:14:25,681 --> 00:14:28,198
﻿Anyway, how can we arrest Cheon Sang-woo,

248
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:29,676
﻿who has become a total big shot?

249
00:14:29,677 --> 00:14:32,193
﻿Don't we just have to make Choi Yong-geun
mention Cheon Sang-woo?

250
00:14:32,218 --> 00:14:33,553
﻿Do you think that will be easy.

251
00:14:33,687 --> 00:14:35,190
﻿Choi Yong-geun will only talk about Gi Dong-jae

252
00:14:35,471 --> 00:14:38,507
﻿If he states that he only coached Gi Dong-jae,

253
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:40,744
﻿he won't need to drag Cheon Sang-woo in.

254
00:14:40,745 --> 00:14:41,743
﻿Where's Gi Dong-jae?

255
00:14:41,784 --> 00:14:43,261
﻿I searched for him, but he vanished.

256
00:14:43,421 --> 00:14:47,057
﻿Either he flew overseas
or got buried somewhere by Gu Jae-chun.

257
00:14:47,058 --> 00:14:49,555
﻿Does that mean we're back to square one?

258
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,792
I didn't get the video but
it was etched in my mind.

259
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,628
Cheon Sang-woo's motive for killing

260
00:14:56,262 --> 00:14:59,082
was hidden in his conversation
with Jung Hee-joo before he killed her.

261
00:14:59,155 --> 00:15:00,899
We need to find and prove it.

262
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:04,639
﻿To do so, we need to investigate Cheon Sang-woo.
﻿And that won't be easy.

263
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,724
﻿He saw Choi Yong-geun get arrested in his face.

264
00:15:07,749 --> 00:15:08,789
﻿He will not let his guard down.

265
00:15:08,814 --> 00:15:11,744
﻿We will track Woo Tae-ho, Jung Hee-joo,
﻿and their past, not Cheon Sang-woo.

266
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:14,636
﻿But Woo Tae-ho and Jung Hee-joo are dead.

267
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,070
﻿Isn't it better to go after Cheon Sang-woo?

268
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:22,779
﻿Do-chang, do you remember the password
to the safe written in Jung Hee-joo's diary?

269
00:15:22,866 --> 00:15:23,737
﻿Yes, I do.

270
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,725
﻿In the video Cheon Na-na showed me,

271
00:15:26,296 --> 00:15:28,573
﻿Cheon Sang-woo told Jung Hee-joo something.

272
00:15:29,812 --> 00:15:34,846
<i>﻿I told you to get what
Woo Tae-ho hid, ﻿not use it.</i>

273
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,739
﻿Hello, ma'am. It's me.

274
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,697
﻿Please put Soo-yeon on the phone.

275
00:15:44,157 --> 00:15:45,345
﻿-Hey. Soo-yeon. 
-Is it Soo-yeon ?

276
00:15:45,815 --> 00:15:46,533
﻿Hey, Soo-yeon. -Is it Soo-yeon?

277
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:50,375
﻿Soo-yeon.

278
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,117
﻿Mommy.

279
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,465
﻿I'm sorry I couldn’t visit you yet.

280
00:15:54,506 --> 00:15:56,703
﻿-Soo-yeon. 
-Daddy and Mommy...

281
00:15:57,345 --> 00:15:59,425
﻿-Soo-yeon. 
-will go see you soon, okay?

282
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,023
﻿-Okay. Daddy. 
-Soo-yeon.

283
00:16:02,048 --> 00:16:03,463
﻿Hang in there a bit more.

284
00:16:04,535 --> 00:16:07,051
﻿Listen to Auntie well until we visit.

285
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:10,328
﻿-Soo-yeon. 
-And don't cause any trouble.

286
00:16:10,329 --> 00:16:10,807
﻿Okay.

287
00:16:10,808 --> 00:16:12,566
﻿Soo-yeon!

288
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,943
﻿Give me your phone, please.

289
00:16:14,051 --> 00:16:15,808
﻿Let me see her one more time.

290
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:17,360
﻿Please.

291
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:20,955
﻿You saw Soo-yeon's doing fine.

292
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,973
﻿Where is she?

293
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:26,386
﻿-Where is Soo-yeon right now? 
-Sit.

294
00:16:27,669 --> 00:16:28,908
﻿Sit down.

295
00:16:37,898 --> 00:16:42,506
﻿I will not ask why you told Woo Tae-ho
those things.

296
00:16:42,886 --> 00:16:43,402
﻿Instead,

297
00:16:44,184 --> 00:16:47,180
﻿do not testify in person in court.

298
00:16:48,471 --> 00:16:50,325
﻿If the police keep pressing hard,

299
00:16:50,606 --> 00:16:56,519
﻿tell them you made up the story because
you despised me and missed Soo-yeon dearly.

300
00:16:57,052 --> 00:17:00,553
﻿You had that conversation
only with Woo Tae-ho and not with the police.

301
00:17:01,006 --> 00:17:05,668
﻿So you will not suffer any damages
even if you say that.

302
00:17:06,432 --> 00:17:08,465
﻿We need to go to the US to meet Soo-yeon.

303
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:12,331
﻿You miss her, don't you?

304
00:17:12,802 --> 00:17:14,739
﻿I'm good as long as she’s doing fine.

305
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:18,021
﻿Earlier. Soo-yeon called you Daddy.

306
00:17:18,828 --> 00:17:20,066
﻿So you've accepted her.

307
00:17:21,517 --> 00:17:21,997
Right?

308
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:33,319
﻿Go to your father and tell him
that he has a granddaughter now.

309
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:34,964
﻿What?

310
00:17:35,382 --> 00:17:36,382
In other words,

311
00:17:37,281 --> 00:17:39,888
﻿acknowledge Soo-yeon
as the granddaughter of your family.

312
00:17:39,913 --> 00:17:40,632
﻿Only then...

313
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:44,986
can she live well even without me.

314
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:46,984
﻿I don't care what happens to me.

315
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:49,702
﻿Do as I say.

﻿Did you think it up yourself?

320

﻿I thought from Woo Tae-ho's point of view.

321
00:18:18,781 --> 00:18:20,428
﻿What would he have done at the moment

322
00:18:21,288 --> 00:18:26,021
﻿he found out that his beloved Jung Hee-joo
was not a victim of serial murder?

323
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:31,256
﻿He was a prosecutor. So naturally,
﻿he would've tried to find the murder motive.

324
00:18:32,595 --> 00:18:36,291
﻿We just have to find and take the path
Woo Tae-ho had.

﻿But will they give us the data we want

329

﻿You want to drag me down
one way or the other, don't you?

330
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:17,806
﻿Do you think you'd get my position then?

331
00:19:18,047 --> 00:19:19,804
﻿But Dad will not choose you.

332
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,600
﻿You're the only one who thinks we're a family.

333
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,819
﻿-I know. 
-You do?

334
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:28,681
﻿Then just take what we give you.

335
00:19:29,115 --> 00:19:31,392
﻿Stop being greedy and lose everything.

336
00:19:31,393 --> 00:19:34,389
﻿And I'm always grateful for what you give me.

337
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,425
﻿That is why Tae-ho and I cleaned up after you.

338
00:19:38,611 --> 00:19:40,608
﻿But you made a mistake again.

339
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:43,699
﻿And I'm only trying to settle that.

﻿Don't smile.

343
00:19:53,441 --> 00:19:55,957
﻿You just want to take revenge for your mom.

344
00:19:56,245 --> 00:19:58,164
﻿Because you think she died because of me.

345
00:19:59,315 --> 00:20:00,592
﻿It was her choice.

346
00:20:01,553 --> 00:20:05,181
﻿She thought it'd be better
to die than to live in a nightmare.

﻿Yes, we have it stored.

so she could sneak away that laptop.

371
00:22:02,672 --> 00:22:07,146
﻿So they didn't want the prosecution
to have something saved in the laptop.

372

﻿That's why that night. Jung Hee-joo...

375

﻿Should I send that video to Ms. Cheon?

376
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:19,773
﻿Then the chairman will probably see it too.

that Cheon Sang-woo made you do it.

﻿Cheon Sang-woo ordered you

﻿Cheon Sang-woo came to my shop once.

﻿When I met him a few days ago,

﻿What did he say when he came?

399
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:40,127
﻿He said horrible things about Hee-joo.

400
00:23:40,287 --> 00:23:46,599
﻿Later on. I realized that
he knew about her relationship with Mr. Woo.

401
00:23:47,482 --> 00:23:50,875
﻿He sent those pictures to Hee-joo, right?

402
00:23:51,116 --> 00:23:52,114
﻿That's right.

403
00:23:52,634 --> 00:23:56,635
﻿Then why did he even come to me
and try to pry into her?

404
00:23:57,349 --> 00:23:59,812
﻿Then what about your grandfather?

405
00:24:01,744 --> 00:24:04,221
﻿He didn't seem all that healthy.

406

﻿What are you saying?

407
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:11,772
﻿I'm saying he might experience that fiery pit
before you do.

408

of the assault from two years ago.</i>

409

﻿Woo Tae-ho kept the footage of
Cheon Sang-woo's assault case on the laptop.

﻿So Cheon Sang-woo killed Jung Hee-joo?

﻿Is that the story?

419

﻿Besides, she knew another weakness that he had.

420
00:24:56,693 --> 00:25:00,320
﻿And once the chairman figures out
why you assaulted Min-ji,

421
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:02,920
﻿he'll be greatly disappointed.

422

﻿She found out that Cheon Sang-woo had a child
out of wedlock with Kim Min-ji.

﻿He was after becoming the next chairman.

424
00:25:10,118 --> 00:25:12,195
﻿So he needed to silence her.

425
00:25:13,827 --> 00:25:16,343
﻿Isn't that enough of a motive?

426

1102
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:05,190
simply because you told him to talk to her?

1103
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:16,206
﻿Jung Hee-joo

1104
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:19,548
was a wicked woman.

1105
01:06:20,468 --> 01:06:21,644
﻿She had lots of men too.

1106
01:06:23,734 --> 01:06:27,219
﻿She even shared a bed
with Choi Yong-geun, her manager.

1107
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:32,335
﻿But when she was drawn to Woo Tae-ho,

1108
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:33,813
﻿Choi Yong-geun got jealous.

1109
01:06:35,220 --> 01:06:36,412
﻿I believe

1110
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:41,605
﻿my orders became a good excuse
for him to dispose of Jung Hee-joo.

1111
01:06:49,558 --> 01:06:52,114
﻿This is the dashcam footage from Gi Dong-jae,

﻿who is suspected of killing Jung Hee-joo.

1113
01:06:54,952 --> 01:06:56,509
﻿Because of a car accident,

1114
01:06:56,947 --> 01:06:59,586
﻿his dashcam was stored
in the Police Station's Traffic Department.

1115
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:02,942
﻿The woman in front was Gi Dong-jae’s girlfriend.

1116
01:07:03,321 --> 01:07:05,539
﻿And in the passenger seat was him back then.

1117
01:07:08,617 --> 01:07:09,025
﻿What?

1118

﻿Jung Hee-joo?

1119

after discussing it with Mr. Choi.</i>

1122
01:07:28,023 --> 01:07:30,060

1123
01:07:32,306 --> 01:07:34,069

1129
01:07:54,448 --> 01:07:55,939
﻿"You only have to kill her."

1130
01:07:58,803 --> 01:07:59,642
﻿"Got it?"

1131
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:35,603
<i>﻿What was my brother like in person?</i>

1132
01:08:35,604 --> 01:08:37,920
﻿He was more of a jerk than I thought.

1133
01:08:37,945 --> 01:08:40,238
<i>﻿There must be a bug or a hidden camera.</i>

1134
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:41,556
<i>﻿Search thoroughly.</i>

1135

﻿Woo Tae-ho?
