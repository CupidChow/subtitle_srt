00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,930
Why isn't he coming?

4
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:35,180
Hello. Hello.

5
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:38,390
What?

6
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:42,900
When the news of Writer Yeon Seok's appearance spread,

7
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:46,850
we received ten times more questions than we usually do.

8
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:49,350
I will introduce you to a few of them.

9
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,140
I will read them as realistically as possible.

10
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,720
"Second. Moon. Rises."

11
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,540
"'The Day the Second Moon Rises' is my favorite.

12
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,860
A desperate reincarnation romance that crosses between Joseon and Gyeonseong!

13
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,590
I am curious about how you did your research for this book.

14
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,710
How they felt.

15
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,150
The description of the background.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,390
Everything is so detailed.

17
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,190
It's so detailed that there are rumors that

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:18,820
you're from the Joseon era, you're from Gyeonseung, and you're 300 years old."

19
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,630
This is what they sent.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,620
I've experienced it.

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:30,920
Don't tell me... you came here through a time machine.

22
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:33,140
My name is Yeon Seok.

23
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,660
This is my third life.

24
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,320
The reason why I remember my past lives is because...

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,260
of my unfulfilled love.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,920
In our first life, we were a servant and madam...

27
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:06,370
I mean, servant and lady.

28
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:09,750
Why are you so surprised?

29
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,710
My Lady.

30
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:17,820
How insolent of you! What are you doing?

31
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:23,310
It was undoubtedly a sad ending for the servant and lady.

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,230
My Lord! I'm sorry! My Lord!

33
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,380
My Lord! I'm sorry!

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,660
Such a pain in the butt. Let's go.

35
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:54,370
In our second lives, we were each other's first love...

36
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,580
Thank you.

37
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,780
...and last.

38
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,210
We're leaving together after this operation, right?

39
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:09,020
Of course. I'll be back before dawn.

40
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,890
Stop!

41
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,020
Stop right there!

42
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,490
However, my third life is different.

43
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,830
I'm now in South Korea in the year 2022.

44
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:37,810
And I am...

45
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:40,580
A renowned web novelist.

46
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:43,490
Money? I have a lot.

47
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,600
My looks?

48
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,330
Well, as you can see...

49
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,370
I'm handsome.

50
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:58,000
And I know how to enjoy some romance.

51
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,180
I may be a bit immoral if I say this while smiling but...

52
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:08,860
I'm an orphan. I have no parents or relatives.

53
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,700
To put it simply, there's no hindrance to my love.

54
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,790
There's only one reason why I write novels.

64
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,940
I will love you passionately.

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,680
Excuse me.

66
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,640
- Do you know him?
- No, I don't.

67
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:36,870
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,870
It's okay.

69
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:55,940
So, you followed her because you thought she was Jeong Ha Yeon?

70
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,990
Hey! You can find her.

71
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,560
I know! You said I can find her!

72
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,830
You said I can find her on the day of the first full moon when I turn 20!

73

Who are you?

77
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,930

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,510

79
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,570
Just tell me.

80
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:35,190
Do you want to become a nobleman?

81
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,970
A scholar?

82
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,930
Then, do you want to become rich?

83
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,240
Love.

84
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,400
What?

85
00:07:55,400 --> 00:08:00,230
I want you to fulfill my love.

86
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:05,790
I've been held captive for the past 300 years for this reason.

87
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,670
What? If it's been that long, then I'm the incompetent one?

88
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:14,570
Even a 1,000-year-old nine-tailed fox will have trouble granting a wish that connects with another person!

89
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,610
There's a full moon right now!

90
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,540

91

This is 63!

94
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,330
Are you sure she's reincarnated?

95
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:35,980
How many times do I have to tell you? They were born on the same day as you.

96
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,430
The Birth Grandmother told me.
(T/N: In Korean folktale, the birth grandmother was a goddess who oversaw the woman's pregnancy journey till birth)

97
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:39,520
Then it's one or the other.

98
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:44,350
Either that grandma lied to you or you became powerless.

99
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:47,390
Or is it because it's not your business? Am I right?

100
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:50,800
Since this is my last life, you're pretending to look for her and then leave.

See you.

110
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:25,010
A signal that I couldn't catch for the past five years... suddenly gets caught?!

111
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,550
I'm pretty sure it's in this area.
