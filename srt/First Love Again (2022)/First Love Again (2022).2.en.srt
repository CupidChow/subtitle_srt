00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,950
By any chance... are you Writer Yeon Seok?

4
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm a fan of yours! I even saw your yesterday's Youtube broadcast.

5
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,240
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,760
Please look through it and call me when you're ready.

00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,270
She was reborn as a man in this life.

8
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:54,050
Three hundred years ago,

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,570
I was a slave named Dol Soe.

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,350
- Dol Soe!
- Yes, Sir!

11
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,190
- Dol Soe!
- Yes, Sir!

12
00:01:08,190 --> 00:01:10,600
- Dol Soe!
- Yes, Sir!

13
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:14,630
- Dol Soe!
- Yes, Sir!

14
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:22,650
- Dol Soe!
- Yes, Sir!

15
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:33,410
- You can go.
- Yes, Sir.

16
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:40,180
Dol Soe!

17
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,880
Yes!

18
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,450
Yes, My Lady?

19
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:48,160
Sit under the eaves for a bit.

20
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,590
Excuse me?

21
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,440
Oh, okay.

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,580
What's your name?

23
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,280
It's Dol Soe.

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,630
That's not a name. It just means wandering slave.

25
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,780
I'd like you to have a name.

26
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,480
How does Yeon Seok sound?

27
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,960
The word "Yeon" is from my name, which means destiny.
(T/N: Destiny in Korean is "in yeon")

28
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,000
So, it's Yeon Seok.

29
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,040
Why are you so quiet? You don't like it?

30
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,870
Oh, no. I like it.

31
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,470
I really do. Yeon Seok.

32
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,000
You were the one who told me what Dol Soe meant.

33
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,170
- I would like another of this.
- Okay.

34
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,710
Sir, are you all right?

35
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,470
Sir?

36
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:44,590
I'll take him home.

37
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,230
Do you know him?

38
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,650
Yes, sort of...

39
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,390
You!

40
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,390
Mr. Writer, where is your home?

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,640
Mr. Writer, are you okay?

42
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,440
Hey. Who are you?

43
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,620
Mr. Writer, you're very drunk.

44
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,190
- Where is your ho—
- You!

45
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:11,330
You!

46
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:13,860
I'm warning you...

47
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,420
Don't show your face in front of me again.

48
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,690
Please wait a moment.

49
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,460
Let go!

50
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,420
I can go alone.

51
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,650
Why did I do that?! Why? Why?

52
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,770
I must be crazy.

53
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,500
I wouldn't have unless I was crazy...

54
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,350
What's with that reaction?

55
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,450
Why are you looking at me like that?

56
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,270
Why didn't you tell me?

57
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,210
- What?
- Jeong Ha Yeon.

58
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,010
I told you he was at the restaurant.

59
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,770
Not about that!

60
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:46,200
The fact Jeong Ha Yeon is a man.

61
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,020
- I'm going to stop serializing.
- Okay.

62
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,830
What? Why?

63
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,980
I'll end it within this month.

64
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,540
Hey! Don't start rebelling at your age.

65

I'm serious.

66
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:04,100
Fine.

67
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,880
You're not going to stop me?

68
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,940
All the stories you planned to write are finished.

69
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:13,860
The serialization was extended because of the popularity and your writing. It's about time to write a new one.

70
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,590
I meant I'm going to stop writing.

71
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,660
What?! Why?!

72
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,280
I found Jeong Ha Yeon. There's no need to write anymore.

73
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,140
- What's your plan?
- For what?

74
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,700
You found your husband, so what is your plan now?

75
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,270
What am I supposed to do?

76
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,970
He's a man! Just like me—

77
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:35,600
- He has one of these.
- So what? What's the problem with that?

78
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,940
The problem is we were reborn wrong.

79
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,920
- Wow. You really are a piece of work.
- What?

80
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,500
How are you able to write when you're that stubborn?

81
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,320
Fine. Quit writing. Quit if you want.

82
00:08:56,510 --> 00:09:00,560
I think I... made a mistake yesterday.

83
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,400
Last night...

84
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,630
I hugged him. I hugged Jeong Ha Yeon.

85
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,480
What?

86
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,120
No! Not like that. I only hugged him. Embrace! Hug!

87
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,740
I didn't say anything.

88
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,320
So how was it?

89

Why are you here?

92
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,460
Because you're here.

93
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:02,710
Can you do this at work?

94
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:05,980
I'm off now.

95
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:08,540

You aren't sick, are you?

97
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,970
What? No.

98
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,080
That's a relief.

99
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,700
I thought you were injured or something.

100
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,690
So why did you come to Korea?

101
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:30,850
I already told you. Because you're here.

102
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:34,000
Be serious.

103
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,550
I just... missed it.

104

00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,030
Yeah. What about you?

107
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,950
Is work doable?

108
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:33,390
It's because this is a manhwa.
(T/N: Manhwa is Korean comics)

109
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,180
This is just a manhwa.

Hello, Mr. Writer! I'm a new editor from Sin Bi Books.

Mr. Writer?

117

Why did she do something I didn't even ask for?

118
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:32,820
Hello! I'm a new editor from Sin Bi Books—

119
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:36,140
I told you not to show up in front of me ever again, didn't I?

120
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,410
So you do remember me.

121
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm David, the new editor.

122
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:43,800
I don't need an editor.

123
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,200
But the CEO told me you did.

124
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:54,330
I'm just an employee. If the company orders it, then I have to do it.

- What are you scheming?
- I do need him.

139
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:37,760
I'm not scheming anything. Jeong Ha Yeon applied for the job himself.

00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:43,420
Ah. I saw that they use English names in the company.

My name is Jeong Ha Yeon.

158
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,670
It's similar to your name, isn't it? Ha Yeon. Yeon Seok.

159
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,110
It's not similar at all.

How does Yeon Seok sound?

The word "Yeon" is from my name, which means destiny.

00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:37,470
♫ You are my one and only first love ♫

183
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:40,740
[Next Story]
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

184
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,220
Mr. Writer.

185
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,720
Mr. Writer, have you ever experienced something like that?

186
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,400
Like your stories.

187
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,060
Love.

188
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:53,790
Love that makes you desperate.

189
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:58,140
Have you, Ha Yeon?

190
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,370
I have that kind of love.

191
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:01,490
Mr. Writer, you should head on home now.

192
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,800
How can I entrust drunk Ha Yeon to you?

193
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,960
Isn't his Jin Hyuk better than a writer he met a couple of days ago?

194
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,180
Why didn't you tell me?

195
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,720
Would it change anything if I said something?

196
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,440
Stop making excuses. You know very well who the one is you've been looking for.

197
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,050
Don't tell me you're confused.

198
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:19,850
How could I not be?
