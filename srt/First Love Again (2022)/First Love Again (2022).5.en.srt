[First Love, Again]

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,580
The moment you doubt about whether you could be this happy,

4
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,460
misfortune happens as if it was mocking happiness.

5
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:41,190
It's here.

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,410
Go in.

7
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:50,170
You have to let go first before I can go.

8
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,100
Jeong Ha Yeon!

9
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,540
I didn't expect to see you here, Mr. Writer.

10
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,570
I know.

11
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,690
Is this your boyfriend?

12
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:23,820
You know he's not.

13
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,350
Let's talk inside.

14
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:28,880
I'm sorry, but I need to talk to my sister today, Jin Hyuk.

15
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,420
He's my guest.

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,910
If you have time, how about you join us for a drink?

17
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,620
Mr. Writer has to go back. He also brought his car.

18
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,600
Sure.

19
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,080
- What's going on?
- I'll explain later.

20
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,660
Are you dating him?

21
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,740
It's not like that.

22
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,550
You should've dated Jin Hyuk instead.

23
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:09,530
Why are you bringing him up now?

24
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:14,030
Just don't let Father find out. I can't help you with this.

25
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:34,790
Do you have something you want to say to me? You're going to bear a hole in my head.

26
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:37,360
What's your relationship with Ha Yeon?

27
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,980
Are you asking as a friend?

28
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,010
Ha Yeon is cute, right?

29
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:49,620
He's bright, honest, and smart.

30
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,810
I know that.

31
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,540
Did you also know this?

32
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:03,420
Ha Yeon has a lot more on his shoulders than you think.

33
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,920
Having a lot on one's shoulders means there's a lot one can lose.

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,730
What are you trying to say?

35
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:14,670
Don't sway him simply because you're in the heat of the moment.

36
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,630
He has a place to go back to.

37
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:25,470
I'm pretty sure it's not by your side. Don't you think you're being nosy?

38
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,430
I'm just worried... because we're like family.

39
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,880
You're more cowardly than I thought.

40
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,260
I have nothing to lose but Jeong Ha Yeon.

41
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,980
Because he's the only thing I want to protect.

42
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,920
In the heat of the moment? Not at all.

43
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,660
I won't let Jeong Ha Yeon go.

44
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,350
I won't let him go, no matter where he goes back to.

45
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,090
Did they seriously… get drunk by drinking four cans of beer?

46
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,600
Jeong Ha Yeon?

47
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,930
Don't go.

48
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,800
Jeong Ha Yeon.

49
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,580
Did the General Manager go to work?

50
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:29,760
She went to work and Jin Hyuk went to practice.

51
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,660
Did he sleep here, too?

52
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,510
Probably?

53
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:36,980
This place is closer to the stadium than his home.

54
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,690
Is he an athlete?

55
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,870
Yes, he's a baseball player.

56
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:43,930
He couldn't be… that Kim Jin Hyuk?

57
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,360
You know him, too?

58
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,420
Yeah...

59
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,640
I didn't think you would be interested (in sports).

60
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,620
I guess I will now.

61
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,280
Excuse me?

62
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,670
Why would someone who was in America come to Korea?

63
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:01,800
He said he missed Korea.

64
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,310
Mr. Writer?

65
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,520
Wow, did you cook this yourself?

66
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,910
My sister cooked it before she left.

67
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,850
Why? Do you like someone who can cook well?

68
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:24,140
No. I like you, Jeong Ha Yeon.

69
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,160
How can you say that with a straight face?

70
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,320
Because it's the truth.

71
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,640
♫ Love you baby, love you baby ♫

72
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,600
What about you, Ha Yeon?

73
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,770
Are you asking if I like someone who can cook well?

74
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:42,140
I wasn't, but we can start with that.

75
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,410
It'll be nice if they can cook well.

76
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,460
I guess I'll have to register in a cooking school now.

77
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:49,590
Excuse me?

78
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:52,140
You're already good.

79
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:58,380
And? I think you have more to say.

80
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,020
You don't?

81
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:04,710
♫ Only you ♫

82
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:06,630
I like you.

83
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,860
Hello.

84
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,450
Mr. Writer! What brings you here?

85
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,420
I came to give the manuscript for the last episode.

86
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,040
Why didn't you send it by email?

87
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,970
It's because… it's the last episode.

88
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,630
I'm seeing you quite often. You used to hate coming to the office.

89
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,150
I don't hate it anymore.

90
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,850
You might as well just clock in every day.

91
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,650
Why are you empty-handed? Where's the manuscript?

92
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,660
Who carries a manuscript around these days? I sent it by e-mail.

93
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:56,100
[The Day the Second Moon Rises]
[Final Episode]

94
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:59,230
- I see the ending has changed.
- Yes.

95
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:03,070
You were so firm on not changing the ending.

96
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,000
I really want this love to have a happy ending.

97
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,690
Shouldn't we have a party for finalizing?

98
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:16,600
This is the end of a three years serialization.

99
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:20,150
But Mr. Writer really hates that kind of thing.

100
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,890
There's a way to make him not hate it.

101
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,480
You surprised me.

102
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,770
- When did you get here?
- Just now.

103
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:28,810
How do you do it?

104
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,740
Mr. Writer, about us dating…

105
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:42,720
I want to keep it a secret…

106
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,920
from the people in the company and my sister.

107
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,180
Are you angry?

108
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:52,560
No. I understand.

109
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,080
That's a relief.

110
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,470
But is it a secret even to that friend?

111
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:05,200
Do you mean Jin Hyuk?

112
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,910
Why are you laughing? I'm serious.

113
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,310
You're not jealous, are you?

114
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,790
I'm just joking.

115
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,980
Yes, I'm jealous.

116
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,350
You told me you were always together with him.

117
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:26,390
You even lived with him in America.

118
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:31,360
It feels like he knows different sides of you that I don't know. I can't help but be jealous.

119
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,010
Especially with "Jjin Hyuk."

120
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:37,550
Why do you call him by a nickname when you call me "Mr. Writer" all the time?

121
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,130
Well, I know I'm being childish,

122
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,440
but just think of it as that I like you a lot

123
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,450
and think fondly of it.

124
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:50,480
It's not childish. I feel the same way.

125
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,250
You said before

126
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,740
that you like that I'm interested

127
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,040
and curious about you.

128
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,930
I feel that way, too.

129
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:03,140
I want you to be more curious about me,

130
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,730
and like me even more.

131
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,570
- Mr. Jeong Ha Yeon.
- Yes?

132
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:18,240
What's your favorite color?

133
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,020
Sky blue and white.

134
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:22,980
Sky blue and white.

135
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,450
What's your favorite drink?

136
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,910
- Strawberry yogurt smoothie.
- Strawberry yogurt smoothie.

137
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,470
By the way, how many questions do you have left?

138
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,700
Are you really going to ask all of these?

139
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,740
Of course!

140
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,290
- Just one moment.
- Okay.

141
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,620
Next question.

142
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:55,710
What's your favorite book?

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,950
The Day the Second Moon Rises.

144
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,480
Why do you like it?

145
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,170
Is it because I wrote it?

146
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,350
First of all, it's entertaining,

147
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,170
and the concept is good, too.

148
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:12,690
What I liked the most was that I could relate to how the protagonist felt.

149
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,430
Honestly, I didn't really like romance novels before I read yours.

150
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,740
They didn't interest me,

151
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,760
nor felt like they had something to do with me.

152
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,040
But this touched me so desperately.

153
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,520
The feelings the protagonist had.

154
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:33,490
- Because it's about you.
- Excuse me?

155
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:39,060
I mean... I-I wrote this as

156
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,000
I imagined meeting you.

157
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,410
Did you say to other people that this is about them, too?

158
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:48,040
No. I never even dated anyone.

159
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,270
Come on. I think you're lying.

160
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,720
I'm telling the truth! You're my first love!

161
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,280
Why are you laughing?

162
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,780
Because you're cute. I'll believe you.

163
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:20,130
Mr. Writer.

164
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,360
I left something at the office. Can you come with me?

165
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,800
- Right now?
- Yes.

166
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,400
Okay.

167
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,180
Do we really have to do this? We don't even know when he'll be here.

168
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,900
David said he'll bring him for sure.

169
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,980
I doubt it... Will he listen to David?

170
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:41,970
He probably will.

171
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:43,870
- You surprised me!
- When did you get here!?

172
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,680
Just now.

173
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,380
There! They're coming.

174
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,250
What are you here for?

175
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:04,200
Ta-da! Congratulation on completing your novel!

176
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,660
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

177
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,020
Is this why you asked me to come here?

178
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,160
See? I told you he would hate it.

179
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,640
See? I told you he would like it.

180
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,460
Well, thank you.

181
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,890
You should all go home now.

182
00:14:34,890 --> 00:14:36,510
What are you saying?!

183
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:38,030
It's time to start the real party!

184
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,010
Then you guys can party. I'll be leaving.

185
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:46,090
Come on, Mr. Writer. They waited all day to congratulate you.

186
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:53,250
Well... all right, then.

187
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,960
Ha Yeon, everything about you is great,

188
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,500
but I wish you were a little more meticulous and faster when working.

189
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,790
Do you like Jeong Ha Yeon that much?

190
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:11,000
- The same goes for that. Honestly speaking,
- Yes, I like him so much.

191
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,910
don't you think coming thirty minutes to an hour earlier

192
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,500
isn't that hard. Right?
- What do you like so much about him?

193
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:18,250
- How about you come that early and clean this place up?
- Is it because it's Jeong Ha Yeon that you've been looking for since your past lives?

194
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,950
Just because it's Jeong Ha Yeon.

195
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,070
He isn't as elegant as before. He's goofier.

196
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,990
He's a man. He's like a different person.

197
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,830
Even so, I just like him.

198
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:36,470
You really have fallen in love.

199
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,560
But...

200
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,520
aren't you leaving?

201
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:46,220
I was about to.

202
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:48,840
Everyone, it's getting late. How about we go now?

203
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:50,530
Mr. Writer needs to rest.

204
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,710
Aren't we going for a second round?

205
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:56,660
We'll go for a second round on our own.

206
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:04,310
Let's go.

207
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,320
Can't you stay with me today?

208
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,640
There are other people around.

209
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,770
Mr. Ha Yeon, aren't you coming?

210
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:21,230
♫ Like a tattoo, your name ♫

211
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:25,480
I really hated being crowded.

212
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:33,800
But this is nice. Maybe because you're with me.

213
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,940
Mr. Writer.

214
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,880
How about we speak casually with each other?

215
00:16:43,630 --> 00:16:46,760
We don't have to if you feel uncomfortable.

216
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,460
Ha Yeon.

217
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,610
Actually, I wanted to address you like this from the start.

218
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:03,290
Please say my name, too. No. Say my name.
(T/N: He first said it formally, then corrected himself to say it informally)

219
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,970

222
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,900
I'd like you to have a name.

223
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,900
How does Yeon Seok sound?

224
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,800
Say, do you know the meaning of a forget-me-not flower?

225
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:14,670
You should personally find out later.

226
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,870
Ha Yeon!

227
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,240
Sir?

228
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,430
You!

229
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:07,510
Hey. Who are you?

230
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,410
Ta-da!

231
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:15,670
I'm sorry.

232
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,760
When did you start liking me?

233
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,320
From when we first met.

234
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,380
I love you, Ha Yeon.

235
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:32,420
Was it really me that you loved?

236
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,870
Hello, Mr. Writer. I'm Jeong Ha Jin.

237
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,950
Jeong Ha Yeon?

238
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,710
Don't go.

[Epilogue]
- Mr. Jeong Ha Yeon.
- Yes?

249
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,850
What's your favorite color?

250
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,620
Sky blue and white.

251

Strawberry yogurt smoothie.

254
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:45,460
Strawberry yogurt smoothie.

255
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,680
By the way, how many questions do you have left?

256

Are you really going to ask all of these?

259
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:59,300
Of course!

260
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,400
- Just one moment.
- Okay.

261
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,710

It didn't feel realistic.

266
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:27,220
What was real? What was fiction?

267
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,370
Or was it all just a dream?

268
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:32,250
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

269
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:36,970
Why were you so mean to me? Why did you change your mind?

270
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:41,680
I thought we felt the same, but now I don't know anymore.

271
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:46,370
Do you want to go with me? You originally wanted to attend graduate school there.

272
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,610
Let's go back together.

273
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:54,000
How long are you going to be around Ha Yeon using the excuse you're his friend? Don't you think that's cowardly?

274
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,060
That's why I'm not going to be his friend anymore.

275
00:22:56,060 --> 00:23:00,180
Ha Yeon and I are going back to America together.

276
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,350
I used to think like this.

277
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:05,480
To simply put it, "I'll go see you because I miss you."

278
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:12,290
But now, I think I may have been selfish.

279
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:16,870
I learned that, although my feelings are important,

280
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:19,820
the other person's feeling of wanting to see me or not is more important.
