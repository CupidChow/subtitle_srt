[First Love, Again]

3
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:39,760
Ha Yeon... I can explain everything.

4
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:42,450
I don't think he wants to hear it!

5
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:46,360
Go ahead first.

6
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,290
Okay.

7
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,400
Let's go somewhere inside and talk.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,230
Just talk here.

9
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:06,140
Mr. Writer... what is your true identity?

10
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:09,610
Did you know everything,

11
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,140
since the first time you saw me?

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,960
Then, why didn't you say anything!?

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,670
I didn't want to... confuse you, too.

14
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,440
- Did you even like me?
- Ha Yeon!

15
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:28,370
Liking me from the start... was a lie.

16
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,860
- I meant it.
- It wasn't me who you liked.

17
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,930
You just couldn't forget the women from your past life.

18
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,720
Am I wrong?

19
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:42,270
I don't even know who you

20
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:44,660
nor I am anymore.

21
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,750
I don't know who you like... even more.

22
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:54,480
My head hurts so much, but just the idea of thinking scares me.

23
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:58,040
I feel like everything is messed up because of you, Mr. Writer!

24
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,880
So, I don't want to see you anymore.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,100
Ha Yeon, please...

26
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,310
Even that name... Stop saying it.

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,410
Please stop now. I ask of you.

28
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,170
I'm just going to think this was all a dream.

29
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,390
[On the Day the Second Moon Rises]

30
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,960
It didn't feel real.

31
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,440
What was real? What was fiction?

32
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,880
Or was it all just a dream?

33
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:32,440
Why didn't you tell me from the start?

34
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,440
Why were you so mean to me?

35
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,120
Why did you change your mind?

36
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,410
I thought we felt the same,

37
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,330
but now I don't know anymore.

38
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:53,360
[Sister]

39
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,140
How am I going to face my sister?

40
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,810
What's wrong with your voice? Are you sick?

41
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,810
Ha Yeon... didn't come.

42
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:45,220
Jeong Ha Yeon didn't come.

43
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,310
You're making a fuss.

44
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,970
You do know it's not even time for work, right? Also, your work is over.

45
00:07:51,970 --> 00:07:54,700
He'll be coming to work at the office starting today.

46
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,830
Hey, did something happen to you?

47
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,560
[Resignation]

48
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:41,010
What's with that face?

49
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,310
Why did you come?

50
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:46,990
You should at least invite someone to sit when they come.

51
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,370
Did you drink all this?

52
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,910
Such a typical move. A typical move for break-ups.

53
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:02,420
Don't tell me you also cried while holding onto a photo?

54
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,980
Or texting him early in the morning?

55
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:09,360
So why did you come?

56
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:20,690
[Resignation]

57
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:24,530
It's my turn to ask. What happened?

58
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,020
I think Jeong Ha Yeon found out about everything.

59
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,880
Found out about what?

60
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:40,230
Our story. Meeting in the past lives, the reincarnation,

61
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,660
and meeting again.

62
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,760
- I think he found out about everything.
- How?

63
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,010
Don't tell me, he saw the picture?

64
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,220
You should've been careful!

65
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,820
I'll look for him. It won't take long.

66
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,680
Don't.

67
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,060
He ran away because of me.

68
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,390
He said everything felt messed up because of me.

69
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:26,610
He said he was scared, in pain, and didn't want to see me.

70
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:31,450
So what am I supposed to say when I find him when he feels that way?

71
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:37,340
What can I do? He's suffering because of me.

72
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:43,300
How do you feel?

73
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,910
I'm a mess too because Jeong Ha Yeon is gone.

74
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:55,890
It's scary and painful to think that he

75
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:01,000
won't be in my life anymore, and I feel bad.

76
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:05,700
But I miss him so much.

77
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:15,710
He said he doesn't know who I actually liked.

78
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:20,900
He said he doesn't know if it's him I like or the woman

79
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,480
from my past lives.

80
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,670
So what did you say?

81
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,540
I couldn't answer.

82
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:32,460
My mind went blank when I heard him say that.

83
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,610
I did look for Jeong Ha Yeon at first because of that.

84
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:43,710
I thought they were all the same person.

85
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,460
Maybe I was being too selfish.

86
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,180
Let me ask you one thing.

87
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:55,350
Who is it that you like right now?

88
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,430
Jeong Ha Yeon.

89
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,100
Jeong Ha Yeon, who looks beautiful smiling.

90
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:06,440
Jeong Ha Yeon, who looks beautiful crying.

91
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:12,580
Jeong Ha Yeon, who is a man.

92
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:21,610
The one who ate with me at this house.

93
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,950
The one who slept with me.

94
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,720
The one who watched movies and joked with me.

95
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,360
The current Jeong Ha Yeon.

96
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:48,630
What do I do, Sin Bi?

97
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,340
What am I supposed to do?

98
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,040
Breakfast delivery.

99
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,590
I told you that you could stay over at my place.

100
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:08,850
I wanted some time alone. Also, my sister knows where your place is.

101
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,110
Are you going through puberty?

102
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:13,930
Your sister is making a fuss, demanding to know where you are.

103
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,810
So, did you tell her?

104
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,950
What do you take me as?

105
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:19,690
Thank you.

106
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:23,570
- Ha Yeon.
- Yes?

107
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,920
I'm going back to America next (baseball) season.

108
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,830
That soon?

109
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:35,320
This place is a bit too small for me.
(T/N: He's saying he's too good to be here)

110
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:38,150
I think you've become more brazen.

111
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,430
That's the only way you can survive.

112
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,420
Do you want to go with me?

113
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:50,610
You originally wanted to attend graduate school there. Let's go back together.

114
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,880
Go back...

115
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,450
I go back to the major leagues, and you get your master's degree.

116
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:03,180
If you want to run away, let's do it together.

117
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:08,420
Whether it's for one, three, or ten years, let's stay there together.

118
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,880
If you don't answer again...

119
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,060
I'll go to the extent of hiring someone to...

120
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,020
Yeah, Sis?

121
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,830
Yeah? Yeah?

122
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:00,460
Did you really say that?

123
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:04,380
Are you rebelling? Are you going through puberty?

124
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,600
Why did you run away when you're all grown up?

125
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,210
- If you're sorry, come to the company right–
- I'm here.

127
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,890
You're here?

128
00:16:16,210 --> 00:16:17,720
What's with this situation?

129
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,590
It's a situation where two close siblings are here to greet their father.

130
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:23,380
Is this a new type of rebellion?

131
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:27,960
I'm only going to let it go this once.

132
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,990
Thanks, Sis.

133
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:35,220
What really is this? Also, what's with that cringy comment.

134
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:45,900
Did something happen? Did Mr. Writer cheat on you?

135
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:48,750
Mr. Writer and I don't have that kind of relationship.

136
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:52,240
It's here. Let's go.

137
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:10,030
[Sin Bi]

138
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,720
Hello?

139
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,010
I found Jeong Ha Yeon.

140
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,560
I didn't expect to see you here, Mr. Writer.

141
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,080
What are you doing here?

142
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,870
Is it strange to come to meet a friend?

143
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:29,160
How long are you going to be around Ha Yeon using the excuse you're his friend?

144
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,350
Don't you think that's cowardly?

145
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,240
That's why I'm not going to be his friend anymore.

146
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,440
Ha Yeon and I are going back to America together.

147
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,980
We won't be back in Korea for at least two years this time.

148
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,690
It could be longer, or we could even stay and live there.

149
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,370
I'm going to confess to him, too.

150
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:02,350
It's about time for Ha Yeon to come down. Are you going to keep waiting for him?

151
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,190
I think he'd feel uncomfortable.

152
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:10,390
Or maybe even cry again.

153
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,640
What are you doing here?

154
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,120
I came to catch you, in case you run away from me.

155
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,280
What? When did you get here?

156
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,770
Just now.

157
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,420
Let's go, Young Master.

158
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,770
I told you not to do that.

159
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,810
[One Month Later]

160
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,940
It's been a while since we last had Writer Yeon Seok here.

161
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,540
First of all, congratulations!

162
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,970
Are you all aware that the novel "On the Day the Second Moon Rises" is being adapted into a movie?

163
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,840
We're curious about how you feel about this.

164
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,150
Hey! Talk.

165
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,980
Answer.

166
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,380
I like it.

167
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,610
It seems Mr. Writer is still stunned about this.

168
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:33,530
Let's get the show started with this program.

169
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,850
A lot of stories were sent to us, even today. Let's read one.

170
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,140
"After my boyfriend and I fought because of a misunderstanding,

171
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:44,500
we broke up in the heat of the moment, and now I really regret it.

172
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:49,180
I miss him but I don't know how he feels.

173
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,270
What should I do?"

174
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:55,180
A sad story was sent to us.

175
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:59,440
Mr. Writer, what do you think they should do in this situation?

176
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:03,050
They should go see him.

177
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,320
They should find them, no matter what, and run to them.

178
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,450
You're indeed the romanticist of the century.

179
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:11,680
I used to think like this.

180
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,900
To simply put it, "I'll go see you because I miss you."

181
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:22,340
But now, I think I may have been selfish.

182
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,280
Why is that?

183
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:30,370
I learned that, although my feelings are important, the other person's feeling of wanting to see me or not

184
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:32,560
is more important, too.

185
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:38,050
However, the person who sent in the story said that they don't know how the other person feels.

186
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:41,370
If you want to know that, don't you think the first thing to do is

187
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:44,080
convey how you feel and clear the misunderstanding?

188
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,000
Even if you really do break up,

189
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:53,840
don't you think you will have a lot of regrets left if the relationship ended badly with misunderstandings?

190
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:00,380
It's not easy to bring up something that hurts each other.

191
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,750
You're right. It's not easy.

192
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:09,410
But I don't think there's a relationship in the world where you won't hurt each other.

193
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,880
Even if you get hurt

194
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,100
or hurt others, you need to overcome that

195
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:17,880
to move one step forward.

196
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,270
Also, it's only possible

197
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:24,670
to get hurt or hurt others when you have a chance.

198
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:29,160
There are times in life when even the opportunity to

199
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:33,130
explain yourself just disappears.

200
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,350
Did I talk too much about myself?

201
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:40,750
Could you read the next story, please, Writer Yeon Seok?

202
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,040
[I miss DAVID...]

203
00:22:34,810 --> 00:22:36,840
I miss him.

204
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,650
- In the middle...
- A little bit.

205
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,880
- It was good.
- It was good overall.

206
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,900
Hello?

207
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:47,580
Ha Yeon's going back to America by plane tonight, Mr. Writer.

208
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:52,040
Ha Yeon's probably waiting for you to hold him back.

209
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,600
Did you forget something?

210
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:20,220
No.

211
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,520
Jeong Ha Yeon!

212
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,360
Don't go.

213
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:55,460
I missed you, too. There wasn't a moment I didn't miss you.

214
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,900
You asked who it is I liked, didn't you?

215
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,470
It's Jeong Ha Yeon.

216
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,920
Jeong Ha Yeon is just Jeong Ha Yeon, and I'm just me.

217
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,340
So! The person I like...

218
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:11,520
is the Jeong Ha Yeon in front of me and only you.

219
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:22,940
I need you to know this... even if you do leave.

220
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:28,730
The person I really love is the current Jeong Ha Yeon.

221
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,530
It's you.

222
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,620
Mr. Writer, are you crying?

223
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,030
I would like to watch this drama more,

224
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:43,580
but I really need to get going.

225
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,100
You better come watch my game next year.

226
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:49,650
- I'll be waiting.
- I'll be there.

227
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:10,920
Did you run here to say that?

228
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,390
You thought I was leaving?

229
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,620
How did you know I was leaving?

230
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,750
Even so, you should've come earlier.

231
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:24,990
