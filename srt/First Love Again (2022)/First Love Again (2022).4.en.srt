[First Love, Again]

3
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,720
Hello! I'm a new editor from Sin Bi Books—

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,020
I told you not to show up in front of me ever again, didn't I?

5
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:36,780
I'm curious as well.

6
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,360
An objective opinion from a reader.

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,790
Mr. Ha Yeon, you take the subway.

8
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,560
Didn't I tell you?

9
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,770
I just don't like you.

10
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:44,710
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:49,540
I mistakenly—

12
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,960
I...

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,240
Why are you apologizing? Did you do something wrong?

14
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,760
You only apologize when you did something wrong.

15
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,250
I'm not sorry.

16
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,610
Wait a minute, Jeong Ha—

17
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,970
What are you doing?

18
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:22,850
I should be the one asking you that.

19
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,750
What's the matter?

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,730
It's nothing.

21
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:55,010
Hey, Jeong Ha Yeon!

22
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,960
How about we go for a drink?

23
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,560
[Sin Bi]

24
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,150
I see you got better at drinking since the last time.

25
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:48,020
My sister said that soju tastes sweet when life is bitter.

26
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,910
I didn't understand those words.

27
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:54,410
How could soju's bitter taste change?

28
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,090
But I think I understand now.

29
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,410
My goodness. You've grown up.

30
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,410
You're really not going to tell me what's going on?

31
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,530
"I'm sorry?"

32
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:33,280
"Mistake?" Did he really think words would be enough?

33
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:42,760
That was my drink.

34
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,210
Let go.

35
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,210
I'll let it go.

36
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,710
Let's go. I'll take you home.

37
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,830
[Ha Yeon's feeling: Is he angry?]
[1. Apologize - He said not to apologize... ]

38
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:07,800
[2. Pretend it didn't happen - Then, we will become like strangers...]

39
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,020
[3.]

40
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,890
[When will you get here?]

41
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,070
[Where are you..?]

42
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,690
Thank you.

43
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,400
Are you... feeling unwell?

44
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,210
No.

45
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:13,030
- Can we talk for a bit?
- Sure. We have to talk.

46
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:15,690
There are three more episodes before it ends, right?

47
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:17,780
The CEO wanted me to confirm.

48
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:23,130
If you want to change something, please let me know now, so we can make the arrangements.

49
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:26,650
Also, please take a look at the cover draft I sent you.

50
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,030
- About the meeting with J Media—
- Not about all that!

51
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:34,170
I'm... I'm sorry.

52
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,010
You seem to have a lot to apologize for.

53
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,910
Let me know a convenient date for next week for the meeting, and I'll try to arrange it.

54
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,050
You're leaving already?

55
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,500
I heard you feel uncomfortable having an editor around when you are finalizing.

56
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,650
Who said that?

57
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,630
The CEO.

58
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:52,740
What nonsense is this.

59
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,460
Then, I'll take my leave.

60
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,480
I'll give you a ride.

61
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:07,210
I have some business with CEO Yoo.

62
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,590
About... yesterday...

63
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:27,000
Yes, CEO?

64
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,400
I'm back.

65
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,190
You're back early.

66
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:35,770
Why are you...

67
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,230
Come with me.

68
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,610
What's going on? And why are you dressed like that?

69
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,630
There's a reason for this.

70
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,450
Let me borrow Ha Yeon for a day.

71
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,410
He's my employee.

72
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,070
About yesterday...

73
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:02,960
I'm sorry.

74
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:07,460
I know how hard you work and how much you think about me.

75
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,510
And yet I...

76
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:13,890
It's my fault.

77
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,480
What are you doing?

78
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,310
I wanted to check if you were sick.

79
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:20,760
You're not the person I know.

80
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,640
Love really is powerful.

81
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,610
It made someone finally act like a human when he was only human by name.

82
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,010
You're making a fuss even when I apologize.

83
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:30,910
I can't just send him to you. Do some outside work.

84
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,020
- Deliver this to J Media.
- Hey!

85
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,980
Just deliver it through a courier service.

86
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,580
I see you don't want to take Jeong Ha Yeon.

87
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,140
Mr. Writer!

88
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,540
Are you all dressed up because it's your birthday?

89
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,930
This is how I'm usually dressed.

90
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:54,400
- David. Could you do some outside work? You can take your things.
-Yes?

91
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,840
Okay.

92
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,980
I'll take my leave.

93
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,530
Where are you going when you're off work now?

94
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,670
I should go home since I'm off.

95
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,660
- I would like to use my wish card.
- What?

96
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,500
Don't you remember? There were even witnesses.

97
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,670
The writer said he'll be your white knight.

98
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:25,930
You know you have to fulfill the writer's wish if he drinks this, right?

99
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,030
- Of course!
- David is drunk!

100
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,310
He's really drunk.

101
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,830
What's your wish?

102
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,210
- Stay with me today.
- What?

103
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,800
Stay with me just for today.

104
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,300
Ha Yeon!

105
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,580
It's okay. I'll do it myself.

106
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,150
It's okay. I'm already done.

107
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:05,820
And you don't really know how to tie your shoelace properly.

108
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:10,220
What brings you here?

109
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,340
I have dinner plans with Ha Jin. If you're done with work, join us.

110
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,960
I'm sorry but I can't. I have a prior engagement.

111
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,480
How about we go eat first? What do you like?

112
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,930
Ha Yeon likes spicy rice cakes.

113
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,810
I didn't ask you!

114
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,850
Come straight home when you're done. I'll be having a drink with your sister.

115
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,170
Sure.

116
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,280
See you around.

117
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,900
Should we head out?

118
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:51,540
You have a child's taste (for food).

119
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:53,300
We could've eaten something more delicious.

120
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,950
I find this is delicious enough.

121
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,170
It's fascinating.

122
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,340
What is?

123
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:02,270
If General Manager Jeon Ha Jin is your sister, that means you're a second-generation chaebol.

124
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:04,920
I didn't know that a second-generation chaebol would eat this.

125
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,380
Are you trying to start a fight or admiring?

126
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,070
I didn't mean it like that. I was just curious.

127
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:15,540
It tastes good.

128
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,200
Are you close with him?

129
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,000
With that friend of yours.

130
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,600
Ah! Jin Hyuk? Yes, we're close.

131
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,670
Since I spent more time with him than with my family.

132
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,050
We lived together in the US.

133
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,270
You lived together?!

134
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,290
Is it that shocking for friends to live together?

135
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:44,120
The way he looks at you isn't how a friend looks at someone.

136
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,340
You can keep eating.

137
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:00,090
Happy birthday.

138
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:03,400
But are you okay with celebrating your birthday with me?

139
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:07,310
Don't you usually celebrate with your family or lover?

140
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,800
I don't have a family nor a lover.

141
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm sorry.

142
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,230
Eat up.

143
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,630
Ha Yeon.

144
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:36,000
About yesterday... I...

145
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,530
Let's not talk about yesterday anymore.

146
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:43,270
It's in the past.

147
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:46,810
The past.

148
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:50,800
[Jjin Hyuk]

149
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,490
I'll be going now. See you on Monday.

150
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,220
Hold on!

151
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,450
I said one day.

152
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:11,850
Which means 24 hours.

153
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,750
There are 12 hours left now.

154
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:22,280
So what are you going to do now?

155
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,770
What?

156
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,460
Now...

157
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,900
What?

158
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,740
[Jjin Hyuk]

159
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,450
You can answer it.

160
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,840
Okay.

161
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,500
What's up, Jin Hyuk?

162
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,910
Why is it so hard to reach you on the phone? I was worried.

163
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:08,630
I'm not a kid. Why worried?

164
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:11,180
I thought you followed someone home because they said they will buy you spicy rice cake.

165
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,180
What did you say? Are you joking with me?

166
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,130
So where are you right now?

167
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:19,770
When will you be done? Should I pick you up?

168
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:22,700
It's okay. I'll see you tomorrow.

169
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,520
- It's over.
- Yes, it is.

170
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:36,530
It ended while you were on the phone.

171
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,530
You're the one who told me to answer.

172
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,480
What friend calls at this hour?

173
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,270
You don't have any friends, do you?

174
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,310
I do!

175
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:53,180
I don't think you do.

176
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:58,250
Then... you should be my friend.

177
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,930
Why would I?

178
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,880
I don't befriend people I've kissed.

179
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,640
What...

180
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,360
Didn't you tell me not to talk about it?

181
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,850
Jeong Ha Yeon?

182
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,630
Ha Yeon.

183
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,120
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,400
What are you sorry about?

185
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm wondering... about what I did wrong.

186
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,790
You keep confusing me.

187
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:56,090
- I'm sorry.
- Stop apologizing!

188
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,380
Are you confused...

189
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,360
because I kissed you and then apologized?

190
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:11,140
I'm sorry.

191
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,430
I wasn't being honest with how I felt.

192
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,930
You told me not to talk about yesterday anymore...

193
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:27,850
since it's in the past.

194
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,270
So I intend to start over now.

195
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,610
I like you.

196
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:37,610
♫ Your name... ♫

197
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:40,500
You said you hated me from the start.

198
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:44,080
- I'm sorry.
- You told me not to show my face in front of you ever again.

199
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,990
I'm sorry for that, too.

200
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,520
No matter who it is, you can't talk to someone like that.

201
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,460
♫ Will it break ♫

202
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,740
I'm sorry.

203
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,800
I endured it because I liked you.

204
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,920
♫ I followed the sound that was calling me ♫

205
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,320
♫ And found you on the other end ♫

206
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,710
♫ You were on the other end of the sound I followed ♫

207
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:16,510
♫  I hear your voice  ♫

208
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:21,950
♫  Call my name. Take my hand  ♫

209
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:26,390
♫  So I can run to you ♫

210
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,490
♫ Now I'm falling, falling, ♫

211
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:32,610
I love you, Ha Yeon.

212
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:37,000
♫ More, more, more, yeah ♫

213
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,460
♫ I'm falling more (in love), oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♫

214
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:45,840
♫ I can't help it now, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  ♫

215
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,630
♫ You know it too ♫

216
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:54,200
♫ Ha, na, na, na ♫

217
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,290
♫ All day, all night ♫

218
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:46,700
♫ All day, all night ♫

219
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:54,700
♫ Love you, baby, love you, baby, and then
you feel so, yes, right ♫

220
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:58,400
Wow! It's really delicious.

221
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,340
Well, I've lived alone for ten years now.

222
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,050
Then, what about your family?

223
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,260
I have no memory of them.

224
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:07,880
I grew up at an orphanage for as long as I can remember.

225
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,230
I'm sorry.

226
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:12,780
Didn't you say you only apologize when you did something wrong?

227
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,230
I like this.

228
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:18,580
I like that you've taken an interest and are curious

229
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,630
about me.

230
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,920
There's another thing I'm curious about.

231
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,070
What is it? I'll tell you everything.

232
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:30,480
Is it okay for you to be playing around like this?

233
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Have you finished the ending?

234
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,040
♫ You make me feel so... ♫

235
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,550

237
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,720

I'm going to... right here.

239
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,910
I heard you feel uncomfortable if someone's around when you're finalizing.

240
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,660
You're an exception.

241
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,150
Excuse me?

242
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,090
You, Jeong Ha Yeon, are an exception.

243
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:03,160
So, stay next to me.

244
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:12,730
Where are you going?

245
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,470
You showed throw those away. They are all withered.

246
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:19,510
Why would I throw them away? They are the first gift you ever gave me.

247
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,960
You also have that.

248
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:24,380
Even so, you can't throw it away.

249
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:28,360
- But how did you know?
- About what?

250
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,130
My favorite flower and the handkerchief.

251
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,510
Don't you remember?

252
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:42,200
I am your fan. It's written in your book.

253
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
I'm also curious about something.

254
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,780
What is it?

255
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,540
When did you start liking me?

256
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,920
300 years ago.

257
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:57,010
From when we first met.

258
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,390
At the restaurant?

259
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,600
Well...

260
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,380
I... I have something I want to give you, too.

261
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,870
This.

262
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,420
Should I put it on you?

263
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,200
Yes.

264
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,010
It's here.

265
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:56,050
Go in.

266
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,840
You have to let go first before I can go.

267
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,760
Jeong Ha Yeon.

What's your relationship with Ha Yeon?

270
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,700
Ha Yeon is cute, right?

271
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,550
He's bright, honest, and smart.

272
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:44,140
What are you trying to say?

273
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:48,020
Don't sway him simply because you're in the heat of the moment.

274
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,360
He has a place to return to.

275
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,520
I don't care where he goes. I won't let him go.

276

Ta-da! Congratulation on completing your novel!

- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

278
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,950
Is this why you asked me to come here?

279
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,650
Is it because it's Jeong Ha Yeon that you've been looking for since the past lives?

280
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,010
Just because it's Jeong Ha Yeon.

281
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,350
He isn't as elegant as before. He's goofier.

282
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:22,420
He's a man. He's like a different person.
