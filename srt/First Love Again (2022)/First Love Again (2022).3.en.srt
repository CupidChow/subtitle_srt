[First Love, Again]

3
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,640
You can't resist loving someone.

4
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,140
What did you just say?

5
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:31,850
Excuse me?

6
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:42,430
It's the line of the new book.

7
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,600
I chose some in advance since I heard we'll be talking about it today.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,550
I like this one.

9
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,960
The readers say that this is a great line, too. What do you think, Mr. Writer?

10
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,030
There are no bad lines.

11
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,160
- What?
- You're... quite narcissistic.

12
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:07,830
Can I have another glass of water?

13
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:23,620
I'm sorry, I'll clean it right—

14
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:26,340
Why are you so careless?

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,810
Will David be okay on his own?

16
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,150
He's probably very okay.

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,040
Just stay still. Don't move an inch.

18
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,640
- I'll–
- You're in the way, so go over there.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,770
But...

20
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,700
Hello?

21
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,680
Come over here if you're done.

22
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,190
Even if you're not done, just come over here.

23
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,890
Okay.

24
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,990
Cheers!

25
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,450
I look forward to working with you.

26
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,110
I look forward to working with you, too.

27
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:39,300
By the way, what brings you here?

28
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,430
You came to an editor's welcome party when you didn't even show up for your birthday party.

29
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,150
21, 22, 23.

30
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,480
24, 25, 26.

31
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,350
27.

32
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,070
28, 29, 30.

33
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:04,370
31.

34
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,550
He lost again!

35
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,060
- Punishment shot!
- Here's your punishment shot.

36
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,170
Thank you.

37
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,090
The writer said he'll be your white knight.

38
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:19,640
When did I say that?

39
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,880
You know you have to fulfill the writer's wish if he drinks this, right?

40
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,970
Of course.

41
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,550
David is drunk.

42
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,190
Are you concerned?

43
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,510
About what?

44
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,420
Stop saying "about what" when you know what I mean.

45
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,600
You should stop smoking. It is bad for your health.

46
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,010
I'm healthy no matter what I do.

47
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,970
Longevity without sickness. Envious?

48
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:04,740
What I mean is that it's bad for my health.

49
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,040
I'm not envious of longevity without sickness. Why would you want to live centuries? It's such a headache.

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,440
I heard other spirits either ascend to Heaven or become human.

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,150
You don't want to?

52
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,440
Yes. Why would I want to be a human? It's such a headache.

53
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,910
Come to tomorrow's meeting. The investor wants to meet you.

54
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,470
Why would an investor want to meet an author?

55
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,380
They're your fan.

56
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,000
Then tell them to come to a fansign event. I'm going now.

57
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,010
I think we need to call it a day.

58
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,330
Where do you live?

59
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:53,490
- Mr. Writer, let's go buy a cup.
- What?

60
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,210
It's my first time seeing a drunk behavior of wanting to go buy a cup.

61
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:02,630
I'm buying it for him, not asking him to buy it for me.

62
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,550
What?

63
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,030
Why?

64
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,480
David, can you get home (on your own)?

65
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:12,370
Yep. Of course.

66
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:14,450
Goodbye.

67
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,850
- Should I call a taxi for you, Mr. Writer?
- See you next time.

68
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,050
Jeong Ha Yeon.

69
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:30,430
Are you okay?

70
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:35,230
Mr. Writer, did you follow me because you were worried?

71
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:38,660
It's because I can't trust you.

72
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:51,420
Mr. Writer, have you ever experienced something like that?

73
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:54,030
Like your stories.

74
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,560
That's a fantasy.

75
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,840
How can a person remember their past life?

76
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:05,120
Love. Love that makes you...

77
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,740
desperate.

78
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:10,210
No, I haven't.

79
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:14,080
Have you, Ha Yeon?

80
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,000
You're calling me by my real name...

81
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,810
when you call others by

82
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,790
"Angel" and "Matt."

83
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,910
I have that kind of love.

84
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,640
Hello. You must be his collegue.

85
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,610
This is the writer.

86
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:58,030
And you are?

87
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:00,490
My Jin Hyuk!

88
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:02,590
He seems really drunk.

89
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:04,910
Mr. Writer, you should head on home now.

90
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,620
Let's go, Ha Yeon.

91
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,690
Goodbye.

92
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:17,590
How can I entrust...

93
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:21,380
How can I entrust drunk Ha Yeon to you?

94
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,810
Instead of a writer that he met a couple of days ago,

95
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:34,210
isn't him better with "his Jin Hyuk", who he has known for twenty years?

96
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,880
Excuse me then.

97
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,780
Dol Soe!

98
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,690
Yes, Sir!

99
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:10,300
Yes, My Lord.

100
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,260
How uneducated you are.

101
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,850
You can go.

102
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,640
Yes, Sir.

103
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,360
Dol Soe!

104
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,460
Yes, Sir!

105
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:28,400
You can go.

106
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,210
Yes, Sir.

107
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,820
Dol Soe!

108
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,830
Yes!

109
00:08:41,410 --> 00:08:42,810
Dol Soe!

110
00:08:42,810 --> 00:08:44,750
Yes, Sir!

111
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,930
Yes, My Lord.

112
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,470
You're here.

113
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,940
Then you can go.

114
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,980
Yes, Sir.

115
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,150
Dol Soe.

116
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,400
You can go.

117
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,360
Dol Soe.

118
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,830
Yes, Sir.

119
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,350
People need to know their place.

120
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:18,750
Knowing your place is what makes you human.

121
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:21,020
Going around not knowing your place

122
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,370
makes you an animal, not a human.

123
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,830
Do you understand?

124
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,530
Yes, Sir.

125
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,400
You can go.

126
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,610
Ha Yeon!

127
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,880
Orabeoni, when did you arrive?
(T/N: Orabeoni means older brother. It was used during the older Korean times)

128
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,190
You look pretty, as always.

129
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:19,800
You're banned from acting like you know me today.

130
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,820
He is trying so hard.

131
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:48,240
Hello.

132
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,800
- By the way, Ha Yeon.
- Yes?

133
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,620
Did you catch a cold? What's with the mask?

134
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:58,360
My throat is hurting a little bit.

135
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:01,300
Hello.

136
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,380
- Hello.
- Hello.

137
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:06,140
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

138
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,110
Did you get home safely yesterday?

139
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:19,580
Yes. Were you worried about me?

140
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,560
Why should I worry when you even had someone to pick you up?

141
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,060
Who was that person?

142
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:32,110
"My Jin Hyuk!"

143
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,470
He's a friend.

144
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:48,530
You can get off now, the both of you.

145
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,320
Yes.

[J Media Group]

147
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,890
Don't overdo it today, all right?

148
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:30,670
Hello, Mr. Writer. I'm Jeong Ha Jin.

149
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,640
Nice to meet you.

150
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
Jeong Ha Jin...

151
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,240
You're quick-witted. I'm Ha Yeon's older sister.

152
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,220
Please take good care of my brother, too.

153
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,150
Shall we begin?

154
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,430
Oh my, I should be the one giving you this.

155
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,890
There's no law saying only men can gift flowers.

156
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:25,580
I got so many from you, Yeon Seok, all this time.

157
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,250
Thank you.

158
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,490
Say, do you know the meaning of a forget-me-not flower?

159
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,780
I do not.

160
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,500
You should personally find out later.

161
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,100
How pretty!

162
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,260
Don't tell me you made this yourself?

163
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,830
I picked them up on the way here.

164
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:00,170
We're leaving together after this operation, right?

165
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,930
Of course. I'll be back before dawn.

166
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,560
Stop!

167
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:28,130
Stop right there!

168
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:12,460
So you plan on killing all of them?

169
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,900
Yes.

170
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,020
I'll give it to you straight.

171
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,150
I want you to change the ending.

172
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,360
Excuse me?

173
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,210
General Manager.

174
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,610
Yes, go ahead.

175
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,140
I think changing an ending that's already been decided is a bit too much to ask.

176
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,810
It hasn't been released yet.

177
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:37,160
Let's just change the ending. Only the final part.

178
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:40,690
Not a sad, but a happy ending.

179
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,870
The movie's story and the novel don't have to be the same.

180
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,410
In fact, when it comes to movies based on novels, there are a lot of parts that have been adapted.

181
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,590
I think it would be best to discuss that with the director afterward.

182
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,040
If you want, we can attend the meeting too.

183
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,720
I want to make it exactly the same...

184
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,770
without harming the writer's work.

185
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,150
I don't think it'll do any harm.

186
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:03,460
Since it'll become a different story.

187
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,550
A different story?

188
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,430
That's unexpected.

189
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:12,250
I just know where the boundaries are.

190
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,260
You. What is the editor's opinion?

191
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,940
- Me?
- Yes.

192
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:24,910
From what I heard, you love the writer's works more than anyone else.

193
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,280
I would like to hear an objective opinion from a reader.

194
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,900
He's an editor that hasn't been on this project for too long–

195
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,640
I'm curious as well.

196
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,240
An objective opinion from a reader.

197
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:43,870
If I was to state my opinion as a reader and not as an editor,

198
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,730
I prefer a happy ending too.

199
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,350
All right now. Let's discuss the ending a little more later.

200
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:56,440
No.

201
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,490
I'm not going to change the ending of the novel.

202
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,550
Actually, I can't.

203
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,510
So it's not that you "won't"

204
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,880
but you "can't"?

205
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,510
- Shall we stop here for today?
- Yes.

206
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:15,580
We'll contact you after further discussion.

207
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,270
What are you doing? Get in.

208
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,780
Mr. Ha Yeon, you take the subway.

209
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,120
Excuse me?

210
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,220
Get in.

211
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,300
Why did you stop?

212
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,650
Today isn't the first time you saw Jeong Ha Jin, right?

213
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,740
Why didn't you tell me?

214
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:09,140
Would it change anything if I said something?

215
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:12,770
I'm not trying to pick a fight. I'm asking because I'm truly curious.

216
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:16,880
You were like this when you first met Jeong Ha Yeon. You asked why I didn't tell you that he was a guy.

217
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,500
Even if I told you that there was a girl who looked like Jeong Ha Yeon,

218
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:24,650
and she's his sister, does anything change from knowing this?

219
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:29,960
- Don't tell me you're confused.
- How could I not be?

220
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,890
- I know you know.
- No, I don't.

221
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm not you. I'm just a normal human.

222
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,650
Jeong Ha Yeon and Jeong Ha Jin appeared at the same time.

223
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:41,430
I feel like I'm going to go crazy, but you keep playing with words.

224
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,660
Are you toying with me?

225
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,470
Hey! Where are you going?

226
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,050
Stop making excuses.

227
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:57,240
You know very well who you've been looking for.

228
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,090
In your mind, Jeong Ha Yeon has to be a woman.

229
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:03,190
But in reality, she isn't, so you're upset and taking it out on someone else.

230
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:07,740
Hey. Get in the car.

231
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:14,990
I'm just going to take the subway because I don't want to be in the same car with a jerk like you.

232
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:20,390
You can either drive the car or leave it here. Do whatever you want. And...

233
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:23,490
think about why you're so upset.

234
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm here, Mr. Writer!

235
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,150
When did you get here, Mr. Writer?

236
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,260
Was there any heavy traffic?

237
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,550
There was no heavy traffic in the subway.

238
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,210
Mr. Writer.

239
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:51,310
My sister was rude, wasn't she? I'm sorry.

240
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:57,400
Are you very upset?

241
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,380
No.

242
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:05,560
Then why are you treating me like this?

243
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:09,290
Like what?

244
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,800
You're treating me like I'm invisible.

245
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,200
Is it because I didn't take your side earlier at the meeting?

246
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,070
I just gave my honest opinion.

247
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,080
Don't I have the right to give my honest opinion as an editor?

248
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,090
But then you told me to take the subway here. Aren't you being too harsh to me?

249
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:31,010
There is a reason why...

250
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:38,850
I'm upset right now.

251
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,120
Didn't I tell you?

252
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,370
I just don't like you.

253
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:50,380
I told you from the beginning not to show your face in front of me again.

254
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,680
Mr. Writer, you really...

255
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,690
have a crappy personality.

256
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,550
- What did you say?
- You heard me.

257
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:03,130
The only thing I did wrong was break a cup.

258
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,310
This isn't how you treat another human with manners.

259
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:10,590
It's because the sight of you keeps bothering me.

260
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,580
I'll leave for now since you don't like me.

261
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:20,020
I don't want to disturb your work.

262
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:15,820
When you're in my line of sight, I can't help but keep thinking of you.

263
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:29,750
As I'm thinking, I might want to change the ending.

264
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:35,030
It's not that I hate you. I'm afraid.

265
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:40,370

My sister said that soju tastes sweet when life is bitter.
