1
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:12,280
Hey, what's wrong?

2
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:17,368
Hey. Are you all right? Hey?

3
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,129
I…

4
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,382
know nothing…

5
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,219
about Keiichi Kaburagi.

6
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:37,180
His name, his background,

7
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,849
everything he said was a lie,

8
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,936
so how could I possibly know anything?

9
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,579
Hey, are you okay?

10
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:03,873
Hey!

11
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,626
He's coughing up blood.

12
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,921
Are you okay?

13
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,051
Hey, cut it out.

14
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,553
Stop it, Kaburagi!

15
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,429
Stop!

16
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,141
Don't let go of the rope.

17
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,230
I think nobody really knew him.
Benzo, I mean.

18
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:31,484
That's what we called him.

19
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,113
How can I say this? I liked him.

20
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:39,284
I respected Sakurai.

21
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:45,540
And he was good at his job.
I think everyone liked him.

22
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,877
So, no one at the facility
was aware of what happened?

23
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,015
Hey, Kaburagi!

24
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,141
Hey!

25
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,606
- Hey!
- Cut it out.

26
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,155
Hey!

27
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,036
He had the air of a normal guy,
but those are the ones who act out.

28
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,371
I thought he was suspicious
from the get-go.

29
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,497
He even killed a kid, right?

30
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,375
We were blackmailed, you know.
He took money from us.

31
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,545
I have spoken to you so often. There's
nothing to say I haven't told you before.

32
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:37,091
I will never forgive him
for the murders he committed.

33
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:43,973
I never had any direct dealings with him.

34
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,184
But my daughter…

35
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,480
She still has faith in him.

36
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:11,793
So, you never realized…

37
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,673
what his true form was?

38
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,410
Good morning.

39
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,914
Things have gotten really crazy,
haven't they?

40
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,551
Sorry to keep you waiting.

41
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,847
You really did it now.
This is an unbelievable blunder.

42
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:08,933
I know.

43
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:13,855
Please rectify it.

44
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,537
My name is Matanuki from the
Tokyo Police's Investigation Division.

45
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,873
As a result of what transpired,

46
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,877
I believe I have caused concern
among the public. I deeply regret that.

47
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,047
Have you ascertained how
the death row inmate was able to escape?

48
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:43,217
Please allow me to refrain
from answering that question,

49
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,969
as revealing any details may impede
our future investigations.

50
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,472
Do you know how he managed to escape?

51
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:52,143
I can't answer you, as we are currently
confirming details surrounding that.

52
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:56,022
Can you give us some specifics
about the format of the investigation?

53
00:05:56,105 --> 00:06:00,902
With the safety of the population
as our top priority, we are mobilizing

54
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:04,572
the maximum number of personnel possible
to resolve the case as quickly as we can.

55
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:09,160
‪Quieten down! Be quiet!

56
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:19,212
- I'm going to go take a leak.
- Have some meat.

57
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,755
A leak?

58
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:35,978
Hey, hey! Wait up! Hey!

59
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:12,890
A death row inmate incarcerated
at a Tokyo detention center has escaped,

60
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:15,351
and police are now tracing
his whereabouts.

61
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,394
DEATH ROW INMATE KEIICHI KABURAGI - 21

62
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,982
The escaped is death row inmate
Keiichi Kaburagi. He is 21.

63
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:25,278
- In 2019, when Mr. Kaburagi was 18…
- That's terrifying.

64
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:29,031
He killed three people when he was my age.

65
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,242
It's unimaginable.

66
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:35,037
Yes, it is. He looks pretty normal though.

67
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:39,000
I wonder where he'll escape to.
Maybe a deserted island?

68
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,629
They say cities are good
because in a rural area, you'd stand out.

69
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,673
Really?

70
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:50,219
Mai, maybe you should rethink
going to Tokyo?

71
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:52,221
- No, no, no, no.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

72
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,350
Soz, but I'm going to become
a beautician there.

73
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,728
I'm gonna be late
for my graduation ceremony.

74
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:00,813
- Hey, hang on.
- It'll be fine.

75
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,940
- See you later.
- Hey, were you listening to me?

76
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:10,865
OSAKA PREFECTURE

77
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,539
Come on. Let's pick up the pace.

78
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,386
Come on, come on, come on.
We'll never get the job done like that.

79
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,431
We're paying you to work.

80
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,520
- Don't worry, Hirata. I'll do it. Go rest.
- Thank you. Sorry.

81
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,563
Hey, Jump!

82
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,106
Hey!

83
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,486
Do you think you have time
to be helping others out?

84
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:52,573
Fucking bastard.

85
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:58,496
Hey, Benzo!
Sorry to ask, but I need a hand.

86
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,249
- Okay.
- I'm counting on you.

87
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:10,132
118 DAYS SINCE THE ESCAPE

88
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,393
What a measly sum!

89
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,395
What are you playing at?

90
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,024
Hey. Jump, what is this about?

91
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:30,444
What are you playing at?

92
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,657
There are other people
I need to pay back too.

93
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,576
Stop making excuses.

94
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,828
- Hey!
- Sorry.

95
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,122
Get me my money next time
or I'll kill you.

96
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:43,749
Hey. Hey. Hey.

97
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:47,545
- You bastard. Hey.
- Come on. Let's go.

98
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,900
Oh, Benzo.

99
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,194
Good evening.

100
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,993
You always plan it,
so you are last in the bath.

101
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,912
- Sorry.
- What are you apologizing for?

102
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,348
I was wondering. Why are you here, Benzo?

103
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:45,144
If you had a normal life,
you wouldn't have ended up here.

104
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:50,316
I guess it doesn't matter.

105
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,034
What are you looking at?

106
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,703
Sorry.

107
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,558
It has been like this all day.

108
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,727
My sincere apologies.

109
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,106
We're increasing the number of agents
and bolstering checkpoints

110
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,273
around the country.

111
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,067
And how long is this going to last?

112
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,820
We'll get it done this week.

113
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,032
Make sure you take care
of the bereaved families too.

114
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,284
Of course.

115
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:52,920
THE DEATH PENALTY FOR KABURAGI

116
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,509
This might be a pretty basic question.

117
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:00,970
But why did Kaburagi try to escape?

118
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,765
I mean, when he was caught
for murdering an entire family,

119
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,018
he was at their home,
so, isn't it a bit strange for him

120
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,603
to try to escape now?

121
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,231
And he kept denying the charges--

122
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,984
Kaburagi did it. We have proof.

123
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:18,404
You're right.

124
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,905
Sorry.

125
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,215
It has been four months
since Kaburagi's escape from custody.

126
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,135
We are searching across a wide area,
but we have not yet located him.

127
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:44,722
I know. I can learn that much on the news.

128
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:49,185
We do not know why he tried to escape,
but if he approached Yoshiko,

129
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,936
the surviving family member--

130
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,938
I have told you many times,

131
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,982
I cannot tell you where my sister is.

132
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,902
- I am sorry--
- Enough!

133
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,115
I just want to be left in peace.

134
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:05,534
I want to make it so that

135
00:13:06,785 --> 00:13:09,371
my sister forgets all about this.

136
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,501
Excuse me.

137
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,222
Hey, are you okay?

138
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,307
It's Kazuya.

139
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:31,310
Help me.

140
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,571
- Are you okay?
- Hello.

141
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,531
Yes, I'm fine.

142
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:46,242
Kazuya, Kazuya, I'm sorry.

143
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,702
It's fine. It's fine.

144
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,666
I have some bad news, Kazuya.

145
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,794
This company won't pay a single yen
of your medical expenses.

146
00:13:56,877 --> 00:13:57,920
Is that so?

147
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:03,592
We should do a whip-around, right?

148
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:07,388
- Right.
- No way. I couldn't accept your money.

149
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,973
- I know you guys have it rough too.
- That might be true,

150
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:12,017
but we know if you spend your money
on treatment, you can't afford to live.

151
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,231
Is there no way we can make
the company pay?

152
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:24,321
There's no way.

153
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,700
We don't have any rights.

154
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,955
But…

155
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,919
Shouldn't we be targeting the state
and not the company?

156
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,257
You should report it to your supervisors

157
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,844
and have them apply
to the Labor Standards Inspection Office.

158
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:50,222
If you do that, then the state
will pay your treatment costs.

159
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,557
- Huh?
- What's he talking about?

160
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:55,519
- The Labor Standards Inspection Office?
- The Labor Standards Inspection Office?

161
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,357
- What's that?
- Do you know it?

162
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:04,153
STEPS TO APPLY FOR COMPENSATION
FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT

163
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,781
I'm sure this injury would be covered
by workers' compensation insurance.

164
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,241
So…

165
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,828
What the hell is this?

166
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:17,333
You are saying you'll snitch to the state
because we aren't doing anything?

167
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,793
No, that's not it…

168
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,631
I'm just saying that we should apply
because the state will pay.

169
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,924
How do I explain it…

170
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,053
Hey, Jump.

171
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,764
You got hurt all on your own, right?

172
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,351
And now you are trying to blackmail me
by making up stories?

173
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,062
Ehm… That's not it at all…

174
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,818
You've nowhere to go.

175
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,742
If you don't like it, why don't you quit?

176
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,622
Are you okay?

177
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,708
Sorry. I'm fine.

178
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,170
How pathetic.

179
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,323
Benzo,

180
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,869
do you know why they call me Jump?

181
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,289
I don't.

182
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,963
After I got out of the facility,

183
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,174
I got into gambling debt.
It grew and grew.

184
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:52,177
I couldn't pay it back, so I flew away.

185
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,346
I was caught again.

186
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:57,349
Then I flew away and was caught again.

187
00:16:58,142 --> 00:16:59,560
I jumped and flew again and again,

188
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,604
but then my wings
were clipped, and now, I'm here.

189
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,069
And this is how my life

190
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,197
is going to play out.

191
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,330
How much do you need to get peace of mind?

192
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:25,544
How much?

193
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,298
Well, maybe… about 100,000?

194
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,969
Understood. Please wait here.

195
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:36,930
What? Hey, Benzo?

196
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,478
Excuse me.

197
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,070
What is it?

198
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:56,033
It's about what we discussed just now.
Is there no way you'd reconsider?

199
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,702
Not happening.

200
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:06,293
From a hazard prevention standpoint,
Kazuya's accident is an infringement

201
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:09,004
of Article 24
of the Occupational Health and Safety Law.

202
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,340
Also, Articles 119 and 122
say responsibility

203
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,509
isn't only on the company
but also the person in charge.

204
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,969
Stop your blabbering.

205
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,263
This project is being run by the state.

206
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,266
So, we are able to apply directly.

207
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,351
If the company doesn't assist us, then--

208
00:18:22,434 --> 00:18:24,478
Get serious, you fucker.

209
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,064
I'm just calling out
an injustice when I see it.

210
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,196
Don't get above your station.

211
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,619
I'm sure you're
a broken little toy too, right?

212
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:47,251
You're wrong.

213
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,837
All of you.

214
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:01,849
It was announced today
that the Metropolitan Police Department

215
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:05,352
will increase the payment
for useful info to 3 million yen.

216
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,812
Three million?

217
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:10,107
Today, the information
on the wanted posters has been updated.

218
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:16,446
Some characteristics of suspect Kaburagi
have been released. He has heavy eyebrows,

219
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,533
a mole on his left cheek,
and a burn mark on his back.

220
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,326
Hey!

221
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,331
Excuse me.

222
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,171
I could only get 20,000 yen.

223
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,758
What happened to you?

224
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,845
I am okay.

225
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,945
You were hit too.

226
00:19:58,071 --> 00:19:59,031
Take it.

227
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:08,832
Thank you very much.

228
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,131
Benzo,

229
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,052
- why don't we head out?
- Huh?

230
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,180
Hang on a second.

231
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,571
Oh, good idea.

232
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:45,744
And we also need some tasty stuff.

233
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:51,708
Some chocolate.

234
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,461
And these. These are some
of my favorite snacks.

235
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,135
Pick your favorite. I'll get it for you.

236
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,140
You don't drink?

237
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,768
Yeah, I've never drank.

238
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,688
Really? What age are you?

239
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:19,069
- I'm 21.
- So, you can drink.

240
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:21,113
Let's drink together, in your room, Benzo.

241
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,782
- Ehm… Okay…
- And a lemon one.

242
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,660
Okay

243
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,206
Ring it up, please.

244
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,429
Hey.

245
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,932
Look, look. They've been
on about it for a while.

246
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,852
They said the bounty
is up to 3 million now.

247
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,438
Wow…

248
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:58,233
If I had 3 million yen,
maybe I could start my life over.

249
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:05,240
- Right?
- Sure.

250
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,036
It's okay. Leave it. I'll take care of it.

251
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,414
Here.

252
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,130
- Thanks.
- Wait, wait.

253
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,382
You need to wait for the cheers.

254
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,055
Cheers.

255
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,564
How is it?

256
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:40,984
Yes.

257
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,862
What do you mean, "yes"?
What kind of reaction is that?

258
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,530
Sorry.

259
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,663
Hey, Benzo, do you have any friends?

260
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,250
- No.
- That's what I thought.

261
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,045
So then,

262
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,672
I'll be your friend.

263
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,511
You're a good guy,

264
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:11,056
and I think we could have
a lot of fun together as friends.

265
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,227
Thank you very much.

266
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:18,772
Let's mark the occasion.

267
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,525
Say cheese.

268
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,571
What's wrong with you? Don't be shy.

269
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,865
Sorry.

270
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:43,338
So, Benzo, do you want to be a lawyer?

271
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,759
Well, yes.

272
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,886
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CASE STUDIES

273
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:56,810
It's nice to have a dream.
If I get into trouble, help me.

274
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:01,815
Huh?

275
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,528
DEATH SENTENCE FOR FORMER JUVENILE

276
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,332
Sorry, sorry. I'm an idiot,
so I don't really understand it.

277
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,173
Let's eat. You should eat something.

278
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,357
You're not great at using chopsticks.

279
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,195
I injured my hand.

280
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,659
Are you sure
you're not actually left-handed?

281
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,501
Don't go all quiet. It's just a joke.

282
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,519
Benzo,

283
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:26,024
what do you look like with no glasses on?

284
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,738
- Why do you want to know?
- Well…

285
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,200
I've never really gotten
a good look at your face.

286
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,036
Because of your hair and your glasses.

287
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,334
Show me your face.

288
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,317
It's an ordinary face.

289
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,953
Yeah, it is.

290
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,668
Sorry, I need to pee.

291
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:00,493
MOST WANTED - BOUNTY 3 MILLION YEN

292
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,042
Left-handed…

293
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,614
What's wrong?

294
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,659
N-nothing.

295
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,293
You're not going to take the call?

296
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:26,579
Hello. This way.

297
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,750
Hello.

298
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,712
This is the young man
who met with Kaburagi.

299
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:38,675
Detective…

300
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,553
he…

301
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:18,173
SHINJUKU WARD, TOKYO

302
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:27,015
They still haven't caught that guy?

303
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:30,143
It seems like he can get
surprisingly close to people.

304
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,854
Stop it. That's so scary.

305
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,898
How can the police be so incompetent?

306
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:45,241
180 DAYS SINCE THE ESCAPE

307
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:51,790
I will ask you about your movements
on the day of the incident.

308
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:56,252
You got off the train
after a female high school student

309
00:29:56,336 --> 00:30:00,006
grabbed and raised your hand because
she thought you tried to touch her, right?

310
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,343
Yes.

311
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:07,430
Why did you try to run away
from the train station staff?

312
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,975
I just

313
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:16,397
told them I didn't do it and then left.

314
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:21,861
You are shown clearly on the CCTV
behaving suspiciously.

315
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:26,741
Please stop. I really didn't do it.

316
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:31,162
If you really didn't do it,
you wouldn't have fled the scene.

317
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,706
You would have stayed put.

318
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:42,340
Mr. Ando, my name is Kuroshima
from the Weekly Times.

319
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:46,469
You've insisted in court that you didn't
do it, but have you any chance of winning?

320
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:50,598
Do you think that your own position as
a top lawyer is an advantage in the case?

321
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:55,103
I also wondered why you'd try
to escape if you hadn't done it.

322
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,896
- Do you have nothing to say?
- Please stop this.

323
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,648
Do you have no comments?
I can write a good article.

324
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,114
It'll all work out in the end.

325
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:11,953
I'm sorry, Sayaka, that you have
to see your father in this state.

326
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,707
What are you saying?

327
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,251
I didn't do it. I really didn't do it.

328
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:24,215
But when you are being attacked
by so many people,

329
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,052
I understand how some people
can end up saying that they did it.

330
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,981
Sorry I'm late.

331
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,691
- Hello.
- Hello.

332
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,861
Are you okay?
That journalist showed up again.

333
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:48,406
He has some nerve
staking the place out like that.

334
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,408
Sorry for causing
so much trouble for everyone.

335
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:53,995
No, no. False accusations
really are terrifying.

336
00:31:54,662 --> 00:31:56,998
Your life can go up in flames
in an instant.

337
00:31:57,081 --> 00:32:00,835
You're right. It really makes you wonder
about the meaning of justice.

338
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,006
This guy could be in the same boat too.

339
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,634
There is still no info about where he is.

340
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,720
The final whereabouts of Keiichi Kaburagi…

341
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:13,973
Please don't compare him to a murderer.

342
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:18,478
Sorry. They keep running special reports
on him, and I find it fascinating.

343
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,231
The more I look into it,
the harder I find it to see a motive.

344
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,360
THE MAN CONVICTED
OF THE HIGASHIMURAYAMA MURDERS

345
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,361
ESCAPES CUSTODY IN TOKYO

346
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:27,570
Huh?

347
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,123
That writer Nasu is waiting
in the meeting room.

348
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,585
Oh, crap, I'd forgotten. Here you are.

349
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,637
- Hey, Nasu. Sorry for being late.
- No worries. Good afternoon.

350
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,140
You are really helping us out, Nasu.

351
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,393
Sorry for all the crazy requests.

352
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,019
It's no problem.

353
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:03,147
Look at the articles
you wrote for us last month.

354
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:08,528
Six of them are in our top ten most-read.

355
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:12,031
How about you give up on freelancing
and join us on a permanent basis?

356
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:21,040
I'm joking. I'm joking. Someone with
your talent could join a better company.

357
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,294
Please stamp this form.

358
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:33,302
Here you go.

359
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:45,648
I wonder if he has had
some plastic surgery.

360
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:48,901
The reports people give
of other people's features are subjective.

361
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,446
Don't rely on facial features

362
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,823
but on behavioral patterns
and psychology instead.

363
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:54,949
Understood.

364
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:59,912
It's amazing how quickly
he found construction firms linked

365
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:02,290
to poverty-stricken businesses.

366
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,000
That's how he is making his money.

367
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,755
But he must have another motive.

368
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:17,930
KEIICHI DEFINITELY DIDN'T DO IT

369
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,646
You're free today, right?
Why don't we go for a drink?

370
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,524
Sounds good. Let's do it.

371
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,443
Sorry, I have to head home.
I have some work to do.

372
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,904
You need to take a break sometime.
You'll miss your chance at marriage.

373
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,697
Hey, that's harassment.

374
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,032
Sorry, see you guys.

375
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,909
- See you. Get home safely.
- Bye-bye.

376
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:49,921
INTERNET CAFÉ

377
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,840
I feel bad showing
the place to you in this state.

378
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,884
He loved to keep things tidy.

379
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:42,932
Is there something of note here?

380
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,939
He was a nice boy.

381
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,775
You think he's causing trouble?

382
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:57,613
CHRISTMAS CLUB

383
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,325
TIME TO TUCK IN

384
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,537
The person you are calling nice
is Mr. Kaburagi, a murderer.

385
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,372
We have evidence collected
from the family members of victims.

386
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,333
We cannot leave Kaburagi
to his own devices.

387
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:13,588
Do you know,

388
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:19,427
he often made food
for the kids in the facility?

389
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,515
Everyone loved Keiichi's Salisbury steaks.

390
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:30,646
Hey, Detective.

391
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,696
You really believe

392
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:42,700
that Keiichi was the perpetrator, right?

393
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,370
Of course.

394
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:51,250
And you could swear that to God?

395
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:58,549
You stole everything away.

396
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,638
You stole Keiichi's life away.

397
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,442
These are incredible.
He really has a gift.

398
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,653
Are you talking about Nasu?

399
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,864
Yes, his word choice is great.

400
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:24,242
And he always makes sure
to meet his deadlines.

401
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,245
Nasu? He really is incredible.

402
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,663
Can I send projects to him too?

403
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,207
Of course. If he is okay with it.

404
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,588
I have a big date today,
so I'm heading home early.

405
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,382
- See you.
- See you.

406
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:40,549
See you.

407
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,513
How nice.

408
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:47,807
I wish I had someone to comfort me too.

409
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,812
Oh, it's raining. Serves you right, Karin.

410
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,287
INTERNET CAFÉ

411
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,251
Nasu?

412
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:21,674
- Nasu?
- Oh, Ando.

413
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,342
Where is your umbrella?

414
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,636
I thought the rain
would pass through quickly.

415
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,054
Do you want to go inside somewhere?

416
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,433
- No, thanks. I'm fine.
- You're not fine.

417
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,770
I will pay, so let's head inside.

418
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:45,865
Why are you making that face?

419
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,285
I was just thinking

420
00:38:49,952 --> 00:38:52,246
this may be the most delicious meal
I have ever eaten.

421
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,583
That must be an exaggeration.
Why don't you have some more?

422
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,002
Thank you.

423
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:16,270
I saw you by chance just now.

424
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,982
You were heading into an internet café.

425
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,572
You're not sleeping there, are you?

426
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:30,659
Well…

427
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,038
You don't need to look so shocked.

428
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,627
You can never tell
what someone is going through.

429
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,217
You are a really great writer, Nasu.

430
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,011
And that's good enough for me.

431
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,769
I trust you, Nasu.

432
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:04,985
So, just continue to work hard,
like you have been.

433
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,166
Huh?

434
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,129
What's wrong?

435
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:36,767
I was just happy to hear
that you trust me.

436
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:41,397
Thank you very much.

437
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,614
Sorry, sorry.
Let's talk about something else.

438
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:53,451
Do you have any hobbies?

439
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,746
I don't.

440
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:00,666
But you're so young.
You should take up something.

441
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,379
What about you, Ando?

442
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,631
Something outside of work?

443
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,384
I guess I don't.

444
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,430
So, that makes us the same.

445
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:20,478
Yes, we're the same.

446
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,990
- Excuse me. Same again, please.
- Sure.

447
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,371
- Excuse me for a moment.
- Okay.

448
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,719
Yes?

449
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,847
Is this your cell, Ando?

450
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,308
It's Kuroshima from the Weekly Times.

451
00:41:59,391 --> 00:42:02,228
Can I ask you about the incident
involving your father?

452
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,146
How did you get my number?

453
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,232
About the molestation case involving

454
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,026
the high school girl
that your father refutes,

455
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,281
he only seems to talk on cases
involving young girls, doesn't he?

456
00:42:15,491 --> 00:42:16,617
Huh…

457
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:18,994
What are you trying to insinuate?

458
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:25,334
My father is proud of his work
helping the powerless.

459
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,754
You have no basis
for what you are saying right now.

460
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:33,842
Okay, speaking
of those powerless young women--

461
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:46,355
Sorry.

462
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,246
Hey, hey, are you okay? You can't
get sick here. Let's go to the toilet.

463
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,874
Come on. Are you okay?

464
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,646
- Stop.
- Don't move.

465
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:30,399
Freeze, don't move.

466
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,197
- Wait. Don't go.
- Calm down.

467
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,867
- Relax.
- It wasn't me.

468
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:43,704
Carry out a proper investigation.
I didn't do it!

469
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:48,959
The judgment is that the defendant
shall be sentenced to death.

470
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:51,754
I find the defendant guilty.

471
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,341
If you are dissatisfied with the verdict,
you are entitled to appeal.

472
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,677
This concludes my verdict.

473
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:26,830
SORRY FOR GETTING YOU DRUNK LAST NIGHT
I LOOK FORWARD TO READING YOUR COPY

474
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,847
KEIICHI KABURAGI

475
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,768
FROM KEIICHI KABURAGI

476
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,228
HE REMAINS ON THE RUN

477
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:52,147
MS. ANDO, GOOD MORNING
SORRY FOR MY BEHAVIOR YESTERDAY

478
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,400
PLEASE REVIEW MY COPY
NASU

479
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:59,488
The police really seem to be
in a bind on this one.

480
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:03,992
Kaburagi adopted a fake persona
and was working at this company.

481
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,246
I never realized it at all.

482
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:10,207
He always wore thick glasses,

483
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:13,168
and he had a mole.

484
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,170
- I'm no closer to knowing what to think.
- You're right.

485
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:18,465
- But he was a good guy.
- It's no clue at all.

486
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:22,511
We called him Benzo.
He was like a character from a comic,

487
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:25,347
with thick glasses.

488
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:28,767
Good job, Kaburagi.

489
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:31,186
You can't say "good job".

490
00:45:32,729 --> 00:45:35,357
- But he is clever.
- I guess he is.

491
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:56,879
Welcome home.

492
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,883
Good evening.

493
00:46:00,966 --> 00:46:03,218
Sorry for still being here.

494
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:07,764
I couldn't find a key.

495
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,059
And I never got to thank you either.

496
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,479
So, you're the serious type?

497
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,398
Please let me pay you back
for your kindness in the future.

498
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,316
Don't worry about it.

499
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,028
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat something?

500
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:24,948
Why don't I make us something?

501
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,701
You can cook?

502
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:30,287
Yes, a little bit.

503
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,582
Okay then, if you wouldn't mind.

504
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:35,375
Sure.

505
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,428
- Does it taste bad?
- That's not it at all.

506
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:51,141
No. It's just that this may be
the most delicious meal I have ever eaten.

507
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:55,479
That must be an exaggeration.
Please eat more.

508
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,564
How did you get so good at cooking?

509
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:04,196
I have a lot of siblings,
so I had to cook for them a lot.

510
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:07,407
Wow, that is pretty incredible.

511
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:09,326
So, you must be able
to do a lot of things.

512
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:16,041
- You must be popular with women, right?
- Not at all.

513
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:18,627
There you go being humble again.
Do you have a girlfriend?

514
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:22,923
I've never had one.

515
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,008
Did you use to live
in the middle of nowhere?

516
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,553
Well, I guess

517
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,389
it was a pretty rural area.

518
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,267
Where was it? What about your family?

519
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,981
Ehm… Well…

520
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:42,609
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's a force of habit from work.

521
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,694
It's no problem.

522
00:47:46,863 --> 00:47:49,116
Ehm… Ando.

523
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,784
Yes?

524
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,913
About that direct employment contract

525
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,041
you mentioned before,

526
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,419
could you give me some more details?

527
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,968
Sure.

528
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:10,137
I'll try to call in a favor.

529
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:13,390
Thank you very much.

530
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:19,271
Also, feel free to stay here
until you find somewhere else to live.

531
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:21,315
No, I couldn't possibly--

532
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:24,109
You can pay me back
by making me food again.

533
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,657
This is really good.

534
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:39,291
TO PROTECT LAWYER ANDO
FROM FALSE ALLEGATIONS OF MOLESTATION

535
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,505
COMMENTS

536
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,591
THIS PAEDO LAWYER MAKES VICTIMS
OF HIS CLIENTS

537
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,509
HIS GREATEST FEAT WOULD BE
CLEARING HIS OWN NAME

538
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,933
REPORT THIS COMMENT

539
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,447
Nasu?

540
00:49:16,244 --> 00:49:17,496
Nasu?

541
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,706
Nasu? Are you okay?

542
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:04,209
Nasu, I have something to ask you.

543
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,669
Could you transcribe this?

544
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,551
WHY?

545
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,387
SARA? WAKE UP!

546
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:29,067
It was October 2019.

547
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:32,237
…WHEN THE MURDER
OF THE HIGASHIMURAYAMA FAMILY OCCURRED….

548
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,657
CURRENTLY THE FAMILY OF THE BEREAVED…
A FORMER RESIDENT OF AN ORPHANAGE …

549
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:41,830
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

550
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,218
Nasu!

551
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,220
Ando.

552
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,690
KABURAGI WAS 18
AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT

553
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,447
SORRY I COULDN'T BE THERE FOR YOU

554
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:21,745
…HIS HATRED FOR THE POLICE…

555
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,919
HE WAS PLACED IN AN ORPHANAGE

556
00:51:43,308 --> 00:51:45,018
HE FLED FROM POLICE CUSTODY

557
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:51,525
THE REASON FOR HIS ESCAPE IS UNKNOWN

558
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,169
Let's appeal.

559
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:55,881
They have it all wrong.

560
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,722
Why was it pinned on me?

561
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,937
There was a real victim.
But somewhere out there right now,

562
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:17,110
the actual perpetrator
is living a carefree life.

563
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,031
But why

564
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:25,076
did this have to happen to me?

565
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,662
It wasn't you.

566
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:33,835
I won't be able
to get through to anyone anymore.

567
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,758
Even if they can't hear you right now,

568
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,011
if you just keep fighting
and never give up,

569
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,680
you'll get through to them some day.

570
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,895
Thank you.

571
00:53:58,026 --> 00:53:59,235
Ando,

572
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:04,032
it's Kuroshima from the Weekly Times.

573
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,700
What do you want?

574
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,704
It was really unfortunate
what happened with your father's case.

575
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:11,665
It's not over yet.

576
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,959
You have my support.

577
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,587
But you surprised me, Ando.

578
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,881
Something's going on with you that's
way bigger than a simple molestation case.

579
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,800
I don't know what you're talking about.
Please stop following me.

580
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,885
If you're looking for Keiichi Kaburagi,
he arrived home earlier.

581
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,230
What are you talking about?

582
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,357
Huh? Really?

583
00:54:38,108 --> 00:54:39,943
You didn't realize?

584
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,448
I live alone.

585
00:54:45,532 --> 00:54:48,535
Is that so? I must have been mistaken.

586
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,634
Welcome home.

587
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,806
The latest episode of the drama
was released today.

588
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,113
What's wrong?

589
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:36,332
My dad lost his case in court today.

590
00:55:38,251 --> 00:55:40,962
He was fighting
a false charge of molestation.

591
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,012
False evidence was created.

592
00:55:53,224 --> 00:55:54,476
And now, the public

593
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:59,355
is attacking him over and over,
calling him the perverted lawyer.

594
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,818
Our family has been torn apart.

595
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,241
But…

596
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:21,377
I believed my father.

597
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,559
I…

598
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:41,981
am sure you didn't do it.

599
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:51,533
What?

600
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,412
You have to run away,

601
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,290
Kaburagi.

602
00:57:21,479 --> 00:57:22,897
I'm Matanuki from
the Tokyo Police Investigation Division.

603
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,149
You're Sayaka Ando, right?

604
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:26,443
Yes, that's right.

605
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,654
We had a report
about a man living with you.

606
00:57:30,613 --> 00:57:32,198
Is he home?

607
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:37,162
Is something wrong?

608
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,247
No.

609
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,708
Nobody lives with me.

610
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,835
I live alone.

611
00:57:46,254 --> 00:57:47,422
Is that so?

612
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:50,425
Can you let us inside, just to be sure?

613
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:56,473
- Okay. Come in.
- Sorry for the intrusion.

614
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,061
We have made contact with the suspect.

615
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,372
Apologies for coming
while you were eating.

616
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,457
‪It's okay.

617
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:32,717
What time was it again
when I spoke with Ando…?

618
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:35,386
Ehm…

619
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,441
- I'm going to open this.
- Go ahead.

620
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,635
Sincere apologies for intruding
upon you all of a sudden.

621
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:18,388
I hope you can understand that I did it
because of how serious the threat is.

622
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:19,472
I understand.

623
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:48,751
- I'm so sorry.
- You don't need to apologize.

624
00:59:49,711 --> 00:59:52,297
Tell me what really happened.

625
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,552
There is something

626
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,931
that I have to do.

627
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,775
I will get rid of them quickly.
You go hide.

628
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,786
Hey, stop!

629
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,835
Stop resisting.

630
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,630
You're out of control.

631
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,739
It has been a while, hasn't it, Kaburagi?

632
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:05,662
Why did you run away?

633
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:11,459
You won't believe me,
no matter what I say.

634
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,806
Run for it.

635
01:01:44,742 --> 01:01:46,577
Detective! Hey, hey!

636
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,706
Come here. He's over here.
He jumped down from above.

637
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,290
He's over here.

638
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,046
Kaburagi!

639
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:00,717
It's Kaburagi!

640
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:35,543
Why didn't you shoot?

641
01:02:58,566 --> 01:02:59,609
Good evening.

642
01:02:59,692 --> 01:03:01,068
1,170 DAYS BEFORE THE ESCAPE

643
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,695
Good evening. Go ahead.

644
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:19,837
Chief Matanuki.

645
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,216
The ambulance will be here soon.

646
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,134
This is a survivor of the family
of the victims who reported the event.

647
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:30,348
We'll transport her to a safe place
promptly, but she's currently in shock.

648
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:32,517
Slowly, slowly…

649
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,398
After a year like the one we've had--

650
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:44,695
When we reached the site, upon receipt
of the report, the high schooler denied

651
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,031
liability and stated
that he had seen the culprit.

652
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,408
But we did not find any evidence
of his claims at the site.

653
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:52,745
The sole surviving family member
is currently in a state of delirium.

654
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:56,833
If you have no other evidence,
then it must have been the high schooler.

655
01:03:58,334 --> 01:03:59,418
Right.

656
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,922
But I think that we may need to undertake
a more detailed investigation.

657
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:05,842
How old is the kid?

658
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,385
He is 18.

659
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,930
That's the perfect age.

660
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:13,432
Excuse me?

661
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,059
Soon, 18-year-olds
who commit serious crimes

662
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:16,936
will face the same punishment as adults.

663
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:19,480
It would be a good deterrent to subject
him to the toughest sanction possible

664
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:22,817
to prevent future crimes by juveniles.

665
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,112
- But…
- Let's finish this quickly.

666
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:28,447
There is no use in prolonging things.

667
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:36,247
You found Kaburagi standing in a big
puddle of blood holding the murder weapon.

668
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,957
Isn't that right?

669
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:43,296
I am correct, right?

670
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,299
- Yes.
- Sis?

671
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,511
That boy you saw was the culprit, right?

672
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,393
Yeah.

673
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,772
That is all. Thank you
for your cooperation. Thank you very much.

674
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,903
Please.

675
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:12,366
Please wait. Please! It wasn't me.

676
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:15,578
Carry out a proper investigation. Please!

677
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:20,041
I didn't do it! I didn't do it!

678
01:05:21,042 --> 01:05:25,713
The judgment is that the defendant
shall be sentenced to death.

679
01:05:30,051 --> 01:05:32,470
I find the defendant guilty.

680
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:36,849
If you are dissatisfied with the verdict,
you are entitled to appeal.

681
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:40,519
This concludes my verdict.

682
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:06,420
We have confirmed that he has traveled
around to various construction sites,

683
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:09,173
such as the Naniwa Expo in Osaka
and office blocks in Shinjuku Ward,

684
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,217
but we have not been able to locate him.

685
01:06:11,842 --> 01:06:15,596
We request the assistance of the public
again for any information on sightings.

686
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,974
We mobilized
the largest investigative team

687
01:06:18,057 --> 01:06:20,184
in the country to ensure
we don't miss anything

688
01:06:21,394 --> 01:06:24,897
We are raising the bounty
for any info on Kaburagi

689
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:28,734
from 3 million to 10 million yen.

690
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:29,986
KABURAGI - SEVEN MONTHS SINCE HIS ESCAPE
POLICE PRESS CONFERENCE

691
01:06:30,069 --> 01:06:34,740
It is believed that Kaburagi continues
to disguise himself while on the run.

692
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,702
Once again, please check
the facial features and characteristics

693
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:41,497
as listed on the most wanted poster,
as well as the recently released photos

694
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:45,584
taken at two hideout locations.

695
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:51,549
There's a high chance he lives among you,
given that he previously worked in Osaka

696
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,301
for three months and in Tokyo for two,
under disguise and a false name.

697
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:58,097
Kaburagi is a violent criminal
who has been convicted of murder.

698
01:06:58,180 --> 01:07:00,016
He may carry knives

699
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:01,017
or other weapons,

700
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,853
and he may rob people for money
to fund his lifestyle or clothes.

701
01:07:03,936 --> 01:07:05,938
So, if you see anyone who looks like him
or looks suspicious,

702
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,191
please contact the police immediately.

703
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,193
The police are currently

704
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:14,530
combing through information
received from all over the country.

705
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:19,285
We'll continue to leave no stone unturned
in our efforts to solve this case.

706
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,830
The information we receive from so many
of you are our greatest leads,

707
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:26,208
so we ask for your help
in solving this case.

708
01:07:28,919 --> 01:07:30,963
Make way. Police coming through.

709
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,298
We're the police. Out of the way.

710
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:33,215
332 DAYS SINCE THE ESCAPE

711
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,425
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

712
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:37,178
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

713
01:07:37,261 --> 01:07:39,555
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

714
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,724
We have confirmed four dead bodies.

715
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:43,684
The approximate number
of stab wounds to the neck

716
01:07:44,268 --> 01:07:46,228
and the murder weapon are likely the same.

717
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:47,354
The circumstances closely resemble

718
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:50,483
the Higashimurayama murders
perpetrated by Kaburagi.

719
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,194
Could it be a copycat killing?

720
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,989
- Where is the suspect?
- He is in custody.

721
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:03,829
First, you raised a sickle
to the father of the house.

722
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:06,999
And then, as the mother was trying
to protect the kids, you stabbed them.

723
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,959
to death with the sickle.

724
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:15,716
The crime played out
exactly as stated, correct?

725
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,642
Is there anything else
you failed to mention?

726
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,317
Have you heard of the crimes
of Keiichi Kaburagi?

727
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:45,079
I'm not copying him.

728
01:08:58,384 --> 01:08:59,552
Detective…

729
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,894
I'd like to eat some cake.

730
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:19,738
Yesterday, an unemployed man was arrested

731
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,950
and transferred to prison
on suspicion of murder

732
01:09:23,033 --> 01:09:26,078
after four members of the same family
were found dead

733
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,164
in a home in Nishitokyo City.

734
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:34,795
The detained man was Kiyoto Ashikaga
from Tokyo and unemployed.

735
01:09:34,879 --> 01:09:37,256
According to police, the suspect Ashikaga,

736
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,258
detained after 5 p.m. yesterday,
is being held

737
01:09:39,341 --> 01:09:41,302
on charges of murdering Tatsuya Aoi

738
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:43,762
and three family members

739
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:47,141
in a residential area in Nishitokyo City.

740
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:53,022
According to the investigators,
Mr. Ashikaga is accepting the charges.

741
01:09:53,105 --> 01:09:57,610
The investigators state that
all four bodies had multiple stab wounds

742
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,612
from a blade,
and the marks mean that the weapon

743
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,489
- is likely to be a sickle.
- That's terrifying.

744
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:03,782
Something like this
happened before too, right?

745
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:04,867
Because of similarities

746
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,744
- to the Higashimurayama family murders…
- So, it's a copycat killing?

747
01:10:06,827 --> 01:10:09,705
- Why would you copy that?
- …from 2019, police believe…

748
01:10:11,207 --> 01:10:12,249
- It's crazy.
- …it is likely a copycat killing.

749
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:14,710
They are now investigating the motive.

750
01:10:18,714 --> 01:10:20,299
Mai,

751
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,302
you look a bit more dressed up
than usual today.

752
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,431
You must be imagining things.

753
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:32,895
- I'm heading out.
- See you later.

754
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:34,980
Are you sure you're not dressed up?

755
01:10:36,690 --> 01:10:41,862
NAGANO PREFECTURE, SUWA CITY

756
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:49,703
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

757
01:10:49,787 --> 01:10:51,747
- Good morning.
- Morning.

758
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:53,040
- Good morning.
- Morning, Mai.

759
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:56,502
I heard the news, Mai.
I'm going to miss you.

760
01:10:56,585 --> 01:11:00,839
It's no big deal. I'm just going upstairs.
I'll see you every day.

761
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:05,636
Why do you have a big smirk
on your face, Mai?

762
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:08,097
- Are you that happy to be moving?
- No, I'm just doing my job.

763
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,015
I'll do my best.

764
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,725
Hmm. You seem different than usual today.

765
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,019
- Why are you saying that? Lay off me.
- I mean, it's true.

766
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:16,021
Sakai.

767
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:20,234
- Sakurai, good morning.
- Good morning.

768
01:11:20,818 --> 01:11:22,945
- Should we get going?
- Sure.

769
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,990
Just give me one moment.
I need my notebook.

770
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:29,660
- Take care of her, Sakurai.
- Sure.

771
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,121
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

772
01:11:32,204 --> 01:11:34,790
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

773
01:11:34,873 --> 01:11:36,250
- Please take care of Sakai.
- Of course.

774
01:11:36,333 --> 01:11:39,920
I have heard that people
are tougher upstairs.

775
01:11:40,004 --> 01:11:42,756
- I'm a bit nervous.
- You'll be fine.

776
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,633
You are popular, Sakai.

777
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:48,012
I'll do my best. Call on me
whenever you need me.

778
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,441
Yoshiko, are you okay?

779
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:04,862
Calm down. You are okay.

780
01:12:04,945 --> 01:12:08,157
It's okay.

781
01:12:09,033 --> 01:12:10,701
Sakurai…

782
01:12:11,368 --> 01:12:13,329
Yes, it's me, Sakurai.

783
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:15,873
Yoshiko, please take deep breaths.

784
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:19,335
Inhale, exhale.

785
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:21,795
Inhale…

786
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:27,343
Let me introduce you. This is Sakai.
She'll be in charge of the second floor.

787
01:12:28,844 --> 01:12:30,471
My name is Mai Sakai.

788
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,806
Nice to meet you.

789
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,143
Nice to meet you too.

790
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,105
Are you okay?

791
01:12:41,982 --> 01:12:43,734
Are you okay?

792
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:53,869
Do outbreaks like that
often happen to Yoshiko?

793
01:12:53,952 --> 01:12:56,872
Yes, they do. A few times a day, at least.

794
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,793
So, she has PTSD.

795
01:13:01,293 --> 01:13:03,837
She has dreams
where she is being attacked by someone.

796
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:05,798
It seems as though
she is afraid to go to sleep.

797
01:13:06,715 --> 01:13:09,593
- Because she has bad dreams.
- So, it's the dreams…

798
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:14,515
If there is something about her
you want to know, talk to me.

799
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,767
Sure. Thank you.

800
01:13:23,148 --> 01:13:25,692
How did you end up here, Sakurai?

801
01:13:27,528 --> 01:13:29,863
I mean, you came from Tokyo, right?

802
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:34,368
I went to a beauty school in Tokyo,
but it wasn't for me.

803
01:13:34,451 --> 01:13:36,453
When I quit, my parents took me back in.

804
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,455
Is that so?

805
01:13:39,706 --> 01:13:40,999
In my case,

806
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:44,169
I just always wanted to do
this type of work.

807
01:13:47,548 --> 01:13:51,301
But why here? Is there something
that drew you here specifically?

808
01:13:51,385 --> 01:13:53,262
No, it is just a coincidence.

809
01:13:59,226 --> 01:14:03,856
Why don't I show you around sometime?

810
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:07,401
As it's my local area,
I know it quite well.

811
01:14:08,193 --> 01:14:10,446
And if you like nature,
there are a lot of nice spots to see.

812
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,491
Thank you very much.

813
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,831
When do you want to do it?
How about this weekend?

814
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:22,666
Whenever you'd like?

815
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:23,917
- Really?
- Yeah.

816
01:14:24,001 --> 01:14:26,587
I will check our shifts.

817
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:27,880
Okay.

818
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:30,007
Okay.

819
01:14:30,090 --> 01:14:32,551
I think I have arrived.

820
01:14:33,719 --> 01:14:35,053
Yeah.

821
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,020
Nice to see you.

822
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,272
Hello.

823
01:14:51,278 --> 01:14:53,989
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

824
01:14:55,073 --> 01:14:56,825
Thank you for coming.

825
01:14:56,909 --> 01:14:59,244
Until you contacted us, Kazuya,

826
01:14:59,328 --> 01:15:02,164
I was losing hope, to be honest.

827
01:15:04,875 --> 01:15:06,418
I quit my job

828
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,421
and was wracking my brains,

829
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:14,134
thinking about Keiichi Kaburagi.

830
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,014
Me too.

831
01:15:21,099 --> 01:15:24,269
Back then, I was at my wits end.

832
01:15:25,312 --> 01:15:29,525
But now, I can't believe that he did it.

833
01:15:33,612 --> 01:15:35,906
What kind of guy was he?

834
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:44,373
You could say he helped me.

835
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,751
He was a good guy.

836
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,879
He had a beard.

837
01:15:50,963 --> 01:15:53,465
And he had thick glasses.

838
01:15:53,549 --> 01:15:57,219
His clothes were shabby and dirty.

839
01:15:58,303 --> 01:16:03,016
When I met him, he had brown hair,
and he had colored contacts.

840
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:06,812
Oh, I saw that. I was shocked
that it was the same guy.

841
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,821
He didn't do it.

842
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,326
We're working with a lawyer friend of ours

843
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,162
to collect evidence
from the time of the incident.

844
01:16:24,246 --> 01:16:25,872
We don't know if we'll succeed.

845
01:16:26,373 --> 01:16:29,251
If there is any chance at all,
I want to believe we can help.

846
01:16:33,213 --> 01:16:37,134
If there is anything I can help you with,
let me know.

847
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:39,761
He's my buddy.

848
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:51,481
Ta-da!

849
01:16:51,565 --> 01:16:56,069
Woah, this is incredible.
It's very beautiful.

850
01:16:56,153 --> 01:16:59,865
Isn't it? It's a very special place.

851
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:23,138
We're at my favorite place today.

852
01:17:30,896 --> 01:17:32,689
Hey, not fair!

853
01:17:44,993 --> 01:17:47,954
Would you rather be sleeping?
I know you're on the night shift today.

854
01:17:48,997 --> 01:17:50,165
No.

855
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:54,836
- Thank you for bringing me here.
- Don't mention it.

856
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,969
Do you have a girlfriend, Sakurai?

857
01:18:04,137 --> 01:18:06,139
I don't.

858
01:18:06,223 --> 01:18:08,558
Do you have your eye on anyone?

859
01:18:12,437 --> 01:18:14,773
Oh, you do?

860
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:19,111
I'm not sure.

861
01:18:20,070 --> 01:18:21,571
Now, you have me wondering.

862
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,581
Be careful not to slip.

863
01:18:39,840 --> 01:18:41,258
WORKED FOR A LANDSCAPING COMPANY IN
HIGASHIMURAYAMA FROM FEB 2017 TO JAN 2020

864
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:43,719
Higashimurayama Landscaping.

865
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:00,569
18-YEAR-OLD CAPTURED FOR MURDERS
IN HIGASHIMURAYAMA

866
01:19:04,364 --> 01:19:05,365
Osaka.

867
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:09,661
Tokyo? What was his goal?

868
01:19:13,790 --> 01:19:14,916
FAMILY MURDERS IN HIGASHIMURAYAMA

869
01:19:31,224 --> 01:19:32,851
- We need to head out.
- Okay.

870
01:19:32,934 --> 01:19:36,396
EVIDENCE

871
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:39,733
A matchmaking party?
Of course, there aren't any here.

872
01:19:39,816 --> 01:19:43,195
I want to save money quickly
and get back to Tokyo.

873
01:19:43,278 --> 01:19:45,071
We're waiting for you.

874
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:47,532
What are you doing for work? Night shifts?

875
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:49,201
Yes, night shifts.

876
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,578
Wow, that's rough.

877
01:19:51,661 --> 01:19:53,580
I saw your post on Instagram.

878
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:56,082
Oh, yeah.

879
01:19:56,166 --> 01:20:00,086
That guy from work
is in that video I posted today.

880
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,464
Isn't he really handsome?

881
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,008
He looks like your type.

882
01:20:06,009 --> 01:20:07,928
- I think I like him.
- Mai,

883
01:20:08,011 --> 01:20:10,388
you seem to really enjoy being home.

884
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:17,354
Maybe I am. I am enjoying being home.

885
01:20:17,437 --> 01:20:19,397
It's nice to hear that you're doing well.

886
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,526
Gotta go. I'll talk to you again.

887
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:26,446
Okay, bye-bye.

888
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:14,494
- But why?
- Take it slow.

889
01:21:15,245 --> 01:21:16,746
Please.

890
01:21:17,998 --> 01:21:21,751
- I just don't know.
- You're okay. You're okay.

891
01:21:21,835 --> 01:21:24,671
It's okay.

892
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:41,855
Long time no see.

893
01:21:43,231 --> 01:21:44,399
This way.

894
01:21:45,275 --> 01:21:48,653
What got into you all of a sudden?
Ando has quit.

895
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:50,572
We have nothing
to do with the case anymore.

896
01:21:52,198 --> 01:21:54,117
You stopped reporting
on the Kaburagi case,

897
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,869
even though you'd expect
your best response right now.

898
01:21:55,952 --> 01:21:59,956
That decision was above my pay grade.
I don't really get it.

899
01:22:01,875 --> 01:22:03,960
You know where Kaburagi is, right?

900
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:08,715
Of course, I don't. How could I?

901
01:22:09,925 --> 01:22:12,427
I would like to see all the documents
you have on this case.

902
01:22:15,513 --> 01:22:16,681
That would be tricky.

903
01:22:18,016 --> 01:22:20,894
Please.

904
01:22:33,406 --> 01:22:36,451
Sorry to make you come
all the way out here, Sasahara.

905
01:22:36,534 --> 01:22:37,869
It's no trouble.

906
01:22:37,953 --> 01:22:41,039
It can be tricky to get here in the snow.

907
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:49,881
Mai, this is Yoshiko's
younger sister, Sasahara.

908
01:22:51,257 --> 01:22:53,635
Hello. I'm Sakai.

909
01:22:56,471 --> 01:22:58,974
Has there been any change?

910
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,892
She is well.

911
01:23:00,976 --> 01:23:02,477
She does have outbreaks,

912
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:05,772
but she's building
good relationships with our staff.

913
01:23:05,855 --> 01:23:08,108
This is a good facility, right?

914
01:23:08,191 --> 01:23:10,944
Yes, it is very secure.

915
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:15,448
The media keep following me.

916
01:23:15,532 --> 01:23:17,200
I feel like I'm going crazy.

917
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:20,662
Don't worry. Nobody knows of this place.

918
01:23:22,288 --> 01:23:25,041
Yoshiko, we're coming in.

919
01:23:27,585 --> 01:23:29,963
Big Sister!

920
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:36,052
MIYAMURA SANGYO

921
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:43,184
Hiroko has really suffered mentally.

922
01:23:43,268 --> 01:23:46,563
With the police and the media,
our life has been turned upside-down.

923
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:57,532
Heave-ho. Thanks, Hisama.

924
01:24:06,249 --> 01:24:08,043
Where is Hiroko Sasahara?

925
01:24:09,127 --> 01:24:11,004
She quit in the fall.

926
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:13,715
Our journalist came here,
and she just couldn't take it anymore.

927
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:17,177
The police even visit my house.
Can you believe it?

928
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:21,514
The neighbor has to go see them
once a week.

929
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:24,934
A young guy about 20 started working here
in the summer of last year, right?

930
01:24:25,018 --> 01:24:26,644
Oh, you mean Hisama?

931
01:24:26,728 --> 01:24:29,647
- Yeah.
- He left already.

932
01:24:29,731 --> 01:24:31,691
It was right after Hiroko left.

933
01:24:31,775 --> 01:24:33,943
What the hell do you think
you are doing coming here?

934
01:24:34,027 --> 01:24:34,903
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

935
01:24:34,986 --> 01:24:36,696
Hiroko, please calm down.

936
01:24:36,780 --> 01:24:39,741
What's wrong?

937
01:24:44,496 --> 01:24:47,415
That was Keiichi Kaburagi.

938
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,297
Have you spoken to Ando?

939
01:24:55,715 --> 01:24:57,133
No, I've told her nothing.

940
01:24:59,552 --> 01:25:03,139
When everything is done,
I will go apologize to her.

941
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:05,558
Understood.

942
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:18,863
Yes?

943
01:25:21,699 --> 01:25:23,785
Please take care of my sister.

944
01:25:23,868 --> 01:25:25,203
You can count on us.

945
01:25:26,246 --> 01:25:28,331
- Get home safely.
- Thank you.

946
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,708
We are now joined
by CBC special correspondent

947
01:25:30,792 --> 01:25:33,336
Motoaki Ishizuka.

948
01:25:33,419 --> 01:25:35,922
- Nice to see you, Ishizuka.
- Nice to see you too.

949
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:41,177
The perpetrator of the family murders
in Nishitokyo City has been indicted.

950
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:45,598
This incident is reminiscent
of the family murder in Higashimurayama

951
01:25:45,682 --> 01:25:49,727
four years ago. It is thought
that it may be a copycat incident.

952
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:54,566
The methods used and the brutality
are reminiscent of the Kaburagi case.

953
01:25:54,649 --> 01:25:57,861
He may be sentenced to death swiftly.

954
01:25:57,944 --> 01:26:02,240
The methods used by Ashikaga in the
Nishitokyo incident are reminiscent of…

955
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,784
- I'm back.
- Hey.

956
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:14,460
- Hey, Yomota…
- Yes?

957
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:16,421
What were you talking about just now?

958
01:26:19,382 --> 01:26:21,384
You were talking
about security and the police…

959
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:27,307
Don't worry about it.

960
01:26:27,390 --> 01:26:29,851
Make sure you take good care of Yoshiko.

961
01:26:35,565 --> 01:26:39,110
Hello. Care Home Aoba.

962
01:26:41,988 --> 01:26:44,532
Yes, she is here today.

963
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:48,494
Please wait a moment.
Mai, it's your mother.

964
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:55,793
Hello.

965
01:26:57,128 --> 01:26:58,213
Huh?

966
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,298
AN UNEMPLOYED MAN HAS BEEN ARRESTED
ON SUSPICION

967
01:27:00,381 --> 01:27:02,217
OF MURDERING A FAMILY IN NISHITOKYO

968
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:07,180
Hello?

969
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:10,516
It's Nasu! They've found Nasu!

970
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,517
What?

971
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,269
I'm going to send you a link.

972
01:27:13,853 --> 01:27:14,979
Here you go.

973
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,192
MISSED CALL FROM MOM

974
01:27:19,275 --> 01:27:20,735
MESSAGE

975
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:26,199
DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE KABURAGI?

976
01:27:27,951 --> 01:27:30,161
DOESN'T HE LOOK LIKE KABURAGI?

977
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,587
Roger. We'll be there as soon as we can.

978
01:27:40,213 --> 01:27:44,300
We have the location. He's
at Care Home Aoba in Suwa City, Nagano.

979
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,428
It seems like the surviving family member,
Yoshiko Io, resides there.

980
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:49,305
Oh…

981
01:27:49,973 --> 01:27:51,516
The prefectural police
are already on their way.

982
01:28:05,571 --> 01:28:06,572
Yoshiko,

983
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:08,866
have you remembered what happened?

984
01:28:12,287 --> 01:28:16,582
Please, I'm begging you, Yoshiko.
I've run out of time.

985
01:28:18,710 --> 01:28:20,670
I can't remember.

986
01:28:23,047 --> 01:28:27,093
Please. Try to remember
what happened that day.

987
01:28:31,222 --> 01:28:33,933
Yoshiko, I know you can remember.

988
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:36,519
Please. Please.

989
01:28:58,166 --> 01:28:59,500
Sakurai…

990
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:19,479
- This is Yomota, a staff member here.
- Hello.

991
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:21,939
The escapee is on the second floor.

992
01:29:27,695 --> 01:29:29,155
Sakai,

993
01:29:31,032 --> 01:29:33,368
I have something I need you to do for me.

994
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,374
I think it has been about two months.

995
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,128
- You said it would be okay!
- Calm down.

996
01:29:44,212 --> 01:29:45,463
Where is my sister?

997
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:46,672
- How could you let this--
- Kaburagi…

998
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:57,391
Kaburagi,

999
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,145
there is no use trying to resist.

1000
01:30:02,396 --> 01:30:03,898
Give yourself up.

1001
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:08,236
I know you know the truth.

1002
01:30:09,612 --> 01:30:11,155
What are you talking about?

1003
01:30:15,409 --> 01:30:17,703
You know who the real criminal is.

1004
01:30:31,425 --> 01:30:32,677
The escaped convict in the case

1005
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,096
of the Higashimurayama murders,
Keiichi Kaburagi,

1006
01:30:35,179 --> 01:30:38,224
has currently taken a hostage
at Care Home Aoba

1007
01:30:38,307 --> 01:30:41,936
in Suwa City, Nagano Prefecture.

1008
01:30:46,941 --> 01:30:50,194
We can now go live
to the elderly care facility

1009
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:54,073
in Nagano, where Keiichi Kaburagi
is currently holed up.

1010
01:30:58,369 --> 01:31:03,040
We are about 12km from Shimosuwa Station
in Suwa City, Nagano.

1011
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:07,211
The police have taken over the area.

1012
01:31:07,295 --> 01:31:08,754
A man who seems to resemble

1013
01:31:08,838 --> 01:31:11,924
death row convict Keiichi Kaburagi
is holed up inside

1014
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:16,387
and has taken a hostage.

1015
01:31:16,470 --> 01:31:20,641
Hey! That's Hisama! It's Hisama.

1016
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:32,195
Why would you do something like this?

1017
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,781
This is my only hope.

1018
01:31:36,949 --> 01:31:38,534
Please.

1019
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:54,342
Police have taken control of the area.

1020
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:55,676
He has started streaming.

1021
01:31:57,511 --> 01:32:02,767
We're now hearing there's a feed
from inside the facility on social media.

1022
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:03,976
- It's Kaburagi.
- Please, you have to remember.

1023
01:32:04,727 --> 01:32:06,312
What happened on that day?

1024
01:32:06,395 --> 01:32:10,816
From our vantage point, we can't confirm
what is happening at the moment,

1025
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,152
but you can see
what is happening on social media.

1026
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:16,155
- I can't remember.
- Please, I'm begging you.

1027
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:20,409
I need your testimony.

1028
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:22,954
Please.

1029
01:32:31,170 --> 01:32:34,757
You saw the real perpetrator, right?

1030
01:32:59,865 --> 01:33:01,575
Hello.

1031
01:33:02,159 --> 01:33:05,288
Pardon me for the intrusion. Hello?

1032
01:33:36,610 --> 01:33:40,448
H-huh?

1033
01:33:51,250 --> 01:33:52,752
Are you okay?

1034
01:34:01,677 --> 01:34:02,845
H-hang on.

1035
01:34:02,928 --> 01:34:05,806
Stay still! Don't move.

1036
01:34:06,390 --> 01:34:08,392
- You've got it all wrong.
- Don't move.

1037
01:34:08,476 --> 01:34:10,478
- Don't move.
- It wasn't me.

1038
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:13,731
I didn't do it.

1039
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:16,317
- Stop resisting.
- It wasn't me.

1040
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:18,611
If you ask her, she'll tell you.

1041
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:21,113
I didn't do it.

1042
01:34:26,452 --> 01:34:27,828
The person who did it

1043
01:34:28,746 --> 01:34:31,665
was Kiyoto Ashikaga,
who people will have seen in the media.

1044
01:34:32,291 --> 01:34:34,960
I'm sure that you saw him, Yoshiko.

1045
01:34:59,527 --> 01:35:01,153
What the heck is he doing?

1046
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:04,031
What the heck is he doing?
How should we respond, Matanuki?

1047
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:22,758
Yes?

1048
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:25,678
What are you playing at?
Get in there, now.

1049
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:27,304
We haven't confirmed
the hostage's safety--

1050
01:35:27,388 --> 01:35:28,639
Get the fuck in there!

1051
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:47,283
- Prepare to enter the facility!
- Yes, sir.

1052
01:36:00,045 --> 01:36:01,255
It's you.

1053
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:09,847
This is all my fault.

1054
01:36:41,003 --> 01:36:42,546
Please, Yoshiko.

1055
01:36:45,341 --> 01:36:48,344
I didn't do it!

1056
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:54,975
Please, I beg you.

1057
01:37:08,113 --> 01:37:10,241
On that day,

1058
01:37:12,952 --> 01:37:14,328
I…

1059
01:40:20,639 --> 01:40:23,142
361 DAYS SINCE THE ESCAPE

1060
01:40:28,981 --> 01:40:30,107
Sakai?

1061
01:40:48,876 --> 01:40:50,252
Nice to meet you.

1062
01:40:50,753 --> 01:40:52,045
Same to you.

1063
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:02,181
Thank you once again for coming.

1064
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:06,477
As I previously told you,
we are collecting letters of support

1065
01:41:06,560 --> 01:41:08,812
from those who knew Kaburagi.

1066
01:41:09,813 --> 01:41:10,773
Right.

1067
01:41:11,273 --> 01:41:15,861
At the facility, you heard that the
real culprit was Kiyoro Ashikaga, right?

1068
01:41:20,032 --> 01:41:23,744
It now appears that Ashikaga had hinted
at other crimes that he committed,

1069
01:41:23,827 --> 01:41:27,706
and that there were irregularities
in the account of his testimony.

1070
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:30,834
It seems like public opinion
is also changing bit by bit.

1071
01:41:32,961 --> 01:41:36,340
We believe that Kaburagi is innocent.

1072
01:41:37,007 --> 01:41:39,635
What do you think, Sakai?

1073
01:41:41,178 --> 01:41:42,721
I…

1074
01:41:48,060 --> 01:41:49,645
think that Sakurai

1075
01:41:51,897 --> 01:41:53,440
was a nice guy,

1076
01:41:55,317 --> 01:41:57,486
and I looked up to him.

1077
01:42:00,697 --> 01:42:03,867
But in reality,

1078
01:42:04,660 --> 01:42:06,787
I didn't really know him at all.

1079
01:42:09,289 --> 01:42:12,334
I'm sure that the guy you knew, Sakurai,

1080
01:42:12,417 --> 01:42:14,920
was a reflection of who he really his.

1081
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:20,509
Mistakes emerge when people
make judgments about others.

1082
01:42:21,802 --> 01:42:23,428
But mistakes need to be corrected.

1083
01:42:26,640 --> 01:42:32,187
I want to breathe new life
into his existence.

1084
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:40,028
And I want people to understand
what he was really like.

1085
01:42:50,455 --> 01:42:51,582
I get it.

1086
01:43:15,105 --> 01:43:16,773
- See you.
- Later.

1087
01:43:19,526 --> 01:43:21,320
THEY ARE APPEALING FOR A RETRIAL

1088
01:43:44,635 --> 01:43:47,638
- Please sign our petition.
- Please sign our petition.

1089
01:43:47,721 --> 01:43:48,555
- Hello.
- Please help us.

1090
01:43:48,639 --> 01:43:50,432
We need your assistance.

1091
01:43:50,515 --> 01:43:51,558
- Please.
- Please

1092
01:43:51,642 --> 01:43:54,394
WAS THE NISHITOKYO MURDERER
ALSO INVOLVED IN OTHER CRIMES?

1093
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:15,082
More and more evidence
is coming to light on Ashikaga.

1094
01:44:16,041 --> 01:44:20,671
If we made a false arrest, this
could damage the reputation of the police.

1095
01:44:22,047 --> 01:44:25,717
But please don't worry.

1096
01:44:26,593 --> 01:44:28,971
Culpability for something so serious won't
fall to you. Return to your normal duties.

1097
01:44:30,347 --> 01:44:31,390
Okay.

1098
01:44:31,932 --> 01:44:36,228
Kaburagi's escape is a major blunder
that will go down in history.

1099
01:44:36,311 --> 01:44:39,439
But it will assist us
in strengthening our efforts

1100
01:44:39,523 --> 01:44:42,734
to prevent future crimes
and deal with escapees.

1101
01:44:45,237 --> 01:44:46,488
What are you trying to say?

1102
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:50,784
Keiichi Kaburagi was the one
who killed that family in Higashimurayama.

1103
01:44:51,743 --> 01:44:55,998
The full truth is not important
in this case.

1104
01:44:57,916 --> 01:44:59,960
You did well.

1105
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:02,879
Just lay low and wait it out. Okay?

1106
01:45:13,223 --> 01:45:14,474
Come in.

1107
01:45:20,605 --> 01:45:21,898
Sit down.

1108
01:45:50,719 --> 01:45:52,054
It's been a while.

1109
01:45:57,142 --> 01:45:58,810
Yes, it has.

1110
01:46:08,028 --> 01:46:09,529
How are you feeling?

1111
01:46:13,241 --> 01:46:15,118
I am feeling a lot better.

1112
01:46:18,830 --> 01:46:19,915
Is that so…

1113
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,515
There is one question

1114
01:46:39,059 --> 01:46:41,228
I have yet to get an answer to.

1115
01:46:44,564 --> 01:46:45,649
What is it?

1116
01:46:50,028 --> 01:46:51,613
Why did you try to escape?

1117
01:47:20,851 --> 01:47:22,978
My name is Matanuki from the
Tokyo Police's Investigation Division.

1118
01:47:24,521 --> 01:47:28,233
In the Higashimurayama murder case
involving Keiichi Kaburagi,

1119
01:47:30,068 --> 01:47:31,736
we may have charged the wrong person.

1120
01:47:37,659 --> 01:47:40,287
All responsibility for this rests with me.

1121
01:47:43,123 --> 01:47:44,708
Please be quiet.

1122
01:47:45,292 --> 01:47:47,752
I would like to have
another press conference

1123
01:47:47,836 --> 01:47:49,588
once we have
appropriately reinvestigated matters.

1124
01:47:51,256 --> 01:47:53,008
Please calm down.

1125
01:47:57,387 --> 01:48:00,265
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1126
01:48:00,348 --> 01:48:01,850
- Thank you.
- Oh! Sayaka!

1127
01:48:05,562 --> 01:48:08,440
TOKYO POLICE ANNOUNCE REOPENING
OF HIGASHIMURAYAMA MURDER CASE

1128
01:48:08,523 --> 01:48:10,233
‪Wow. Is this for real?

1129
01:48:37,302 --> 01:48:40,597
819 DAYS SINCE THE ESCAPE

1130
01:49:14,089 --> 01:49:15,340
Stop there.

1131
01:49:24,391 --> 01:49:26,309
Why did you try to escape?

1132
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:38,363
I wanted to believe

1133
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:41,074
that this world was a good place.

1134
01:49:44,077 --> 01:49:45,662
I wanted to believe that

1135
01:49:46,538 --> 01:49:48,623
if I stood up for what is right,

1136
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:52,419
people would listen to me.

1137
01:50:01,011 --> 01:50:02,721
When I got out,

1138
01:50:06,016 --> 01:50:09,602
I got a job for the first time in my life.

1139
01:50:12,564 --> 01:50:14,399
I drank alcohol

1140
01:50:16,109 --> 01:50:17,944
for the first time ever.

1141
01:50:23,283 --> 01:50:25,410
I made friends.

1142
01:50:29,205 --> 01:50:31,624
I started to like people.

1143
01:50:39,632 --> 01:50:42,677
I started to be happy to be alive.

1144
01:50:48,058 --> 01:50:49,309
And then I thought…

1145
01:50:55,065 --> 01:50:57,317
I wanted to keep on living.

1146
01:51:26,513 --> 01:51:27,931
Long time no see, Nasu.

1147
01:51:33,269 --> 01:51:34,896
Long time no see.

1148
01:51:46,616 --> 01:51:47,867
I'm sorry.

1149
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:50,662
Don't apologize.

1150
01:51:53,081 --> 01:51:55,041
When it's all over, I'll ask you
all the questions I have.

1151
01:51:58,086 --> 01:51:59,796
When it's over?

1152
01:52:00,296 --> 01:52:01,339
What the hell, Benzo?

1153
01:52:02,715 --> 01:52:04,801
So, that's what you really look like?

1154
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:09,222
Yes.

1155
01:52:10,682 --> 01:52:11,850
I've…

1156
01:52:13,518 --> 01:52:15,395
started studying for a qualification.

1157
01:52:16,604 --> 01:52:20,275
Isn't that cool?
You should be telling me how great I am!

1158
01:52:22,444 --> 01:52:23,862
That's incredible.

1159
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:35,915
I'm working with Kazuya Nonomura,

1160
01:52:35,999 --> 01:52:37,542
Mai Sakai,

1161
01:52:38,376 --> 01:52:42,130
and my own father, in order
to prove your innocence.

1162
01:52:47,218 --> 01:52:48,386
I…

1163
01:52:50,930 --> 01:52:53,141
decided I'm not running away anymore.

1164
01:52:56,603 --> 01:52:59,439
I'm going to face up to both myself

1165
01:53:00,940 --> 01:53:02,650
and everyone around me.

1166
01:53:05,862 --> 01:53:07,822
It was meeting you

1167
01:53:08,948 --> 01:53:10,366
that helped me come to that decision.

1168
01:53:18,583 --> 01:53:21,044
But all I have done is run away?

1169
01:53:26,174 --> 01:53:27,717
When all of this is done,

1170
01:53:30,970 --> 01:53:32,180
let's go get some drinks.

1171
01:53:39,604 --> 01:53:40,647
Sure.

1172
01:53:41,314 --> 01:53:42,607
We'll be waiting for you…

1173
01:53:46,819 --> 01:53:48,655
Keiichi Kaburagi.

1174
01:53:51,908 --> 01:53:53,076
You are entitled to live

1175
01:53:54,244 --> 01:53:56,746
the life you have ahead of you
to the fullest.

1176
01:54:13,805 --> 01:54:14,973
Thank you.

1177
01:54:25,316 --> 01:54:27,944
Your name is Keiichi Kaburagi, correct?

1178
01:54:30,321 --> 01:54:31,364
Yes.

1179
01:54:32,657 --> 01:54:36,494
I will now deliver my verdict
on the accused, Keiichi Kaburagi,

1180
01:54:36,578 --> 01:54:43,334
who is charged with the crimes
of trespassing and murder.

1181
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:47,046
I find the defendant…

1182
02:00:29,680 --> 02:00:32,683
