1
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,710
Move, move, quickly!

2
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,790
To the position of the four battalions!

3
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:56,560
Get the burnt box!\NHurry up!

4
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:57,760
Team 1 is ready!

5
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,730
How many shots are coming?

6
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,120
I think 20 shots.

7
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:01,660
Son of bitches..

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,900
We'll pay you back with 50 shots\Ncounter fire!

9
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:08,360
50 menace shots, fire!

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,780
- Fire!\N- Fire!

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,890
How many shots?

12
00:01:15,690 --> 00:01:17,330
Two hundred shots.

13
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,140
These bastards..

14
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,580
Just go over 500 shots.

15
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:24,090
Chief of staff!

16
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,430
I think it's 100 shots this time!

17
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,150
Are they crazy?\NAre they going to war?

18
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,490
Blow 200 shots!

19
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,060
A few years ago, the front unit, which had been pierced in knock order, was pierced again.

20
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,110
It's broke.\NMilitary discipline is broken.

21
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,100
Is the military an army these days?You have to roll it.

22
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,920
-Bang!\N-Bang!

23
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,120

00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,190

00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,640
-Bang!\N- Now, even the lucky lottery!

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,930
-Bang!\N- Thank you!

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,540
Hey, what's the sound?\NStill in a war?

29
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,160
The North is continuing to shoot and provoke, perhaps because of an accident in Cheorwon.

30
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,680
Hey, I'm on my way.

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,430
Don't back down. Push it according to the rules of engagement.

32
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,610
You're wasting your ammo, you punks.

33
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,040
So far, 3,000 shots have been fired.

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,370
Give me another 300 shots.

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,430
The second round is on me.

36
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,620
The 2nd round is...

37
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,460
It's today's mission.

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,460
Captain's on his way, you know?

39
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,700
Captain, there're three horse dungs, three.

40
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:26,140
Go and see where it's coming from. Go!

41
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,770
Can sergeant Park talk to dogs?

42
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:34,030
Where are you?

43
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,270
500m?

44
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,610

45
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,670

48
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,300
- Park Chunwoo!\N- Park Chunwoo! Park Chun...

49
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,460

- He's stressed out.\N- He's stressed out.

51
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:42,810
It's a bit fishy.

00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:46,640
- Holstein, Holstein!\N- Hols!

53
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,670

Airsher, airsher!\NIt's Airsher!

55
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,120
Sergeant Park, you're amazing.

56
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,420
Isn't he like a milk barista?

57
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,630
My house used to have a big ranch.

58
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,580
- Ranch?\N- Ranch.

59
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,920
Why do you forget about the foot-and-mouth disease?

60
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,850
Loyalty!

61
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,580
- Hey, Seongho!\N- Yes.

62
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,870
Not going to work, huh?

63
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,890
Hey, if knock defect is coming again you know?\NGet moving!

64
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,600
- I got it!\N- Hey, hey.

00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:23,380
Come on.

68
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,660
- Move quickly, move, move.

69
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,840
- Yes, sir\N- Yes, sir.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,060
Supply officer, are you on duty?

71
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:32,330
No, it looks like the hols's stuck again.

72
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:34,390
It's not easy to get water.

73
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,180
- Take care of yourself. Thank you.

74
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,880
- Good day.\N- Good luck!

75
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,900
- Hey, bring me the chessboard.\N- Yes, sir.

76
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,270

77
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,620
97 days.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:51,960
Oh, 15 hours.

79
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,870
No, 15 hours.\N30 minutes are left!

80
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,000
Still?

81
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,560
Yes, right.

82
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,430
What's wrong with this?

83
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,110
Okay, the draw has begun!

84
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,500
The first lucky number is 39.

85
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,660
What's the second\Nlucky number?

86
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,920
36.

87
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,280
Damn, I got two right.

88
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,000
Here's a draw for the 3rd number.

89
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,070
3!

90
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,790
Yes, 3...\NThe 4th lucky number.

91
00:06:37,850 --> 00:06:39,260
30.

92
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,790
There are a lot of numbers with 3 letters?

93
00:06:41,790 --> 00:06:44,590
The 5th lucky number is 1!

94
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:55,270
So, what's the last 6th\Nlucky number?

95
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:56,560
The ball is spinning fast...

96
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,320
- Get rid of it.\N- Yes, sir!

97
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,770
What are you doing, not preparing for the roll call?

98
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,360
These guys just lost their themselves.

99
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,100
Don't you wake up?

100
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,100
Hey, hey ...

101
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:14,520
33!

102
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,290
Now, we'll draw a bonus ball for second place.

103
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,770
- The 934th.\N- Hey.

104
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,650

- //39, //30, //3\N- Probably spoiled milk.

106
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,220
You did.

107
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,650
Spoiled milk?

108
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,380
- What's wrong?\N- Are you crazy?

109
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:43,250
Drank spoiled milk?

110
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,960
Spoiled milk?

111
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,890
Crying while laughing.

112
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,780
Hey, go.

113
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,170
Excuse me, Sergeant Park. Are you okay?

114
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,830
No, because the world is so beautiful.

115
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:03,710
Yeah?

116
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,820
Hey, what are you saying?

117
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,250
I don't know.

118
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,700
5.7 billion.

119
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:40,090
South Korean soldiers.Hello.

120
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:45,940
How hard is it to work on the front desk all day and night?

121
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:48,410
We, the guards,

122
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:53,210
are here with warm love and consideration from the awe-inspiring Commander Comrade.

123
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,090
North Korean soldiers,

124
00:08:55,090 --> 00:09:00,420
there's a weather forecast on the supercomputer of the Korea Meteorological Administration.

125
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,180
It will rain in three hours.

126
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:08,190
With the affection of our compatriots, we inform North Korea that there is no other supercomputer.

127
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,330
Hey, what are we gonna do about this?

128
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,850
According to our North Korean scientific satellite\NGwangmyeongseong No. 2.

129
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:18,240
It's not raining.

130
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,320
Our comrade fart man(Bang Kwi Nam) soldier leader and I

131
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:26,250
have developed a lot of feelings in such a program,

132
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,400
he has no taste and dryness, his name is also very rustic,

133
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:33,230
we have prepared three lines of poetry for comrade fart man, you wanna hear it?

134
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,260
IU from North Korea prepared an acrostic poem.

135
00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:39,470
Of course I'll have to hear it.

136
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:43,390
Fart, farting boom boom.

137
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:46,120
Kwi, Kwi-nam.

138
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:50,650
Nam, South Korean hot pants.

139
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,150
Hot pants..

140
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,630
Comrade Yeonhee, take it easy.

141
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,860
Since IU sent us an acrostic poem.

142
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,770
I should send you a reply with an acrostic poem.

143
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:07,170
I know.

144
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,140
IU is the most beautiful singer in South Korea.

145
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,110
Should I say the first letter?\NAh.

146
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,120
She still think

147
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,200
she's pretty.

148
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,720
Yoo, I'm sorry to hear that.

149
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:28,600
Sergeant Park!

150
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,300
A South Korean soldier who only judges people by their looks.

151
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,600
Don't you have a girlfriend?

152
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,970
You're very angry.

153
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,600
But even angrier if you heard this?

154
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,850
That's what, 10 years of military service?

155
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,750
What should I do?\NI'm about to be discharged.

156
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,520
Where's medicine.

157
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,720
unable to get rid of the nasty sickness.

158
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,240
If you play around like that,

159
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,700
you're likely to end up in an acorn.

160
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,180
Irrational madness.\NThat's it. Come on!

161
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:07,010
Come on!

162
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:13,370
- It's not a coincidence.\N- Loyalty!

163
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,210
What's

164
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,940
that?

165
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,000
I think our GP has soldiers of interest.

166
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,250
Soldiers of interest?

167
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,890
Sergeant Park Chun-woo is a bit weird these days.

168
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,450
Park Chun-woo?

169
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:33,590
A real rich man doesn't ignore others.

170
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,840
A positive attitude of keeping dignity.

171
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,810
That's the real elite.

172
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,300
It's a good story.

173
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,440
Well, can I go to the bathroom?

174
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,890
Why are you asking me that?\NAsk your old man.

175
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,860
It's not small, it's big.

176
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,070
You're doing a good job.\NYou're not supposed to hold back your shit.

177
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:22,590
No!

178
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,850
What am I supposed to do?

179
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,970
Welcome, Comrade Lee Yongho.

180
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,680
What are you looking at?

181
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,220
I am just bored watching the German War movie.

182
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,110
Watch it together?

183
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,010
I've memorized everything now.

184
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,090
I should've seen this more than 100 times.

185
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,950
Chol-jin companion.

186
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:33,000
Can I ask you something?

187
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,320
I don't know anyone else, but I have to help Lee Yong-ho.

188
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,010
I picked up a piece of South Korean paper.

189
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,330
You know what this is?

190
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,770
It's called 645.

191
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:46,880
645?

192
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,820
If you get 6 correct out of 45 numbers,

193
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,640
A vicious capitalist exploitation technique

194
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,200
that fleeces the Korean people in the name of giving them huge amounts of money.

195
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,300
But this is the day of the last drawing.

196
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,920
Is this the latest piece of paper?

197
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,980
Just for fun, take a look.

198
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:07,190
OK.

199
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:14,140
Okay, there it is. .

200
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,690
Number one, three, and thirty.

201
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:18,930
3...

202
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:23,950
33, 36.

203
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:26,850
Lastly, number 39.

204
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,470
This is the number one.

205
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,780
What's the matter, Comrade Chol Jin?

206
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,730
It's...

207
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,160
What is this?

208
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,030
Yeah, well...

209
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,780
What should we do?

210
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,100
Yeah?

211
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,890
I almost broke my back.

212
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,570
The temperature is 21 degrees Celsius and the wind is from the northeast.

213
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:10,030
The wind speed is 14 m /s\NA lottery ticket weighs 75 grams.

214
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:11,750
If you plug in the formula for free fall.

215
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,660
The flight distance of Lotto is 1.23 km.

216
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:28,170
This is where the lottery is.

217
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,620
What's going on?

218
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,370
What?

219
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,080
Just hand out the flyers!

220
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,080
Oh.

221
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:16,440
Hello, here.

222
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,850
Put the gun down.

223
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm not gonna eat you. Okay?

224
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,980
Come on.

225
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,200
Put the gun down.

226
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,340
What's your name?

227
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:08,970
It's Park Chunwoo?

228
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,620
My name is Lee Yongho.

229
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,790
Sergeant Lee Yongho.

230
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,250
Sergeant Lee Yongho.

231
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,110
It's been three days since we met.

232
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,770
I came out to meet my South Korean soldier.

233
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,990
Welcome to Free Korea.

234
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:31,110
What are you talking about, you stupid?

235
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,840
But why do you keep talking informally?

236
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:34,940
I mean you.

237
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,430
Do you know the game called "645"?

238
00:18:39,390 --> 00:18:42,600
Out of 45 numbers, if you get 6 correct, you'll get 1st place.

239
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:45,390
I picked up a 645.

240
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,800
This is a piece of paper for first place.

241
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,190
So..

242
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,010
I'll give you 10% if you bring the cash.

243
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,650
I finally found it, thank you!

244
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,860
Hey, North Korean soldier.

245
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,390
That, that's mine.

246
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:09,070
So give it to me while I'm being nice.

247
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,050
What?

248
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,310
Is this yours?

249
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:15,340
Yeah, that's how I got here.

250
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,690
Stupid.

251
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,510
934th, right?

252
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,750
- Yeah.\N-1, 3, 30.

253
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,410
Number 33, number 36, number 39, right?

254
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:27,790
Yeah, so it's mine! Give it back!

255
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,820
You Korean boy think I'm hot pants?

256
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,480
And where does this note belong?

257
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,400
Who got it who's the owner.

258
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,650
What does that mean?\NWhat's that?

259
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,220
Sergeant Park Chun-woo.

260
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
When is your next shift again?

261
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,460
- What's that?\N- Answer me, you jerk!

262
00:19:51,550 --> 00:19:53,210
Three days later, you punk!

263
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:54,820
I'll see you here in three days.

264
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,210
I'm gonna talk to you here again, okay?

265
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,700
Wait.

266
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,230
It hurts a lot?

267
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,200
No.

268
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,050
Are you... At night..

269
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,420
Did you meet a ghost and wrestled?

270
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,010
No.

271
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,080
But why do you walk around at night like a madman?

272
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,100
And in a minefield you'll find if you go in.

273
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:17,720
Wouldn't it be nice if you didn't explode?

274
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,150
You cross the bars and you're in the brig by law.

275
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,690
But you'll be discharged in a few months

276
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:26,360
and you have serious mental health problems.

277
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,570
I'm alright.

278
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:30,650
No problem at all.

279
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,860
But why cross the barbed wire every night like a madman.

280
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:34,660
Wandering around the Demilitarized Zone, you punk!

281
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:37,400
Five of the dog holes you dug!\NWho are you?

282
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,710
Really son of bitch?

283
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:39,920
Are you a spy? Nasty bastard.

284
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,870
I'm not a spy.

285
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:42,550
Don't you dare talk back to me, boy!

286
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:59,590
I'll report to the main office first\NGo to the hospital for treatment first.

287
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:09,660
Actually, I won first prize in the lottery.

288
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:11,400
I was watching TV in the Home Office.

289
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,200
Number 1, 3, 30, 33\NNumber 36 and 39.

290
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,690
The prize money alone is 5.7 billion won.

291
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:23,630
That lottery was brought to me by the battalion leader in the Jeep.

292
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:26,520
He didn't give it to me. It came like fate.

293
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,800
The recruits on duty together suddenly had diarrhea, and the ticket flew away.

294
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,750
- Is that gone?\N-yeah!

295
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,190
- So?\N- Well, so...

296
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,310
So, go back a little, huh?

297
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,060
Let me talk freely, huh?

298
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,440
- The lottery flew to the north.\N- Yes, yes

299
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,480
A North Korean soldier named Sergeant Lee Yongho picked it up.

300
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:48,450
I'm Captain Kang, 437\NPut me through to the hospital.

301
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:50,160
No, no, Chief.

302
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,880
- A few days ago, at the Military Demarcation Line.\N- Yes.

303
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,620
I met the North Korean soldier.

304
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,000
But the guy only wants to give me 10%.

305
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,050
That's a shame! That's mine.

306
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,130
It's yours, so it's not making sense.\NRight?

307
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,670
Do you have a helicopter now?\NWe have a critical patient. We need to get him out of here.

308
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,040
No, we were supposed to meet the North Korean soldier in three days...

309
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,080
Now the hole's blocked up. I can't see him.

310
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,560
The dog holes are blocked up.

311
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,040
It must have been hard?

312
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,040
Can you at least send a truck if the ambulance can't stop?

313
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,210
Look at my eyes.

314
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,790
Yeah?

315
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,360
We're going to the hospital. Hurry up.

316
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,070
No.

317
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:32,680
- I know I can't do that.\N- What?

318
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,760
Look.

319
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:38,410
I told you it's true.

320
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,780
I won 5.7 billion in the lottery!

321
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:49,730
Loyalty! TOD observation soldier\NPrivate First Class Kim Man-Cheol!

322
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,460
I need to talk to my leader.

323
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,800
You're just in time.\NYou use your computer a lot, don't you?

324
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,860
Can you use TOD to detect fake photos?

325
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,560
Computers have nothing to do with TOD.

326
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,590
This guy's good. He faked a photo, huh?

327
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:08,260
Let's go back. There's another one.

328
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,520
5.7 billion in North Korea?

329
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:26,770
Sergeant Park.

330
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,300
So you risked your life over the fence?

331
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,180
You're really incredible.

332
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,670
Hey, I'm glad I found it.\NIt's heaven's help

333
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:40,760
This secret is carried to the end of the grave.

334
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,480
- Yes.\N- Yes.

335
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,630
In all battles, power analysis is the basic.

336
00:23:44,170 --> 00:23:46,570
If you know your enemy and know us, you'll win every battle.

337
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:49,730
What kind of guy is that North Korean guy who picked up the lottery?

338
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,250
A bastard.

339
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,060
Bastard?

340
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,600
Yes.

341
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,410
For the sake of the party and the people.

342
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,610
I thought this money should be spent for the country, of course.

343
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,960
Same.

344
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:08,720
What have the party and the state done for us?

345
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,500
You're right.

346
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,480
I wholeheartedly agree with Comrade Lee Yong-ho.

347
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,350
Hard parents,

348
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:21,530
my sister wants to be a singer's dream,

349
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,290
I will achieve in the end.

350
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,820
I have to change my dad's dentures first.

351
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,070
Very steel alloy\NSwiss dentures.

352
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,950
Change them all.

353
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,240
Chol Jin superior soldier comrade.

354
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:40,350
This heart must not change.

355
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:46,790
Whatever it takes to kick that Korean son of a bitch's ass.

356
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:49,630
Make sure you get back from your mission.

357
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,490
You know I have a daughter, right?

358
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:57,330
Doesn't have a piano that everyone else have.

359
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,270
I came home one day.

360
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,440
She drew the piano on the drawing paper with colored pencils.

361
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:07,800
Sola Sola Redo.

362
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,870
Can I give you 10%?

363
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,390
One day my wife is going to

364
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,350
pay my mother's medical bills

365
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:22,080
I'm going to put mom in a nursing home,

366
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,090
but I don't have the money or the piano.

367
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,100
One day the kid said,

368
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:31,750
Dad, why don't we have money?

369
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,230
Can I give you 15%?

370
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:41,680
With generous support and sponsorship for 15% of the shares, there is no better platoon leader.

371
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,710
Sergeant Park Chun-woo.

372
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,830
I'm a man of conscience, huh?\NLet's do it well.

373
00:25:56,770 --> 00:25:58,220
Manchul, what number do you like?

374
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,260
Number? Maybe, 7?

375
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,200
- Ok, give you 7%\N- 10.

376
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:09,450
So the number 10, 10.

377
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:14,190
Come to think of it, isn't that a nice, perfect number?

378
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,350
Ten. Name is Ten. Ten. Ten

379
00:26:18,630 --> 00:26:19,710
10, Ten.

380
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,350
Sergeant Park! Park...

381
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,590
What? Why is this open?

382
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,350
I think this is a supply tube.

383
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:29,340
The pipes are so old that they are often unclogged.

384
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,490
There is no ice in the demilitarized zone even in winter.

385
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,340
Only the supply officer knows the map of the springs and Wells.

386
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:39,700
How nice would it be to open up and talk?

387
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:42,760
On the south side is the Lost Property Act.

388
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,650
I mean, there's all kinds of weird stuff going on.

389
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:48,660
See, section four of the Lost Property Act.

390
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:51,140
When picking up something lost by another.

391
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,960
Compensation ranges from 5 percent to 20 percent.

392
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:55,410
How great would that be?

393
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:58,090
According to the law, you can claim compensation.

394
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,220
Is that so?

395
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:02,180
So I'm 80, you're 20.

396
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,540
Get out.

397
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,820
You really don't understand the language.

398
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:12,440
You'll need an ID to get that.

399
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,820
And even if you hold it, you wouldn't get any prize money!

400
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:18,100
It is said that the period to collect the bonus is one year.

401
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,430
You think there's nothing we can do?

402
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,870
Search all defectors whose in-laws and relatives have settled in the south.

403
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:25,750
We can find it, too. We win.

404
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,250
You don't make any sense. Negotiations are broken.

405
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,280
You bas...\NReally...

406
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,160
How did it go?

407
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,100
Where are those Korean motherfuckers?

408
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,470
If we search the defectors carefully.

409
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,700
We can find it, too.\NCan't we threaten him?

410
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,310
If you read that right.

411
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:58,370
I wouldn't have anything to say right now if you were sentenced on the spot.

412
00:27:58,370 --> 00:27:59,660
Comrade political instructor.

413
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,900
Put the gun down.

414
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:05,390
Where do you want to go?

415
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:09,410
Yoduk political prison camp? Gaechon camp?\NPick one.

416
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,010
That's where people used to sweat and bleed.

417
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,540
The exploiters and the sectarians have come together.

418
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,460
It's like coming back to home. Very warm.

419
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:21,200
I'll tell you the truth, political instructor.

420
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,290
Not long ago Comrade Li Yongho.

421
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:26,600
Picked up a lottery ticket blown by the wind from Korea.

422
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,640
What's that?

423
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,840
I hear they give you a lot of money if you win.

424
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,570
- The Korean people's...\N- son of...

425
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,130
Political instructor comrade, the 645 won the first prize.

426
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:38,520
The Korean kid who claimed 645 was his.

427
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,930
We're negotiating a 50-50 split.

428
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,610
How much is the bonus?

429
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:48,090
The total amount is 5.7 billion won.

430
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,100
How much dollar.

431
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,740
In dollar terms...

432
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,740
6 million.

433
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:02,650
What? 6 million?

434
00:29:02,770 --> 00:29:05,190
How much money are they gonna give us?

435
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,170
It must be 900,000.

436
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,300
Told us to eat 100,000.

437
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,680
No,10...\NI'm really speechless.

438
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,730
Aren't they thieves?

439
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,680
You think the north-south issue is that simple?

440
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,350
They always use brinkmanship.

441
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,980
The negotiations have broken down.\NWhat should we do now?

442
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:25,570
Negotiations are meant to be made up before fight.

443
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:33,120
We're gonna have to reconnect.

444
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,030
Does that give us an answer?

445
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:53,060
Meeting is a precious thing.

446
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,500
How earnestly are we waiting to meet?

447
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,060
The depression of not having an answer is really overwhelming.

448
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:06,430
I would like to speak to my compatriots in the North who do not sleep at night.

449
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,220
Kiha & The Faces.

450
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:13,870
Let's meet now.

451
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:20,690
Uh, warden, there, there..

452
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:24,760
I've seen it too, punks.

453
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:32,030
There must be a new number of people.

454
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,690
People?

455
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,680
What's wrong with them?

456
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,290
It looks like Korean consonants.

457
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,230
Korean initial consonants?

458
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,300
Yes.

459
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:48,540
Korean initial consonants? That's "k" in Korean. "K" in Korean.

460
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,770
Oh, right, right, right.

461
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,370
That, that k, d.

462
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,150
Yes!

463
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:55,010
- Hey, man, Manchul, you write it down.\N- Yes.

464
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:58,460
"K" and "S".

465
00:30:58,510 --> 00:30:59,580
I, I.

466
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,250
- Is it Chi?\N- Right, right, right

467
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,290
Why do you keep rubbing your butt?

468
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,340
If it's "k" and "d", then "military"?

469
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:11,010
Chief, you're right.

470
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:14,400
Army, yes, you and I are the same army, army!

471
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,390
What about "K" and "S"?

472
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,210
Military?

473
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:21,600
Military.

474
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,090
Army, military.\NWe're getting in, all right?

475
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:26,110
After then?

476
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,450
Together?

477
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,090
Yeah?

478
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,840
Courtship?

479
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,170
A, Prison?

480
00:31:35,690 --> 00:31:37,620
Like a dog bird?

481
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:41,300
A joint chest gay?

482
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,260
High-dap chest muscles?

483
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,950
You really have a poor imagination...

484
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:49,100
Co-parasitic fruit..

485
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,310
Hey, is that imagination?\NLonely death zone.

486
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,460
- Together?\N- Wait a minute

487
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,970
Why? What's wrong?

488
00:31:57,970 --> 00:32:02,480
Who's in our GP that can go in and out of the Demilitarized Zone at will?

489
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,360
What, the water supply officer with the key to the gate?

490
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,930
Then they have a supply tube, right?

491
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,410
That's it.

492
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:13,510
Don't they have to bring water from somewhere in the winter?

493
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,230
- That's right.\N- That's right.

494
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,250
Here's the place they were talking about.

495
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:27,660
Common.

496
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,630
Water supply.

497
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,290
District.

498
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:32,770
JSA Common Water supply area.

499
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:42,120
Hey, give me the medicine that the supply officer drew.

500
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:44,450
Ah? You want me to look through it?

501
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,090
Look with your heart and you'll find it.

502
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,120
Heart?

503
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,350
I'm really going crazy.

504
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,810
Hey, where are you going?

505
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:18,110
A single stroke between controls.

506
00:33:42,570 --> 00:33:45,760
You're not a chicken head, are you?

507
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,810
Drop the gun.

508
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,960
Drop the gun.

509
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,140
So before we get to the talks,

510
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:09,060
According to the principles of the UN Command,

511
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,810
Weapons will be collected separately.

512
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,220
Good.

513
00:34:23,750 --> 00:34:26,620
It's like our military academy.

514
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:30,580
The lost and Found Act is bullshit.

515
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:34,730
I'm here to sternly correct a thief who went mad after eating it.

516
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:36,970
It's not 645, it's the lottery.

517
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,090
You have to be clear about that..

518
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,760
Don't use USA language.

519
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,310
This is not Korean land.

520
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,890
Let me ask you a question.

521
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,630
Do you know what the taxes are on the lottery?

522
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,180
Tax?

523
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,790
I knew this would happen.\NFor a skilled TA.

524
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:53,930
In the future.

525
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:02,550
The total winnings amount to N5.765772,844 won.

526
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,540
Up to 300 million won, 20 percent of other income tax and 2 percent of N resident tax will total 22 percent.

527
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:10,420
Over 300 million won, other income tax is 30 percent\Nand resident tax is 3 percent, or 33 percent.

528
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,110
The actual amount received, excluding income tax and residential tax, is

529
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:18,400
3,914,959,762 won.

530
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:21,190
You don't even know that.

531
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,980
What about 80% and what about 90%?

532
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,800
Show us, comrade Choljin.

533
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:33,200
What is it? Lunch boxed meal?

534
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,930
It's just a strong point that's easy to recognize.

535
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,880
Strong point?

536
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,900
Yanks call them PowerPoint?

537
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,200
Our People's Army is beyond words.

538
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,370
I just need one shot of drawing.

539
00:35:47,370 --> 00:35:50,040
Why bother to talk like that and look good?

540
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:51,800
We didn't budge an inch in our opinion,

541
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,860
so you know what?

542
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,870
What if we don't take it?

543
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,040
Then I have nothing to say.

544
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:04,910
Get up, everybody.

545
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:07,610
Here we go again!

546
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,090
Brinkmanship again.

547
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,820
In that case, do you think we'd be scared?

548
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,460
And why do you own the lottery?

549
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:16,450
You won't get the prize with it anyway.

550
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:18,980
Do you know where to find the prize money?

551
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,940
Is it not looking at the co-op?

552
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,340
Agricultural cooperatives.

553
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:29,460
Uncle, we're not a co-op.

554
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:32,810
The Agricultural Cooperative is at the bank. The bank.

555
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,080
Eight to two? That's a lot of concessions.

556
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:40,500
Did you learn to eat for free from American wolves?

557
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,580
Do you run the lottery?

558
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,510
This is property issued by the Republic of Korea.

559
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,430
You are illegally occupying our property, do you understand that?

560
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,690
What do you suggest?\NIllegal possession?

561
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,230
You're lucky you didn't go to the Azzo coal mine.

562
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,670
Azzo coal mine?

563
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,510
You punk!\NAre you done talking?

564
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,370
Yeah, I'm done. Why?\NWhat are you gonna do?

565
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,930
Scoundrels.

566
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,970
I was going to make it good, but it didn't work!

567
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,610
What if I don't do well?\NAre you trying to do it or what?

568
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,920
You punks!

569
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:17,220
We don't need any money!

570
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,590
I'm gonna burn that guy's 645.\NI'm gonna burn him up!

571
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,010
- I'm gonna burn it\N- Burn it!

572
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:35,940
Those guys could really burn up.

573
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:38,500
I feel depressed too.

574
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,650
I've never seen such an ignorant person.

575
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,930
Let's just, let's just do what they say.

576
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,810
Hey, how can you say that?

577
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,690
That's ours. Why is it 10% of ours?

578
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,160
All I have to do is get the lottery back.

579
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:53,400
Think about it.

580
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,110
We have the ticket. What are they gonna do?

581
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,530
Yeah, that's the right answer.

582
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,720
Mr. Political instructor, are you really gonna burn 645?

583
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,460
So we don't need the money either?

584
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,790
So what do we do?

585
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,860
Are you asking me to bow down to those useless guys?

586
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:21,700
I should have taken 10%.

587
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,320
Isn't that a lot of money for us?

588
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:31,160
8 : 2!\NWe won't budge any more!

589
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,910
Fxxk 8:2.\N7:3.

590
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,260
Who take the 7.

591
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,290
Of course you.

592
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,760
Did you say we're 7?

593
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,920
Considering North Korea's difficult economic situation.

594
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,770
We made a decision for the greater good.

595
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:52,830
Is it true?\NIs that a fake account?

596
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,580
So.

597
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,330
Can we at least write up an agreement?

598
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,900
Of course we do.

599
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,050
The 645 agreement.

600
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:00,170
Clause 1.

601
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:04,950
The winning sum is Democratic People's Republic of Korea take 7\NIn proportion to the Republic of Korea take 3.

602
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,470
Clause 2, even in the event of a natural disaster.

603
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,620
Clause 3, if there is a dispute between the two Koreas.

604
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,670
The International Court of Justice of the United Nations\Nis a court of exclusive jurisdiction.

605
00:39:15,670 --> 00:39:18,700
Clause 4, two copies of the agreement.

606
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:22,290
The north and the south keep one copy after signing and sealing.

607
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:37,490
Remember, it's either 7-3 or war.

608
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,770
Just trust me for once for the sake of national prosperity.

609
00:39:46,410 --> 00:39:47,460
Wait.

610
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,430
Just saying.

611
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:53,740
What happens if you do not pay

612
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,510
after we give 645?

613
00:39:58,850 --> 00:40:00,330
Those sons of bitches.

614
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:02,740
Is that why we're making a 7-3 offer?

615
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,840
That's what he was thinking.

616
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:07,670
Put down.

617
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:11,400
You got to let it go, stupid.

618
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,830
I told you to let it go.

619
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,540
I told you.

620
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,640
If you don't let go on the count of three.

621
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,160
I'm gonna rip your teeth out.

622
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,030
OK.

623
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,830
Do it.

624
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,520
1!

625
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:28,640
2!

626
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,090
- 3!\N- 3!

627
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,910
- Hurry up and find the lottery! Come on!\N- Take 645 away! 645!

628
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:55,080
You sons of bitches!\NI'm gonna shoot you!

629
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,430
- Shoot me! Bastard! Shoot!!!!\N-Manchul, where are you?

630
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,990
Turn off the lights! Turn off the lights!

631
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,520
It's because I know where it is when it'sound.

632
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:02,890
- Move...\N- You out of your mind?

633
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,410
- Chief, where are you?\N- Don't look for me, man!

634
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:09,860
- Wait, wait, wait...\N- Come here.

635
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,510
Eyes, eyes, eyes...

636
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,550
- Stupid.\N- Stupid.

637
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:18,460
- Bring it on .\N- What are you doing here?

638
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:22,770
Just turn on the light, but it's dark. Did you see anything?

639
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,650
These unnatural and helpless feelings.

640
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:27,820
Good.

641
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,420
Here, take a picture.

642
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,260
Good.

643
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,170
A little bit over here.

644
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,340
Good.

645
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:38,390
Isn't that the South Korean supply officer?

646
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:41,440
Ah, ah!\NWhat are you doing here?

647
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,940
Didn't we have a blockage in the water line before?

648
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,260
I helped a lot back then.

649
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,960
What's this?

650
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:54,690
I've heard about what's going on.

651
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:57,110
Sergeant Park, how much did you pay for it?

652
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,660
I didn't.

653
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,130
Didn't?

654
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,230
Just picked it.

655
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:03,920
- Hey, this...\N- Hey, be quiet!

656
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,620
What? Pick up?

657
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:08,110
Even your kids pick it up and you are claiming it?

658
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,650
You son of a bitch!

659
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:11,750
Well, I think...

660
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:14,920
Because it's something that no one can claim.

661
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,000
It's the Peace lottery.

662
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,720
How about a 50-50 split?

663
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,750
Five to five, we're good.

664
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,750
A clean 50-50 split, huh?

665
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:28,050
Good!

666
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:30,110
All right, I got it.

667
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,520
But it's not over yet.

668
00:42:31,830 --> 00:42:34,180
The north gives the South a lottery.

669
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:36,660
I think the South will get the first prize back.

670
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:39,960
But we have to transfer the money north again.

671
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,560
But how are we supposed to trust each other?

672
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,810
How about this?

673
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:47,900
It's like a prisoner swap in a spy movie.

674
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:49,860
The duration is 1 week.

675
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:53,440
The North pays the lottery and the south gets its money back

676
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,710
Before handing over the change to the North again.

677
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:59,380
One soldier from the north and one from the south.

678
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:00,880
That should do.

679
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,640
Who's gonna go?

680
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:17,000
All right, whoever goes!

681
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,130
In case of emergency.

682
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,230
How do you get in touch?

683
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,410
My waist...

684
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,290
You're alive.

685
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,340
This is an ancient emergency network issued in this common water area since the Korean War.

686
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:38,840
The cell phone of TA-312 A.K.A. Daughter.

687
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:41,670
But both North and South Korea.

688
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,240
There should be a phone somewhere in GP.

689
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:48,610
Manchul, where are you from?

690
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:50,770
Cheongdam-dong, Gangnam-gu, Seoul.

691
00:43:50,950 --> 00:43:52,400
I am also of the old school in Seoul.

692
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,720
Sergeant Park, you're from Gangwon-do?

693
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,120
Gangwon-do is not the same Gangwon-do.

694
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:00,090
It's completely different from North Korea.

695
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:02,090
Why don't I take the post?

696
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:04,050
Manchul is not part of our unit.

697
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,630
He was assigned to the TOD observation corps.

698
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:06,780
Yeah right.

699
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,950
Just 1 week.

700
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:13,750
But that's not supposed to work, is it?\NHow do I get to North Korea?

701
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:15,640
Let's play rock paper scissors.

702
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,790
Manly, just one round!

703
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,240
No, Sergeant Park.\NWhat kind of rock-paper-scissors...

704
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,410
Hurry up and play rock paper scissors.\NRock paper scissors. Rock paper scissors.

705
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:21,840
- Just one round.\N- Just one round

706
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,050
Yeah just one round.

707
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:25,060
- Hurry up!\N- Yes.

708
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,920
Rock paper scissors.

709
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,690
Wait a minute. Just once.\NWhat? The third round!

710
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:33,770
Sergeant Park, what's wrong with you?

711
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:35,140
- Manchul, I'm sorry.\N- It's the last time.

712
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:36,550
- Where is that? Really?\N- Just one round, just one round.

713
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:39,760
If I lose this time, I'll really go.\NJust one more round, huh?

714
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,830
It's really the last round!

715
00:44:41,830 --> 00:44:44,660
Yes, just one round!\NI'm really going to go.

716
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,310
Hey, I'm sorry. N-Last, last.

717
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:48,660
You do it. Rock, paper, scissors.

718
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:53,170
Yes.\NRock-paper-scissors paper!

719
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,670
Sergeant Park, this is fate.

720
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,270
Punks.

721
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:19,000
Hey, I didn't do it right!

722
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:23,390
I'm watching what you guys usually do.

723
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:27,020
Let the sweat run like a river.

724
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,610
If you roll your eyes like that, does your body flutter?

725
00:45:30,770 --> 00:45:34,190
- Be loyal! Be loyal!\N- Impossible.

726
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:37,410
There was no place to hide from the sight of our fellow security instructors.

727
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:38,470
Hey, you!

728
00:45:38,470 --> 00:45:40,240
Rack your brains.

729
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:44,760
It's about to be executed. We should do something about it.

730
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,510
Even though we sleep under the same quilt in the same housekeeping class.

731
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:50,340
I wonder who is guarding the comrade instructor's lackey.

732
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,740
Where we can deceive fellow security instructors in our posts.

733
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:56,390
Not a single place.

734
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:02,310
There is a place.

735
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:07,110
The only place we can escape the murderous gaze of our instructor.

736
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,060
Do you know what the most recognized ant is?

737
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:13,610
Labor ants.

738
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:19,020
A calf has only one life, and producing milk is also a battle.

739
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:23,420
Milk 100 kilos a day.

740
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:27,830
Be the best working cow in the Republic, you know?

741
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:31,770
Comrade Yeon-hee,\NWhen did you come?

742
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:35,100
Comrade Youngchul! Why are there wild boars?

743
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,890
Lost Amy near the army not long ago.

744
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:39,710
I saw him crying, so I picked him up.

745
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:41,480
Does he have to be fed to eat, too?

746
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,100
In the demilitarized zone.

747
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,090
Don't wild boar and red deer make good egg fillings?

748
00:46:46,110 --> 00:46:48,490
Actually, I'm a little upset.

749
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,480
Could something this beautiful eat me?

750
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:56,110
Just a month, and you can grow a little more

751
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:01,200
Brother! Brother!

752
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,470
What?

753
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:03,880
Here.

754
00:47:05,610 --> 00:47:07,310
What are you doing with your head?

755
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:14,520
Hey, recruit.\NPut it up there.

756
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,830
What? I didn't hear you!

757
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:17,260
I said lift it up!

758
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,130
Don't use your hands! Lift up the rope!\NPulled tight!

759
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:23,380
I was scared at first.

760
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,070
It was a terrible time. It was a terrible time.

761
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:29,030
Because of the softness...

762
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,700
- Recruit!\N- Private Kim Hyunsoo.

763
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,030
Bring me a glass of water.

764
00:47:34,710 --> 00:47:36,950
You made a joke.

765
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:39,040
But it's not fun, huh?

766
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:42,810
What's the word used in South Korea at times like this?

767
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,810
That's what I did earlier.

768
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:49,920
- Gap, Gapbungyo? Gapbungyo.\N- Gapbungyo.

769
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,620
It's a sudden chill!

770
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,640
Gapbungyo is all of a sudden, the atmosphere is like the principal!

771
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,060
I'm gonna die comrade!

772
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:02,690
Again!

773
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:06,070
Comrade Li Yongho, let's do it again.

774
00:48:06,750 --> 00:48:08,310
What's the point of Moonsong?

775
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:11,690
I'm sorry I was born liberal arts.

776
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:12,850
Good.

777
00:48:13,570 --> 00:48:16,810
Next, Honbabian.

778
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,140
Honbabian...

779
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:23,330
Who eats alone?

780
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,770
Good job. What's a Honkono?

781
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,190
Who goes to coin karaoke alone?

782
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,210
Good.

783
00:48:31,290 --> 00:48:32,560
Now.

784
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:36,490
What's bondalbonjum?

785
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,450
Stir-fry the chrysalis...

786
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:43,760
Bondalbonjum!

787
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:46,160
If you ask for a number, I'll give you a number!

788
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,910
I'm gonna die!

789
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,540
That's it, this life is end, this life is end.

790
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,650
Really, really, that's really, really.

791
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:00,760
Masang.

792
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:04,480
- Heartbreak\N- My beloved people all over the country.

793
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,540
Brave men and women of the People's Army, brothers and sisters.

794
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,700
Dear, dear nation,\NDear nation.

795
00:49:11,700 --> 00:49:15,670
If the people's army of the Republic must recite a New Year message.

796
00:49:15,670 --> 00:49:17,130
Memorize it vigorously.

797
00:49:17,470 --> 00:49:18,780
The beloved people of the whole country.

798
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,250
Brave men and women of the People's Army,\Nbrothers and sisters.

799
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,020
Sergeant Park, put your hat on.

800
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,100
It's a good match.

801
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:40,700
Go as a private first class. What?

802
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,300
Can you believe it?

803
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:50,240
We're all in this together now.

804
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:55,130
How can you not drink on a happy day like today?

805
00:49:55,180 --> 00:49:56,450
Comrade Choljin!

806
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:03,120
Prepared the republic's most delicious rhododendron wine!

807
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:06,090
I knew this would happen, which is why we've got drinks and food.

808
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:09,420
I only prepared the most popular items of PX in the Republic of Korea.

809
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,130
Okay, just a little bit more of the heavy flavor.

810
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,890
Tie it up.

811
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:23,960
DUDUDU.

812
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:26,330
Now it's important. You watch it.

813
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:28,110
Turn this end

814
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,810
around!

815
00:50:35,190 --> 00:50:37,840
This is what makes tired soldiers want to eat.

816
00:50:40,080 --> 00:50:41,170
Taste it again.

817
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,970
Give it to me.

818
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:00,040
Let's have a candid conversation.

819
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:04,310
It's all here. You know who's got the biggest ball?

820
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:09,210
This is the bomb shelter.\Npublic water supply area.

821
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:11,270
Stay.

822
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:15,690
There is Panmunjom in North Korea and Peace House in the south.

823
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:17,590
Then here.

824
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,440
This is the back door to peace.

825
00:51:20,540 --> 00:51:22,010
The back door to peace?

826
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,470
Is this make sense?

827
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,700
This is the back door to future peace.

828
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:32,160
Let's have a toast.

829
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:36,520
- Come on, cheers\N- Cheers!

830
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,960
Good!

831
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:52,440
- My, my !\N- My turn! My! My!

832
00:51:58,670 --> 00:52:01,880
Hey, you just crossed the bridge.

833
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,490
What did you say? The guy up there dumped you.

834
00:52:04,510 --> 00:52:05,990
Why are you so surprised?

835
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:09,210
Is that how the South Korean president walked through Panmunjom?

836
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,100
Okay, so our aggregate score is 1-0.

837
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,400
- Now switch places.\N-Nice.

838
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,650
Ah wait.

839
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,320
Do you really want to change this?\NThis is North Korea.

840
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:32,230
Have you been crying all night?\NSkip!

841
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,810
Okay, let's skip it.

842
00:52:34,740 --> 00:52:35,780
Go, go.

843
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,460
Ok ! Ok ! Focus!

844
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:42,260
It's okay.\NYou're in the brig.

845
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:49,690
But how old are you?

846
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:52,200
In North Korean terms, I'm 29.

847
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,850
I'm 32 years old.

848
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,360
It's the big brother. You can speak freely.

849
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:03,420
Ok? Let's get a cup from my brother.

850
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,500
Yes, brother.

851
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:10,330
But it seems your birth declaration was a lot late?

852
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,620
I did it in time.

853
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:27,180
What does Sergeant Park Chun-woo want to do when you become rich?

854
00:53:27,290 --> 00:53:29,640
I'm gonna start a farm. A cow farm.

855
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:31,430
I graduated from the Department of Animal production.

856
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:32,620
A dairy farm?

857
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:36,360
Cows are pregnant for life to be milked.

858
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:38,090
How inhumane.

859
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,710
So I've decided.

860
00:53:39,770 --> 00:53:43,090
Cows need postnatal conditioning, too. I'm gonna start that farm.

861
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,360
What will Corporal Lee Yong-ho do when you become rich?

862
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,830
I have a lot of work to do.

863
00:53:54,850 --> 00:53:56,890
I want to buy a watch for dad.

864
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:02,220
And my beautiful sister who sings well...

865
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,800
Sister? Do you have a beautiful sister?

866
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:09,470
Brother!\NWhat are you saying?

867
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,530
South Korean television, the Internet.

868
00:54:15,570 --> 00:54:19,380
What scheming has been done to our republic there?

869
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,440
You're supposed to be watching all day.

870
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:25,280
It's like me. I use my monitor all day.

871
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:29,630
Of all the networks and TV shows, do you know girl groups?

872
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:33,030
No, you didn't know that, did you?

873
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:56,550
Stop it, comrade Choljin!

874
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:11,940
What are you doing?

875
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,320
Hey, Seungil! Choi Seungil!

876
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,900
You stupid.

877
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:22,050
You've heard the American Yankee water?

878
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:26,420
Did you go to a thought struggle?

879
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,520
Comrade Political Instructor.

880
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:30,580
Hey, Seungil.

881
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:35,070
Please play it again Yongho.

882
00:55:35,390 --> 00:55:37,000
- What?\N- Play it!

883
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,540
I love you.

884
00:55:58,540 --> 00:56:04,070
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'\NRollin' Rollin' Rollin'

885
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,290
What are you all doing?Get out of here!

886
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,810
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'\NRollin' Rollin' Rollin'

887
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:11,330
Let's do it together! Let's do it together!

888
00:56:17,390 --> 00:56:24,170
Let's overcome the hardships and build a better garden!

889
00:56:24,170 --> 00:56:27,490
With a great general, we'll win!

890
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,550
Because of the nature of GP work,

891
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:45,240
Once deployed, no one can go outside for three months.

892
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,280
Do you understand?

893
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:47,560
Yes.

894
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:49,490
You have to get sick to get out.

895
00:56:49,490 --> 00:56:50,500
I thought a lot about it.

896
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:52,600
Drink stale milk a year out of date.

897
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,010
Food poisoning?

898
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,890
But the way to get out of cleanly.

899
00:56:57,310 --> 00:57:00,260
Whether it's your right arm or your left arm, only one of your arms is broken.

900
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:02,580
You can get out.

901
00:57:05,410 --> 00:57:07,180
Pick one that you want.

902
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:12,340
What would hurt the least?

903
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:15,170
It's going to hurt.

904
00:57:15,810 --> 00:57:18,870
I've already told you about it.

905
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,790
As soon as you get out, you'll be taken to the N.K. Capital Hospital.

906
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:25,670
You're just gonna get a month's cast, all right?

907
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:26,750
Loyalty!

908
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:32,400
- This?\N- No, no.

909
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:34,280
Then, with this?

910
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:35,790
No, why...

911
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,910
Okay, take it easy.

912
00:57:39,180 --> 00:57:40,870
- This, this...\N- A hammer?

913
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:42,700
Yeah, it's one shot.

914
00:57:43,950 --> 00:57:45,350
Stone. That sounds clean.

915
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,400
Oh.

916
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:49,430
With small stone?

917
00:57:49,430 --> 00:57:51,250
No, this, this, this.

918
00:57:54,670 --> 00:57:56,730
Tell my mom I love her.

919
00:57:57,670 --> 00:57:58,780
OK.

920
00:58:00,410 --> 00:58:01,470
Sorry.

921
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,910
1, 2!

922
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,090
Where are you going to keep the lottery?

923
00:58:14,310 --> 00:58:16,040
I'll keep it in my wallet.

924
00:58:17,580 --> 00:58:18,940
You don't know anything about people.

925
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:21,050
What if a thief stops us?

926
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:22,680
So I'm ready.

927
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,850
I was gonna talk back to you.

928
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:27,150
I always thought a zipper would be better.

929
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:53,670
He was a revolutionary soldier in white with a single shot.

930
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:55,080
An unbeatable army!

931
00:58:56,420 --> 00:58:59,390
Strength of steel! The vigorous Brawler!

932
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,680
A lightning charge into the enemy's fortress.

933
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:06,230
One man can ruthlessly defeat hundreds of enemies.

934
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:11,010
The attacking spirit of a hundred is special defeat.

935
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:13,310
This time the training.

936
00:59:13,320 --> 00:59:16,990
Put the granite on the lower abdomen, with the big view far value of a hit immediately hit the training.

937
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,110
I hear there's a new assignment this time, right?

938
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:23,250
Who?

939
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,700
The recruit!

940
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:31,120
Out.

941
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,900
In an indomitable revolutionary spirit.

942
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:40,850
Give Dantian a little strength.

943
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,460
Hit rocks with little belly!

944
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,890
The beloved people of the whole country.

945
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:53,330
Brave officers and men of the People's Army, brothers and compatriots.

946
00:59:53,330 --> 00:59:57,200
Today we all work hard and meaningfully.

947
00:59:57,220 --> 01:00:00,860
What they've done this past year to be proud of.

948
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:04,690
Isn't this a New Year message from our comrade Chairman?

949
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,520
Have you learned all this by heart?

950
01:00:07,210 --> 01:00:10,590
What are you guys still doing? Why don't clap, clap!

951
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:18,100
Okay, you need to wake up.

952
01:00:19,230 --> 01:00:23,670
- Welcome to a hopeful New Year!\N- Got it. Wake me up.

953
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,310
What happens when you get hurt?

954
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:33,020
If you get hurt, just put on a big sauce, otherwise you'll get smashed.

955
01:00:39,650 --> 01:00:42,600
Stop it!\NStop it now!

956
01:00:46,990 --> 01:00:48,250
What are you doing?

957
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:51,450
Comrade political instructor, we are conducting basic military education and training.

958
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,450
The recruit was assigned to the farm!

959
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,000
We don't need a drill!

960
01:00:57,850 --> 01:00:58,920
Is that so?

961
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,920
What's this?

962
01:01:09,610 --> 01:01:10,680
Hey, recruit.

963
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:13,430
Private Kim Hyunsoo.

964
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,310
Hey, hey, get out, get out.

965
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,600
I told you I had to do it by today, right?

966
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,320
- Sorry.\N- Sorry?

967
01:01:21,290 --> 01:01:22,030
Really...

968
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,950
- Stupid.\N- It's just...

969
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,400
New boy, let's go smoke.

970
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,590
Out!

971
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:46,110
You bring Masang?

972
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,170
Are you hurt.

973
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:53,860
No.

974
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:55,920
Really?

975
01:01:57,170 --> 01:02:00,350
Really, for real.

976
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,090
It's okay. Yeah.

977
01:02:05,090 --> 01:02:09,710
Don't think of this life as a failure.\NIt's all small but certain happiness.

978
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,270
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

979
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:16,900
You're not part of our unit.

980
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:22,680
Give me.

981
01:02:24,580 --> 01:02:25,970
Give me.

982
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,310
How can you spit on it?

983
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:05,460
It's so hard.

984
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,320
Stop it. Just.

985
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:29,080
That's amazing.

986
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,250
You didn't use shoe polish, but it's glossy.

987
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:34,200
What's your secret?

988
01:03:34,360 --> 01:03:36,130
What's the secret..

989
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:41,210
In life, there's a guy who doesn't want to waste his shoe polish.

990
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:44,990
Now, spit it out.

991
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,740
What's wrong with your tone?

992
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:56,680
Did you sprain your leg?

993
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,990
You must have sprained your leg, it hurts.

994
01:03:59,990 --> 01:04:04,420
I don't know anything. I miss my mom every night.

995
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,970
So you're an animal doctor.

996
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:10,060
I heard what Comrade Lee Yongho said about 645.

997
01:04:10,460 --> 01:04:12,490
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me, okay.

998
01:04:12,490 --> 01:04:14,490
What about Korea?

999
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,800
Don't look down on me.

1000
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,210
Go away! A duck that can't even lay an egg.

1001
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:23,390
Can't ducks lay eggs?

1002
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:26,900
I don't know what the problem is. It's not breeding well.

1003
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:31,160
The farm thrives when eggs are hatched and young are born.

1004
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:34,830
Looks like I came to the right guy.

1005
01:04:34,830 --> 01:04:36,750
I majored in animal production and mating.

1006
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,120
Atmosphere is important when it comes to breeding success.

1007
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,190
Atmosphere?

1008
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:42,960
You have to respect her personal life.

1009
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:46,790
The partitions and lighting should also be emotional.

1010
01:04:46,790 --> 01:04:49,860
It would be better if there was music\Nlove songs and stuff like that.

1011
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,540
There's one of my favorite songs.

1012
01:04:53,080 --> 01:04:54,510
It's that song.

1013
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:06,060
- Live with the moon and stars.\N- Live with the moon and stars.

1014
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:13,420
- Paradise of feeling.\N- Paradise of feeling.

1015
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:20,360
- You live with me\N- You live with me

1016
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:27,750
- This earnest heart\N- This earnest heart

1017
01:05:36,730 --> 01:05:38,990
Comrade Yeon-hee.\Nwelcome.

1018
01:05:38,990 --> 01:05:42,000
Comrade Youngchul, how have you been?

1019
01:05:44,030 --> 01:05:46,050
It's long, but who is this ggonsam?

1020
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:50,050
I'm Choi Jung-nam, a newly assigned farm management soldier.

1021
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:52,130
You two say hello.

1022
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,940
Good night..

1023
01:06:48,540 --> 01:06:50,900
Stop moving! Stop moving!

1024
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,920
It's a mine.\NEverybody back off.

1025
01:06:54,920 --> 01:06:58,360
You, you! Don't move!\NDon't move, you punk!

1026
01:06:58,470 --> 01:07:01,060
Contact the home squadron! Contact the demining team!

1027
01:07:01,060 --> 01:07:01,900
- Yes, sir!\N- Yes, sir!

1028
01:07:01,900 --> 01:07:02,990
Then it'll be late.

1029
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:04,560
Everyone, step aside.

1030
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,500
- This is what we planted.\N- No...

1031
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:12,610
It's a wooden-box mine planted by North Korea.

1032
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,210
- The radius of the kill is 3m.\N- Get back off!

1033
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:17,820
About 5m?

1034
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,730
It explodes when you step on it or open the lid.

1035
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:24,810
Remove the safety pin before opening the lid.

1036
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,210
It was like I'm in a detached situation.

1037
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:30,090
Yeah?

1038
01:07:30,830 --> 01:07:34,620
After eating 100 sweet potatoes, I was really depressed.

1039
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:55,540
Everybody on the ground!

1040
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,550
- Get down!\N- Get down!

1041
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:59,360
Get down!

1042
01:08:09,510 --> 01:08:10,850
Get down?

1043
01:08:16,160 --> 01:08:18,470
- Applause!\N- Applause!

1044
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:53,830
It's a miracle, Comrade!

1045
01:08:53,830 --> 01:08:56,450
One night, you're gonna have to pack 100 eggs.

1046
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,750
The duckling lays one egg every 10 minutes.

1047
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:02,550
Rabbit, pig, you're going crazy.

1048
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:06,420
The food problem in our republic has finally been solved!

1049
01:09:10,010 --> 01:09:11,550
Wow, you just showed up?

1050
01:09:11,980 --> 01:09:15,270
It will come at a time of hardship when millions of people starve to death.

1051
01:09:15,270 --> 01:09:17,440
What took you so long to show up?

1052
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:24,720
Comrade Choi Jeong-nam.

1053
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:28,820
You're a nation's talent that comes out once in a thousand years!

1054
01:09:28,820 --> 01:09:29,760
No.

1055
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:33,680
I recommend Comrade to the cadre training school at once!

1056
01:09:34,030 --> 01:09:35,650
Battalion commander, Battalion commander comrade!

1057
01:09:35,650 --> 01:09:39,650
Comrade Choi Jung Nam is a rookie who just got assigned to the squad.

1058
01:09:39,650 --> 01:09:41,860
- There's still a lot to learn..\N- Shut up!

1059
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:47,030
It's already decided. Send him to a senior training school right now.

1060
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:52,000
What do you mean by going to a school?

1061
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,500
There is a military academy in South Korea, but there is no military academy in North Korea.

1062
01:09:58,190 --> 01:09:59,420
If anyone gets a letter of recommendation,

1063
01:09:59,420 --> 01:10:02,220
You're chosen to go to a training school for cadres.

1064
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:02,890
When?

1065
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:04,770
You're leaving the day after you got the letter of recommendation.

1066
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:05,850
Where?

1067
01:10:05,970 --> 01:10:08,740
Where else to go? Pyongyang.

1068
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:11,950
Congratulations. I've never been there before in my life.

1069
01:10:13,120 --> 01:10:14,460
Wake up!

1070
01:10:18,540 --> 01:10:21,340
That's the only car you can drive.

1071
01:10:27,580 --> 01:10:28,800
How's it going?

1072
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:34,240
I don't know what it is, but I got it all back.

1073
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:37,320
I got rid of it.

1074
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,620
The repairs will take at least three or four days.

1075
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:42,190
- The...\N- Go for broke..

1076
01:10:42,190 --> 01:10:43,560
Well done.

1077
01:10:44,410 --> 01:10:47,120
Let's go. There won't be a miracle, will there?

1078
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:08,710
Listen to what I'm saying.

1079
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:12,670
That being the case, you crossed the line.

1080
01:11:14,430 --> 01:11:16,230
I want to go home.

1081
01:11:16,350 --> 01:11:18,360
Do you know what Pyongyang is?

1082
01:11:18,720 --> 01:11:20,820
Places you can't go if you want to.

1083
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,820
Comrade Chunwoo, take this opportunity to change your fate.

1084
01:11:27,180 --> 01:11:29,210
I want to go home.

1085
01:11:30,850 --> 01:11:31,690
Why?

1086
01:11:31,690 --> 01:11:34,370
Make the carts and the ducks fly?

1087
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,360
I'm screwed.

1088
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,970
Loyalty!\N437 Cheif, Kang Eunpyo!

1089
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:51,730
Where you can't even get an ant near you...

1090
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:52,930
Where?

1091
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:54,250
Who do you mean?

1092
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:56,840
Heroic soldiers who give themselves to remove mines!

1093
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:57,900
Where!

1094
01:12:00,370 --> 01:12:01,710
That, Sergeant Ha...

1095
01:12:02,490 --> 01:12:06,300
Did the G.P. Experience soldier go on duty?

1096
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:07,460
In the dining room.

1097
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,600
To the dining!

1098
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:13,150
Stand at attention!\NAbout Captain..

1099
01:12:13,220 --> 01:12:15,490
Sit down and eat.

1100
01:12:19,660 --> 01:12:20,880
Is it him?

1101
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,110
Excellent. That's the soldier.

1102
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:25,660
I have a good hunch.

1103
01:12:29,560 --> 01:12:30,560
Is it you?

1104
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:34,640
The soldier you removed the mines and saved the lives of your comrades?

1105
01:12:37,070 --> 01:12:38,950
Yeah?

1106
01:12:39,500 --> 01:12:41,290
Department, department, official...

1107
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:45,160
- Attention.\N- Right.

1108
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:47,740
You really enjoyed your meal.

1109
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,630
Well, is there anything about military life that's inconvenient?

1110
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,380
- Yeah.\N- Yeah?

1111
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:02,160
Ok, where is your hometown?

1112
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:04,410
Up there, Ham...

1113
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,980
Ham? Ham?

1114
01:13:08,930 --> 01:13:10,810
Ham? Ham where?

1115
01:13:18,700 --> 01:13:20,350
It's Hamburg.

1116
01:13:20,790 --> 01:13:22,100
Hamburg?

1117
01:13:22,440 --> 01:13:25,390
Germany's Son Heung-min SV... Hamburg?

1118
01:13:27,150 --> 01:13:28,060
Yes.

1119
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:33,820
The model soldier I've been looking for is right here, huh?

1120
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:39,460
A true soldier who gave up his foreign nationality to fulfill his noble military duty!

1121
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:42,210
Yeah, well, what's your resolution?

1122
01:13:42,210 --> 01:13:45,870
He gave up his foreign nationality and tried to become a Korean soldier.

1123
01:13:46,040 --> 01:13:47,750
Tell me!

1124
01:13:49,910 --> 01:13:50,980
In German.

1125
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:53,840
German...

1126
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:16,350
Comrade Lee Yongho, one in a million.

1127
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,320
I wish I didn't have to use this.

1128
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:36,320
I've memorized everything now.

1129
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,720
You should've seen this more than 100 times.

1130
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:48,700
I am a Korean.

1131
01:14:50,850 --> 01:14:52,190
Did you understand?

1132
01:14:52,540 --> 01:14:53,390
Yes.

1133
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,110
Translate.

1134
01:15:01,100 --> 01:15:04,860
Give up German citizenship and choose Korean citizenship.

1135
01:15:12,270 --> 01:15:14,140
It's not anything special, right.

1136
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:22,690
Because you only get one chance to defend your country.

1137
01:15:35,510 --> 01:15:37,690
The most advanced guard task that no one can complete.

1138
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:47,680
I had the confidence that I could do anything.

1139
01:15:54,100 --> 01:15:57,140
If you ask me why, I'm just gonna say this.

1140
01:16:07,470 --> 01:16:12,950
I am a proud Korean.

1141
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,410
Brother...

1142
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,380
Stand up!

1143
01:16:37,870 --> 01:16:40,240
Applause! Applause!

1144
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:48,330
That's right! That's right!

1145
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:50,950
Hey, this is a moving eco-friendly car.

1146
01:16:50,974 --> 01:17:02,974
Upload by adm820@gmail.com

1147
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:26,640
Stop! Stop!

1148
01:17:35,650 --> 01:17:37,360
This is by order of the Legion's political department

1149
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:44,140
They postponed the transfer of Choi Jung-nam to an executive school.

1150
01:17:44,140 --> 01:17:46,550
Film the revolutionary recipe for increasing food production.

1151
01:17:46,550 --> 01:17:49,070
All outposts have priority spread!

1152
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,870
I submitted the plan to the Legion's political department.

1153
01:17:54,870 --> 01:17:56,650
I used a little trickery.

1154
01:17:57,690 --> 01:17:58,990
Thanks.

1155
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:04,980
It's all I can give you.

1156
01:18:08,840 --> 01:18:12,750
Make no mistake, this is all because of me.

1157
01:18:13,350 --> 01:18:17,980
Comrade Youngchul told me, you don't have to worry.

1158
01:18:20,050 --> 01:18:24,080
Hey, I'm curious. Can I ask you something?

1159
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:25,520
- Of course.\N- Wouldn't it be...

1160
01:18:27,100 --> 01:18:29,420
You know that fart guy?

1161
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:31,850
It's that guy.

1162
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:35,530
Every time I'm on the air, I'm gonna break your mouth.

1163
01:18:35,720 --> 01:18:38,150
When I see a guy that good-looking.

1164
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:39,440
Break his leg.

1165
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:41,750
You can jump rope with a rubber band on.

1166
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,020
Never get too close to this unbeatable bastard.

1167
01:18:46,340 --> 01:18:47,230
Yes.

1168
01:18:48,570 --> 01:18:49,490
Yes.

1169
01:18:55,580 --> 01:18:57,870
What many people want to know is this.

1170
01:18:57,870 --> 01:19:02,150
That's why mating is so combative.

1171
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:05,510
Please introduce the special secret of Comrade Choi Jeong-nam.

1172
01:19:07,930 --> 01:19:11,510
To increase milk production from cows.

1173
01:19:11,510 --> 01:19:13,810
The important thing is to rub it.

1174
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,940
Wipe! Is friction more important than anything else?

1175
01:19:20,080 --> 01:19:24,260
Just pinch the breast of the cow like this.

1176
01:19:24,320 --> 01:19:28,040
Use stroking to relieve accumulated chest muscles.

1177
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:33,740
Come on, everybody, look this way. Come on, squeeze like this.

1178
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:36,550
Hold it like this.

1179
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:41,070
Like this?

1180
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:43,050
- From the top...\N- Show me.

1181
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,370
Stop eating.\NYou're going to become a real pig.

1182
01:19:58,370 --> 01:19:59,670
Pig..

1183
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:25,960
You're good.\NGood, meticulous.

1184
01:20:28,350 --> 01:20:34,300
The chickens on our farm laid 645 eggs this morning.

1185
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:37,290
Very good news.

1186
01:20:37,290 --> 01:20:40,830
What's the secret to success in this battle?

1187
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:44,070
Love.

1188
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,170
It was love.

1189
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,180
Yes, it is love.

1190
01:20:58,130 --> 01:21:00,440
What, love?

1191
01:21:08,580 --> 01:21:10,610
I'm gonna go out.

1192
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:13,860
Yeonhee, I...

1193
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,380
Lee Yongho?

1194
01:21:20,270 --> 01:21:21,890
Seohyeon Station on the Bundang Line.

1195
01:21:22,170 --> 01:21:26,510
The moment you get out of the Armed Forces Capital Hospital,\Nyour life-long mission begins.

1196
01:21:26,970 --> 01:21:28,600
Take the subway.

1197
01:21:29,190 --> 01:21:30,770
The subway is the safest.

1198
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,790
And don't make eye contact with anyone.

1199
01:21:34,250 --> 01:21:37,970
Don't ever.

1200
01:22:18,350 --> 01:22:19,430
Get in.

1201
01:22:23,930 --> 01:22:25,770
Guard officer, you wanted to see me?

1202
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:30,240
Hey, Yeonhee, sit.

1203
01:22:32,220 --> 01:22:34,880
I called you because I wanted to talk to you.

1204
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:40,990
Is there anything inconvenient about the work of the Corps propaganda team?

1205
01:22:41,150 --> 01:22:42,170
Let me know

1206
01:22:44,290 --> 01:22:45,850
if you do.

1207
01:22:46,480 --> 01:22:49,130
No, I'm happy with it

1208
01:22:50,750 --> 01:22:52,110
What is this?

1209
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:55,300
This is an oil lotion I bought with dollars not long ago.

1210
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:02,090
It smells so good. I think of Comrade Yeonhee

1211
01:23:02,270 --> 01:23:07,680
Oh, and I bought a nice bottle of wine.

1212
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:10,470
It's ok.

1213
01:23:11,930 --> 01:23:17,750
And there is no reason to receive such a gift from a comrade security instructor.

1214
01:23:19,450 --> 01:23:22,330
Why do you keep doing this? Didn't you say you were gonna help me?

1215
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:23,560
Don't!

1216
01:23:28,150 --> 01:23:30,650
You girl don't understand me?

1217
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:41,170
You seem to watch a lot of movies, guard officer.

1218
01:23:41,630 --> 01:23:42,460
What?

1219
01:23:43,850 --> 01:23:47,430
That's what they do to make people fall in the movies.

1220
01:23:47,770 --> 01:23:49,430
Can women do this?

1221
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:53,130
But movies and reality are different.

1222
01:23:53,890 --> 01:23:56,170
At the outpost of the revolution.

1223
01:23:56,470 --> 01:23:58,880
You are so partisan.

1224
01:24:00,350 --> 01:24:01,220
Yeonhee!

1225
01:24:01,220 --> 01:24:05,340
Bearing the heavy responsibility of national reunification

1226
01:24:05,360 --> 01:24:07,700
An elite member of the legion Propaganda team!

1227
01:24:09,830 --> 01:24:10,650
It hurts.

1228
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:13,430
Are you gonna make me look like some asshole in heat?

1229
01:24:19,160 --> 01:24:21,320
What age is it now, God damn it.

1230
01:24:30,730 --> 01:24:32,040
What the hell are you doing here?

1231
01:24:32,170 --> 01:24:35,620
Yeah, I'm just passing through...

1232
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:38,090
Let's have a cup of coffee. Let's go.

1233
01:24:38,540 --> 01:24:39,380
Yes.

1234
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,140
There are brokers in front of the head office of the Agricultural Cooperative.

1235
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:46,540
The winner will be subject to a tax deduction of around 30%.

1236
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:49,040
These brokers do it to launder money

1237
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:53,130
After deducting about 20 percent of the funds, they propose cash transaction.

1238
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,670
But they're all liars.

1239
01:24:55,980 --> 01:24:58,330
If he gets caught, he might just take the lottery.

1240
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,440
You have to watch out for the brokers.

1241
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:05,250
If you go to the bank, go to the petition police immediately.

1242
01:25:07,620 --> 01:25:10,810
There's a special elevator that lotto winners can take.

1243
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:15,450
Go to the police and take the elevator.

1244
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,070
That's it. That's the end of it.

1245
01:25:22,850 --> 01:25:24,130
Come in.

1246
01:25:25,650 --> 01:25:27,250
Psycho soldier brother.

1247
01:25:30,170 --> 01:25:32,160
- What's up?\N- Come.

1248
01:25:33,580 --> 01:25:34,730
- Why are you doing this?\N- You have a daughter.

1249
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:36,220
Do you understand the heart of parents?

1250
01:25:36,790 --> 01:25:39,310
- Psycho soldier!\N- What's wrong?

1251
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:41,750
Ah!

1252
01:25:42,390 --> 01:25:44,440
Psycho soldier?

1253
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:47,240
What's this?

1254
01:25:48,650 --> 01:25:50,520
Manchul? Why are you running away?

1255
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,000
He hasn't found money yet?

1256
01:25:53,000 --> 01:25:55,220
What are you doing in Seoul?

1257
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:01,840
Money, did you find the money?

1258
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:04,180
Why aren't you picking up the phone?

1259
01:26:05,980 --> 01:26:07,300
You punk!

1260
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,520
Aren't you answering the phone?

1261
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:12,580
What should I do?

1262
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,900
Let's go have a cup of stick coffee.

1263
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:24,500
- Let's go.\N- Yes.

1264
01:27:02,900 --> 01:27:05,660
Choi Seungil, 645, 500,000.

1265
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:11,120
Lee Yongho, 645. 750,000.

1266
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:20,150
Choi Jung Nam on June 16th.

1267
01:27:23,750 --> 01:27:26,710
16th, no soldiers came in?

1268
01:27:37,440 --> 01:27:40,370
Our Republic's Hero.\NChoi Jung-nam, Comrade.

1269
01:27:40,370 --> 01:27:41,960
What are you saying? Is there anything uncomfortable?

1270
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:42,950
No.

1271
01:27:42,950 --> 01:27:44,980
Comrade Choi Jeongnam. Where are you from?

1272
01:27:45,510 --> 01:27:46,510
Ham...

1273
01:27:48,980 --> 01:27:50,150
Ham, where?

1274
01:27:50,260 --> 01:27:51,120
It's Hamheung.

1275
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:52,880
Nice to meet you.

1276
01:27:52,880 --> 01:27:54,730
I'm from Hamheung, too.

1277
01:27:54,730 --> 01:27:57,150
I'm also from Hamheung. What part?

1278
01:27:57,550 --> 01:27:59,830
I mean, um...

1279
01:28:02,020 --> 01:28:04,870
I thought you were the hero of the Republic of Korea.

1280
01:28:04,870 --> 01:28:07,620
But it turns out.

1281
01:28:08,900 --> 01:28:10,630
A traitor to the nation.

1282
01:28:13,510 --> 01:28:14,680
Get in.

1283
01:28:19,070 --> 01:28:21,420
Comrade Yeonhee, come here.

1284
01:28:21,620 --> 01:28:24,270
I found something interesting today.

1285
01:28:24,270 --> 01:28:27,590
Comrade Lee Yong-ho said that Comrade Yeon-hee was an enemy?

1286
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,860
Yeah.

1287
01:28:29,550 --> 01:28:34,190
But our comrade Lee Yongho has not been seen recently.

1288
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,320
Do you know Yeonhee?

1289
01:28:36,980 --> 01:28:39,690
Did he happen to cross the Military Demarcation Line?

1290
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:45,140
Running south.

1291
01:28:45,980 --> 01:28:47,360
Comrade security instructor.

1292
01:28:51,330 --> 01:28:52,570
Who are you?

1293
01:28:53,620 --> 01:28:56,830
The hero of the Republic, Choi Jeong-nam, was a ghost from the beginning.

1294
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:58,440
Who are you?

1295
01:29:01,620 --> 01:29:04,100
You bastard!\NWho are you!

1296
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:09,920
I am proud

1297
01:29:09,920 --> 01:29:11,860
- Republic of Korea Army Sergeant\N- You son of a bitch!

1298
01:29:11,860 --> 01:29:16,420
Rebel of the Republic! South Korean reactionary spy!

1299
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:19,040
Your face looks white and clean.

1300
01:29:19,050 --> 01:29:21,120
Ever since you started calling the balls.

1301
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:22,710
- I asked around, you son of a bitch. - Calm down.

1302
01:29:22,710 --> 01:29:23,800
Bastard, I...

1303
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,270
I'm gonna kill this bastard today! I'm gonna die, too!

1304
01:29:28,270 --> 01:29:29,500
Comrade Yeonhee, give me that gun.

1305
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:31,220
Give me that gun!

1306
01:29:31,230 --> 01:29:32,650
Let go of this!

1307
01:29:38,360 --> 01:29:39,530
What's going on?

1308
01:29:41,440 --> 01:29:42,900
Comrade political instructor.

1309
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:50,190
It's here.

1310
01:29:51,190 --> 01:29:54,470
We need to revise our plan and head south now!

1311
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:55,670
Comrade political instructor.

1312
01:29:55,670 --> 01:29:57,650
I'll contact the south side. All right.

1313
01:29:57,730 --> 01:30:00,110
Move to the public water supply area now!

1314
01:30:00,110 --> 01:30:01,920
How are you going to get here?

1315
01:30:01,920 --> 01:30:05,180
When the guard instructor wakes up, one of them has to die!

1316
01:30:07,830 --> 01:30:08,990
Comrade Yeonhee.

1317
01:30:10,850 --> 01:30:13,220
I used to be a special instructor!

1318
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:15,750
A special instructor who went all the way to the Middle East.

1319
01:30:16,110 --> 01:30:18,710
Don't worry.\NTake him

1320
01:30:18,710 --> 01:30:22,070
and go, quickly.

1321
01:30:24,940 --> 01:30:26,190
Oh...

1322
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:29,650
- You have to go, you have to go!\N- Hey, wait...

1323
01:30:39,130 --> 01:30:40,300
Take it.

1324
01:30:47,830 --> 01:30:51,150
The situation is urgent, the identity of Chunwoo comrade was found.

1325
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:54,310
Wait, wait.

1326
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:56,540
Wait.

1327
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:00,110
The young boar was in a lot of trouble.

1328
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:03,310
Does the boar especially not follow you?

1329
01:31:03,920 --> 01:31:07,180
When you look at this handkerchief, you're bound to think of us.

1330
01:31:07,530 --> 01:31:12,850
On the way back, please let the boar return to its mother's arms.

1331
01:31:17,980 --> 01:31:18,900
Yeah.

1332
01:31:19,580 --> 01:31:22,400
Go easy, Comrade Jeongnam.

1333
01:31:28,910 --> 01:31:31,880
Quick go to! Don't get hurt! Go find Mom!

1334
01:31:32,170 --> 01:31:34,680
Go. There's no time.

1335
01:31:36,240 --> 01:31:38,590
Yeon-hee, is it ok that I'm going?

1336
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,660
I'm fine. Just go.

1337
01:31:50,150 --> 01:31:52,190
Hello, Comrade Kim Kwang-cheol.

1338
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:57,810
You have two choices.

1339
01:31:59,220 --> 01:32:02,360
A chance to enjoy good fortune after receiving a large sum of money.

1340
01:32:02,740 --> 01:32:04,110
Another is..

1341
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,730
You and I are not getting away with this.

1342
01:32:10,850 --> 01:32:12,860
One of us

1343
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:21,220
is gonna die here.

1344
01:32:30,710 --> 01:32:35,680
If you assemble the gun first, you're a dead man.

1345
01:32:37,740 --> 01:32:41,440
But you're really out of luck.

1346
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:47,880
I was a member of the 525th Special Operations Group,\Npart of the Operations Directorate of the General Staff of Neray.

1347
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:54,150
AK47, SR-25.

1348
01:32:54,820 --> 01:32:59,350
M9 Beretta, Glock 17.

1349
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,680
I've won every fire I've touched in a while!

1350
01:33:05,110 --> 01:33:06,110
Is that so?

1351
01:33:08,620 --> 01:33:13,500
But I'm not gonna die under a gun.

1352
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:18,790
38th Aviation Army Regiment under\Nthe Reconnaissance General Bureau of the People's Armed Forces.

1353
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:21,230
I came from a sniper brigade.

1354
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,250
Comrade Kim Kwang Cheol.

1355
01:33:29,140 --> 01:33:30,640
Choose well.

1356
01:33:52,280 --> 01:33:53,350
Quick.

1357
01:33:55,530 --> 01:33:58,790
Why are your hands so disobedient?

1358
01:34:17,080 --> 01:34:19,380
Okay, your exit pass to the Capital Hospital of the Founding Army.

1359
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,920
Depart from Sohyeon Station on Bundang Line on 14:00.

1360
01:34:22,330 --> 01:34:25,010
Transfer to Line 3 at Seonneung Station, Line 2.

1361
01:34:25,150 --> 01:34:28,180
Transferred from Jongno 3-ga to Line 5 again.

1362
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:30,890
Arrived at the Nonghyup headquarters at Seodaemun Station.

1363
01:34:31,450 --> 01:34:33,140
Good, very good.

1364
01:34:33,140 --> 01:34:37,910
By the way, 15:30\NAre you suddenly leaving the Nonghyup headquarters?

1365
01:34:39,490 --> 01:34:42,610
At 15:48. Buy and eat at Gwanghwamun.

1366
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:46,390
Buy a lottery ticket at 16:01.

1367
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:52,290
Eat soondae at Euljiro 3-ga.

1368
01:34:52,290 --> 01:34:57,540
Why do you buy a hot dog\Nand an Americano at Jonggak Station?

1369
01:34:57,750 --> 01:35:01,570
Why do you go to the playground after looking at the bicycle repair shop?

1370
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:06,900
Yeah, 5 minutes ago. Hwangga's kalguksu.

1371
01:35:07,250 --> 01:35:08,790
You got caught.

1372
01:35:12,210 --> 01:35:13,830
Yes, it's a kalguksu restaurant.

1373
01:35:15,660 --> 01:35:18,180
Who?\NMr. Pervert?

1374
01:35:18,460 --> 01:35:21,250
Excuse me, is there a pervert among you?

1375
01:35:22,210 --> 01:35:23,680
Mr. Pervert Soldier!

1376
01:35:25,230 --> 01:35:26,990
You got a call. Please answer it.

1377
01:35:29,670 --> 01:35:30,560
Come on.

1378
01:35:39,140 --> 01:35:40,880
- Hello, communications security...\N- Hey, you punk!

1379
01:35:40,910 --> 01:35:42,470
Did you find the money at the bank?

1380
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:45,330
Why are you angry? I got kicked out!

1381
01:35:45,330 --> 01:35:46,280
What?

1382
01:35:51,700 --> 01:35:54,110
Maybe, lottery?

1383
01:36:07,310 --> 01:36:09,650
- Is this the right place?\N- Yes, that's right.

1384
01:36:11,630 --> 01:36:12,820
Hey, Chunwoo.

1385
01:36:13,550 --> 01:36:14,890
- Brother!\N- Yeonhee.

1386
01:36:15,970 --> 01:36:17,600
- Comrade Yeonhee!\N- How did you know this place?

1387
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:18,910
It's a long story.

1388
01:36:19,230 --> 01:36:21,980
You okay?\NAre you hurt?

1389
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:25,970
- You okay?\N- Yes.

1390
01:36:26,790 --> 01:36:29,530
Seungil is late.\NWhat happened?

1391
01:36:31,030 --> 01:36:33,090
By the way, did you find the money?

1392
01:36:33,090 --> 01:36:35,180
Comrade Manchul is all right to come?

1393
01:36:35,630 --> 01:36:36,890
The fool.

1394
01:36:49,620 --> 01:36:51,360
I sent him to 645.

1395
01:36:51,360 --> 01:36:53,360
How dare you do this to my only sister?

1396
01:36:53,630 --> 01:36:55,540
You son of a bitch! Say it!

1397
01:36:55,540 --> 01:36:57,400
What trick did you do?\NTalk about it!

1398
01:36:57,480 --> 01:36:59,100
What's the matter, brother?

1399
01:36:59,100 --> 01:37:00,710
Comrade Lee Yongho! Calm!

1400
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:03,300
I told you it wasn't like that!

1401
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:05,520
Hyung? Why am I your Brother?

1402
01:37:05,640 --> 01:37:08,170
If you're a year older, you're older than me!\NSo you call me brother-in-law?

1403
01:37:08,210 --> 01:37:09,290
Brother-in-law?

1404
01:37:09,640 --> 01:37:12,000
You son of a bitch or an asshole?

1405
01:37:12,020 --> 01:37:12,930
Shit!

1406
01:37:15,330 --> 01:37:20,090
The client didn't do anything. What are you two doing?

1407
01:37:20,790 --> 01:37:24,430
I'm my idea whether you like me or not. I'm not a toy.

1408
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:26,780
Yeah, well, if you take a closer look, they're all right.

1409
01:37:27,850 --> 01:37:29,460
Loosen the collar at once.

1410
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:38,880
Thank you, Yeonhee.

1411
01:37:38,940 --> 01:37:42,080
Shut up!\NYou didn't do anything right either!

1412
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:43,140
Yes.

1413
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:47,870
- Kim Manchul!\N- Manchul!

1414
01:37:48,990 --> 01:37:50,450
Loyalty!

1415
01:37:52,220 --> 01:37:54,420
TOD Observation Soldier Kim Man-chul.

1416
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:58,290
Mission accomplished, safe and sound.

1417
01:38:09,650 --> 01:38:12,700
Hey, how did you find this? I heard you couldn't get to the bank.

1418
01:38:12,700 --> 01:38:16,010
Isn't the first prize in this lottery paid out of the account?

1419
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:18,980
So right from the start, you can cash it in a day.

1420
01:38:18,980 --> 01:38:20,690
It's an impossible plan.

1421
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,900
The bonus wasn't actually drawn at the bank.

1422
01:38:22,900 --> 01:38:24,370
The prize money.

1423
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,270
I was there to find him.

1424
01:38:30,390 --> 01:38:32,380
Mr. Rich Soldier, yes.

1425
01:38:37,340 --> 01:38:41,200
Don't you think the country got too much in taxes?

1426
01:38:41,690 --> 01:38:43,350
Yeah, that's crazy.

1427
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:46,650
The civil servants.

1428
01:38:47,810 --> 01:38:49,700
I want to see something.

1429
01:38:50,870 --> 01:38:51,740
Yes?

1430
01:38:51,840 --> 01:38:52,900
The thing.

1431
01:38:57,860 --> 01:38:59,210
Not bad.

1432
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:04,320
What you doing?

1433
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:06,040
She said she wanted to see something.

1434
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:07,390
Who said anything about wanting to see your stuff?

1435
01:39:07,390 --> 01:39:10,560
Things! The real thing! Cha! Why is that?

1436
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:11,590
Are you out of your mind?

1437
01:39:11,590 --> 01:39:12,670
- Hands on pants...\N- No. no.

1438
01:39:12,670 --> 01:39:16,020
- No, no.\N- Are you crazy? People are so fucked up these days.

1439
01:39:16,020 --> 01:39:18,010
- No...\N- Hey, you pervert.

1440
01:39:18,490 --> 01:39:22,950
Enough is enough!\NPlease.

1441
01:39:34,010 --> 01:39:35,570
I put a zak here.

1442
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:39,350
-Disgusting.\N-That psycho Kang Eun-pyo

1443
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:42,780
- Let me.\N- Yes.

1444
01:39:43,230 --> 01:39:46,480
Do you know how nervous I get every time I go to the bathroom?

1445
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:50,190
What if it gets wet?

1446
01:39:50,190 --> 01:39:54,670
If you lose and the bank doesn't pay you.

1447
01:39:54,790 --> 01:39:55,750
That is not.

1448
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:58,850
It's not just money.

1449
01:39:58,850 --> 01:40:01,340
No, what's the point of giving four days and three nights off?

1450
01:40:01,340 --> 01:40:03,550
I'm coming to Seoul now.

1451
01:40:03,560 --> 01:40:07,970
What should I do when I come to Seoul?

1452
01:40:08,790 --> 01:40:09,980
All right! All right!

1453
01:40:09,980 --> 01:40:11,280
No, I'll show you everything.

1454
01:40:11,280 --> 01:40:12,100
No I don't want to.

1455
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,630
- What's going on with this...\N- No, I don't look.

1456
01:40:13,630 --> 01:40:14,890
- No, close the ...\N- This is outrageous.

1457
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:16,980
Does that make sense to you?

1458
01:40:17,190 --> 01:40:19,330
Why are you yelling at me?

1459
01:40:20,470 --> 01:40:23,220
Aunt Popeye at the South Gate loan shark?

1460
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,160
What is Popeye?

1461
01:40:25,940 --> 01:40:28,450
Just eat spinach and his eyes roll.

1462
01:40:28,710 --> 01:40:31,990
American imperialist with his fists at will.

1463
01:40:33,040 --> 01:40:36,550
Popeye has a terrible name.

1464
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:40,720
Yeonhee, Yeonhee,Yeonhee.

1465
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,470
Don't move.

1466
01:40:48,270 --> 01:40:49,400
Back off!

1467
01:40:52,530 --> 01:40:53,860
Comrade security instructor!

1468
01:40:54,300 --> 01:40:56,910
It's made in America!

1469
01:40:58,360 --> 01:41:00,070
Four million dollars!

1470
01:41:01,220 --> 01:41:05,630
We can share this!

1471
01:41:05,630 --> 01:41:08,790
- Yeah.\N- Split it, you and me?

1472
01:41:10,420 --> 01:41:11,360
Why?

1473
01:41:12,590 --> 01:41:14,350
- Brother.\N- Comrade security instructor!

1474
01:41:15,320 --> 01:41:18,120
This is 645 of peace.

1475
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:23,460
It's a sign from heaven that North and South Korea\Ncan share in peace and harmony.

1476
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:25,300
Hello, Peace?

1477
01:41:27,120 --> 01:41:29,990
Are you still in a romantic mood?

1478
01:41:30,640 --> 01:41:32,790
What peace? Do you want to be beaten half to death?

1479
01:41:32,790 --> 01:41:34,580
One of two has to die!

1480
01:41:35,080 --> 01:41:37,240
Real peace came.

1481
01:41:37,790 --> 01:41:38,980
OK!

1482
01:41:42,320 --> 01:41:43,680
Stupid.

1483
01:41:45,750 --> 01:41:47,200
You think I don't know?

1484
01:41:50,330 --> 01:41:51,860
I know it all.

1485
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:59,280
What are you doing?

1486
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:01,990
That's our money. Put it down.

1487
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:03,220
Stay!

1488
01:42:03,220 --> 01:42:07,360
What are you guys doing? Do something!

1489
01:42:08,880 --> 01:42:10,310
Okay, I'll kill you.

1490
01:42:11,070 --> 01:42:13,170
I'll kill you in one go.

1491
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,090
Soldiers of the North and South, goodbye.

1492
01:42:32,420 --> 01:42:34,860
What's that?

1493
01:43:08,430 --> 01:43:10,730
Hey, you fucking boar! Stop!

1494
01:43:11,230 --> 01:43:13,820
Stop! Hey, boar!

1495
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:16,460
Comrade Choljin, follow quickly!

1496
01:43:18,480 --> 01:43:20,880
Come here! Don't even eat that!

1497
01:43:21,060 --> 01:43:22,800
Hey, you boar!

1498
01:43:23,740 --> 01:43:29,150
My money!

1499
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,810
Don't shoot me! It's me!

1500
01:43:33,090 --> 01:43:34,070
How's it going?

1501
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:35,510
The mine exploded.

1502
01:43:35,670 --> 01:43:40,000
Comrade Guard instructor flew into the sky.

1503
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:41,700
And the money?

1504
01:43:41,740 --> 01:43:44,430
The boar took it all.

1505
01:43:45,120 --> 01:43:46,850
It's all over.

1506
01:43:48,490 --> 01:43:49,590
Fxxk...

1507
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:51,280
Brother.

1508
01:43:56,410 --> 01:43:57,790
It's all over.

1509
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:01,170
He's 645.

1510
01:44:02,180 --> 01:44:04,410
It was ridiculous from the start.

1511
01:44:05,260 --> 01:44:09,210
Let's go back.

1512
01:44:09,780 --> 01:44:11,810
What the hell have we been doing?

1513
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:13,530
Wait! Wait!

1514
01:44:20,000 --> 01:44:21,590
Hey what you doing now?

1515
01:44:21,590 --> 01:44:23,380
No, Sergeant Park! It's not like that. It's not like that.

1516
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:25,900
- You son of a bitch.\N- Get your hands off me, Man-chul! Get your hands off me!

1517
01:44:25,900 --> 01:44:27,070
Yes, I want it down! I want it off!

1518
01:44:27,070 --> 01:44:28,110
Take it out! Take it out!

1519
01:44:28,740 --> 01:44:29,820
Done!

1520
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,070
Huh? Why is that coming out there?

1521
01:44:32,080 --> 01:44:33,510
Mister, this, this, this.

1522
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:34,810
Right, right.

1523
01:44:36,210 --> 01:44:37,350
Here?

1524
01:44:38,940 --> 01:44:40,910
- What's this?\N- Can you...

1525
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:42,100
Right, right.

1526
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:45,830
Manchul...

1527
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,460
Manchul!

1528
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:50,350
This, this.

1529
01:44:52,940 --> 01:44:56,040
I didn't put anything in bag.

1530
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:59,020
I brought another $400,000 with me.

1531
01:44:59,450 --> 01:45:00,720
Manchul!

1532
01:45:01,350 --> 01:45:02,250
Manchul!

1533
01:45:02,250 --> 01:45:06,090
So this is reversed.

1534
01:45:06,420 --> 01:45:07,860
There's a twist!

1535
01:45:07,860 --> 01:45:08,960
Yes, yes.

1536
01:45:09,030 --> 01:45:12,260
Kim Man-chul is on a reward vacation right now!

1537
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:13,520
Thanks.

1538
01:45:17,980 --> 01:45:18,990
Yeonhee.

1539
01:45:20,050 --> 01:45:21,810
- Chunwoo!\N- One, bucket plant, stone three, raccoon.

1540
01:45:21,810 --> 01:45:24,350
- Squid, beef soup, Turkey, octopus\N- How much?

1541
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:30,760
Here's $400,000.

1542
01:45:33,870 --> 01:45:35,610
I was kind of... running over here.

1543
01:45:38,840 --> 01:45:42,990
But if it's $400,000 it's still a lot of money.

1544
01:45:42,990 --> 01:45:44,770
Of course. $400,000.

1545
01:45:44,770 --> 01:45:47,130
So if you split it in half, that's $200,000.

1546
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:50,110
About 200 million won.

1547
01:45:50,110 --> 01:45:51,610
If it's 200 million to 15 percent.

1548
01:45:51,990 --> 01:45:53,490
30 million won?

1549
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:58,980
I can pay the piano and pay my mother's medical bills.

1550
01:46:00,220 --> 01:46:04,600
But for that money you could buy100 false teeth made in Switzerland.

1551
01:46:05,230 --> 01:46:08,620
Are you gonna let me in, too?

1552
01:46:09,660 --> 01:46:12,000
Of course you do.

1553
01:46:16,540 --> 01:46:17,630
Yeonhee.

1554
01:46:28,290 --> 01:46:30,480
Don't forget my account number.

1555
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:32,830
All right, I'll text you.

1556
01:46:36,540 --> 01:46:41,270
Comrade Chunwoo, good job these days. Goodbye.

1557
01:46:41,960 --> 01:46:44,550
Will we see each other again?

1558
01:46:45,200 --> 01:46:46,670
What are we gonna do when we meet again?

1559
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:49,460
We can see each other when we're unified, right?

1560
01:46:51,850 --> 01:46:52,830
Right.

1561
01:46:53,730 --> 01:46:56,700
Let's all be united and pray.

1562
01:46:57,540 --> 01:46:59,090
Unification is nothing.

1563
01:46:59,700 --> 01:47:03,390
All you can see when you want to is unity.

1564
01:47:25,510 --> 01:47:26,520
Yeonhee.

1565
01:47:28,440 --> 01:47:31,760
Now it's time to leave.

1566
01:47:33,300 --> 01:47:34,710
Be safe.

1567
01:47:36,550 --> 01:47:41,650
Everything you do goes well, and make a lot of money.

1568
01:47:42,140 --> 01:47:44,310
Please grant your wish.

1569
01:47:44,910 --> 01:47:46,670
Make sure you open a farm.

1570
01:47:47,830 --> 01:47:49,870
There must be glory in all things.

1571
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:53,450
I hope Yeon-hee can become a successful singer.

1572
01:47:53,900 --> 01:47:57,420
You must come to Pyongyang to eat cold noodles.

1573
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:03,400
Don't get sick. Don't get sick.

1574
01:48:09,570 --> 01:48:14,190
Well, then go find yourself a good date.

1575
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:23,720
And you.

1576
01:48:41,630 --> 01:48:42,630
Go!

1577
01:48:42,690 --> 01:48:43,700
Go!

1578
01:49:03,470 --> 01:49:07,630
Hello, members of the Korean Armed Forces.

1579
01:49:07,940 --> 01:49:11,440
This is the Broadcasting Bureau of the 24th Division of the Korean People's Army.

1580
01:49:12,480 --> 01:49:14,740
How's your day?

1581
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,850
Turn around and turn right!

1582
01:49:32,850 --> 01:49:34,130
- Round and round and  right!\N- Turn around and turn right!

1583
01:49:34,130 --> 01:49:37,500
Turn around and turn right!\NTurn around and turn right!

1584
01:49:40,490 --> 01:49:44,070
But there are no surprises that fall short!

1585
01:49:44,070 --> 01:49:47,620
Come on, win the lottery!\NA thousand won lotto is just right!

1586
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:49,970
- Congratulations congratulations,\N- Congratulations congratulations

1587
01:49:49,970 --> 01:49:51,840
Congratulations congratulations
