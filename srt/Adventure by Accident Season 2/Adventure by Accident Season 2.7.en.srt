1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,010
Pani Bottle, who was gone shortly,
has come back!

2
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:04,009
(Pani Bottle came back home.)

3
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:05,079
(Happy to see Pani Bottle again.)

4
00:00:05,079 --> 00:00:06,780
I heard you come here
more often than I do.

5
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,979
- You're right.
- That's right.

6
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:09,850
- I'm leaving again tomorrow.
- What?

7
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:10,920
- Where are you going?
- Where are you going this time?

8
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,020
- I'm going to Morocco.
- I see.

9
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:13,719
- Really?
- I'm going to film a YouTube video.

10
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,890
I'm all over the place.
After that, I'm going to Egypt.

11
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:18,689
I think I'll be out of the house
for two months.

12
00:00:18,689 --> 00:00:19,890
- Two months?
- Oh, my.

13
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,189
If so, could we use it?

14
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:22,529
It's always empty.

15
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:23,629
- I'll tell you my door code.
- Okay.

16
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:26,000
You can come and rest as much as you want.

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,930
Oh, my. How nice.
It's like a shared office.

18
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:31,739
Pani Bottle.
It seems you ate quite a lot in India.

19
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,739
(Happy Bottle has
generously sized cheeks.)

20
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:34,470
- Your cheeks look so nice.
- Your cheeks.

21
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,270
- You look so much healthier.
- Yes.

22
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,080
I've had quite an appetite lately.

23
00:00:38,279 --> 00:00:40,809
By the way, you come over often,

24
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,679
but I never have anything prepared.

25
00:00:43,679 --> 00:00:45,679
I prepared something we could eat...

26
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:47,190
- while watching today.
- Oh, my!

27
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:48,950
- You didn't have to do that.
- Yes!

28
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,819
- Chicken.
- It's chicken.

29
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:52,359
- Nice.
- How nice.

30
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:54,429
It's Chobok today.

31
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,459
That's why he prepared
such a generous amount.

32
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,059
(That looks tasty.)

33
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,099
(Eyes fixed)

34
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,029
- That looks good.
- I'm excited.

35
00:01:02,169 --> 00:01:05,439
Eating like this really feels
like we came over to hang out.

36
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,340
(Come over often.)

37
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,639
(Filling their empty stomachs
with a hearty meal at a friend's house)

38
00:01:13,210 --> 00:01:15,210
- The nachos make it taste Mexican.
- Right.

39
00:01:15,279 --> 00:01:16,880
It does have an exotic taste.

40
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,919
Eating it with nachos makes it crunchier.

41
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:22,889
Did Naveen contact you
after that episode aired?

42
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,130
(Naveen was the happiest guy...)

43
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,689
(after meeting a superstar.)

44
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:31,359
- He was so happy.
- Oh, my.

45
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:33,769
He was so touched and was posting a lot.

46
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:35,730
- He was posting on Instagram.
- I see.

47
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:37,700
Do you remember the girl
I met on the train?

48
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,969
- Did she contact you?
- She contacted me on Instagram.

49
00:01:38,969 --> 00:01:40,309
- What did she say? Did she DM you?
- Really?

50
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:43,639
But there were several Indian women.

51
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:45,409
- Who was it?
- Which one was it?

52
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:46,779
- The girl...
- The one with glasses?

53
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,409
- Glasses?
- Yes, the one with glasses.

54
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:49,549
The medical school student.

55
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:50,549
(I remember her.)

56
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,719
(Dex randomly met her
on the train in India.)

57
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:54,249
(Do you like me?)

58
00:01:54,519 --> 00:01:56,419
(I saw you for the first time.)

59
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:58,990
(Even though it was a brief first meeting,
these two shared a nice memory.)

60
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:01,460
I think she said something kind. Yes.

61
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,960
"I enjoyed the show. It was cool."

62
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,029
Are you two still talking?

63
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,399
If we continue our relationship...

64
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,769
- I see.
- Yes.

65
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:11,839
- Let's see.
- You never know.

66
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,440
You all made a lot of friends there.

67
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:17,810
Let's see here. What?

68
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:20,280
(What?)

69
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,410
Who are you...

70
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,619
- talking to?
- Half of it is people asking for money.

71
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,119
(Patting Kian84 on the back)

72
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,589
(At least someone messaged me.)

73
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,489
(It's already the 7th day in India.)

74
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,790
(They arrived at the Golden Temple city.)

75
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:37,200
(Amritsar)

76
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,730
(The three brothers enter a new world.)

77
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:41,530
(There's no handle...)

78
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,700
(or side-view mirror?)

79
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,700
(Wearing a turban instead of a helmet?)

80
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,910
(They can tell by their first impression
that Amritsar is different.)

81
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,010
(Completely transforming
to become one with Sikhism)

82
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,739
(One more plate
of Dumpling Bottle, please.)

83
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,350
(The Golden Temple
greets the three brothers.)

84
00:02:54,709 --> 00:02:58,380
(Entering the biggest restaurant
in the world)

85
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,589
(This place feeds
100,000 people every day...)

86
00:03:00,589 --> 00:03:01,989
(with volunteers working 24 hours.)

87
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,160
(Kian84 and Pani Bottle
stuff their faces.)

88
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,459
(Dex acts as a diplomat.)

89
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,260
(No work, no food.)

90
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,000
(Following the volunteers
washing the dishes,)

91
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:16,070
(the three brothers
show off their dishwashing skills.)

92
00:03:16,869 --> 00:03:18,000
(Work is here.)

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,269
(It's a work party.)

94
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,810
(He went to get more dirty dishes.)

95
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,609
(Dishes crashing down)

96
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,750
(So confused by the flying food trays)

97
00:03:29,649 --> 00:03:32,419
(Kian84 is struggling on the battlefield.
What will happen to him?)

98
00:03:32,649 --> 00:03:35,089
(Why isn't Kian84 back yet?)

99
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:38,489
(Unaware of Kian84's situation,
Pani Bottle heads over.)

100
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,160
(Pausing)

101
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,200
(He spots Kian84...)

102
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,200
Pani Bottle is surprised.

103
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,570
Isn't that the face I made at the wedding?

104
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,669
- I know that face.
- Right.

105
00:03:51,669 --> 00:03:53,239
That's how I was at the wedding.

106
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:56,269
(When Kian84 was trapped
on the dance floor,)

107
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,639
(Dex made this same shocked face.)

108
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,950
(Pani Bottle is also shocked and frozen.)

109
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,880
I wanted to help,
but I couldn't get myself to go in.

110
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,950
I was wondering what he was doing.

111
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,750
- I was thinking so many things at once.
- Right.

112
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,989
- Mental breakdown.
- I couldn't do anything.

113
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:10,560
I felt like I was frozen there.

114
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,790
But he's staying until the end
and picking up plates.

115
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,930
(Let's go.)

116
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,130
Where does this go?

117
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,269
- That must be heavy for Pani Bottle.
- Lift!

118
00:04:22,269 --> 00:04:23,469
(Dumpling Bottle, who finished thawing,
helps Kian84.)

119
00:04:24,399 --> 00:04:25,700
(Patting his back)

120
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,139
(It's so heavy, they need encouragement.)

121
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,880
- Okay. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

122
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,579
(One, two, three. Let's go.)

123
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:35,909
- Oh, my.
- That was so heavy.

124
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,089
(There's more work.)

125
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:43,789
(Thanks to the work
these two brought over,)

126
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,089
(the dishwashing party gets going again.)

127
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,529
- I felt a sense of belonging.
- Right.

128
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,969
(Proud)

129
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,469
(Looking down)

130
00:04:56,229 --> 00:04:57,639
Gosh. I'm so dirty now.

131
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,240
Oh, no. It's a white shirt.

132
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,339
I didn't even know Kian84 was doing that.

133
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:05,209
When I saw him later,
I wondered why his clothes were so dirty.

134
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,310
- You must've been surprised.
- I was.

135
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,979
I was wondering how he did the dishes
to end up that way.

136
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,950
I didn't know about this situation.

137
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:15,389
I think doing it like that made it feel...

138
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,889
like I did very intense volunteer work.

139
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:18,920
- I worked hard.
- I'm working hard.

140
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,529
- I worked hard.
- I did volunteer work today.

141
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,060
It's like when your face becomes black
after delivering coal briquettes.

142
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:24,729
- Right.
- So when my clothes got dirty,

143
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,500
- I felt more holy.
- I see.

144
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:31,240
I got food all over my face.

145
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:34,310
(Kian84 became holy from head to toe.)

146
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,440
That's insane.

147
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,740
(The holy worker
of the never-ending dishes)

148
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:43,420
(Even though he's tired,
he diligently gathers dishes.)

149
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:47,120
(Seeing Kian84 work hard,)

150
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:48,589
Okay.

151
00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:49,620
(one of the locals joins him.)

152
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:52,990
Kian84 worked very hard.

153
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,760
(Whose son is that?)

154
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:00,029
(He's very hardworking.)

155
00:06:00,930 --> 00:06:03,800
(The help the India Brothers shared)

156
00:06:04,269 --> 00:06:07,209
We weren't very skillful,
but we hoped to help out a bit.

157
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,670
Oh, my. How shiny.

158
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,409
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my. That's nice.

159
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,180
(Kian84 finished washing dishes.)

160
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,550
(Oh, my)

161
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,349
Everyone is equal...

162
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:21,349
in front of dirty dishes.

163
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,649
We found enlightenment.

164
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,089
We need to learn from Sikhism
in this aspect.

165
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,130
I'm definitely very proud
of my dishwashing skills now.

166
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,959
You've only done this, right?

167
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,700
I've done some intense dishes.

168
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,130
- I'm the UDT of the dishwashing world.
- You're a master.

169
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,469
- UDT.
- UDT?

170
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:38,670
You're just regular soldiers?

171
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:40,839
- I'm a special forces agent.
- I see.

172
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:46,950
Hey. Where did Dex go?

173
00:06:47,149 --> 00:06:48,649
- What?
- Oh, there you are.

174
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:49,750
What?

175
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,149
- I'm right here.
- It's confusing...

176
00:06:52,149 --> 00:06:53,649
because everyone's wearing this.

177
00:06:53,649 --> 00:06:55,149
- Right.
- Everyone looks the same.

178
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:59,190
This must be the onion zone.
It's stinging my eyes so much.

179
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,159
(In this corner, they're prepping onions.)

180
00:07:01,159 --> 00:07:02,229
Your eyes must sting so much.

181
00:07:02,229 --> 00:07:04,130
- Prepping ingredients...
- It's divided into different areas.

182
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:06,430
(Ingredient prep zone)

183
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:07,930
And the cooking zone.

184
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:09,670
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my. That's insane.

185
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,440
It's very systematic.

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,810
(The volunteer work is divided
in a systematic way.)

187
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,810
The music is to raise morale.

188
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:22,180
- It's like a work song.
- Right.

189
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,719
I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.

190
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:29,219
He couldn't eat,

191
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,360
and it was so loud.
He's so out of it right now.

192
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,930
Are only your muscles strong?

193
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,229
Even his hearing is weak.

194
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:37,800
Your ears are weak.

195
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,099
Your ears.

196
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,670
(Sniffing)

197
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,469
This is the smell of bread.
They're baking right now.

198
00:07:42,769 --> 00:07:44,469
It's full of smoke, right?

199
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,740
Oh, my!

200
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:50,209
(Following the smell of bread)

201
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,940
- Oh, my.
- This definitely looked fun.

202
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,849
It's a baking class.
I'd definitely want to do that.

203
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,380
A baking class.

204
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,349
There's a section for making dough
and another section for baking.

205
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,519
(The chapati they ate earlier)

206
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,130
- It has a warm, savory smell.
- Right.

207
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,430
(Getting nice and golden)

208
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,060
- Oh, my.
- They must make over 100,000 a day.

209
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,700
- That means...
- Because 100,000 people come.

210
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,769
There could be some people who eat a lot.

211
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:15,870
They'd have to make more.

212
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,500
You definitely have to take a baking class
when you're traveling.

213
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,070
Oh, my eyes are stinging.

214
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,870
This is training to strengthen your eyes.

215
00:08:24,139 --> 00:08:25,510
Don't avoid it. Fight it.

216
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:30,250
This place was full of smoke and heat.

217
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,849
- It must be hot.
- It really was.

218
00:08:33,079 --> 00:08:35,849
(Dough)

219
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,890
Is this flour?

220
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:41,190
Is this "mil?"

221
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,959
- Meal.
- Meal.

222
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:44,259
- "Mil?"
- She somehow understood.

223
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:45,400
A meal.

224
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,099
I'll make the dough a bit thin.

225
00:08:48,099 --> 00:08:51,400
I'll make it thin,
like a gorgonzola pizza.

226
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,770
(Kian84 was slightly disappointed
by the thickness of the chapati.)

227
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,339
These days,
you need to make the dough thin.

228
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,140
- Oh, is that the trend?
- That's the trend.

229
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,749
You sound a bit like Paik Jong Won.

230
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,719
Oh, this is easy.

231
00:09:07,089 --> 00:09:08,349
(Singing and rolling the dough)

232
00:09:08,349 --> 00:09:09,420
Complete.

233
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:11,119
Oh, very thin.

234
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,089
- You're quite good.
- Yes.

235
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,030
- This is fun for me.
- Really?

236
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:17,430
(So fun)

237
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,959
He enjoys everything other than eating.

238
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,430
Simple labor fits me well.

239
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,570
(He shows off his talent
whenever he does simple labor.)

240
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:26,570
He's a machine.

241
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,369
(An honor student of simple labor)

242
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,509
(Making sounds as he rolls out the dough)

243
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,209
He makes a lot of sound effects
whenever he does something.

244
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:35,709
I make those kinds of sounds
when I'm happy.

245
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:37,719
Right. You must be making those sounds
because you're having fun.

246
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:40,420
(Done!)

247
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,920
(No.)

248
00:09:42,619 --> 00:09:43,690
(As soon as he finishes...)

249
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,989
Okay.

250
00:09:47,359 --> 00:09:49,890
(While Dex hogs all of the work,)

251
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:51,329
(Pani Bottle...)

252
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:52,359
Oh, Pani Bottle too.

253
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:54,430
Oh, my.

254
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,869
(Struggling)

255
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,670
(My back hurts.)

256
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,770
(My eyes are stinging.)

257
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,979
She really adores him.

258
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,540
Oh, okay.

259
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,950
(He's not good at making dough,
but they're having fun together.)

260
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,209
Didn't it feel a bit different
from when we did the dishes?

261
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:11,249
- Right.
- Oh, you're right.

262
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,879
(Dishwashing was
like being on a battlefield.)

263
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,450
- Dishwashing was like a battlefield.
- Right.

264
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,560
This place was very peaceful.

265
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,660
(The peaceful chapati factory)

266
00:10:20,589 --> 00:10:21,589
Oh, okay.

267
00:10:21,589 --> 00:10:22,729
(Glancing over)

268
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,859
Doesn't it feel like the holidays?

269
00:10:24,859 --> 00:10:25,859
- Yes.
- Seriously.

270
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,700
- Like making songpyeon with everyone.
- Right.

271
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,869
It kind of feels like that.

272
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,910
(Just like the scene
we saw during the holidays)

273
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:39,540
(Everyone is gathered around,
happily working together.)

274
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,410
A very large family.

275
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,780
It felt like a huge relative's house.

276
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,150
- A relative's house.
- The relative's house is back.

277
00:10:49,550 --> 00:10:50,859
A huge holiday.

278
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,560
If every single one of my distant cousins
got together,

279
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,229
it would be around that size.

280
00:10:55,589 --> 00:10:57,930
All of my aunts on my dad's side.

281
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,129
All of my aunts on my mom's side.
Both of my grandmas.

282
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,030
They're all making dough together.

283
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:05,839
- It felt very affectionate.
- How fascinating.

284
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,770
- It does feel affectionate.
- Yes.

285
00:11:07,869 --> 00:11:09,339
(The India Brothers
make chapati with affection.)

286
00:11:09,339 --> 00:11:10,979
Oh, I made a hole. Oh, no.

287
00:11:12,109 --> 00:11:13,879
(Peek-a-boo, Grandma.)

288
00:11:13,879 --> 00:11:15,379
- What? Are you asking for praise?
- Yes.

289
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,410
(This guy!)

290
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,719
- You're flirting.
- No.

291
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:18,749
You're even flirting while doing that.

292
00:11:18,749 --> 00:11:20,849
- How many are you going to seduce?
- Seriously.

293
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:22,950
- Did she message you too?
- No.

294
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,859
- No.
- "I saw the show."

295
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:26,790
- "I remember you."
- Right.

296
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,259
Did she message you?
We'll have to check later.

297
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,400
She was taking such good care of me.

298
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,099
I needed to do something.
I needed to be cute, at least.

299
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:35,629
- Good job.
- You never know. She could have...

300
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,999
made a social media account
because of you.

301
00:11:38,599 --> 00:11:40,609
- "I want to send a message."
- To send a message.

302
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,440
(Chapati boy is acting cute)

303
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:47,450
- She's enjoying it so much.
- She's so happy.

304
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,749
- She really adores him.
- Oh, my.

305
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,849
Whatever country you go to in the world,

306
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:55,150
all grandmas are kind.

307
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,020
- Right?
- Even if you're bad, they just laugh.

308
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:00,089
That's not a national rule.

309
00:12:00,089 --> 00:12:02,759
- Is that an Earth rule, then?
- An Earth rule.

310
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,800
Even if you don't speak the same language,

311
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,300
- you can still communicate.
- Seriously.

312
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:08,829
I want to see my grandma.

313
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,940
(Rolling the dough out with care
while thinking of his grandma)

314
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:15,310
(Glancing over)

315
00:12:15,969 --> 00:12:17,280
(They're baking the chapati
in the same space.)

316
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,440
You should've tried baking that.

317
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,180
Can only skilled people bake these?

318
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,219
(He carries over the dough
he rolled out with care.)

319
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,820
Oh, that's how you throw it?

320
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,219
- Oh, my.
- What is that?

321
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,829
It's like throwing a boomerang.

322
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,229
(Taking a seat next to the master)

323
00:12:36,829 --> 00:12:38,759
Grandmother. Can you throw mine too?

324
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,060
Oh, sure.

325
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,499
Please throw mine too.

326
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,270
Is it okay?

327
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,509
(Using the skill of a master)

328
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:49,640
(Throwing the dough)

329
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,379
(Clean)

330
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,579
(Landing)

331
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,280
Mine are definitely a bit bigger.

332
00:12:55,849 --> 00:12:57,150
Like a gorgonzola pizza.

333
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,849
Kian84's dough almost looks like a pizza.

334
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,749
(Staring)

335
00:13:03,859 --> 00:13:05,320
(Do you want to try flipping it?)

336
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,359
Oh, okay?

337
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:08,190
This? Me? Oh, okay.

338
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,190
Flipping.

339
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,859
- I don't think that'll be easy.
- He'll try flipping.

340
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:13,560
Baking it just right
and making sure it doesn't rip.

341
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,770
That won't be easy.

342
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:16,770
It's like a game.

343
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,770
(Flipping)

344
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:22,839
He's a bit slow.

345
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:25,239
Even if you're bad,
no one gets mad at you.

346
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:26,839
- Seriously.
- That's so nice.

347
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,849
Her flipping skills...

348
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,379
are no joke.

349
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,820
She's so fast.

350
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,020
(She's basically
a human flipping machine.)

351
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,420
Come on. It's easy.

352
00:13:37,619 --> 00:13:38,920
Hey. This is easy.

353
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,390
This is nothing.

354
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,390
(Excuse me. Please move.)

355
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:46,300
(He said it was easy,
but he was soon kicked out.)

356
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,300
She took it from him.

357
00:13:47,469 --> 00:13:49,129
- Because they need to be quick.
- Right.

358
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,800
They need to feed 100,000 people.

359
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,099
They won't be able to eat at that pace.

360
00:13:52,099 --> 00:13:54,270
- There's generally no place to work.
- Right.

361
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,469
The competition is too intense.

362
00:13:56,469 --> 00:13:57,509
Gosh. Seriously.

363
00:13:58,739 --> 00:13:59,879
He's still at it.

364
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:03,249
I didn't even know
Kian84 and Pani Bottle were gone.

365
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:05,079
- I see.
- I was focused on doing that.

366
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:06,979
Shall we go?

367
00:14:07,249 --> 00:14:08,290
Dex.

368
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,950
Are you going to work more?

369
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,420
(Laughing)

370
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:14,489
That's the best expression
I've seen on your face.

371
00:14:14,489 --> 00:14:16,589
- That was the best.
- You looked like such a fool.

372
00:14:16,589 --> 00:14:18,200
His mouth looks focused. "Yes."

373
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:19,700
- So cute.
- So cute.

374
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,430
- So cute!
- You're like a kid.

375
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,599
- You didn't know, right?
- I didn't know I made that face.

376
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:25,339
It would've been a big issue
if we didn't let you keep going.

377
00:14:25,339 --> 00:14:26,369
Oh, my goodness.

378
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,709
Then join us after you work a bit more.

379
00:14:28,709 --> 00:14:30,709
(Bye.)

380
00:14:31,209 --> 00:14:32,280
I want to rest too.

381
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,379
(Let's go together.)

382
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,550
- You make more!
- He's coming.

383
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,280
Why are you coming? Make more.

384
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,879
Make 100 more, then join us.

385
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,489
(I'll be going too.)

386
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,119
- That was enough for our meal, right?
- Definitely.

387
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,890
It wasn't just enough for your meal.
It was a "Real Life Experience."

388
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:46,959
- Right.
- Right.

389
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,959
Wait. Let's sit and have a meeting.

390
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:51,099
Gosh.

391
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:52,400
Oh, goodness.

392
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,900
Today's flight...

393
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,800
from Amritsar to Leh...

394
00:14:57,999 --> 00:14:59,599
- is at 5.
- At 5 a.m.?

395
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:00,869
- At 5 in the morning.
- Right.

396
00:15:00,869 --> 00:15:03,140
- To catch the flight here,
- Okay.

397
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:05,579
we need to leave at 3 a.m. at the latest.

398
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:06,810
- Really?
- Yes.

399
00:15:07,009 --> 00:15:08,609
- We were supposed to sleep here.
- We had already checked out...

400
00:15:08,609 --> 00:15:10,349
- What you see back there...
- of the hotel we slept in last night.

401
00:15:10,349 --> 00:15:14,050
We were trying to decide where to stay
until our early morning flight.

402
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,920
- We hadn't decided yet.
- We hadn't decided yet.

403
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,859
We needed a discussion.

404
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:20,190
We were supposed to sleep here.

405
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,390
- What you see back there is the lodging.
- I see.

406
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:24,660
- So...
- Is that also free?

407
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,800
It's free.

408
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,829
But the important thing is...

409
00:15:26,829 --> 00:15:29,530
that the conditions weren't great
when I stayed there last time.

410
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:35,170
(Memories of having a hard time
because of bed bugs)

411
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,239
So let's go and check it out first.

412
00:15:37,239 --> 00:15:38,709
If we can sleep there, let's do that.

413
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,239
If not, we can sleep on the street.

414
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:42,579
- We need to sleep at night.
- This is the first proposal.

415
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,950
If we don't think we can sleep,
let's get a hotel.

416
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,349
This is the second proposal.

417
00:15:46,349 --> 00:15:48,849
I think you two can choose.

418
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,959
- I'm okay...
- Pani Bottle subtly...

419
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,719
- with sleeping outside too.
- tossed the decision to us.

420
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:54,729
- I just gave them the options.
- Right.

421
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,400
- There is a fan.
- Since we're here,

422
00:15:57,629 --> 00:16:01,129
let's sleep together with the Sikhs.

423
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:02,400
I vote for staying here.

424
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,099
Dex. Don't feel bad, and be honest.

425
00:16:04,099 --> 00:16:06,140
- You could get sick again.
- If Dex goes to a hotel,

426
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,339
- I'll go with him.
- Right.

427
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:08,869
Will you be okay staying here alone?

428
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,780
- I don't care.
- If Dex goes to a hotel,

429
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,410
- I'll go with him.
- What do you want to do?

430
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,879
I'll really follow you two.
I don't have anything I want to do.

431
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,749
Do what you want to do.
I'll do what I want to do too.

432
00:16:19,749 --> 00:16:20,920
- Really?
- Yes.

433
00:16:21,749 --> 00:16:22,920
Do you want to go to a hotel?

434
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:24,890
In the end, he wanted to go too.

435
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,959
- Because hotels have air conditioning.
- Exactly.

436
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:27,959
You already had an answer.

437
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,989
- That's what you really wanted to say.
- No.

438
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:31,499
You're going to sleep here, right?

439
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,560
- I'll rest here.
- Okay.

440
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:35,869
- If it gets tough, I'll go to the hotel.
- Okay.

441
00:16:36,099 --> 00:16:37,969
- Kian84 stays until the end.
- My last bit of pride.

442
00:16:38,369 --> 00:16:40,599
If so, you can try staying here.

443
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:42,810
- We'll find a hotel.
- Okay.

444
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:43,869
- Okay?
- Okay.

445
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,640
Okay. Then let's check out the room first.

446
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:48,079
This could be our first and last chance,

447
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,979
- so we wanted to check the condition...
- Yes.

448
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,979
- of the room before we decided.
- Right.

449
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,479
Where do we need to go?

450
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,849
I think the foreigner lodging
was here or something.

451
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,520
Let's ask. Excuse me?

452
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,619
- Yes.
- Excuse me?

453
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,859
- Where is the sleep...
- Where is the foreigner dormitory?

454
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,560
Can we see it?

455
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,100
- Come here.
- Okay.

456
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,830
(Following the staff
to check out the room)

457
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,160
Right. This was it.

458
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,299
- This is it?
- Yes.

459
00:17:09,469 --> 00:17:11,739
- This is the free dormitory.
- I see.

460
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,739
It's clean.

461
00:17:12,739 --> 00:17:14,440
It's not dirty,

462
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,840
but since there's no sunlight,

463
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:17,170
- they have bed bug issues.
- I see.

464
00:17:17,209 --> 00:17:19,009
Hello. Do you sleep here?

465
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,209
Yes.

466
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,809
I slept here three years ago.

467
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:25,120
- Okay.
- And I found some bed bugs.

468
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,479
Is it okay?

469
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:29,150
- It's fine. It's very good.
- Really? Okay.

470
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,860
I guess there aren't any now.

471
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,160
Okay.

472
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,090
I think we could stay here.

473
00:17:34,489 --> 00:17:35,489
The condition is...

474
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,600
- Let's go out and discuss first.
- Okay.

475
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,059
Thank you, sir.

476
00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:41,830
You can't sleep here, right, Dex?

477
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,140
To be honest,

478
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,870
I can sleep here. But I would sleep there.

479
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,670
- I don't think I can sleep inside.
- I see.

480
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,509
I still have nightmares
about those bed bugs.

481
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:53,279
I really can't sleep inside.

482
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,910
But the atmosphere inside...

483
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:59,420
feels like I'd be sleepy,
no matter how much I sleep.

484
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,549
- I think I'd be sleepy all day.
- If we're going to sleep,

485
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,319
it'd be best to just rest very well
in a hotel.

486
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,789
Since you were sick,
you need to rest more.

487
00:18:05,789 --> 00:18:07,989
I'm trying to get him to go to a hotel.
Let's go.

488
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,900
"Since you were sick, you need to rest."

489
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,130
"Dex. Are you okay?"

490
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,559
- "Don't you need more rest?"
- To be honest,

491
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,130
I wanted to go.

492
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,370
- I was happy you said so.
- Right.

493
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,739
- If so...
- Let's go to a hotel.

494
00:18:20,739 --> 00:18:23,309
- If so...
- Sick people shouldn't do tough things.

495
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:24,580
Let's go.

496
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,910
Let's go to Kian84 first
and tell him our plan.

497
00:18:28,749 --> 00:18:30,549
- He's in the same position.
- As expected.

498
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,549
(Taking a nap
in the same exact position as earlier)

499
00:18:32,549 --> 00:18:33,779
- Kian84.
- Yes?

500
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,789
Oh, my.

501
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:36,620
You must have a lot of vitamin D.

502
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,959
Kian84. We made a decision.

503
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,989
You stay here for a bit.

504
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,330
No. I'm going to follow you guys.

505
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,499
- Why all of a sudden?
- There's nothing to do here.

506
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:46,430
(A few moments ago,)

507
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:49,229
(he wanted to stay at the Golden Temple.)

508
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:51,769
To be honest, we were saying that,

509
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,410
but I'm sure we all wanted
to go back to the hotel.

510
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,539
- Yes.
- The hotel.

511
00:18:55,910 --> 00:18:57,610
Since we chose to go back to the hotel,

512
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,880
you stay here,
and come back if you don't like it.

513
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,709
No, I will follow you to the hotel.

514
00:19:02,249 --> 00:19:03,749
(Take me with you.)

515
00:19:03,749 --> 00:19:06,279
- What's wrong with you?
- It was hot.

516
00:19:06,819 --> 00:19:08,249
Okay, then.

517
00:19:08,249 --> 00:19:10,420
- Let's go.
- Let's go to the hotel last night...

518
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,819
- and ask for the same room.
- Yes.

519
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,059
- And we need to get our laundry.
- Yes.

520
00:19:13,059 --> 00:19:14,660
- At that hotel?
- Yes.

521
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,190
- Okay.
- Let's just come back again at night.

522
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,600
- Yes, sure.
- Yes, to watch the night view.

523
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,900
Why would we sleep outside?

524
00:19:21,569 --> 00:19:23,170
Yes, you need to sleep in a good place.

525
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,100
And we needed to leave early.

526
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,400
- Yes.
- I see.

527
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,039
- Okay.
- Your shoes.

528
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:29,809
I never thought I'd hear him say
he likes the hotel better.

529
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,610
- I do.
- It was so...

530
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:33,209
- He likes staying at hotels.
- Yes.

531
00:19:33,209 --> 00:19:34,479
I love staying at hotels.

532
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,950
I guess you've gotten used to
worldly comforts.

533
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,749
It's been a while
since I've been that way.

534
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,650
I realized that I was a city boy.

535
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,259
- Let's get your shoes...
- Yes.

536
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,590
- and go back to book another night.
- Let's go.

537
00:19:48,059 --> 00:19:49,360
Okay.

538
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,400
That was right around noon.

539
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,700
It was getting hot.

540
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,130
- Hey.
- Yes?

541
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,299
It's so hot.

542
00:19:55,729 --> 00:19:57,940
It's hot, isn't it?
Don't you need sunglasses?

543
00:19:58,039 --> 00:19:59,170
Sunglasses?

544
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,569
My eyes hurt even with sunglasses on.

545
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:03,239
Please, let's get you some this time.

546
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:06,180
You only kept complaining
during the last season.

547
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Really?

548
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,509
(He insisted on not needing any
when they were in South America.)

549
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,479
(He didn't even want the helmet cover.)

550
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:17,789
(He trained his eyes back then
until they got bloodshot.)

551
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,519
(Pulling)

552
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,759
(He tries to cover his eyes
like a hermit crab.)

553
00:20:23,759 --> 00:20:26,799
- My eyes hurt even with sunglasses.
- Yes, please get some.

554
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,830
It's really bad here.
The light even gets reflected...

555
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,469
- since it's all white.
- Yes.

556
00:20:30,469 --> 00:20:32,269
Do you have our keys?

557
00:20:32,269 --> 00:20:33,469
(Ta-da!)

558
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:35,370
If we lost that...

559
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:37,739
- I never lose these things.
- Great.

560
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,940
(They return to the lockers.)

561
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,080
What number were we?
I don't remember that.

562
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,709
- Here.
- Number five?

563
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,519
I was a bit worried back then...

564
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:46,420
since there were so many shoes.

565
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,789
I was skeptical about getting ours back.

566
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,950
- Thank you.
- I forgot.

567
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,590
(Yay)

568
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,789
- Gracias.
- "Gracias?"

569
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,390
Let's go.

570
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,289
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

571
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:00,660
Let's get you some sunglasses on the way.

572
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:03,229
- Okay.
- You will hurt your eyes.

573
00:21:03,999 --> 00:21:06,840
(The trusty Leader Bottle)

574
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,769
(Striding)

575
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,309
Hello, do you have sunglasses?

576
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:13,779
No?

577
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:16,110
(Quickly)

578
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,650
Hello, do you have sunglasses?

579
00:21:19,019 --> 00:21:20,420
- Yes?
- Do they have them?

580
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,819
They do.

581
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,620
I was worried he wouldn't get them,

582
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,789
- so I looked for them.
- Good job.

583
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:30,690
He took care of me even in South America.

584
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,799
(Pani Bottle keeps taking care
of Kian84's eyes.)

585
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:33,630
- Do they block the sun?
- Yes, they are black.

586
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:34,799
Do you want to try them on?

587
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,430
I think they will suit you.

588
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,400
I like these squared shapes.

589
00:21:39,499 --> 00:21:42,569
- These are okay.
- They suit you.

590
00:21:42,809 --> 00:21:44,580
- How much?
- It's 200.

591
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,009
- It's 200?
- It's 200?

592
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,279
It's three dollars?

593
00:21:47,279 --> 00:21:48,850
- Thank you.
- That's so cheap.

594
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,680
- It's three dollars?
- That's cheap.

595
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,779
Aren't you thirsty?

596
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,620
- It's killing me.
- Let's hurry.

597
00:21:53,749 --> 00:21:54,989
Let's get something to drink.

598
00:21:55,989 --> 00:21:57,860
(Slipping them on)

599
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,160
Gosh, that's cool.

600
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,590
- They look good.
- It's nice.

601
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,860
- Do you like your glasses?
- What?

602
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,459
- Do you like your glasses?
- I think my eyes hurt less.

603
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:09,370
Should we get a drink?

604
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:11,239
We can buy them here.

605
00:22:11,239 --> 00:22:13,239
- Should we get some now?
- They have drinks.

606
00:22:13,239 --> 00:22:14,870
- Okay.
- I'm thirsty.

607
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:16,069
(They go to get drinks.)

608
00:22:17,509 --> 00:22:18,739
I'll have that.

609
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:20,680
- This.
- Here it is.

610
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,509
- The one inside.
- Yes.

611
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:23,580
(The youngest one chooses a drink first.)

612
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,719
Mister, do you have ice?

613
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,350
- Ice?
- Ice.

614
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,319
Ice. How there?

615
00:22:30,519 --> 00:22:32,789
Can you stop saying that?

616
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:36,190
- That's all I know.
- You should say, "Where is it?"

617
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:38,259
That sounds like "How dare."

618
00:22:38,499 --> 00:22:40,529
- "How where?"
- No, "How dare you."

619
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:42,469
- "How dare you?"
- How dare you.

620
00:22:42,469 --> 00:22:44,769
- That's what I've been saying?
- Yes, so I...

621
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:47,569
You were a total gangster.

622
00:22:48,269 --> 00:22:50,640
(Even in South America...)

623
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,140
(and in India,
he kept saying, "How there.")

624
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,009
(He meant "How to get there.")

625
00:22:56,309 --> 00:22:57,920
(How dare)

626
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,279
That's what it meant.

627
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,049
(You country, how dare?)

628
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,150
- "How dare your country?"
- "How dare your country?"

629
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,860
(Toilet, how dare?)

630
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,390
- "How dare you, toilet?"
- "How dare you, toilet?"

631
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,390
(How dare, right side-view mirror?)

632
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:12,630
"How dare you go
without a side-view mirror?"

633
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,959
- You said that to an elderly man.
- You said that?

634
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,370
"How dare you?"

635
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:19,900
(He kept saying that,
even to an elderly man.)

636
00:23:19,969 --> 00:23:21,739
(Staring)

637
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:26,309
Didn't they give you weird looks
when you said that?

638
00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:28,880
I guess no one listened to me.

639
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,549
It's because you kept saying...

640
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:33,150
"How dare you" as soon as you saw them.

641
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,519
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

642
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,090
It's a good thing no one noticed.

643
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,759
It's a good thing my pronunciation is bad.

644
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

645
00:23:44,430 --> 00:23:45,459
It's 255.

646
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:47,029
(Drinks, 255 rupees, about 4 dollars)

647
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,529
I could have died
if it weren't for Pani Bottle.

648
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,729
"Died?"

649
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,370
Where is...

650
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,840
Where is the cat?

651
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,880
I took English lessons, though.

652
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:58,880
Really?

653
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:00,680
If you say that,

654
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,549
- it looks bad for the teacher.
- My teacher...

655
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,749
No, it was when
I was in elementary school.

656
00:24:05,219 --> 00:24:06,519
Just don't mention the teacher.

657
00:24:06,519 --> 00:24:07,620
- Okay.
- I don't mention it either.

658
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,890
It's true, though.

659
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:10,989
I'm not good at English, either.

660
00:24:11,459 --> 00:24:12,819
Okay, let's go in.

661
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,090
(They return to the hotel,
leaving their sad English skills behind.)

662
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:15,190
This is it.

663
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,459
We want to stay today.

664
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,900
We have already checked you out
and cleaned the room.

665
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,330
Okay, no problem.

666
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:24,870
If you want the room again...

667
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,400
- We have to check in again?
- you have to check in again.

668
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,969
Okay, no problem.

669
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,340
- I will give you the money upstairs.
- Okay.

670
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:34,410
Is the laundry coming back in the evening?

671
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:36,910
- "Evening?"
- Yes.

672
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,180
At 5 p.m.

673
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,049
"Evening" is the afternoon, right?
What does it mean?

674
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,289
Around 5 p.m.

675
00:24:42,289 --> 00:24:43,450
Okay, thank you.

676
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:46,019
Is "evening" around dinnertime?

677
00:24:46,489 --> 00:24:48,390
What is noon, then?
It's not "lunch," is it?

678
00:24:50,989 --> 00:24:52,229
I'm tired.

679
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,999
You should see your teacher again.

680
00:24:53,999 --> 00:24:55,269
Yes, let's go.

681
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:59,200
- This is better than I thought.
- What?

682
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,200
Why did you come back out
without taking a rest?

683
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,170
That was around 1 p.m.,

684
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,509
and the border closes at 4 p.m.,

685
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:07,279
so we had to leave right away...

686
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,709
- considering the travel time.
- Yes.

687
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:13,749
So, we have to get to the Wagah Border...

688
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:19,559
(They will see the flag ceremony
at the Wagah Border.)

689
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,360
It is far from here,

690
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,559
so we should rent an actual car...

691
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,100
to get to and from there.

692
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,499
Okay.

693
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,870
There are so many people here.

694
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,900
The crowd is amazing.

695
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,640
(The streets are full of people,
since it is a sacred place.)

696
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:38,779
You don't like crowds.

697
00:25:38,979 --> 00:25:41,410
Yes, but I have you next to me,
and you are my tranquilizer.

698
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,450
- Really? Stay close by.
- Yes.

699
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:46,420
- Okay, I feel at peace with you.
- Yes.

700
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,450
Okay.

701
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,850
- We relied on each other a lot.
- Yes.

702
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:50,989
(The Ganges Brothers are close.)

703
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:54,219
It's so hot.

704
00:25:54,789 --> 00:25:56,630
Let's buy a hat if there are any.

705
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,890
Yes, let's get one.

706
00:25:58,059 --> 00:26:00,999
Does Sikhism not allow caps?

707
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,130
(Stopping)

708
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:04,840
What?

709
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,799
- What is it?
- Aren't those caps?

710
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,840
Where?

711
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,239
- Over there. The yellow one.
- That?

712
00:26:09,239 --> 00:26:11,809
I guess Sikhism does allow caps.

713
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:14,039
Is this original?

714
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,580
- Copy.
- Copy.

715
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,709
Immigration?

716
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,519
- "Immigration?"
- "Immigration?"

717
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,350
- "Immigration?"
- It's "imitation."

718
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:22,749
They are similar. It gets confusing.

719
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:25,019
No, thank you.

720
00:26:25,019 --> 00:26:26,890
- I can't buy a fake one.
- It's fake?

721
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:30,489
- You're quite picky.
- I have my pride.

722
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,100
I can't buy a fake.

723
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,299
There are caps here.

724
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,499
Green?

725
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:38,440
You look good in caps.

726
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,969
- Thank you.
- Hats suit you well.

727
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,269
(Slipping)

728
00:26:43,069 --> 00:26:44,880
- You look good it in.
- He looks young.

729
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,910
- He looks good in everything.
- It keeps me from the sun.

730
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,979
It's perfect.

731
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,809
Hello.

732
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,350
Sorry.

733
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,620
There's a bar to keep cars out.

734
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:56,019
So cars can only pass by
from this point on.

735
00:26:56,019 --> 00:26:57,049
(Cars can pass by from this point on.)

736
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,789
So they started touting.

737
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:01,319
- So that's why they're all coming.
- Yes.

738
00:27:01,489 --> 00:27:02,989
Sorry.

739
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:05,360
- What is it?
- Okay, bye.

740
00:27:05,759 --> 00:27:07,499
(Pani Bottle to the rescue.)

741
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,100
- Are you a taxi driver?
- Wagah Border.

742
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,170
- Wagah Border?
- Wagah Border.

743
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:12,640
We have AC.

744
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,400
- AC?
- Yes.

745
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,569
- How much is it? To and from.
- It's 2,000.

746
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,539
- It's 2,000.
- Yes.

747
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:20,209
It's a double rate?

748
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,410
- Double rate.
- Okay.

749
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,380
- Then it's not too bad.
- Yes?

750
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,319
Because we need to wait,
so it's not that bad.

751
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,219
- Okay.
- Okay.

752
00:27:28,219 --> 00:27:30,749
It's because if we go,

753
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,660
- the driver will wait until we're done...
- Yes.

754
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,160
and bring us back.

755
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,700
I heard that it was about 1,200 rupees
for a 1-way ride.

756
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,130
- It wasn't bad for a round-trip.
- Yes.

757
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,900
- You can ride in the front.
- Thank you.

758
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,670
- Thank you.
- Gosh, it's hot.

759
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,400
- Sorry, this is the driver's seat.
- He has a side-view mirror.

760
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,900
He does.

761
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,009
Side-view mirror, how dare you?

762
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,680
Great.

763
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,809
(They dare to ride a taxi
with a side-view mirror.)

764
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,880
Let's go.

765
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,779
(They set off for the Wagah Border.)

766
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,489
It feels comfortable.

767
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:04,450
Yes, and we couldn't hear
much honking here.

768
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,660
No, we didn't.

769
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:08,059
What was the name
of the neighborhood, again?

770
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,430
"Hanatsar."

771
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:11,700
Was it "Hanatsar?"

772
00:28:12,229 --> 00:28:13,759
- What?
- "Hanatsar."

773
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,430
- What do you mean?
- This place.

774
00:28:15,499 --> 00:28:16,569
Are you okay?

775
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,340
- Amritsar.
- "Amritsar?"

776
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,870
Amritsar.

777
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:23,110
Amri... Front teeth.

778
00:28:23,509 --> 00:28:26,080
Front teeth and tsar. Amritsar.

779
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:28,350
- Amritsar.
- You're trying to memorize it?

780
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,350
(An amazing way to memorize)

781
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:31,249
How did you memorize "Mumbai?"

782
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:33,350
With Mumbai...

783
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:34,749
I thought of BLACKPINK.

784
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,719
<i>Boombayah</i>

785
00:28:36,719 --> 00:28:37,950
"BOOMBAYAH?"

786
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,090
- By the song?
- Yes.

787
00:28:40,489 --> 00:28:42,660
I memorized Mumbai with BLACKPINK.

788
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,759
With Varanasi...

789
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:45,799
- It's similar to "wish."
- Varanasi?

790
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,529
- You wish for something. It's Varanasi.
- That's even harder.

791
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,799
(Connect it to similar words
when you need to memorize!)

792
00:28:50,069 --> 00:28:51,299
What about the Wagah Border?

793
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,069
I still haven't memorized that one.

794
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,269
(His memory is full.)

795
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,569
I still haven't gotten that one.

796
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,870
That's what I remember.

797
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,440
It's okay, even if you don't know.

798
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:02,309
"Hanatsar" does sound pretty.

799
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,110
Wagah Border.

800
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:06,519
I only saw it on Instagram.

801
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,489
It went viral through short-form videos.

802
00:29:08,489 --> 00:29:09,620
Yes, that's right.

803
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,719
With the high kicks.

804
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:14,319
Amritsar is a big city by the border,

805
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:16,160
and in Pakistan,

806
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,259
there is a big city called "Lahore."

807
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:20,259
Yes?

808
00:29:20,259 --> 00:29:21,499
It's much bigger than Amritsar.

809
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:23,200
- The border will be by there.
- By that place?

810
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,229
Somewhere around there.

811
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,940
The border between India's Amritsar
and Pakistan's Lahore...

812
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,640
is the Wagah Border.

813
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,809
In August 1947, when India and Pakistan...

814
00:29:33,809 --> 00:29:36,180
declared their independence
from being a British colony,

815
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,620
they were divided into two countries
due to religious reasons.

816
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,190
The two countries are
still in strained relations,

817
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:45,289
but they hold a daily flag ceremony
at the border...

818
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:47,420
in order to stress peace and harmony.

819
00:29:47,759 --> 00:29:49,529
More than 15,000 people visit the place...

820
00:29:49,529 --> 00:29:53,459
in order to see
the festive event every day.

821
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:54,799
(People from all over the country
come to see the event.)

822
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,130
There are so many people.

823
00:29:56,370 --> 00:29:58,130
- Gosh, this is...
- The Wagah Border.

824
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,870
Have you been to Pakistan as well?

825
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,809
I haven't. I'm planning to.

826
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,840
They used to be one country.

827
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,340
I know. I heard they parted
due to religious reasons.

828
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:10,150
India is mostly Hindu,

829
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,620
- Yes.
- and Pakistan is Islamic.

830
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,920
Sir...

831
00:30:13,249 --> 00:30:15,549
How far is the Wagah Border from here?

832
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,920
- I don't think he speaks English.
- He doesn't speak English.

833
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:22,360
(Unable to communicate)

834
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,430
Well... I guess we'll arrive before 5 p.m.

835
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,029
- I think it will be enough.
- Yes.

836
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,600
It's easier to think that...

837
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,600
it will work out in the end.

838
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,670
- Indian time.
- Indian time.

839
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,069
I'm sure it will work out.

840
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,610
Those plums look good.

841
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:38,440
I love plums.

842
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,610
Hey...

843
00:30:40,509 --> 00:30:42,209
- Can we...
- We need to try the mangoes.

844
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:43,749
Indian mangoes are so good.

845
00:30:43,749 --> 00:30:44,950
I want apple mangoes.

846
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,519
I'm not sure if they have any.

847
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,289
There were apple mangoes in Bolivia.

848
00:30:49,989 --> 00:30:51,350
(Bite)

849
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,890
Mango ribs.

850
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,120
(The apple-mango-fan enjoyed eating them.)

851
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,830
We didn't eat any fruits here.

852
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,830
- Let's start having fruits.
- Yes.

853
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,959
The fruit is really cheap and good here.

854
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:02,569
Let's do that tonight.

855
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,299
Let's watch the ceremony, have dinner,

856
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:05,370
and then go out to buy fruit.

857
00:31:05,370 --> 00:31:06,539
- Fruit.
- Yes.

858
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,370
I think it's nice to make plans
as you go like this.

859
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,640
That's what I really want to do,
more than anything else.

860
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,410
I haven't had my vitamins here.

861
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,110
We're on a bigger road now.

862
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:18,880
It's quite far.

863
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:19,880
(The taxi starts to speed up.)

864
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,890
There's a big road up to the border.

865
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,719
A wider road.

866
00:31:25,459 --> 00:31:27,519
(The cool gate catches their eyes.)

867
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,390
It's a university.

868
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:31,229
(Amazed)

869
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:33,700
- Is it a university?
- It was really cool.

870
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,999
It looks so cool.

871
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:37,569
Yes.

872
00:31:37,569 --> 00:31:38,700
(It looks too holy for a university.)

873
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,269
It's Khalsa University,

874
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:43,739
a representative school in Amritsar.

875
00:31:44,709 --> 00:31:46,209
It's like the Hindi version of Hogwarts.

876
00:31:46,209 --> 00:31:47,809
It looks like a shrine.

877
00:31:47,809 --> 00:31:49,150
(It looks like a scene
in a fantasy movie.)

878
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:52,249
I want to try
Indian school cafeteria food.

879
00:31:52,249 --> 00:31:54,450
Eating cafeteria food at other schools
sounds like fun.

880
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,319
I want to try going there next time.

881
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,249
- Yes, you need to do that.
- Yes.

882
00:31:58,249 --> 00:31:59,420
(Kian84 keeps adding things
to his bucket list.)

883
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
(With the wish to eat cafeteria food...)

884
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,989
We're almost there.

885
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,729
(With the natural scenery,)

886
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,769
(as they ride down the road...)

887
00:32:09,769 --> 00:32:10,830
Gosh, that's cool.

888
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,269
It's nice.

889
00:32:13,269 --> 00:32:14,539
I liked this place.

890
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,309
- It's quiet and peaceful.
- Yes, this road.

891
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,940
It was nice.

892
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:22,279
(A quiet and secluded place)

893
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:23,950
We're here.

894
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,450
- This must be it.
- Yes.

895
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:29,650
The security was higher
when we got to the border.

896
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,620
(It feels like...)

897
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,160
You're right.

898
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,690
It makes you nervous.

899
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,890
(It feels like passing the Panmunjeom
in Korea.)

900
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:38,059
This is the border.

901
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,200
It looks like the soldiers
guarding the DMZ in Korea.

902
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,469
The soldiers here...

903
00:32:43,469 --> 00:32:46,069
are like the honor guards, right?

904
00:32:46,069 --> 00:32:47,640
- Yes.
- In Korea,

905
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,739
it would be like North
and South Korean soldiers...

906
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,809
having a dance battle at the Panmunjeom.

907
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:55,150
It's hard to imagine it in Korea.

908
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,549
I can't believe
I get to see this for myself.

909
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,779
There are more people.

910
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,489
(They see more tourists
in the parking lot.)

911
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:05,789
(They finally arrive at the Wagah Border.)

912
00:33:05,789 --> 00:33:08,120
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

913
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,529
Let's go.

914
00:33:10,529 --> 00:33:12,799
(They leave the parking lot
after getting their things.)

915
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,969
(Looking around)

916
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,769
Why are you looking around?

917
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:19,900
Did you see something?

918
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,069
I want to buy a cap...

919
00:33:22,069 --> 00:33:23,110
and it's...

920
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,509
It's like how they sell
souvenirs at theme parks.

921
00:33:25,509 --> 00:33:26,580
Yes.

922
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:28,549
Big size.

923
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:30,509
(How is this?)

924
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:31,950
- It looks good on you.
- It's nice.

925
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:33,779
Thank you.

926
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,489
(Many tourists came to see
the flag ceremony.)

927
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,959
Pani bottle.

928
00:33:39,959 --> 00:33:41,719
- Pani is a bottle.
- Pani is a bottle.

929
00:33:41,989 --> 00:33:44,590
- Should we buy some popcorn?
- Okay.

930
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,360
- They sell popcorn here?
- Yes.

931
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,700
Cool version?

932
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,729
- "Cool version?"
- They also sell snacks?

933
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:52,370
It's like how they sell popcorn
at movie theaters.

934
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:53,739
It really is a festival.

935
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,039
Okay.

936
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:57,709
Okay, let's go.

937
00:33:57,709 --> 00:33:59,279
Okay, let's go.

938
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:04,009
I heard this is like the DMZ of Korea.

939
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:08,379
Even India's conflict has...

940
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,120
a flavor of "Boom Shakalaka."

941
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,890
It's like a party.

942
00:34:14,160 --> 00:34:16,330
That's how they have the flag ceremony.

943
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:20,129
(They walk faster with excitement.)

944
00:34:20,299 --> 00:34:21,460
Wait for me.

945
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,569
(The younger ones also follow him in.)

946
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:27,669
The drills of Indian soldiers...

947
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:31,109
are kind of like dancing as well.

948
00:34:31,609 --> 00:34:33,410
I'll see for myself.

949
00:34:35,649 --> 00:34:37,009
- Gosh.
- There are so many people.

950
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:38,210
(Full)

951
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:40,279
(Welcome to Wagah Border.)

952
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:41,950
- It's enormous.
- Let's go!

953
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,689
The flag-hoisting ceremony is
an event of both countries' soldiers...

954
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:50,290
which has been held every day since 1959.

955
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,930
When the gates open,

956
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,799
the soldiers of both countries
show off their bravery...

957
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:58,469
with exaggerated actions.

958
00:34:58,469 --> 00:35:00,540
Once they exchange eye contact
and shake hands,

959
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,810
they lower the flag, ending the event.

960
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,339
Do people go there...

961
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:08,279
- just for that event,
- Yes.

962
00:35:08,279 --> 00:35:10,350
- with no other tourist sites?
- Yes, lots of people.

963
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,549
If you cross that line, it's Pakistan.

964
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,450
- Over there?
- It's Pakistan.

965
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:17,520
(Pakistan, India)

966
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:20,890
They really are different
since they are full of fun.

967
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:21,960
Yes.

968
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,730
They do this every day.

969
00:35:23,730 --> 00:35:24,890
(How amazing.)

970
00:35:26,129 --> 00:35:27,230
Gosh, look at that.

971
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:31,270
"India's first line of defense."

972
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,410
- "India's first line of defense."
- India's first line of defense.

973
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:37,770
(Gaining English knowledge.)

974
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:42,980
(Standing)

975
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:45,919
(Tapping)

976
00:35:45,919 --> 00:35:47,480
- What is it?
- Why?

977
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:48,620
(What is it?)

978
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,020
(Curious)

979
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,890
The kid behind me peed.

980
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,989
The little boy? Gosh.

981
00:35:56,629 --> 00:35:59,430
This boy behind Pani Bottle...

982
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,200
wet his pants.

983
00:36:02,669 --> 00:36:04,100
- Did it get on you?
- No, it didn't.

984
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,339
- That's fortunate.
- Fortunately.

985
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,399
(Sorry)

986
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,339
(They move to the side.)

987
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:14,009
I guess the public can join in.

988
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,450
(Waving)

989
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,149
In this dancing area,
only women and kids can enter.

990
00:36:20,149 --> 00:36:21,149
I see.

991
00:36:21,149 --> 00:36:23,689
(Excited)

992
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,689
It's a festival.

993
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,719
Look.

994
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,859
(Spotting something)

995
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,290
The cheerleader.

996
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,359
The cheerleader?

997
00:36:31,629 --> 00:36:33,700
It's kind of like a university festival.

998
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,430
He was like a recreation instructor.

999
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,739
Pakistan is amazing as well.

1000
00:36:41,239 --> 00:36:43,310
Look at them.

1001
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,839
(The audience and size may be small
compared to India,)

1002
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:50,509
(but they are also cheering hard.)

1003
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,089
(The Indian soldiers enter
with their gear.)

1004
00:36:57,419 --> 00:36:59,919
Okay. I love their gear.

1005
00:36:59,919 --> 00:37:02,060
He's excited to see the soldiers.

1006
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:03,830
"I love their gear."

1007
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,299
Their gear was...

1008
00:37:06,299 --> 00:37:07,700
(The Indian gear made
the ex-UDT fall in love.)

1009
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,870
(The grand sounds fill the stadium.)

1010
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:13,870
(Looking around)

1011
00:37:14,669 --> 00:37:16,439
(Exclaiming)

1012
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,939
The drill.

1013
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:23,080
(With enthusiastic cheers,)

1014
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,950
(they make a strong appearance.)

1015
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,149
That was cool.

1016
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,790
(Let's try.)

1017
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:33,759
(Shouting)

1018
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,230
It's starting now.

1019
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,529
(They announce the beginning
of the ceremony...)

1020
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,500
(with the long sound.)

1021
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:46,299
(What is this?)

1022
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:52,279
(The Lee Seung Chul of the Wagah Border)

1023
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,910
His lung capacity is amazing.

1024
00:37:57,750 --> 00:37:59,219
(Gosh)

1025
00:37:59,219 --> 00:38:01,919
He could probably hold his breath
for five minutes.

1026
00:38:02,649 --> 00:38:04,149
(The long shout ends,)

1027
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,560
(and the ceremony begins.)

1028
00:38:05,859 --> 00:38:07,290
Yes, let's go!

1029
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:10,259
Let's go.

1030
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:11,290
(Things are getting heated.)

1031
00:38:13,129 --> 00:38:15,100
(Cheering)

1032
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,230
Look at that kid.

1033
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,029
(I'm excited.)

1034
00:38:18,899 --> 00:38:20,569
(They enter with the beat.)

1035
00:38:20,899 --> 00:38:22,370
(Just then!)

1036
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,469
What is that?

1037
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:27,339
(The crowd is cheering.)

1038
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,980
With that man,

1039
00:38:29,210 --> 00:38:30,779
it's forestallment.

1040
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,180
(This is forestallment.)

1041
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,319
(But if you're curious about this man...)

1042
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:39,219
Kian84 is all about forestallment.
He is Forestallment84.

1043
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:40,259
"Forestallment84?"

1044
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:42,689
(He is the best at conquering the mood.)

1045
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,660
(Screaming)

1046
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,160
(Bollywood84 is back!)

1047
00:38:47,399 --> 00:38:49,629
(The youngest joins him.)

1048
00:38:50,129 --> 00:38:51,569
(Make some noise!)

1049
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,140
- Yes!
- Gosh, that must be fun.

1050
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,669
(As if they are citizens of India,)

1051
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:59,210
(they intimidate the people of Pakistan.)

1052
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,680
I started to get heated up
without realizing it.

1053
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,250
It was exciting for some reason.

1054
00:39:06,049 --> 00:39:09,689
I was immersed in mob psychology.

1055
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:13,390
It felt like it was a festival.

1056
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:16,730
I had the most fun at the ceremony
during my entire trip to India.

1057
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,160
(Getting too heated)

1058
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,660
- Yes!
- The energy on this side is crazy.

1059
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,969
(The honorable intimidation is over.)

1060
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,910
(The soldiers enter.)

1061
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,580
What's going on?

1062
00:39:33,779 --> 00:39:35,310
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1063
00:39:37,549 --> 00:39:39,180
(The loud scream signals the start
of the ceremony.)

1064
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,850
- Yes!
- Yes!

1065
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,189
Hindustan!

1066
00:39:42,189 --> 00:39:43,489
- Hindustan!
- Hindustan!

1067
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,020
(One more time!)

1068
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,819
- Hindustan!
- Do you know what it means?

1069
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,089
- Hindustan!
- Hindustan!

1070
00:39:49,089 --> 00:39:52,259
Hindustan means the land of Hindus.

1071
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,969
(Although they don't know the meaning,
they cheer as if they're people of India.)

1072
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,439
(They begin to march
as the crowd cheers for them.)

1073
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,270
(The soldiers from India march
with sharp movements.)

1074
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,509
(And the gait of the soldiers
from Pakistan is controlled.)

1075
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:09,609
(The two countries battle it out
with their performances at the gate.)

1076
00:40:10,779 --> 00:40:13,450
(The soldiers from India perform first.)

1077
00:40:13,649 --> 00:40:14,950
(Stomping)

1078
00:40:16,589 --> 00:40:18,350
(Stomping toward them)

1079
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:20,660
(Stomping back)

1080
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,890
(He takes big strides to get closer.)

1081
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,830
I think their military rules are
a bit different from ours.

1082
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,230
- Their movements are fancier and bigger.
- Right.

1083
00:40:30,169 --> 00:40:31,230
(The soldiers face one another
at the gate.)

1084
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,569
I think they're trying
to show their strength.

1085
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,540
(This scene impresses everyone.)

1086
00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:42,310
- It's open.
- It's open.

1087
00:40:42,779 --> 00:40:44,310
- It's open.
- Gosh, amazing.

1088
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,450
(Opening)

1089
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,750
Gosh, it's open.

1090
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:50,919
- Yes!
- Hey, let's get up.

1091
00:40:50,919 --> 00:40:51,950
(Getting up)

1092
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,989
Everyone stood up when the gate opened.

1093
00:40:57,730 --> 00:41:00,759
(Two countries finally face one another
without any obstacle in the middle.)

1094
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:02,830
It really feels like a show.

1095
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,669
- The last part was cool.
- Gosh.

1096
00:41:06,799 --> 00:41:09,569
(The performance to intimidate
each other continues.)

1097
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:11,239
- Gosh. He's trying to intimate them.
- He did it.

1098
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,839
(Amazed)

1099
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:15,980
(Copying)

1100
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,009
This is cool.

1101
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,180
(Energetic kicks)

1102
00:41:21,549 --> 00:41:22,549
(Stomping)

1103
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:24,450
That's not good for his knees.

1104
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,390
I wonder why they keep kicking.

1105
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,989
They're showing how strong they are
through their kicks.

1106
00:41:28,989 --> 00:41:30,529
(Appealing to their strength by kicking)

1107
00:41:31,529 --> 00:41:33,430
(They strike the ending pose
while facing each other.)

1108
00:41:33,799 --> 00:41:35,930
- They did the same pose.
- Yes.

1109
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:39,040
- In the movie "Joint Security Area,"
- Yes.

1110
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,500
the soldiers from both countries
are close.

1111
00:41:40,669 --> 00:41:42,969
- It might be similar for them.
- Definitely.

1112
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:43,969
(They showed good teamwork
during the performance.)

1113
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,140
"Joint Drills Area."

1114
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,080
"Joint Drills Area."

1115
00:41:48,379 --> 00:41:49,810
- Gosh, they're starting.
- Goodness.

1116
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,109
That's the finale.

1117
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:53,549
(The descending flags signal the finale.)

1118
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:54,779
They're bringing the flags down.

1119
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,390
(Before they lower the flags,)

1120
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:59,390
(everyone gets up.)

1121
00:42:00,589 --> 00:42:04,160
(They salute in front of the flags
to show their respect.)

1122
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,330
- I guess this is how they salute.
- Yes.

1123
00:42:06,330 --> 00:42:07,660
- They show their palms.
- Yes.

1124
00:42:10,029 --> 00:42:11,299
They are coming down.

1125
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,640
They are coming down.

1126
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:16,169
Gosh. The flags make an X
as they come down.

1127
00:42:17,969 --> 00:42:19,509
(They bring down the flags
at the same speed.)

1128
00:42:19,509 --> 00:42:20,739
That's...

1129
00:42:20,739 --> 00:42:21,779
(They bring down the flags
at the same speed.)

1130
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:23,580
(The ceremony comes to an end.)

1131
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,149
This is quite meaningful.

1132
00:42:25,149 --> 00:42:26,480
(The ceremony comes to an end.)

1133
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:31,589
(Feeling emotional)

1134
00:42:31,989 --> 00:42:33,560
How did it feel to watch it in person?

1135
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,830
We got emotional
just by watching this clip.

1136
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:39,299
Actually, there was so much passion
you couldn't feel through the clip.

1137
00:42:39,299 --> 00:42:41,259
There was that crazy atmosphere
of a festival.

1138
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:43,169
And it was a festival.

1139
00:42:43,169 --> 00:42:45,000
- Right.
- Yes.

1140
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:52,439
(The soldiers carefully fold the flag
and turn back.)

1141
00:42:54,609 --> 00:42:56,109
(After a cool handshake...)

1142
00:42:56,109 --> 00:42:57,779
They shook hands.

1143
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,350
- Gosh.
- The flags went down.

1144
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:02,850
(the gates from both countries
are closed again.)

1145
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:07,589
There was a hint of nervousness
during the ceremony.

1146
00:43:07,989 --> 00:43:11,230
But there was some kind of cheerfulness
I couldn't put my finger on. I liked it.

1147
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,560
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

1148
00:43:16,129 --> 00:43:17,299
There are so many people.

1149
00:43:17,299 --> 00:43:19,669
(Wagah Border was
a special border region.)

1150
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:21,870
Let's go.

1151
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:24,270
Hindustan! Wonder!

1152
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:27,379
Guys, I'm having so much fun.

1153
00:43:27,379 --> 00:43:29,810
- Traveling in India is so much fun.
- Are you?

1154
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:30,950
How long has it been?

1155
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:32,180
- How long has it been since what?
- Since you came to India.

1156
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,149
- About seven days.
- It's been about seven days.

1157
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:38,089
The atmospheres of the cities
are completely different.

1158
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:39,859
- India...
- This is fascinating.

1159
00:43:39,859 --> 00:43:41,759
is such a diverse country,
and there's so much to see.

1160
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:44,960
Each city feels like a different country.

1161
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,799
- India...
- Yes. It feels like a different country.

1162
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:48,399
- I totally agree with that.
- Yes.

1163
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,969
Wagah Border and Varanasi
are indeed very different.

1164
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,469
- Amritsar is so different too.
- Yes.

1165
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:57,370
(There was a different charm
in Wagah Border too.)

1166
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:59,739
Traveling in India for two weeks...

1167
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:02,109
is only seeing 0.1 percent of India.

1168
00:44:02,879 --> 00:44:05,080
India is a popular destination
for travelers.

1169
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:07,919
(It's a destination with endless sights
that will fill travelers' bucket lists.)

1170
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,589
(Glancing)

1171
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:12,819
I'm starting to see the fruit stands
one at a time.

1172
00:44:13,689 --> 00:44:15,419
- You must buy fruit.
- Right.

1173
00:44:15,419 --> 00:44:16,790
- You decided to buy fruit.
- Right.

1174
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:19,299
Should we get out on our way to the hotel
and buy some fruit?

1175
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,359
- Sure.
- Let's talk to the driver.

1176
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,529
Sir.

1177
00:44:23,100 --> 00:44:26,500
Fruits. Bananas and mangos. Stop. Okay?

1178
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:27,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

1179
00:44:27,870 --> 00:44:29,069
- He understood that.
- Yes.

1180
00:44:29,069 --> 00:44:30,410
You only used simple English on purpose.

1181
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:31,710
- Right. I just had to...
- So he could understand you.

1182
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:33,040
- He made it easy for the driver.
- Yes.

1183
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:37,879
(He makes a U-turn to go to a fruit shop.)

1184
00:44:38,210 --> 00:44:40,620
The bus keeps trying to turn toward us.

1185
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,379
In my opinion, if you don't do that,

1186
00:44:42,379 --> 00:44:44,450
other drivers won't yield.
That's why they do that.

1187
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:46,390
(Crashing)

1188
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,460
They're just...

1189
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,529
(The younger ones are so shocked
that they freeze.)

1190
00:44:53,629 --> 00:44:54,759
Gosh, that scared me.

1191
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,129
- Okay. I'm okay.
- You okay?

1192
00:44:57,669 --> 00:45:00,370
- It's okay?
- He bumped into that thing.

1193
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,469
(He was making a U-turn
after letting the bus go first.)

1194
00:45:03,669 --> 00:45:05,109
(Crashing into the median strip)

1195
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:06,739
- I see.
- He bumped into the median strip.

1196
00:45:06,739 --> 00:45:09,680
He crashed into the guardrail,
so it wasn't so serious.

1197
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,109
No one got hurt.

1198
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:14,250
- It's okay? Are you okay?
- Is the car okay? Gosh. What?

1199
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:15,520
- I'm okay.
- Are you okay?

1200
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,890
So this happened.

1201
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,890
He bumped into the guardrail.

1202
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,660
- He crashed into a paving stone.
- A paving stone.

1203
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,859
(The taxi is on top of the paving stone.)

1204
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:27,960
- We should lift it.
- Gosh.

1205
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,830
Should we lift it?

1206
00:45:30,529 --> 00:45:32,029
It's better if he can drive it in reverse.

1207
00:45:34,839 --> 00:45:37,210
(To make things worse,
the road is getting congested.)

1208
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,040
The road got congested,
so that was a problem.

1209
00:45:41,410 --> 00:45:44,180
(He gets into the car to move it.)

1210
00:45:45,649 --> 00:45:47,779
Dex, there are cars coming. Be careful.

1211
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,219
(The oldest looks out
for the youngest's safety.)

1212
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:52,989
Watch out for the cars.

1213
00:45:52,989 --> 00:45:54,759
(Spinning)

1214
00:45:54,759 --> 00:45:56,189
- It's not working?
- You should lift it together.

1215
00:45:56,189 --> 00:45:57,390
- Right. You should push it together.
- Yes.

1216
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,930
We had to lift the front wheel.

1217
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,930
It won't work.

1218
00:46:02,600 --> 00:46:03,799
- We can't push it back.
- Push it back?

1219
00:46:03,799 --> 00:46:06,000
- It won't work.
- Can't we do this?

1220
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,839
(Honking)

1221
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:11,770
(Honking)

1222
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:13,710
We can lift it and push it back.

1223
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:16,049
Gosh. You guys were in a tight spot.

1224
00:46:16,049 --> 00:46:18,379
- You can't do anything there.
- Gosh.

1225
00:46:18,379 --> 00:46:19,379
(Let us pass through.)

1226
00:46:19,719 --> 00:46:23,689
(Frustrated)

1227
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,960
There were a lot of cars, to begin with
because it was around dinnertime.

1228
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,960
- Right.
- Cars started to pile up there.

1229
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,989
Yes. The road started to get congested.

1230
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:32,759
(They are tied up there.)

1231
00:46:32,759 --> 00:46:36,000
You know, I saw it.
But I thought I was wrong.

1232
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:40,100
(A local guy suddenly shows up
out of the blue.)

1233
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,870
(Another local guy)

1234
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:48,009
People from all over the place
started to come to help out.

1235
00:46:48,009 --> 00:46:49,549
Gosh, it won't be easy to pull it out.

1236
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:51,210
If this is a front-wheel drive car,
it would come out.

1237
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,410
- But it's a rear-wheel drive car.
- Yes.

1238
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,020
(People showed up from all over.)

1239
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,189
Everyone there is a chef. Everyone cleans.

1240
00:46:58,319 --> 00:46:59,960
Everyone there works
at a car insurance company.

1241
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:02,989
- People are starting to come.
- I'm grateful they all came to help.

1242
00:47:05,029 --> 00:47:08,430
(As he gestures to lift the car,)

1243
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:09,529
Let's lift it.

1244
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:11,270
(the second-oldest
gets into position right away.)

1245
00:47:11,330 --> 00:47:13,040
No. Let's lift it like this.

1246
00:47:13,299 --> 00:47:15,239
(And...)

1247
00:47:15,770 --> 00:47:16,810
(the local guys get into position
to help.)

1248
00:47:16,810 --> 00:47:19,210
- Everyone came to help.
- That's so reassuring.

1249
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,580
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1250
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:24,879
(They all join hands to lift
and move the car.)

1251
00:47:24,879 --> 00:47:26,719
Gosh, humanity at its finest.

1252
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,879
You guys did it.

1253
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,350
Be careful.

1254
00:47:30,350 --> 00:47:32,589
(Meanwhile, the oldest...)

1255
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,819
Wait.

1256
00:47:38,529 --> 00:47:39,629
Come.

1257
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,460
- "Come."
- "Come."

1258
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,830
That's universal in any language.

1259
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:45,700
(Sorting out the traffic
with the universal word)

1260
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:48,540
Slowly.

1261
00:47:49,739 --> 00:47:51,210
Slowly.

1262
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:59,380
(It was when he was traveling
in South America.)

1263
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,010
This three-way intersection...

1264
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,479
(He experienced the worst traffic jam
in Bolivia.)

1265
00:48:03,479 --> 00:48:04,780
- Gosh.
- That was the worst.

1266
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:06,490
Goodness. What is this?

1267
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:10,289
(That's how he added one more activity
to the bucket list.)

1268
00:48:10,919 --> 00:48:12,930
(Sorting out the traffic jam)

1269
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:15,829
(The oldest wanted
to sort out traffic jams.)

1270
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,729
(He achieved his dream
of sorting out traffic jams in India.)

1271
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,169
(The second-oldest
who wanted to go with him...)

1272
00:48:23,240 --> 00:48:27,110
(is here too.)

1273
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,079
(Dreams come true.)

1274
00:48:31,380 --> 00:48:32,749
"Dreams come true."

1275
00:48:32,749 --> 00:48:34,050
(Dreams come true in India.)

1276
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,579
You got to do an activity
on your bucket list.

1277
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,950
- Gosh.
- You did it.

1278
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,519
- At last. You finally did it.
- You got to do it in India.

1279
00:48:39,519 --> 00:48:41,650
- In 1, 2, 3.
- In 1, 2, 3.

1280
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:44,889
(They all joined hands
and pulled out the taxi.)

1281
00:48:44,889 --> 00:48:45,889
Gosh.

1282
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:49,599
(The taxi gets going first to prevent
any secondary accidents.)

1283
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:51,559
- That was a true local experience.
- Wait.

1284
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,700
(Luckily, it was resolved
without any further accidents.)

1285
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:58,300
- Let's go.
- Okay. Watch out for the cars.

1286
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:00,809
When the accident happened,

1287
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:03,479
in Korea, the worker
from the insurance company...

1288
00:49:03,539 --> 00:49:04,709
would have gotten to the scene fast.

1289
00:49:04,709 --> 00:49:07,510
But interestingly, in India,
people started to show up out of the blue.

1290
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:10,720
And they all helped out to sort out
the traffic and other cars.

1291
00:49:10,979 --> 00:49:13,519
It was really nice to see that.

1292
00:49:13,889 --> 00:49:16,419
India is a country with a human touch.

1293
00:49:16,919 --> 00:49:19,229
It was the India I knew of.
So it was really nice.

1294
00:49:19,959 --> 00:49:22,999
Earlier, you diligently washed the dishes.

1295
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:24,660
And you volunteered and did a good deed.

1296
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:25,700
- The deity helped him.
- Yes.

1297
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:29,369
"Kian84, go ahead, and I'll let you do
what you want to do." Like that.

1298
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:31,070
"I'll let you sort out the traffic jam."

1299
00:49:31,970 --> 00:49:33,939
I'm not sure if that's a good thing.

1300
00:49:34,209 --> 00:49:36,410
- The entire world is on your side.
- Seriously. Good for you.

1301
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,079
- Everything works out for him.
- Everything does.

1302
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:39,209
(Sorting out the traffic jam by accident)

1303
00:49:39,650 --> 00:49:43,479
(It's peaceful on the road again.)

1304
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,490
- It's okay?
- Okay. Yes.

1305
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:46,689
- Okay.
- Okay.

1306
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:49,160
Good.

1307
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,459
Was the car okay?

1308
00:49:50,459 --> 00:49:52,660
There wasn't a major problem
other than the few scratches.

1309
00:49:52,660 --> 00:49:53,889
- That's a relief.
- That's a relief.

1310
00:49:53,889 --> 00:49:55,229
Let's buy some fruit first.

1311
00:49:55,229 --> 00:49:56,829
(They'll use that chance
to buy some fruit.)

1312
00:49:57,059 --> 00:49:58,260
- Right now?
- By the way,

1313
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,229
we ended up buying fruit.

1314
00:50:00,999 --> 00:50:02,570
- Let's buy 1kg of this.
- Gosh.

1315
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,099
- Yes, 1kg.
- Okay.

1316
00:50:05,099 --> 00:50:08,110
- What is this?
- How much?

1317
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:10,139
- What is it? What surprised them?
- What is it?

1318
00:50:10,139 --> 00:50:11,139
They're getting surprised left and right.

1319
00:50:11,139 --> 00:50:12,410
- What is this?
- How much?

1320
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,550
An elephant!

1321
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:14,979
- What?
- What?

1322
00:50:14,979 --> 00:50:17,349
(Hello.)

1323
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:19,019
- It's an elephant.
- What?

1324
00:50:20,619 --> 00:50:23,189
This is a true story. It really happened.

1325
00:50:23,189 --> 00:50:25,459
- What's an elephant doing there?
- I thought it was computer graphics.

1326
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:28,959
(Suddenly facing an elephant
who was passing by)

1327
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:30,700
(Puzzled)

1328
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:31,829
- Gosh, that...
- Look!

1329
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:33,169
Gosh.

1330
00:50:34,729 --> 00:50:35,939
This is crazy.

1331
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,499
- What's this?
- This is crazy.

1332
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:42,809
- I can't believe this. It's huge.
- That's cute.

1333
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:44,209
(Big and cute)

1334
00:50:44,209 --> 00:50:46,410
Try it.

1335
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:50,849
(Chuckling)

1336
00:50:52,919 --> 00:50:54,150
This is a greeting.

1337
00:50:54,450 --> 00:50:56,119
- He's letting you touch the elephant.
- Gosh.

1338
00:50:56,119 --> 00:50:58,720
(The younger ones are having a blast,
but the oldest is nowhere to be seen.)

1339
00:50:59,459 --> 00:51:01,459
What a day we're having.

1340
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,099
If I were to tell people
what happened today,

1341
00:51:05,099 --> 00:51:07,400
I'm not sure if they would believe me.

1342
00:51:07,829 --> 00:51:10,639
We had a meal at the temple
and did the dishes.

1343
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:11,999
And we did all sorts of things.

1344
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:13,840
We watched the festival.

1345
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:17,979
We were making a U-turn
in front of the fruit shop.

1346
00:51:17,979 --> 00:51:21,180
The moment the taxi turned,
it bumped into something. It crashed.

1347
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:24,720
While getting the car out,

1348
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,849
we saw the fruit shop
and went there to buy fruit.

1349
00:51:27,849 --> 00:51:29,689
And an elephant was walking toward us.

1350
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,130
It's unpredictable.
India is unpredictable.

1351
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:35,430
That day felt like a weird dream.

1352
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:37,559
Come to think of it,
if it weren't for the accident,

1353
00:51:37,559 --> 00:51:39,130
- you wouldn't have met the elephant.
- Right.

1354
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,030
Yes. The timing would have been off.

1355
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:42,639
Gosh. The deity of variety shows...

1356
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,200
- It's on our side.
- is helping you out.

1357
00:51:44,599 --> 00:51:47,240
(Kian84, do whatever you want to do.)

1358
00:51:48,539 --> 00:51:51,380
(Hello.)

1359
00:51:52,610 --> 00:51:53,610
(Touching)

1360
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,680
It was my first time seeing
an elephant that close.

1361
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:57,919
So cute.

1362
00:51:58,050 --> 00:52:00,689
I'll pay for the bananas.

1363
00:52:00,689 --> 00:52:02,220
You should give some bananas
to the elephant as a present.

1364
00:52:02,220 --> 00:52:03,320
(The second-oldest is excited
and buys bananas.)

1365
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:07,189
(Munching)

1366
00:52:08,229 --> 00:52:09,329
Bananas.

1367
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,200
(The youngest gives the elephant
some bananas too.)

1368
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,329
This is a gentle one.

1369
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:14,829
(Giggling)

1370
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:18,099
(While the elephant is taking care of
the youngest...)

1371
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:20,740
Gosh, this is scary.

1372
00:52:21,610 --> 00:52:23,579
- Was it scary?
- Elephants are the most powerful animals.

1373
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,910
- It was really big in person.
- It was huge, indeed.

1374
00:52:27,309 --> 00:52:28,749
By the way, it's a beautiful elephant.

1375
00:52:33,189 --> 00:52:36,919
(Approaching)

1376
00:52:38,019 --> 00:52:40,260
This... How much is a bundle?

1377
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:43,400
"A bundle."

1378
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:45,160
It's 100 rupees.

1379
00:52:45,459 --> 00:52:47,200
One hundred?

1380
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:49,269
Okay.

1381
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:50,769
- It's cheap.
- That one is slightly more expensive.

1382
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:52,939
You're big, so have this in one go.

1383
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:57,639
(Eating the whole bundle...)

1384
00:52:57,639 --> 00:52:59,050
- Gosh.
- It ate them in one go.

1385
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,910
(in one bite)

1386
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:02,380
This is a greedy one.

1387
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,349
This bundle of bananas
will hardly be enough for the elephant.

1388
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:09,590
(Give me more.)

1389
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:10,820
(Glancing)

1390
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:13,289
- How much?
- It's 100.

1391
00:53:13,289 --> 00:53:14,360
One hundred?

1392
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:16,160
He started to spend money like water.

1393
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,729
And the fruit there was really cheap.

1394
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:19,900
- Was it cheap?
- How much was the bundle?

1395
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:21,300
- It was 1.6 dollars.
- It was 1.6 dollars?

1396
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,340
That's not bad.

1397
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:25,099
(Munching)

1398
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:26,939
How much is the watermelon?

1399
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:28,139
It's 100 rupees for 2.

1400
00:53:28,139 --> 00:53:29,680
It's 100 rupees for 2? Yes.

1401
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,280
Then for one of them...

1402
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,450
Wait.

1403
00:53:34,010 --> 00:53:35,150
This one is a watermelon.

1404
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:36,450
(Feeding the elephant again)

1405
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,550
(Eating it in one bite)

1406
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,990
You went to buy fruit for yourselves.
Why did you keep feeding the elephant?

1407
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,459
When you go to the sheep ranch,

1408
00:53:44,459 --> 00:53:46,059
- you can feed them.
- Right.

1409
00:53:46,059 --> 00:53:48,360
Multiply the excitement you get there
by ten.

1410
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,559
I can see that.

1411
00:53:49,829 --> 00:53:51,400
- The elephant keeps asking for more.
- Gosh, so cute.

1412
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,700
It keeps touching him with its trunk.

1413
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,700
I was going to eat one.
But you can eat it.

1414
00:53:56,599 --> 00:53:58,340
- It ate a lot.
- It's eating a lot, indeed.

1415
00:53:58,340 --> 00:54:00,510
- But the elephant is cute.
- It's cute.

1416
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:04,209
(Carefully approaching)

1417
00:54:05,439 --> 00:54:08,950
(Patting)

1418
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:12,689
- The elephant likes that.
- So adorable.

1419
00:54:13,249 --> 00:54:14,419
So cute.

1420
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,059
We should buy some for us now.

1421
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,959
Let's buy 1kg of apple mangoes.

1422
00:54:18,959 --> 00:54:20,490
- That's all I want.
- I don't think that will be enough.

1423
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,789
- Let's buy 2kg.
- Let's do that.

1424
00:54:21,789 --> 00:54:23,499
- Apple mangoes, 2kg.
- Give us 2kg.

1425
00:54:23,499 --> 00:54:25,160
And 2kg of this too.

1426
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,130
(They also buy plums
which the youngest likes.)

1427
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,200
And this...

1428
00:54:31,240 --> 00:54:32,709
These are for us.

1429
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:35,709
He understood Kian84.

1430
00:54:35,709 --> 00:54:38,010
This... My friend...

1431
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:39,749
Okay.

1432
00:54:40,809 --> 00:54:41,979
(And...)

1433
00:54:41,979 --> 00:54:43,479
I must've fed the elephant too much.
It keeps looking at me.

1434
00:54:44,019 --> 00:54:45,349
The elephant didn't go
because I fed it a lot.

1435
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:46,650
- One.
- One fifty.

1436
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:47,720
One fifty.

1437
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:49,519
Fifty.

1438
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:50,720
(The elephant keeps staring at his back
to no end.)

1439
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:52,260
- The elephant didn't leave,
- It's not moving.

1440
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:53,389
thinking the fruit was for the elephant.

1441
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,829
(Kian84.)

1442
00:54:56,059 --> 00:54:57,260
(Let's go now.)

1443
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:58,459
That's a kind elephant.

1444
00:54:58,459 --> 00:54:59,729
(The elephant is fixed in that spot.)

1445
00:54:59,729 --> 00:55:01,430
It's a really calm one.
It's staying still.

1446
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,139
It's a kind elephant. It didn't go
and eat it from the stalls.

1447
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:06,070
- Right.
- That's fascinating.

1448
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,110
(Fascinated)

1449
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:09,910
(Feeling sad)

1450
00:55:10,709 --> 00:55:12,110
(Glancing)

1451
00:55:14,209 --> 00:55:16,180
Whenever Kian84 sees elephants...

1452
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:18,320
or other animals wanting food,
he can't just walk away.

1453
00:55:18,320 --> 00:55:19,590
- It's because he's warmhearted.
- What? What's happening?

1454
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:22,519
(Give me more.)

1455
00:55:22,519 --> 00:55:23,959
Hey, I have to eat some too.

1456
00:55:23,959 --> 00:55:25,660
If I give you everything,
I have no fruit for myself.

1457
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,360
Kian84 is having a blast.
He keeps feeding the elephant.

1458
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,599
- What did he buy? Yes.
- He's still feeding the elephant?

1459
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:35,599
That's it. Finished.

1460
00:55:37,369 --> 00:55:39,340
No. Ask your dad to buy you fruit.

1461
00:55:41,110 --> 00:55:42,240
(Wiping)

1462
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,510
(Sniffing)

1463
00:55:43,979 --> 00:55:45,309
What is it? What's wrong?

1464
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:48,579
My hand is covered in snot
from the elephant

1465
00:55:48,579 --> 00:55:49,749
- Did it smell?
- It didn't smell.

1466
00:55:49,749 --> 00:55:50,950
- It didn't smell? That's good.
- No.

1467
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,789
Bye.

1468
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:54,590
Okay.

1469
00:55:54,590 --> 00:55:56,220
- Bye.
- Bye.

1470
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,820
Gosh. The elephant had a big meal.

1471
00:55:57,820 --> 00:55:59,559
The elephant is feeling great,
thanks to you, Kian84.

1472
00:55:59,559 --> 00:56:00,559
Right.

1473
00:56:02,229 --> 00:56:03,700
What a day we're having.

1474
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:06,229
- A lot of things happened today.
- How is this possible?

1475
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,400
- Sir, are you okay?
- Let's go.

1476
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,970
- You're okay?
- Okay.

1477
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:11,139
- Let's go home!
- Yes!

1478
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:12,840
Yes.

1479
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:16,039
Be careful when driving.

1480
00:56:16,610 --> 00:56:18,309
Okay. Let's go.

1481
00:56:19,039 --> 00:56:21,249
- The car is fine.
- Yes, the car's fine.

1482
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:22,919
- Hey, isn't that the elephant?
- Yes.

1483
00:56:22,919 --> 00:56:25,249
- Gosh. Wait.
- Its bottom is swaying when it walks.

1484
00:56:25,249 --> 00:56:26,789
The elephant is walking on the road.

1485
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,189
Where is the elephant going?

1486
00:56:28,189 --> 00:56:30,019
A lot of elephants attend weddings...

1487
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,619
or events in India.

1488
00:56:31,619 --> 00:56:34,430
That's why people often see
elephants on the road.

1489
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,300
- It's the same elephant.
- Be happy.

1490
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:39,630
My dear elephant.

1491
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:43,039
Now that I'm in India,
this is the most animals...

1492
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:44,769
I've seen in the past ten years.

1493
00:56:45,499 --> 00:56:47,570
(Dogs)

1494
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,780
(Horses)

1495
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:52,280
(Monkeys)

1496
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,079
(White cows)

1497
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:55,610
(Regular cows)

1498
00:56:55,610 --> 00:56:57,579
(Goats)

1499
00:56:57,919 --> 00:56:59,150
(And today, he saw an elephant.)

1500
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:01,090
Seeing an elephant was the best, though.

1501
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,119
I think I saw more animals here
than during my trip to the Amazon.

1502
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:05,220
Right.

1503
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:08,229
Gosh. The elephant was so cute.
So I ended up...

1504
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:10,300
spending 300 rupees on the elephant.

1505
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:13,200
But it didn't feel like a waste.
It was for a cute elephant.

1506
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:15,130
Giving it to the elephant wasn't a waste.

1507
00:57:15,369 --> 00:57:18,539
But it did eat that bunch of bananas
in one bite.

1508
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:21,539
It felt like the elephant
took a kickback from that fruit place.

1509
00:57:21,809 --> 00:57:24,180
The elephant did stop
in front of the fruit place.

1510
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:25,539
That's a possibility.

1511
00:57:26,809 --> 00:57:28,780
- The accident happened so quickly.
- Do you know what this is?

1512
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:31,150
- Isn't it a melon?
- This a melon?

1513
00:57:31,150 --> 00:57:32,180
Yes.

1514
00:57:32,180 --> 00:57:34,550
No. Wait.

1515
00:57:34,749 --> 00:57:36,689
- You should wash it first.
- Okay.

1516
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,059
Why do you always put things
into your mouth?

1517
00:57:38,919 --> 00:57:41,229
- Are you an elephant, Kian84?
- What?

1518
00:57:41,389 --> 00:57:42,860
But we're in India.

1519
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,559
You should wash it, just in case.

1520
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,570
I doubt agricultural chemicals
are used in India.

1521
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:48,030
That metaphor just now was on point.

1522
00:57:48,269 --> 00:57:49,369
I'm starving.

1523
00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:52,669
Come to think of it,
we didn't eat anything...

1524
00:57:52,669 --> 00:57:54,639
after that meal at the temple.

1525
00:57:54,709 --> 00:57:56,880
- You're right.
- I'm really hungry, Kian84.

1526
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,740
- I'm craving tandoori chicken.
- Right.

1527
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,079
- Yes.
- In Sikhism, pork can be...

1528
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,720
- Sikhism is quite merciful.
- Right.

1529
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,720
- What? Are we here?
- Okay.

1530
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,189
- So we're here.
- Thank you.

1531
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:08,220
(Arrived near their hotel)

1532
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,289
It's 2,000 rupees.

1533
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:11,590
- Bye.
- Okay.

1534
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,930
The driver worked all day...

1535
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,430
since he picked you guys up around noon.

1536
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,530
Yes.

1537
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:18,959
- Let's get a quick meal,
- Okay.

1538
00:58:18,959 --> 00:58:21,169
go to our rooms, take a shower, and rest.

1539
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:22,269
- Let's sleep after that.
- Okay.

1540
00:58:22,269 --> 00:58:24,970
- After we eat these fruits.
- We must eat our fruits.

1541
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:28,539
I don't think I ever bought
such an ample amount of fruit in Korea.

1542
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:31,380
From apple mangoes and plums
to watermelon,

1543
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,849
we chose a variety.

1544
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,510
- How much was this?
- It was 600 rupees.

1545
00:58:35,510 --> 00:58:37,019
- What?
- It was 600 rupees.

1546
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:39,349
This was a total of ten dollars?

1547
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:41,590
- If we bought this much in Korea,
- It would've been expensive.

1548
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:43,459
it would've cost us over 100 dollars.

1549
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:44,760
We bought it at a low price.

1550
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,959
Why are we eating
those good foods only now?

1551
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,030
I know, right?

1552
00:58:49,030 --> 00:58:51,499
The elephant bag is super short now.

1553
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,200
(It's stiflingly tight.)

1554
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,470
It came up to my armpit.

1555
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:56,240
The bag is coming up to his shoulder.

1556
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:58,869
Actually, as you can tell,

1557
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:00,470
the bag used to be this long.

1558
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,809
(The bag was quite long
when Kian84 gave it to him.)

1559
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,110
Yes, it was long at first.

1560
00:59:05,979 --> 00:59:08,209
- But the string kept coming off.
- Gosh.

1561
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:12,119
(Despite the string getting shorter,)

1562
00:59:12,749 --> 00:59:15,650
(Dex treasured it throughout the trip.)

1563
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,419
(He feels extremely bad.)

1564
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:23,059
(Kian84 promised to buy a bag
at a department store.)

1565
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,900
So I bought a bag.

1566
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:27,499
- Did you buy him another elephant bag?
- Really?

1567
00:59:27,499 --> 00:59:28,930
- What?
- Where did you buy it?

1568
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,499
- Really? Seriously?
- What's this?

1569
00:59:31,499 --> 00:59:33,570
It wasn't sponsored.
I bought it with my own money.

1570
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:35,669
(Really, how touching.)

1571
00:59:35,669 --> 00:59:38,579
I'm really touched. For real?

1572
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:41,680
- Nice.
- I did say I liked khaki.

1573
00:59:41,680 --> 00:59:42,749
It suits you.

1574
00:59:42,749 --> 00:59:46,590
I will carry this even when I travel
on my YouTube channel.

1575
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:48,189
- There's no need.
- I promise.

1576
00:59:48,189 --> 00:59:49,459
- This is nice.
- Thank you.

1577
00:59:49,459 --> 00:59:52,189
I finally feel a bit at ease.

1578
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:53,660
(Laughing)

1579
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:55,630
Watching him carry it around
made me feel bad.

1580
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:57,459
- I'll gratefully use it well.
- Okay.

1581
00:59:58,099 --> 01:00:01,269
Let's order food from the lobby.

1582
01:00:01,829 --> 01:00:03,869
You'll get to eat room service
at the hotel now.

1583
01:00:03,869 --> 01:00:04,869
- Yes.
- Yes.

1584
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:07,639
The hotel's room service
was most convenient...

1585
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:08,809
since they brought it to us.

1586
01:00:08,809 --> 01:00:09,880
Hello.

1587
01:00:09,880 --> 01:00:11,809
I was starving to the point I had...

1588
01:00:11,809 --> 01:00:14,079
already pictured what to eat in my head
on our way back.

1589
01:00:14,579 --> 01:00:16,479
(Sighing)

1590
01:00:16,849 --> 01:00:18,550
Sir, room service.

1591
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:20,189
- Room service menu.
- Yes.

1592
01:00:20,189 --> 01:00:21,749
- Okay, two tandoori chickens.
- Two of these.

1593
01:00:21,749 --> 01:00:23,660
- One cheese chili.
- Okay.

1594
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,260
That's it. Finished.

1595
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:28,959
Please give us ice.

1596
01:00:29,229 --> 01:00:30,360
- Hello.
- Yes.

1597
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:31,630
Do you have ice?

1598
01:00:31,630 --> 01:00:33,200
- Yes.
- One pack of ice.

1599
01:00:33,530 --> 01:00:34,700
And water.

1600
01:00:35,369 --> 01:00:37,039
- Water. Big size.
- Water.

1601
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,809
- Pani bottle.
- Pani bottle.

1602
01:00:40,110 --> 01:00:41,340
Okay.

1603
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:43,510
(While Pani Bottle pays
for the pani bottles)

1604
01:00:43,939 --> 01:00:45,539
I'll peel the fruits.

1605
01:00:47,380 --> 01:00:48,650
Apple mango.

1606
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:50,249
Apple mango sounds good.

1607
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,579
(Going in)

1608
01:00:51,579 --> 01:00:52,579
(1 second)

1609
01:00:52,579 --> 01:00:53,590
(2 seconds)

1610
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:54,590
(3 seconds)

1611
01:00:54,590 --> 01:00:55,590
(4 seconds)

1612
01:00:55,590 --> 01:00:56,590
(5 seconds)

1613
01:00:56,590 --> 01:00:57,590
(6 seconds)

1614
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,590
(7 seconds)

1615
01:00:58,590 --> 01:00:59,590
(8 seconds)

1616
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,630
(9 seconds)

1617
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:03,660
- You're done?
- That was super fast.

1618
01:01:03,729 --> 01:01:04,930
He washed 3 in 9 seconds?

1619
01:01:04,930 --> 01:01:06,400
How did you wash them?

1620
01:01:06,530 --> 01:01:08,700
- Squeaky clean.
- Did you wash them squeaky clean?

1621
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:10,200
- They must be clean then.
- Great job.

1622
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:11,340
Three seconds per mango.

1623
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:12,470
Using too much water is bad.

1624
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:13,470
(Laughing)

1625
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,809
(Leaving the mangoes he washed savingly
on the bed)

1626
01:01:15,939 --> 01:01:17,840
(Clean)

1627
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:18,880
(Sliding)

1628
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:19,880
How cute.

1629
01:01:21,410 --> 01:01:22,450
Welcome back.

1630
01:01:22,919 --> 01:01:24,050
Hey.

1631
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,889
Did I give you the knife?

1632
01:01:27,220 --> 01:01:28,689
The knife? Yes, you did.

1633
01:01:29,459 --> 01:01:31,519
- You look tired.
- It stinks like fish.

1634
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,329
"Like fish?" My gosh.

1635
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:35,660
The fabric itself
had that smell from the start.

1636
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,229
(Reaching)

1637
01:01:37,229 --> 01:01:38,829
Let's have a taste of the mango.

1638
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,070
(Going in with his teeth right away)

1639
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:43,200
With the skin on.

1640
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:44,570
There was a knife.

1641
01:01:44,570 --> 01:01:45,869
Then why did he do that?

1642
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:48,709
Do you eat the whole thing,
including the skin?

1643
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:50,680
No. I'm peeling it with my teeth.

1644
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:52,709
Oh, I see. For the others?

1645
01:01:52,849 --> 01:01:54,510
- No.
- For us?

1646
01:01:54,510 --> 01:01:55,510
Not for them.

1647
01:01:55,510 --> 01:01:57,650
Like how moms try kimchi first
to see if it's spicy?

1648
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,650
- Like how they wash it in their mouth?
- Yes.

1649
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:01,289
(Was that it, Kian84?)

1650
01:02:01,990 --> 01:02:03,389
(For him to eat,)

1651
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:05,689
The food will take about 40 minutes.

1652
01:02:05,689 --> 01:02:07,360
(he carefully peels the mango.)

1653
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,999
- It looks good.
- Gosh, it sounds delicious.

1654
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:12,700
(Amazed)

1655
01:02:12,869 --> 01:02:14,070
It sure was delicious.

1656
01:02:14,070 --> 01:02:15,869
Anyway, this is apple mango.

1657
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:16,869
- It looks good.
- Nice.

1658
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:19,539
It's really good.

1659
01:02:20,110 --> 01:02:22,470
(Another big bite)

1660
01:02:24,079 --> 01:02:25,840
One of these could fill my stomach up.

1661
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:27,010
It was huge...

1662
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:28,510
and exploding with juice.

1663
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,849
The mango itself was really big.

1664
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:33,220
(Comforting his wish of eating meat...)

1665
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:35,019
He's going in like it's some meat.

1666
01:02:35,019 --> 01:02:37,119
(by eating a mango)

1667
01:02:37,119 --> 01:02:39,220
Gosh, it must've been really good.

1668
01:02:40,059 --> 01:02:41,090
(In awe)

1669
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,829
He's eating it like some ribs.
It looks like one.

1670
01:02:43,829 --> 01:02:45,860
Kian84's eating the mango
like some fried chicken.

1671
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:49,130
Please eat mango if you're in India.

1672
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,439
- Do you recommend it?
- Totally. It was the best.

1673
01:02:51,499 --> 01:02:53,369
- What is it?
- Mango.

1674
01:02:54,410 --> 01:02:56,139
(A kitchen knife)

1675
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,610
Shall I have a taste of it?

1676
01:02:57,939 --> 01:02:58,939
Go ahead.

1677
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:01,550
- Give me a minute.
- Yes, that's a must.

1678
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:03,979
- Like this.
- He made it all fancy.

1679
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,320
That's how you cut a mango.

1680
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:06,749
(Dex's mango steak)

1681
01:03:06,749 --> 01:03:08,249
You sure know how to eat a mango.

1682
01:03:08,249 --> 01:03:09,590
That looks good.

1683
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,889
By any chance,
did you recently visit Thailand?

1684
01:03:12,019 --> 01:03:14,329
- Yes.
- That was why he knew that.

1685
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,700
- That's right.
- I ate it like this.

1686
01:03:17,499 --> 01:03:19,130
That was one way to eat it.

1687
01:03:19,260 --> 01:03:21,570
- You can eat it however you want.
- There's no right answer.

1688
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:24,070
(The two may eat it differently,)

1689
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,869
(but they enjoy it like a pair of twins.)

1690
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,410
We were starving back then.

1691
01:03:28,439 --> 01:03:31,309
(Pani Bottle cuts the mango like Dex.)

1692
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:35,249
Eating fruits like a mini-snack like that
when you travel...

1693
01:03:35,249 --> 01:03:37,249
- is a vibe in itself.
- Totally, it makes it better.

1694
01:03:37,249 --> 01:03:39,380
(Eating)

1695
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:40,889
The mango is amazing.

1696
01:03:40,889 --> 01:03:43,019
- It looks good.
- I'm craving mangoes now.

1697
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,559
I really want one.

1698
01:03:44,919 --> 01:03:47,189
(After the mango, they try a new fruit.)

1699
01:03:47,189 --> 01:03:48,789
- What's that?
- Is it a lemon?

1700
01:03:48,789 --> 01:03:49,860
It's a melon.

1701
01:03:49,860 --> 01:03:51,130
- Is it a melon?
- Korean melon?

1702
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,459
- It looks like a Korean melon.
- Korean melon?

1703
01:03:52,459 --> 01:03:54,269
- Give it a taste.
- Isn't this melon?

1704
01:03:54,999 --> 01:03:56,769
(Eating it right away)

1705
01:03:56,769 --> 01:03:58,669
- His teeth are really healthy.
- How is it?

1706
01:03:58,669 --> 01:03:59,809
His teeth are in good condition.

1707
01:03:59,809 --> 01:04:01,840
- Teeth condition?
- What does it taste like?

1708
01:04:02,669 --> 01:04:05,439
It's like Korean melon and melon...

1709
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:07,650
- A mix of the two?
- together.

1710
01:04:08,309 --> 01:04:09,979
- Then it's a melon.
- Melons and Korean melons...

1711
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,019
must be relatives.

1712
01:04:11,079 --> 01:04:12,150
Aren't they?

1713
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:13,619
They do taste similar.

1714
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,459
It was like a different relative
from melons and Korean melons.

1715
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:19,320
(Slurping)

1716
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,889
That was fun too.

1717
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,329
- Trying new foods?
- Those fruits...

1718
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:25,630
were a first for me.

1719
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:27,630
Grapes.

1720
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:31,999
(The 2nd eldest is gnawing on
the mango rib.)

1721
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:35,169
(The youngest is doing the same.)

1722
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:38,039
We promised to eat one,
but we couldn't stop.

1723
01:04:38,039 --> 01:04:40,610
- It's making my mouth water.
- We filled our bellies with them.

1724
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:42,050
I'm full.

1725
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,349
(With sweet fruits)

1726
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:44,650
I filled my stomach with fruits.

1727
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:46,849
Our food is on our way, right?

1728
01:04:46,849 --> 01:04:48,389
- We should stop.
- Right.

1729
01:04:48,389 --> 01:04:49,789
We ate too much. I'm full.

1730
01:04:49,789 --> 01:04:50,820
(Satiated to the max)

1731
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:53,860
Since I don't take long,
can I shower first?

1732
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,030
Go ahead.

1733
01:04:55,030 --> 01:04:57,860
(Freshening up
before the room service arrives)

1734
01:04:58,160 --> 01:04:59,160
(Facing down)

1735
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:00,430
What is it? Is he not feeling well?

1736
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:01,700
Maybe he has an upset stomach.

1737
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:03,999
- What?
- What's wrong?

1738
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:06,840
What's this?

1739
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:08,669
(Peek-a-boo)

1740
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:11,180
Good grief.

1741
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,749
When did it rip?

1742
01:05:14,110 --> 01:05:15,510
(Laughing)

1743
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:17,619
(Going crazy)

1744
01:05:17,619 --> 01:05:19,050
Oh, goodness.

1745
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,249
My gosh, how wild.

1746
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,619
(His charm cracked up.)

1747
01:05:24,889 --> 01:05:26,760
- This...
- It's a relief.

1748
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,030
What's this? What do I do, Kian84?

1749
01:05:29,030 --> 01:05:30,599
(Behaving modestly)

1750
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,760
It gave me a shock.

1751
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,269
You don't know when it happened?

1752
01:05:34,869 --> 01:05:35,869
No.

1753
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:38,939
(On their way back from Wagah Border)

1754
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,340
(It was slightly ripped.)

1755
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,410
- There was already a hole back then.
- It was ripped.

1756
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:45,240
(The hole got bigger
while he ate his mango.)

1757
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,780
(They crack up.)

1758
01:05:47,780 --> 01:05:48,979
(Embarrassed)

1759
01:05:48,979 --> 01:05:51,079
It must've felt nice and breezy.

1760
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,880
I was deep in thought.

1761
01:05:52,880 --> 01:05:55,689
I was deep in thought like this
when I noticed it.

1762
01:05:55,849 --> 01:05:58,119
I really felt the open breeze.

1763
01:05:58,220 --> 01:06:02,059
Good grief, how hilarious.

1764
01:06:02,459 --> 01:06:03,930
It's fun.

1765
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:09,300
(Organizing)

1766
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:13,369
Gosh, how cold.

1767
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,110
I think I can sleep after the meal.

1768
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:20,650
We didn't have much time
before our flight,

1769
01:06:20,749 --> 01:06:23,119
- so we needed to get some sleep.
- You need a short nap.

1770
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,119
Oh, right.
You need to leave early morning.

1771
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:27,849
You must've been dead tired.

1772
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:29,519
- Oh, gosh.
- Goodness.

1773
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:30,660
(Yawning)

1774
01:06:32,990 --> 01:06:35,789
I think the room service
will get here in 30 minutes.

1775
01:06:36,030 --> 01:06:38,130
- The food hasn't arrived yet.
- That's right.

1776
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,340
(Sleeping deeply)

1777
01:06:44,300 --> 01:06:47,039
Gosh. Hold on. It's our food.

1778
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,869
Okay, here.

1779
01:06:51,579 --> 01:06:56,079
(He's not waking up
even though his food is here.)

1780
01:06:58,019 --> 01:06:59,650
- Thank you very much.
- My pleasure.

1781
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:00,749
(Sound asleep like he passed out)

1782
01:07:03,260 --> 01:07:04,820
- He passed out.
- Kian84.

1783
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,229
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

1784
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:09,559
You guys dig in.

1785
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:12,760
It could be better to just sleep
at a time like that.

1786
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:15,669
We'll eat by ourselves then.

1787
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:17,369
(Leaving Kian84, who is sleeping,)

1788
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:18,900
Eat.

1789
01:07:19,570 --> 01:07:21,439
(the younger ones start eating.)

1790
01:07:21,439 --> 01:07:22,439
Finally.

1791
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:24,510
- We're eating it.
- Tandoori.

1792
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:25,939
- They're finally having chicken.
- Protein.

1793
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:29,450
- The chicken looks delicious.
- I like wild ginseng.

1794
01:07:30,119 --> 01:07:31,820
- I'm not eating it.
- What's this?

1795
01:07:32,880 --> 01:07:34,220
- This is cheese, right?
- Yes.

1796
01:07:34,220 --> 01:07:35,889
It tastes like tofu.

1797
01:07:36,019 --> 01:07:38,160
- It's cheese.
- Is it really cheese?

1798
01:07:38,419 --> 01:07:41,689
The texture of Indian cheese
was like tofu.

1799
01:07:41,889 --> 01:07:42,889
It's...

1800
01:07:42,889 --> 01:07:44,059
- Not bad.
- Not bad?

1801
01:07:44,059 --> 01:07:46,329
- It's good.
- It was delicious.

1802
01:07:46,669 --> 01:07:48,200
- Try this.
- Okay.

1803
01:07:51,769 --> 01:07:52,900
It's good.

1804
01:07:53,709 --> 01:07:55,169
I'm not going to eat tandoori chicken.

1805
01:07:55,169 --> 01:07:58,039
(After giving the older one a bite,
he starts eating.)

1806
01:08:00,010 --> 01:08:01,809
It's almost the first time
for Dex to eat properly.

1807
01:08:01,809 --> 01:08:02,880
Right.

1808
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:04,450
I'm relieved.

1809
01:08:04,450 --> 01:08:06,889
He started eating more
as he found the food...

1810
01:08:06,889 --> 01:08:09,320
- that suited his palate.
- That's nice. It's a relief.

1811
01:08:13,430 --> 01:08:17,800
(Pani Bottle starts eating as well.)

1812
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:19,969
How should I put it?

1813
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,769
I used to hate Indian food.

1814
01:08:21,769 --> 01:08:23,000
I don't know why it tastes good now.

1815
01:08:23,370 --> 01:08:24,570
Everything is good.

1816
01:08:26,509 --> 01:08:28,839
- Pani Bottle...
- He has a big appetite now.

1817
01:08:29,509 --> 01:08:31,839
- He's been gaining weight.
- For real.

1818
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,580
I gained weight in India.

1819
01:08:34,150 --> 01:08:35,349
He's getting rounder.

1820
01:08:35,849 --> 01:08:37,250
He might lick the plate.

1821
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,450
He looks like a big baby in India.

1822
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,049
- Let me clean up.
- Yes.

1823
01:08:43,049 --> 01:08:44,189
(He's done eating.)

1824
01:08:45,059 --> 01:08:46,360
He's eating again.

1825
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:47,929
Do you need a sleep mask?

1826
01:08:47,929 --> 01:08:49,189
No, I'm fine.

1827
01:08:49,929 --> 01:08:51,400
(He's going to make a hole in the plate.)

1828
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:53,099
I liked how much he enjoyed the food.

1829
01:08:53,099 --> 01:08:54,629
- Yes. He ate a lot.
- He enjoys the food.

1830
01:08:54,629 --> 01:08:55,799
(Clean)

1831
01:08:56,599 --> 01:08:57,740
It was crazy good.

1832
01:08:57,740 --> 01:08:58,969
(After finishing a satisfying meal,)

1833
01:08:58,969 --> 01:09:00,040
It was great.

1834
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:02,370
(he lies on the bed.)

1835
01:09:02,370 --> 01:09:03,809
Weren't you hungry, Kian84?

1836
01:09:03,809 --> 01:09:05,009
- Were you okay?
- I was so tired.

1837
01:09:05,009 --> 01:09:06,809
I don't even remember it.

1838
01:09:06,809 --> 01:09:09,110
I understand that he was exhausted.

1839
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,580
He did so many things.

1840
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:14,120
(The India Brothers finish a busy day.)

1841
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:19,019
(In the morning when everyone is asleep)

1842
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:20,759
(Waking up)

1843
01:09:21,189 --> 01:09:22,229
(Turning)

1844
01:09:23,160 --> 01:09:25,330
(After checking
if the others were sleeping,)

1845
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,570
(he found leftovers.)

1846
01:09:29,229 --> 01:09:30,400
(Gobbling it up)

1847
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:31,500
What's this?

1848
01:09:32,670 --> 01:09:34,070
(Glancing)

1849
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:37,580
- The caption says, "Parasite84."
- "Parasite84."

1850
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,580
(Parasite84 has returned.)

1851
01:09:41,349 --> 01:09:42,410
(Glancing)

1852
01:09:42,410 --> 01:09:43,580
(Eating)

1853
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:47,320
(Parasite84 was eating on the train
while glancing at others.)

1854
01:09:48,219 --> 01:09:52,460
(As if he's secretly living in the place,)

1855
01:09:53,219 --> 01:09:56,799
(he eats with his hands in a rush.)

1856
01:09:56,799 --> 01:09:58,429
(Slurping)

1857
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:01,830
What?

1858
01:10:02,700 --> 01:10:05,900
(Kian84, you're good with your hands.)

1859
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:11,939
(The last night where all sorts of things
happened passes by.)

1860
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:18,019
(The three brothers are sleeping
for tomorrow.)

1861
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,990
(Creaking)

1862
01:10:23,759 --> 01:10:25,120
Misters.

1863
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:27,259
You got 30 minutes left.

1864
01:10:27,460 --> 01:10:29,389
- Already?
- They didn't sleep much.

1865
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:30,960
It's 2:30 a.m.

1866
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:36,670
(The flight to Leh departs at 5 a.m.)

1867
01:10:37,570 --> 01:10:41,040
They usually say you should arrive at
the airport two hours before the flight.

1868
01:10:41,040 --> 01:10:42,040
Right.

1869
01:10:42,769 --> 01:10:43,979
- We should go.
- Yes.

1870
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:48,110
(What do you want to do in India, Dex?)

1871
01:10:48,549 --> 01:10:52,120
(The Himalayas are in India.)

1872
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:53,689
(There's a place you can get there
by airplane.)

1873
01:10:53,990 --> 01:10:55,389
(Tempted)

1874
01:10:56,490 --> 01:10:59,990
(Since then, Dex has been talking...)

1875
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:04,299
(about the Himalayas.)

1876
01:11:05,299 --> 01:11:06,900
Dex kept saying...

1877
01:11:06,900 --> 01:11:09,670
that he wanted to feel nature.

1878
01:11:09,799 --> 01:11:12,000
But it's been noisy with honking cars.

1879
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,540
He must be tired because of it.

1880
01:11:14,939 --> 01:11:18,540
So I thought it'd be a suitable ending...

1881
01:11:18,879 --> 01:11:21,780
to finish our trip in a quiet place
close to nature.

1882
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:23,309
Finally, it's something
on the youngest's bucket list.

1883
01:11:23,309 --> 01:11:24,320
Right.

1884
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:26,650
(The India Brothers came down
to check out.)

1885
01:11:26,650 --> 01:11:27,650
Hello.

1886
01:11:28,049 --> 01:11:29,120
- Hello.
- Sir.

1887
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:31,689
(You can tell he's tired by his bedhead.)

1888
01:11:32,219 --> 01:11:33,589
(His face is puffy.)

1889
01:11:33,589 --> 01:11:36,360
Check out. Everything is done, right?

1890
01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:38,460
Some payments are left.

1891
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:41,229
- The room service? Okay.
- The room service.

1892
01:11:41,229 --> 01:11:42,400
How much is it?

1893
01:11:43,330 --> 01:11:44,799
(He starts pressing a calculator.)

1894
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:45,870
That's 275...

1895
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:47,439
(He's watching closely with sleepy eyes.)

1896
01:11:47,439 --> 01:11:48,710
With hawk eyes.

1897
01:11:52,339 --> 01:11:54,979
It was about 40 dollars,
including the room service...

1898
01:11:54,979 --> 01:11:56,309
and the laundry service.

1899
01:11:56,309 --> 01:11:57,750
Forty dollars for everything...

1900
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,019
seems good.

1901
01:11:59,219 --> 01:12:00,450
- Thank you. Bye. Good night.
- Thank you.

1902
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:01,990
- Bye. Thank you.
- Bye.

1903
01:12:01,990 --> 01:12:03,389
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1904
01:12:04,960 --> 01:12:07,089
This is the car.
The one that got into an accident.

1905
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:08,530
- The one that got into an accident.
- The car that got into an accident.

1906
01:12:09,189 --> 01:12:11,660
- They couldn't fix it.
- It hurts my heart.

1907
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:14,570
- Hello.
- Good morning.

1908
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,900
- Hello.
- To the airport.

1909
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:17,139
The driver.

1910
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:20,210
If we can't call a cab
early in the morning,

1911
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:22,269
we will miss the flight.

1912
01:12:22,269 --> 01:12:23,639
So we made a reservation in advance.

1913
01:12:24,610 --> 01:12:25,639
Okay.

1914
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:26,679
(The luggage is loaded.)

1915
01:12:26,679 --> 01:12:28,650
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1916
01:12:28,650 --> 01:12:29,910
(They're going to the airport now!)

1917
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:32,420
(They spot the Golden Temple.)

1918
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:34,889
It's 3 a.m.,
but there are so many people like this?

1919
01:12:35,290 --> 01:12:37,389
They started their day early.

1920
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:38,589
(There are many people in front
of the temple early in the morning.)

1921
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,360
He's praying.

1922
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,259
(He's praying.)

1923
01:12:46,259 --> 01:12:47,929
He's suddenly praying here?

1924
01:12:48,269 --> 01:12:50,939
(The eldest one respects the culture
in a hurry.)

1925
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:52,500
I saw him praying, so...

1926
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,839
I prayed for the last time before leaving.

1927
01:12:54,839 --> 01:12:56,410
(He prayed for their safe journey.)

1928
01:12:57,110 --> 01:12:59,110
- It feels different.
- Right.

1929
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:01,049
(Goodbye, Amritsar.)

1930
01:13:02,250 --> 01:13:04,080
Where are we going now?

1931
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:07,320
First, we're going
to take a flight to Delhi.

1932
01:13:07,650 --> 01:13:08,820
- Delhi?
- Yes.

1933
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,460
- Really?
- Because there's no direct flight...

1934
01:13:11,460 --> 01:13:12,990
- to Leh from here.
- There's no direct flight.

1935
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:15,460
- It's only in Delhi.
- I see.

1936
01:13:15,460 --> 01:13:18,200
So we're going back to Delhi to go to Leh.

1937
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:20,000
- So it's two flights?
- Yes.

1938
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,269
My goodness.

1939
01:13:21,969 --> 01:13:25,099
You can go to Leh by airplane or car.

1940
01:13:25,099 --> 01:13:26,240
If you get there by car,

1941
01:13:26,240 --> 01:13:29,540
you should take the Leh Manali Highway.

1942
01:13:29,540 --> 01:13:34,250
But the roads are frozen
because of the heavy snow in winter.

1943
01:13:34,250 --> 01:13:36,580
So they're usually closed
for more than half of the year.

1944
01:13:36,849 --> 01:13:40,019
At that time, the roads were closed,

1945
01:13:40,019 --> 01:13:42,719
- so they could only get there by plane.
- I see.

1946
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:46,559
The city called Leh that we went to
was at a high altitude.

1947
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:48,830
It's minus 10℃ even in May in some places.

1948
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:50,460
If it's minus 10℃, it's like winter.

1949
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,670
Did you all bring winter clothes?

1950
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:56,769
I do have some,
but I don't think it'd be enough.

1951
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:58,839
Let's buy puffer jackets
when we get there.

1952
01:13:59,400 --> 01:14:02,910
I do want to get the clothes
the locals wear if they sell them.

1953
01:14:03,309 --> 01:14:06,309
Actually, in the last city,

1954
01:14:06,309 --> 01:14:08,849
I think I won't get changed
most of the time.

1955
01:14:09,150 --> 01:14:10,549
(Laughing)

1956
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:13,280
Because I only brought
one set of winter clothes.

1957
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:14,790
Well done.

1958
01:14:14,790 --> 01:14:16,849
I brought only one set, just in case.

1959
01:14:17,259 --> 01:14:19,689
You shouldn't get changed often
in a cold place.

1960
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:20,689
I see.

1961
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:22,429
- It's okay because you won't sweat much.
- Right.

1962
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:24,360
You can go on for a week
if things go well.

1963
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:25,500
Yes.

1964
01:14:25,830 --> 01:14:27,830
- You won't even smell because it's cold.
- Yes.

1965
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:30,769
And what if we smell? We're tourists.

1966
01:14:30,769 --> 01:14:31,799
Yes.

1967
01:14:32,299 --> 01:14:33,670
(He's satisfied with their conversation.)

1968
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:34,740
"Satisfied."

1969
01:14:34,939 --> 01:14:37,939
I'm quite a neat guy,
but I got accustomed to it.

1970
01:14:38,939 --> 01:14:41,950
I thought I could wear the same clothes...

1971
01:14:41,950 --> 01:14:44,420
- for 4 to 5 days.
- Right.

1972
01:14:44,979 --> 01:14:46,750
I wasn't going to take a shower...

1973
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:48,689
- for the last 3 or 4 days.
- Right.

1974
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:50,589
In a cold place...

1975
01:14:50,589 --> 01:14:52,960
He was talking about clothes.
And you were talking about a shower.

1976
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:56,059
Did you take a shower?

1977
01:14:56,259 --> 01:14:57,530
He didn't take a shower either.

1978
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,559
- I didn't take a shower.
- Okay.

1979
01:14:58,559 --> 01:15:00,129
Isn't it good to take a shower
when you can?

1980
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:01,299
Yes. You can take good showers
after returning to Korea.

1981
01:15:01,299 --> 01:15:03,799
To me, not getting changed...

1982
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:05,099
means not taking off the clothes.

1983
01:15:05,099 --> 01:15:07,240
Once you put them on,
you don't take them off?

1984
01:15:07,410 --> 01:15:08,740
Because you'll lose heat.

1985
01:15:09,139 --> 01:15:10,710
(As expected of him)

1986
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:16,250
And one of the risks
we aren't sure of is...

1987
01:15:16,250 --> 01:15:17,479
He and I...

1988
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:20,019
got it confirmed in Peru and Bolivia.

1989
01:15:20,019 --> 01:15:22,049
But you've never been to alpine regions.

1990
01:15:22,049 --> 01:15:24,019
- Right.
- The altitude sickness.

1991
01:15:24,019 --> 01:15:25,420
- Right.
- At high altitude.

1992
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:26,689
I've never been to alpine regions.

1993
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:28,160
It's not easy.

1994
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,229
- Right.
- No.

1995
01:15:29,229 --> 01:15:30,299
(You may get altitude sickness when you
travel to a high altitude quickly.)

1996
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:33,460
Dex would get used to a high altitude.

1997
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,900
It doesn't matter if you're strong or not.

1998
01:15:37,070 --> 01:15:38,540
You don't know who will experience it.

1999
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:40,939
- So it's almost a matter of luck.
- It's a matter of luck.

2000
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:43,410
- The hotels in Leh...
- Yes.

2001
01:15:43,410 --> 01:15:45,679
have respirators.

2002
01:15:45,679 --> 01:15:47,250
They do?

2003
01:15:47,549 --> 01:15:49,179
It means it's going to be very tough.

2004
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:52,349
- It's 3,500m above sea level.
- It's 3,500m?

2005
01:15:52,349 --> 01:15:54,620
The highest point was almost 5,000m.

2006
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,049
- It was higher than 5,000m.
- Gosh.

2007
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:00,330
I'm scared to go somewhere that high.
It's been a while.

2008
01:16:00,460 --> 01:16:01,830
You are? It's that bad?

2009
01:16:01,830 --> 01:16:05,129
- It feels a bit different up there.
- So it's like...

2010
01:16:05,129 --> 01:16:08,299
- you're out of breath for everything.
- I see.

2011
01:16:08,570 --> 01:16:11,170
They kept scaring me
about altitude sickness...

2012
01:16:11,170 --> 01:16:12,700
even before we got there.

2013
01:16:13,099 --> 01:16:14,839
I'll be able to come back
as a stronger man.

2014
01:16:17,740 --> 01:16:19,740
You keep making me look forward to it.

2015
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:22,910
(Driving while looking forward
to becoming stronger...)

2016
01:16:23,049 --> 01:16:25,150
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

2017
01:16:28,820 --> 01:16:29,820
Let's go.

2018
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:31,790
When do you want to eat this?

2019
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:33,120
What?

2020
01:16:33,360 --> 01:16:35,189
It's too heavy.

2021
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:36,889
- I brought the leftover watermelon.
- Gosh.

2022
01:16:36,889 --> 01:16:38,960
- You brought a watermelon to the airport.
- This...

2023
01:16:39,129 --> 01:16:41,299
We can bring food onto domestic flights.

2024
01:16:41,299 --> 01:16:43,229
- Domestic flights.
- I think this is nice and ripe.

2025
01:16:43,370 --> 01:16:44,839
This is a watermelon from "Hanabasi."

2026
01:16:45,299 --> 01:16:47,469
- It's Amritsar, not "Hanabasi."
- Do you want it?

2027
01:16:47,570 --> 01:16:49,339
- He got confused with Varanasi...
- I got it mixed up.

2028
01:16:49,339 --> 01:16:50,839
He got the number of syllables right.

2029
01:16:51,479 --> 01:16:54,610
I also have Korean melon from "Hanabasi."

2030
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:55,610
Korean melon.

2031
01:16:55,610 --> 01:16:57,549
Dex didn't correct him about "Hanabasi."

2032
01:16:57,549 --> 01:17:00,349
To be honest, I didn't know either.

2033
01:17:00,519 --> 01:17:03,120
This isn't a squash from "Hanabasi."
It's a watermelon.

2034
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:04,559
A watermelon.

2035
01:17:05,019 --> 01:17:07,589
(Reliable Bottle is paying the cab fare.)

2036
01:17:07,759 --> 01:17:10,360
I'm worried that he might get
into another accident.

2037
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,000
Be safe, sir.

2038
01:17:13,530 --> 01:17:14,799
Don't get into an accident.

2039
01:17:14,799 --> 01:17:16,929
- Don't get into an accident.
- Right.

2040
01:17:16,929 --> 01:17:18,170
Don't get into an accident.

2041
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,299
(He's in high spirits.)

2042
01:17:19,299 --> 01:17:20,639
(He's shaking his body and dancing.)

2043
01:17:21,210 --> 01:17:22,870
He's in such high spirits.

2044
01:17:23,939 --> 01:17:26,280
- Slowly.
- Slowly. Okay.

2045
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:27,309
All right.

2046
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:29,309
Bye.

2047
01:17:29,910 --> 01:17:32,950
Gosh, he's so funny.

2048
01:17:36,950 --> 01:17:38,089
What?

2049
01:17:39,420 --> 01:17:41,660
A distinct feature of this airport is...

2050
01:17:42,629 --> 01:17:46,259
the pigeons that are bouncing by.

2051
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,500
- Is there a window open, maybe?
- Right.

2052
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,939
They have no boundaries
between inside and outside

2053
01:17:50,939 --> 01:17:51,939
(Amritsar Airport equally has
no boundaries between inside and outside.)

2054
01:17:51,939 --> 01:17:53,200
It's basically Yeouido Park.

2055
01:17:53,200 --> 01:17:54,710
(It resembles a Korean park
with lots of pigeons.)

2056
01:17:55,710 --> 01:17:58,580
The animal that is best adapted
to human society...

2057
01:17:58,580 --> 01:18:00,509
is the pigeon.

2058
01:18:01,950 --> 01:18:04,420
(Like the pigeon that is flying away,)

2059
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:06,479
(the India Brothers, who are great
at adapting, are flying away too.)

2060
01:18:06,479 --> 01:18:08,519
We flew about an hour and ten minutes...

2061
01:18:08,519 --> 01:18:10,559
for a layover in Delhi.

2062
01:18:11,360 --> 01:18:14,129
(They briefly stopped
at Delhi airport for a layover.)

2063
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:17,500
What was the name of the city
we were just in?

2064
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:18,860
What?

2065
01:18:19,229 --> 01:18:21,769
"Yabavizan?" "Yabaviza?"

2066
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,139
- Amristar?
- Amristar.

2067
01:18:26,139 --> 01:18:28,540
You know you called it
"Hanatsar" yesterday?

2068
01:18:28,969 --> 01:18:30,339
(Yesterday, "Hanatsar")

2069
01:18:30,339 --> 01:18:31,809
(Amristar)

2070
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:33,439
(The day before yesterday, "Amitar")

2071
01:18:33,439 --> 01:18:35,080
(Amristar)

2072
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,650
(1 hour ago, "Hanabasi")

2073
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:37,920
("Yabaviza?")

2074
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:40,019
(Pani Bottle has given up.)

2075
01:18:40,019 --> 01:18:42,420
- "Yabaviza" is so funny.
- "Yabaviza" is the funniest.

2076
01:18:42,549 --> 01:18:43,750
It's so random.

2077
01:18:43,750 --> 01:18:45,519
How do none of them
sound similar to each other?

2078
01:18:46,019 --> 01:18:48,259
We're going to "Ven" now?

2079
01:18:48,729 --> 01:18:49,729
"Ven?"

2080
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:52,200
It was something like "Ven" or "Jen."

2081
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:55,030
- Leh.
- Leh.

2082
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,070
Leh as in "Do, re." Okay.

2083
01:18:57,469 --> 01:18:58,870
You're not getting the names wrong
on purpose, are you?

2084
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,610
- Leh.
- I don't do things like that to be funny.

2085
01:19:02,939 --> 01:19:04,910
I'm sure there are
a lot of people like me.

2086
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:06,610
To people who don't travel,

2087
01:19:06,679 --> 01:19:08,349
too much information all at once...

2088
01:19:08,349 --> 01:19:10,379
- It can be confusing.
- can be confusing. Extremely.

2089
01:19:10,379 --> 01:19:11,420
You know it now, right?

2090
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:13,379
- I know it now. Leh.
- Where you're headed right now.

2091
01:19:13,379 --> 01:19:14,849
- Gosh.
- Okay.

2092
01:19:15,019 --> 01:19:17,219
Is this something
you should be applauding me for?

2093
01:19:17,820 --> 01:19:18,860
It's a bit...

2094
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:19,889
(He's proud but also embarrassed.)

2095
01:19:20,160 --> 01:19:22,960
Right now, we are headed to Leh.

2096
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:25,929
We have a layover in Delhi,

2097
01:19:25,929 --> 01:19:29,370
so we're waiting for our next flight.

2098
01:19:29,429 --> 01:19:31,769
It was about an hour and a half late.

2099
01:19:31,769 --> 01:19:33,269
Because of the weather conditions...

2100
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:35,070
- They have to check air conditions.
- Yes.

2101
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:37,379
We decided to meet up
at a specific time...

2102
01:19:37,379 --> 01:19:39,540
and do our own thing.

2103
01:19:39,540 --> 01:19:41,049
What will I be doing?

2104
01:19:41,179 --> 01:19:43,979
I'm going to sleep.
I'll be sleeping out in the open.

2105
01:19:43,979 --> 01:19:45,120
I'm so sleepy.

2106
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:49,150
I at least have to find somewhere
I can lean back.

2107
01:19:49,549 --> 01:19:51,759
Somewhere there aren't many people.

2108
01:19:51,759 --> 01:19:52,790
(Dex's checklist
for sleeping out in the open.)

2109
01:19:54,160 --> 01:19:55,660
I found it.

2110
01:19:57,299 --> 01:19:59,759
(Can he lean back?
Are there little to no people?)

2111
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:02,570
Gosh. This is so nice.

2112
01:20:03,769 --> 01:20:06,070
He's becoming more and more like Kian84.

2113
01:20:06,070 --> 01:20:07,639
He's becoming Kian84.
We can't do anything about it.

2114
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:09,210
But really.

2115
01:20:09,469 --> 01:20:11,009
You're being influenced by each other.

2116
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,540
(The brothers who sleep out in the open
are influencing each other.)

2117
01:20:13,280 --> 01:20:16,610
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle is maintaining
his dignity on the chair.)

2118
01:20:18,979 --> 01:20:20,620
(He is reunited with SleepingOutside95,
who got some good sleep.)

2119
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:21,790
SleepingOutside95.

2120
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,189
Where's Kian84?

2121
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:25,120
He's sleeping over there.

2122
01:20:27,059 --> 01:20:28,460
(Kian84 is sleeping.)

2123
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,429
- He got himself a good spot.
- That's a good spot.

2124
01:20:30,429 --> 01:20:31,830
Dex slept on the floor,

2125
01:20:31,830 --> 01:20:33,900
while Kian84 slept on a bed. This is...

2126
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,900
- Different, isn't it?
- Completely different.

2127
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:39,370
He wouldn't know
if someone were to steal his things.

2128
01:20:39,939 --> 01:20:41,509
He's not even on alert in the first place.

2129
01:20:42,639 --> 01:20:44,040
(Scratching)

2130
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:48,250
(Kian84 wakes up and makes them laugh.)

2131
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,710
At least he woke up.

2132
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,179
This is when I realized...

2133
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,849
that the little things made us...

2134
01:20:52,849 --> 01:20:54,490
- laugh and have fun.
- You had fun.

2135
01:20:54,549 --> 01:20:56,719
- That's how it is when you're traveling.
- Laughing a lot.

2136
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:58,519
We really were laughing a lot.

2137
01:20:59,519 --> 01:21:00,759
I was passed out.

2138
01:21:00,929 --> 01:21:02,860
- Were you fast asleep?
- Yes.

2139
01:21:03,790 --> 01:21:06,000
- Take some medicine.
- What?

2140
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,030
- For altitude sickness?
- Yes.

2141
01:21:08,599 --> 01:21:11,500
Once we board the flight,
the altitude gets higher very quickly.

2142
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,500
(They take the pills
before they board the flight.)

2143
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,740
- We have to take these no matter what.
- I'm not taking that.

2144
01:21:14,910 --> 01:21:17,410
- You don't need it?
- I don't get altitude sickness.

2145
01:21:17,580 --> 01:21:19,610
- Not again.
- Gosh.

2146
01:21:19,610 --> 01:21:20,979
Pani Bottle.

2147
01:21:21,379 --> 01:21:23,710
- He's pretending to be tough again.
- No, I'm not.

2148
01:21:23,710 --> 01:21:25,820
You'll be bleeding
from both your nostrils.

2149
01:21:25,820 --> 01:21:28,389
I got a nosebleed because I was tired.
No, but really,

2150
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,059
if I feel sick when we get there,
I'll tell you.

2151
01:21:31,059 --> 01:21:33,019
- I'll concede and take the medicine.
- All right.

2152
01:21:33,620 --> 01:21:35,460
(And not long after...)

2153
01:21:35,759 --> 01:21:37,799
(I think he's getting altitude sickness.)

2154
01:21:37,799 --> 01:21:40,099
(No!)

2155
01:21:40,330 --> 01:21:42,729
(Gosh, my head hurts.)

2156
01:21:43,299 --> 01:21:44,939
(He lies down
in the middle of a conversation.)

2157
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:46,500
Oh, my goodness.

2158
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:47,910
You said you didn't get altitude sickness.

2159
01:21:47,910 --> 01:21:48,939
(He keeps lying down
regardless of time or place.)

2160
01:21:49,670 --> 01:21:51,740
(He eventually begins acting weirdly.)

2161
01:21:52,540 --> 01:21:53,540
Okay.

2162
01:21:53,939 --> 01:21:55,280
Goodness.

2163
01:21:55,379 --> 01:21:57,150
He can't even walk properly.

2164
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,280
I'm regretting it.

2165
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:02,189
(2 of them take medicine, while 1 claims
to be unbeatable by altitude sickness.)

2166
01:22:02,450 --> 01:22:04,759
(Let's go to Leh!)

2167
01:22:05,460 --> 01:22:07,729
- Are you finally heading to Leh?
- Yes, finally.

2168
01:22:07,729 --> 01:22:08,990
They're finally going to Leh.

2169
01:22:09,790 --> 01:22:11,030
(The plane isn't taking off.)

2170
01:22:11,030 --> 01:22:12,059
What's going on?

2171
01:22:12,059 --> 01:22:13,129
(Unsettled)

2172
01:22:13,129 --> 01:22:14,330
What's going on now?

2173
01:22:14,330 --> 01:22:15,969
It's like everywhere they go...

2174
01:22:15,969 --> 01:22:17,030
(What on earth is going on?)

2175
01:22:17,769 --> 01:22:19,299
Before, in India...

2176
01:22:19,299 --> 01:22:20,400
What kind of interview is this?

2177
01:22:20,400 --> 01:22:21,469
I was...

2178
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:23,070
What kind of interview is this?

2179
01:22:23,070 --> 01:22:24,309
I think I've...

2180
01:22:24,309 --> 01:22:25,439
I think I've seen this on "Three Days."

2181
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:26,580
It feels like "Three Days."

2182
01:22:26,580 --> 01:22:27,910
This kind of feels like a KBS show.

2183
01:22:27,910 --> 01:22:29,410
- Yes, it feels like a KBS show.
- Right, it feels like a KBS 1TV show.

2184
01:22:29,410 --> 01:22:30,650
- Yes, 1TV.
- Right, 1TV.

2185
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:31,820
It's like he's on
"Asian Corridor in Heaven."

2186
01:22:31,979 --> 01:22:33,150
Right. "Asian Corridor in Heaven."

2187
01:22:33,250 --> 01:22:34,450
Isn't that from a documentary?

2188
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,820
(An MBC founding project
called, "The Himalayas")

2189
01:22:36,990 --> 01:22:38,820
Before, in India,

2190
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:41,490
we could have gone to Leh by motorcycle,

2191
01:22:41,490 --> 01:22:43,559
or by another land transportation.

2192
01:22:43,660 --> 01:22:45,900
But the roads are always
closed off because of snow,

2193
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:48,099
so they're only open
for about three months a year.

2194
01:22:48,370 --> 01:22:50,469
And when we were here,
our timing wasn't right.

2195
01:22:51,769 --> 01:22:53,439
There was too much wind
in Leh at the time...

2196
01:22:53,439 --> 01:22:55,439
that they couldn't take off.

2197
01:22:56,910 --> 01:22:59,479
(The older two are getting more sleep.)

2198
01:23:01,379 --> 01:23:02,450
Namaste.

2199
01:23:02,549 --> 01:23:04,519
- There he goes again.
- He's doing it again.

2200
01:23:04,519 --> 01:23:06,479
There's going to be
another DM in his inbox.

2201
01:23:06,849 --> 01:23:07,950
What's your name?

2202
01:23:08,450 --> 01:23:10,320
- Harinandek.
- Harinandek?

2203
01:23:11,019 --> 01:23:12,259
My name is Kim.

2204
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:15,189
This is a Korean big...

2205
01:23:15,259 --> 01:23:18,460
The biggest channel's TV show.

2206
01:23:18,900 --> 01:23:20,870
TV show?

2207
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,530
- He's surprised.
- Shocked.

2208
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:24,030
Yes, this is for you.

2209
01:23:24,969 --> 01:23:26,400
You're on the TV show.

2210
01:23:26,670 --> 01:23:28,170
MBC.

2211
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:29,839
MBC.

2212
01:23:31,110 --> 01:23:33,110
- Repeat after me, okay?
- Okay.

2213
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:38,950
<i>MBC FM for you</i>

2214
01:23:38,950 --> 01:23:40,349
- That's the radio...
- The radio channel's theme song.

2215
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:41,490
You did all sorts of things.

2216
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:42,889
(Nodding)

2217
01:23:43,089 --> 01:23:44,360
Okay. Try.

2218
01:23:45,189 --> 01:23:47,059
<i>- MBC</i>
<i>- MBC</i>

2219
01:23:47,929 --> 01:23:50,360

2220
01:23:51,460 --> 01:23:52,460
Gosh.

2221
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,700
(Goodness)

2222
01:23:54,400 --> 01:23:56,469
- What?
- What?

2223
01:23:56,469 --> 01:23:57,469
(The boy's version of
the theme song was adorable.)

2224
01:23:57,469 --> 01:23:59,469
You did great.

2225
01:23:59,570 --> 01:24:00,670
- An Indian person...
- Gosh.

2226
01:24:00,670 --> 01:24:01,910
(Sang MBC's radio theme song.)

2227
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:03,639
<i>FM for you</i>

2228
01:24:03,639 --> 01:24:05,210
He sang MBC's radio theme song.

2229
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:07,210
- His voice is so clear.
- He has a great voice.

2230
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:08,509
It was so clear.

2231
01:24:08,509 --> 01:24:10,849
We'll do it together. Last time.

2232
01:24:11,019 --> 01:24:15,490
<i>- MBC</i>
<i>- MBC</i>

2233

2234
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:21,960
- Yes.
- He's M-Dex.

2235
01:24:22,389 --> 01:24:23,530
Good job.

2236
01:24:23,990 --> 01:24:25,299
Let's go to Leh.

2237
01:24:25,559 --> 01:24:26,700
- Leh.
- Leh.

2238
01:24:27,870 --> 01:24:30,870
(Thankfully,
they are approved to take off.)

2239
01:24:31,740 --> 01:24:34,740
(The plane takes off.)

2240
01:24:35,670 --> 01:24:37,170
We're going to Leh right now.

2241
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:39,679
Gosh. To the alpine region.

2242
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,879
(Pani Bottle is staring out the window.)

2243
01:24:42,879 --> 01:24:45,019
(What are you looking at?)

2244
01:24:45,679 --> 01:24:47,280
(A view so magnificent,
he can't turn his eyes away)

2245
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,750
We could see permanent snow and glaciers.

2246
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:52,559
It looks tough for the plane to land.

2247
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:55,790
Mountain cities
are usually tough to land on.

2248
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,189
Because there are only mountains.

2249
01:24:57,660 --> 01:25:00,559
We were almost grazing mountain tops.

2250
01:25:00,559 --> 01:25:02,700
- Really?
- And flying in between mountains.

2251
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:04,570
There really was...

2252
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,599
- What?
- What's going on with my hair?

2253
01:25:06,599 --> 01:25:09,309
Wait, this looks like it belongs
in a documentary too.

2254
01:25:09,439 --> 01:25:12,110
I think I've seen a documentary
like this on channel 139.

2255
01:25:12,110 --> 01:25:14,110
It reminds me of
a National Geographic documentary.

2256
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:16,250
You look like you should be milking yaks.

2257
01:25:16,349 --> 01:25:17,780
He said I look like I milk yaks.

2258
01:25:17,780 --> 01:25:19,150
(Shepherd Boy84)

2259
01:25:19,219 --> 01:25:20,650
- From here,
- It's the beginning?

2260
01:25:20,650 --> 01:25:22,420
everyone lost a lot of weight.

2261
01:25:22,420 --> 01:25:24,389
- Gosh, from hardship.
- Even the camera crew.

2262
01:25:24,389 --> 01:25:26,960
Their jawlines were so sharp
that they could cut me.

2263
01:25:26,960 --> 01:25:28,660
Like K-pop idols.

2264
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,229
Everyone was gradually
transforming like that.

2265
01:25:31,229 --> 01:25:32,559
(The Himalayan idols
are about to make their debut.)

2266
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:34,670
There really was...

2267
01:25:34,670 --> 01:25:37,870
the Himalayas that I've seen
in documentaries before.

2268
01:25:38,439 --> 01:25:41,070
Varanasi was different,
New Delhi was different,

2269
01:25:41,339 --> 01:25:43,309
and Amritsar was definitely different.

2270
01:25:43,309 --> 01:25:46,540
But Leh seemed like
a completely different country.

2271
01:25:48,379 --> 01:25:52,120
(The India Brothers arrived in Leh.)

2272
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:58,089
(The Son of MBC
can't take his eyes off the scenery.)

2273
01:25:58,759 --> 01:26:01,530
I can see the Himalayas from afar.

2274
01:26:03,059 --> 01:26:04,500
That is the Himalayas?

2275
01:26:05,129 --> 01:26:06,700
(Yes)

2276
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,500
Oh, my gosh.

2277
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:10,830
(The scenery is filled
with the Himalayas.)

2278
01:26:11,900 --> 01:26:13,200
It was what I wanted to feel.

2279
01:26:13,200 --> 01:26:16,339
Coming on this trip,
I wanted to be overwhelmed by nature.

2280
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:18,740
"I'm nothing."

2281
01:26:18,740 --> 01:26:21,879
Facing Mother Nature, I realized...

2282
01:26:21,879 --> 01:26:23,610
how small I was.

2283
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,620
(I realized how small I was.)

2284
01:26:27,950 --> 01:26:29,490
(Ladakh, the hilly land)

2285
01:26:29,490 --> 01:26:30,920
- Ladakh.
- Ladakh.

2286
01:26:34,759 --> 01:26:37,460
(A mysterious land that opens
only for 3 months a year...)

2287
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:42,330
(embracing the huge Himalayas)

2288
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,599
(The record of three travelers
who jumped into it)

2289
01:26:54,139 --> 01:26:55,150
"Coming soon."

2290
01:26:55,150 --> 01:26:57,650
(Into Mother Nature, coming soon)

2291
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,580
(Super excited)

2292
01:26:59,580 --> 01:27:01,750
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

2293
01:27:02,389 --> 01:27:03,790
I got goosebumps.

2294
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:05,259
The scenery doesn't make sense, does it?

2295
01:27:05,259 --> 01:27:07,830
- It's no joke.
- The places changed so drastically.

2296
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:09,559
Episode eight will be different again.

2297
01:27:09,559 --> 01:27:10,759
It'll be different again.

2298
01:27:10,759 --> 01:27:13,259
It's like we went to
several different countries.

2299
01:27:13,259 --> 01:27:14,469
How should I put it?

2300
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:16,670
"How should I put it?"

2301
01:27:17,269 --> 01:27:18,740
This is so much fun.

2302
01:27:19,370 --> 01:27:21,769
(At the foot of the Himalayas
in Mother Nature)

2303
01:27:22,339 --> 01:27:26,210
(Leh is a village
where people maintain their culture.)

2304
01:27:26,939 --> 01:27:29,179
(They fall in love with Leh
as soon as they arrive.)

2305
01:27:29,450 --> 01:27:30,950
(It's nice. It's romantic.)

2306
01:27:30,950 --> 01:27:31,950
(It's so cool.)

2307
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,219
(Look at him.)

2308
01:27:33,479 --> 01:27:35,650
(The food suits his palate as well.)

2309
01:27:36,049 --> 01:27:37,689
(Little Dex's dream came true.)

2310
01:27:38,219 --> 01:27:39,620
(I'm running out of breath!)

2311
01:27:39,990 --> 01:27:41,290
(Pani Bottle can't breathe well
because of altitude sickness.)

2312
01:27:41,290 --> 01:27:42,729
(He feels like dying.)

2313
01:27:43,490 --> 01:27:46,099
(They're going to camp in Mother Nature.)

2314
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:49,729
(The emerald river
flowing from the Himalayas)

2315
01:27:50,330 --> 01:27:53,900
(The magnificent scenery
unfolds endlessly.)

2316
01:27:54,370 --> 01:27:56,040
(They all ran away.)

2317
01:27:56,540 --> 01:27:58,540
(The eldest is suddenly by himself?)

2318
01:27:59,339 --> 01:28:02,080
(He meets an unexpected new friend?)

2319
01:28:03,479 --> 01:28:04,620
(Adventure by Accident 2)
