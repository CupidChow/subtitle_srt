1
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,709
Gosh. That was a long day.

2
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:13,779
I think it's best for all of us
to have free time tomorrow.

3
00:01:13,779 --> 00:01:16,049
Let's make time for self-maintenance.

4
00:01:16,449 --> 00:01:19,150
I might exchange some money
and get a haircut.

5
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,449
First, I'll go to the gym.

6
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,449
Oh, really?

7
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,360
Let's go together at 10 or 11 a.m.

8
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,520
Sure. Around that time.

9
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,429
We probably all had things
we wanted to do personally.

10
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,529
We needed personal time,

11
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:31,659
- actually.
- You're right.

12
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:35,330
So from the morning to
when we have to catch our flight at night,

13
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,639
we decided to have time
for some self-maintenance.

14
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,340
Right. And when you meet again
after being apart,

15
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,539
it feels more affectionate.

16
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,740
- Of course.
- You're right.

17
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,810
- Yes.
- Sounds nice.

18
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:44,079
Let's sleep.

19
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,139
(They decide
to do some self-maintenance...)

20
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,240
(and to recharge their affection
the next day.)

21
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,910
Let's go to sleep now.

22
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:52,880
(The India Brothers are all asleep.)

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,950
(Kian84, Pani Bottle, Dex)

24
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,120
You must've slept so well.

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,289
Oh, thank you.

26
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,560
- What was that?
- What was that?

27
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,590
- Did someone come in?
- What?

28
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:05,829
(Kian84 keeps talking
when no one is listening.)

29
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:09,329
Men, women, the elderly, and the young...

30
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,169
He's talking in his sleep
because he's tired.

31
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,539
- He's talking in his sleep?
- He must've been very tired.

32
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:17,209
Right. He must've not slept well...

33
00:02:17,209 --> 00:02:18,509
- if he was talking like that.
- Right.

34
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,050
(Tossing and turning)

35
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,179
What does that mean?

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,319
Pani Bottle was sleeping next to him,

37
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,990
but it was so fascinating...

38
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,959
- that he filmed it.
- He filmed it?

39
00:02:31,589 --> 00:02:33,789
He's very sensitive about hygiene.

40
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,390
Hygiene.

41
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,300
(Our clean Little Dex.)

42
00:02:38,929 --> 00:02:42,069
(He's always worrying about Dex,
whether he's awake or asleep.)

43
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,940
There were always guys like that
in the military.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,709
You know how to use soap.

45
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,110
Even though you're talking in your sleep,
you enunciate so well.

46
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,110
I know, right?

47
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,179
(Even in his sleep, he praises
Dex's hygiene with great enunciation.)

48
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:54,250
Look.

49
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,479
- I'm shy.
- "I'm shy."

50
00:02:57,819 --> 00:02:59,750
(He shyly recalls...)

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,559
(his dancing machine days.)

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,559
He's even dreaming about India.

53
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:07,630
(He really is India84.)

54
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:10,830
(After his shy trip in his dreams...)

55
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,830
What was that?

56
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,000
- Since we need to check out,
- Right.

57
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
let's clean up.

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
(Day 6 of the India trip)

59
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,639
I'll head this way, then.

60
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,739
Okay.

61
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,109
See you later.

62
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:26,239
We got some free time in New Delhi.

63
00:03:27,109 --> 00:03:30,319
Since Kian84 and Dex work out...

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,280
I don't really work out.

65
00:03:33,889 --> 00:03:35,620
There's quite a lot to buy.

66
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,519
I haven't been
to this three-way intersection in a while.

67
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:39,889
This is a very famous intersection.

68
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:42,389
A long time ago, I stayed near here.
That's right.

69
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,799
(This guy, who is lost in his memories,)

70
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,370
(became famous
because of his India video.)

71
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,340
You really did become famous
because of your India video on YouTube.

72
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,470
(His 3rd time traveling in India)

73
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,069
He knows more about India
than any other Korean person.

74
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,109
(I became popular
because of my India video,)

75
00:03:58,109 --> 00:04:00,479
(but I got too angry at Indian people
while I was in India.)

76
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:03,880
(He felt indebted because he felt bad.)

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,250
(On this trip,)

78
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,090
(I want to be a bit kinder...)

79
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:10,049
(to Indian people.)

80
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,259
- Right.
- I think it's impressive...

81
00:04:13,259 --> 00:04:14,389
- that you wanted to repay their kindness.
- I agree.

82
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,859
What else do I have to do?

83
00:04:16,229 --> 00:04:17,630
I didn't exchange currency.

84
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:19,500
I'll exchange currency first.

85
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:21,299
(Visiting a currency exchange counter
for his first task)

86
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:22,329
Hello.

87
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:24,739
- How much is one dollar?
- How much do you want to exchange?

88
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,239
Five hundred.

89
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,970
I'll give you 41,500 rupees.

90
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:32,009
First, I'll check the exchange rate
on an app.

91
00:04:32,009 --> 00:04:33,239
(India Genius' currency exchange method,
1. Check the exchange rate on an app.)

92
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,350
You calculate it first?

93
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,509
Oh, okay. Good.

94
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:38,750
Two thousand. Three thousand.

95
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,650
Okay. Correct. Yes.

96
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,949
- It was a nice transaction.
- Nice.

97
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:44,789
- Bye.
- You really are the India expert.

98
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:47,130
- He really is reliable.
- It's smooth sailing.

99
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:48,130
Yes.

100
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:50,829
I did buy some clothes yesterday, but...

101
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,000
(What?)

102
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,030
That place earlier was 81,
but this place is 84.

103
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,199
Their exchange rate is much better.

104
00:04:57,799 --> 00:04:59,769
Gosh. Pani Bottle gets scammed too.

105
00:05:00,769 --> 00:05:03,039
Let's not think about exchanges
that we already made.

106
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:07,750
(Being positive for a nice trip)

107
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:10,419
Paharganj is a very famous place,

108
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:12,150
but I didn't get to look around much.

109
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,750
- Paharganj.
- What?

110
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:15,350
- Do Yeon.
- Oh, yes.

111
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,419
Paharganj is very cool right now.

112
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:19,720
- Paharganj.
- Oh, really? Let me explain to you...

113
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,389
- how cool it is.
- Please explain to us.

114
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,460
Right now, Pani Bottle...

115
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,830
is in Paharganj,
an area close to New Delhi station.

116
00:05:27,229 --> 00:05:30,739
There are lots of restaurants and lodgings
that are popular with tourists,

117
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:32,739
so it's known as the tourist street.

118
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:34,710
Because it's near the station,

119
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:37,679
it's also called the base camp
for travelers who start their trip...

120
00:05:37,679 --> 00:05:39,439
- in New Delhi.
- I see.

121
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,580
Paharganj.

122
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,679
After I eat, I need to go to a hair salon.

123
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,320
- Are you Pani Bottle?
- Oh, hello.

124
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,989
- Can I take a picture?
- Yes.

125
00:05:47,989 --> 00:05:49,020
Do they recognize you?

126
00:05:49,489 --> 00:05:50,720
Are they Korean?

127
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,359
- Hello.
- Oh, my goodness.

128
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:54,989
What are the chances
of running into you here?

129
00:05:54,989 --> 00:05:56,429
I'm on a trip.

130
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,400
- Yes.
- My friend likes Pani Bottle.

131
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,100
- Oh, I see.
- Are you Pani Bottle?

132
00:06:00,499 --> 00:06:02,530
- Yes, Pani Bottle.
- Pani Bottle?

133
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:04,070
Do you know who I am?

134
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:05,239
- I do.
- How?

135
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,309
Pani Bottle is a very famous star.

136
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:09,340
(Pani Bottle is a very famous star.)

137
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,640
He can't get seven million views...

138
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,510
- with just Korean people watching.
- I'm traveling again.

139
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,710
- People overseas watched him a lot too.
- Really?

140
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,080
- Really?
- What?

141
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,080
Really?

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,179
- Did he say, "Really?"
- Oh, my goodness.

143
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:20,720
Yes, really.
Why would there be a fake one?

144
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,450
- Pani Bottle. My brother is very famous.
- Okay.

145
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,660
- I'll show you.
- Is someone there?

146
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,789
(Pani Bottle ends up following him.)

147
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,660
Do you know Naveen?

148
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,330
- Naveen?
- Yes.

149
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,600
I've seen him on YouTube.

150
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:39,140
He's an Indian guide
that is very famous with Korean people...

151
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,739
- who travel to India.
- I see.

152
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:43,369
I saw you. I saw you before on YouTube.

153
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:44,379
(Naveen, India travel guide)

154
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:46,809
Oh, right. I need to get a SIM card.

155
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:47,850
Okay, Pani Bottle.

156
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:50,720
- Here's my passport and 300 rupees.
- Okay.

157
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:52,619
Do a lot of Korean people come lately?

158
00:06:52,619 --> 00:06:53,650
Yes, Pani Bottle.

159
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:57,619
Because of you, so many people come here.

160
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:00,859
- You're Pani Bottle, right?
- Yes.

161
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:02,489
(Are you really Pani Bottle?)

162
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:03,629
I'll show you.

163
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,460
- What's wrong?
- Oh, my.

164
00:07:06,799 --> 00:07:08,499
(He's so moved
that he drops his head into his palms.)

165
00:07:08,499 --> 00:07:10,570
What's wrong?
I didn't expect this big of a reaction.

166
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,470
Because a lot of people go to India...

167
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,669
- after seeing Pani Bottle.
- Right.

168
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,470
(Naveen is a successful fan
that got to meet his savior.)

169
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,840
- I'll show you.
- I'm very happy to see you.

170
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,350
Oh, my goodness.

171
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:23,609
Since I look quite normal,

172
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,879
people might not believe me.

173
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,320
I'm really surprised.

174
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,020
- Here. Pani Bottle.
- Oh, my gosh.

175
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,059
- Right there.
- Oh, my.

176
00:07:31,059 --> 00:07:32,660
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my.

177
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,760
- That's a real reaction.
- He's being sincere.

178
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,989
- Seriously.
- This is real.

179
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,129
I'm getting goosebumps.

180
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,729
He's basically...

181
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:40,669
- a fan at a Michael Jackson concert.
- This is crazy.

182
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:42,600
- That's how fans look when they see him.
- Right. He's a fan.

183
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:44,999
(Calm down, my heart.)

184
00:07:44,999 --> 00:07:46,100
Gosh. This is crazy.

185
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,410
- Pani Bottle.
- Yes?

186
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,570
I don't need...

187
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,210
- I don't need money.
- He doesn't need money?

188
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,379
- I won't take it.
- He doesn't need money?

189
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:53,979
(Pani Jackson is surprised.)

190
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:55,850
- Please.
- You need to let me pay.

191
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,919
- I promised a lot of Korean people.
- Okay.

192
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:00,220
- When I see Pani Bottle,
- Okay.

193
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:03,220
I want to give him a free SIM card.

194
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,390
- Everything will be free.
- Oh, my.

195
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,289
Please.

196
00:08:07,059 --> 00:08:08,830
Then I'll do something for you.

197
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,799
I'll buy you a meal. Okay?

198
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:12,460
- Are you okay with a meal?
- Okay.

199
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,400
- This is how you become...
- Oh, my.

200
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,539
I should put one there too.

201
00:08:17,869 --> 00:08:19,100
I'll put this...

202
00:08:20,369 --> 00:08:22,140
(Will he?)

203
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,710
I'll put one there.

204
00:08:25,309 --> 00:08:26,539
(Clapping like a seal)

205
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,010
(Oh, my gosh)

206
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,309
He's that happy?

207
00:08:30,619 --> 00:08:32,679
- Over there.
- Let's put it there.

208
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:36,720
(How much more)

209
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,789
(He has dreamt of this moment.)

210
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,530
- Thank you.
- That is the best memory.

211
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,830
Should I sign it here?

212
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,330
What is that?

213
00:08:47,770 --> 00:08:48,929
Pani Bottle!

214
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,330
- That surprised me.
- This looks a bit...

215
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,840
like a wanted poster.

216
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:53,070
(I won't hurt you.)

217
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,140
A wanted poster.

218
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,470
I can sign on the wall here.

219
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,539
(Leaving an autograph
so people can recognize him)

220
00:08:58,309 --> 00:08:59,640
(Leaving a big autograph on the wall)

221
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,280
- Look at him signing the wall.
- Oh, my.

222
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,010
- Oh, my.
- That's what celebrities do.

223
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,650
(Copying what celebrities always do)

224
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,150
After Jae Seok and Park Ji Sung,

225
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,289
- it's...
- Yu Jae Seok, Park Ji Sung,

226
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,619
- Pani Bottle. Let's go.
- Pani Bottle.

227
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,590
Gosh.

228
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,890
(Feeling dazed)

229
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:14,289
I have watched all of your videos.

230
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,359
Did you see the video where I was angry?

231
00:09:16,359 --> 00:09:17,400
Of course.

232
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,970
(Haggling is unavoidable
on an India trip.)

233
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:22,499
(You're a liar!)

234
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:26,169
(Angry Bottle didn't back down.)

235
00:09:26,169 --> 00:09:29,010
I have videos
where I show cool parts of India,

236
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,039
but videos where I criticize it as well.
What about sorry?

237
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:34,510
I don't mean to say India is bad
and that you shouldn't go there.

238
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,150
I was just expressing my wish...

239
00:09:36,479 --> 00:09:39,749
for these small things to be improved,
so that India can become a country...

240
00:09:39,749 --> 00:09:41,950
where everyone can be happy.

241
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:44,460
I thought Indian people...

242
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:47,359
who have seen that video
may think badly of me.

243
00:09:47,489 --> 00:09:49,259
But I felt he understood me.

244
00:09:49,259 --> 00:09:50,629
I was very happy.

245
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,100
- He's so happy.
- You must be proud.

246
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:53,460
It's so beautiful.

247
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,029
What a crazy thing to happen.

248
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,869
I didn't think Indian people
would be waiting for me.

249
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:04,680
Okay!

250
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,739
(Setting up the SIM card
that Pani Bottle received as a gift)

251
00:10:05,739 --> 00:10:07,139
- Let's go.
- Okay.

252
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,450
- We'll be back.
- Okay.

253
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,779
- Have a nice break.
- Okay.

254
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,820
- Naveen. I'll buy.
- Yes?

255
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,749
Let's go to an expensive place.

256
00:10:13,749 --> 00:10:15,550
- And I will buy.
- Okay.

257
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,649
You promise me.

258
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,759
- Okay.
- I will buy.

259
00:10:18,989 --> 00:10:19,989
Hello.

260
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,460
Oh, the view!

261
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,389
The view is nice.

262
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,060
You went to a nice restaurant.

263
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,029
Wait. It's here.

264
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,070
Dal. This is chicken.

265
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,470
- Chicken? Okay.
- Yes.

266
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,139
When I'm not tired, I can drink.

267
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:37,639
(Taking a bite of chapati dipped in curry)

268
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:38,979
(Thumbs up)

269
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,879
- This place is good.
- Yes.

270
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,450
(Eating)

271
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,920
(Eating more)

272
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,450
I didn't really like Indian food,
but why is this so tasty?

273
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,019
(Taking a big bite)

274
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:50,190
Dex and I lost weight,

275
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:51,720
- but he came back a bit heavier.
- Really?

276
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,790
It's true because he ate well.

277
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:56,159
You looked a bit chubby
in your interview earlier.

278
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,499
(Happy Bottle)

279
00:11:00,129 --> 00:11:02,970
(Happy Bottle
finally grew to like Indian food.)

280
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:05,399
(Feeling content)

281
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,170
Gosh. I'm full.

282
00:11:07,769 --> 00:11:09,869
(Puffy)

283
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,180
Do you learn Korean...

284
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,950
from Korean people?

285
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,950
Yes.

286
00:11:15,479 --> 00:11:17,009
I know a good saying.

287
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:21,519
Pani Bottle's form is insane.

288
00:11:21,989 --> 00:11:24,790
(Your Korean form is insane.)

289
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:26,619
(Truly touched)

290
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:27,989
Your form is insane.

291
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:29,629
Where did you learn that?

292
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:31,029
That's so new.

293
00:11:31,729 --> 00:11:33,029
You're good at Korean.

294
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,129
(While Pani Bottle has a fan-meet...)

295
00:11:34,729 --> 00:11:39,200
Hi, everyone. Today,
Kian84 and I will head to the gym first.

296
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:42,540
Today, I'm planning to give myself
ample time to go to the gym...

297
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,279
and work out.

298
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,310
So I'm searching for gyms in India.

299
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,149
Today will be a new start.

300
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,519
- Okay.
- With a fresh mindset.

301
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:53,720
I guess your body has finished recovering.

302
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:55,320
I seem to be feeling a lot better.

303
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,850
- I'm in good spirits.
- We'll catch a ride...

304
00:11:57,119 --> 00:11:59,889
and head to the gym.

305
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:00,889
A gym nut.

306
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,290
Excuse me.

307
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:06,399
I want to go here.

308
00:12:07,229 --> 00:12:08,399
Okay? You don't know?

309
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,769
(Just get in.)

310
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:10,800
- What?
- Just get in?

311
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,300
Oh, thank you.

312
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,570
How much?

313
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,009
(A deep gaze)

314
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,009
What a gentle smile.

315
00:12:18,009 --> 00:12:19,580
He won't tell us how much it is.

316
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,149
Well, let's just go and haggle later.

317
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,279
(Let's haggle later.)

318
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,749
(The gym rats get going
without haggling...)

319
00:12:25,749 --> 00:12:27,649
(to prevent muscle loss.)

320
00:12:27,649 --> 00:12:29,690
I didn't lose weight
even when I went to South America.

321
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:31,590
But are you losing weight here?

322
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,029
I think I've lost 2kg
since coming to India.

323
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,930
- When bodybuilders are cutting,
- Yes.

324
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,259
- they can come to India.
- But the problem...

325
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,869
is that they'll lose muscle too.

326
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,570
Fitness fanatics can't tolerate that.

327
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,300
- Muscle loss is bad.
- Kian84 likes to talk...

328
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,340
- about fitness.
- Right.

329
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,340
- You get along well.
- Yes, we had that in common.

330
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:55,009
(The origin of India's cultural heritage,
New Delhi)

331
00:12:55,009 --> 00:12:56,149
(India Gate)

332
00:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,379
- Gosh.
- That's amazing.

333
00:12:57,379 --> 00:12:58,479
- That is so amazing.
- It's cool.

334
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,450
(There are so many things to see.)

335
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:01,850
I'm seeing that for the first time now.

336
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,450
(I'm seeing that for the first time now.)

337
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:06,460
(The two only looked for the gym.)

338
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,389
We were urgently searching for a gym...

339
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:10,659
rather than historical sites or temples.

340
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,300
We have separate footage for that.

341
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,470
- Yes, that's enough.
- Just get a good look.

342
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,800
- Okay, here.
- Here. Stop.

343
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,470
- Stay.
- Okay.

344
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:23,340
- Stay.
- Stay.

345
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,840
Good.

346
00:13:26,409 --> 00:13:27,580
How much?

347
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:29,479
It's 500 rupees.

348
00:13:29,749 --> 00:13:30,820
It's 500 rupees.

349
00:13:31,149 --> 00:13:32,420
- What?
- It's 500 rupees.

350
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,950
(Very close)

351
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,519
Did you sit on his lap?

352
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:38,690
I was trying to bargain on a softer mood.

353
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,930
"On a softer mood?"
I thought you were trying to crush him.

354
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,090
Too expensive.

355
00:13:42,259 --> 00:13:44,159
Our Dex...

356
00:13:44,359 --> 00:13:46,600
Is he dating, or is he bargaining?

357
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,670
Three, five, zero.

358
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,729
(Shaking)

359
00:13:49,729 --> 00:13:51,600
Come on. Me too, no.

360
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:53,800
He sounds so sweet.

361
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:55,840
Three, five, zero. Okay?

362
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,869
Okay.

363
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:58,779
I think they've reached an agreement.

364
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,139
Okay, thank you.

365
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,409
- Bye.
- Bye.

366
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,609
The ride was about 20 to 30 minutes,

367
00:14:02,609 --> 00:14:04,580
and it cost about 5 or 6 dollars.

368
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,820
- That was good.
- That's enough.

369
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:09,249
This is the gym Dex found.

370
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,619
I want to use the gym for one day.

371
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,259
How much do I have to pay?

372
00:14:15,359 --> 00:14:17,259
- It's 1,000 rupees.
- It's 1,000?

373
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:20,200
(Will he bargain the price of 16 dollars?)

374
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,700
- Okay. It's quite expensive.
- What?

375
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,800
- It's 16 dollars.
- It was a fixed price.

376
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,499
I don't bargain anywhere.

377
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:28,940
I respect the system
when it's a fixed price.

378
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,409
We need 1,000 more each.

379
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:32,639
(Gasping)

380
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,180
We really came to a decent place.

381
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:37,820
It's about 16 dollars.

382
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:42,119
(He always said, "Enough.")

383
00:14:42,489 --> 00:14:44,190
- Here's 2,000.
- They are at a nice gym.

384
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,359
Thank you.

385
00:14:45,359 --> 00:14:46,389
(For 2 daily gym passes,
2,000 rupees, 32 dollars)

386
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,590
I will show you the gym.

387
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,830
Okay, show me.

388
00:14:49,729 --> 00:14:51,659
This is the sacred spot
for muscles in India.

389
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,560
(They enter the sacred spot
for muscles in India.)

390
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,570
Okay.

391
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,899
Gyms always have...

392
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:03,509
club music like this.

393
00:15:03,909 --> 00:15:06,879
These are sandbags
that look like percussion instruments.

394
00:15:07,109 --> 00:15:08,609
Like this.

395
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:11,979
(The tough guy uses his fists right away.)

396
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,950
But his bag has an elephant on it.

397
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,019
(Help)

398
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:16,220
You're good.

399
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,320
You look cool.

400
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,190
Show us how you do it.

401
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,560
(He wants to look cool.)

402
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:22,659
Gosh, your steps.

403
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,690
(Swish)

404
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,529
(Body, jab, hook)

405
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:27,729
You have good form.

406
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,800
- Okay.
- Body.

407
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,869
- How many times are you hitting it?
- Look.

408
00:15:32,869 --> 00:15:35,409
You have to use your body, not your hands.

409
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:36,710
- Your body.
- Gosh.

410
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,279
- Do you get it?
- That's cool.

411
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,009
- You look cool for the first time.
- Okay?

412
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,950
- When you fight.
- Okay.

413
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:43,509
- Use your body if you have to fight.
- Okay.

414
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:44,680
- Okay.
- Yes.

415
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,080
That was easy.

416
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,090
Then,

417
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:49,950
- let's work out our muscles first.
- Muscles first.

418
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,220
Okay, let's go.

419
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,830
(Legs first)

420
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:56,830
Look at his legs.

421
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,629
These ten are warm-ups.

422
00:15:58,930 --> 00:15:59,930
Let's go with 100.

423
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,229
You just add more weight right away.

424
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,700
(Total of 100kg)

425
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,300
I wanted to use the pent-up energy.

426
00:16:07,369 --> 00:16:08,869
Destroy it!

427
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,810
I can still feel it while watching this.

428
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:15,109
(The older guy also joins in
the happiness.)

429
00:16:15,609 --> 00:16:16,810
Right there.

430
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,550
Your back...

431
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,149
(Exercising with their faces)

432
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,149
(Concentrating)

433
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:25,690
- That's it.
- Yes.

434
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,590
- You can lift it.
- Okay.

435
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,659
Gosh.

436
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,930
(After lifting some heavy weights)

437
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:33,399
I think I'm going to poop.

438
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:35,029
I had trouble...

439
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,830
going to the toilet here,

440
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,540
but it got my stomach working.

441
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:41,840
(His stomach keeps getting stimulated.)

442
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,710
- Gosh.
- Good.

443
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,080
That's good.

444
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,680
- Good.
- That was good.

445
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:48,009
- Gosh.
- Good.

446
00:16:48,109 --> 00:16:49,580
I need to use the toilet.

447
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,749
(Too much stimulation)

448
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:54,180
You have to tighten your butt.

449
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,220
(While the older guy is gone,)

450
00:16:55,489 --> 00:16:57,320
(the younger guy follows
the Indian musclemen.)

451
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:58,659
Yes, sir.

452
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,759
(Working on shoulders)

453
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,290
They're all filming.

454
00:17:03,590 --> 00:17:04,659
- Up.
- Up.

455
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,729
(His stable posture
makes them want to film.)

456
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,070
(He became silly after gaining muscle
for the first time in a while.)

457
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,899
- That's good.
- I was so excited.

458
00:17:11,399 --> 00:17:13,369
He's going to hold it, right?

459
00:17:13,369 --> 00:17:14,440
(He is back after emptying his stomach.)

460
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:16,210
Let's go.

461
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,279
- Good.
- Good.

462
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:20,040
I can feel the determination in your eyes.

463
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,050
Yes.

464
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:22,109
(His eyes make him look
like the top-tier gym guy.)

465
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,180
Look at that.

466
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,649
Give me power.

467
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,680
(Slap)

468
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,190
- Three, two. Very nice.
- Good.

469
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:30,220
Up.

470
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,759
It's light.

471
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,759
(Shiny eyes)

472
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,290
You can do it! Come on!

473
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:35,529
Up!

474
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:37,290
Six.

475
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,460
- Isn't that Yang Se Chan?
- Yang Se Chan?

476
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,899
(His face did all the work.)

477
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,300
Your eyes are bloodshot.

478
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,540
- That's what makes me cool.
- Your eyes are red.

479
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,940
- Is that what's cool?
- It is.

480
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:51,979
(That's what makes me cool.)

481
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:54,310
It made me excited to meet
the strong guys.

482
00:17:54,310 --> 00:17:55,379
Okay.

483
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,409
The strong Indian musclemen...

484
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,220
helped us with the plates...

485
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,649
and spotted us,

486
00:18:01,649 --> 00:18:03,820
saying, "One more."

487
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,259
"Last one." And that made me feel...

488
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,229
like we were being connected
through muscles.

489
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,760
The world coming together with muscles.

490
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:16,600
Muscle diplomacy.
That's what it felt like.

491
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,139
- Okay, you...
- Dex.

492
00:18:18,439 --> 00:18:19,939
I think this is it for me.

493
00:18:19,939 --> 00:18:22,240
- Okay.
- I did enough today.

494
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,209
Okay, then we will wrap up this session,

495
00:18:24,209 --> 00:18:25,340
and I will work out some more.

496
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,550
I like cardio more than lifting,

497
00:18:29,949 --> 00:18:31,350
so I'm here to do cardio.

498
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:34,179
(Panting)

499
00:18:34,179 --> 00:18:35,790
(Blowing)

500
00:18:35,949 --> 00:18:37,649
Did you just blow your nose on your shirt?

501
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,659
Yes.

502
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,520
It got sweaty anyway.

503
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,290
- It's from your own nose anyway.
- I know.

504
00:18:43,189 --> 00:18:44,699
(The younger guy keeps working
on his muscles.)

505
00:18:44,699 --> 00:18:45,800
Okay.

506
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,730
Did you visit Varanasi?

507
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,030
Varanasi.

508
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,169
I lived in Varanasi...

509
00:18:51,169 --> 00:18:53,040
two years ago.

510
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,340
Two days ago.

511
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,810
So I came here.

512
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,879
Wrestling and Ganges.

513
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,980
- Wrestling.
- Do you like it?

514
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:06,649
I like fighting one-on-one.

515
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:08,090
- Yes.
- Yes.

516
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,820
Please train me.

517
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,419
- Yes, let's go.
- Okay.

518
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:12,689
Let's go upstairs.

519
00:19:12,689 --> 00:19:13,889
I was going to learn.

520
00:19:14,689 --> 00:19:16,060
- Are you going to do it here?
- Give it a try.

521
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,730
These guys' bodies show that
they are athletes.

522
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:21,669
He said he wanted to fight.

523
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:23,300
What do you mean?

524
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:24,740
It's just sports.

525
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,169
(The sportsmen gather upstairs.)

526
00:19:29,709 --> 00:19:31,679
They are going to the rooftop.

527
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,379
- Gosh, this is...
- It was a good place to spar.

528
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,580
Full power.

529
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,649
- Okay.
- Okay?

530
00:19:37,649 --> 00:19:39,149
- You show me.
- Okay.

531
00:19:39,149 --> 00:19:41,389
- I want to feel your power.
- Okay.

532
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:42,520
Okay, thank you, sir.

533
00:19:43,189 --> 00:19:45,889
(He wrestled for the first time
at the Akhara.)

534
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,560
(He could not forget the defeat.)

535
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,760
He was defeated at the Akhara.

536
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:52,399
(Will he get even in New Delhi?)

537
00:19:54,929 --> 00:19:57,100
(They promptly go head-to-head.)

538
00:19:57,669 --> 00:20:00,100
(Full power versus full power)

539
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,240
(Slip)

540
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,310
I'm nervous.

541
00:20:02,439 --> 00:20:05,109
(The men fight roughly.)

542
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,310
(He tries to lift the leg.)

543
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:08,750
It did not work.

544
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:10,379
Gosh, there he goes.

545
00:20:10,449 --> 00:20:12,149
- Oh, gosh.
- Goodness.

546
00:20:12,149 --> 00:20:14,379
- Oh, gosh.
- That's very nice.

547
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,619
(He was overturned and ended up losing.)

548
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:20,419
(It hurts to watch.)

549
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:21,490
Does he have to go to the hospital again?

550
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:24,030
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

551
00:20:25,729 --> 00:20:28,200
- This is where he got hurt.
- This is it.

552
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,229
Gosh.

553
00:20:29,229 --> 00:20:30,430
He went too hard.

554
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,739
Our faces hit each other.

555
00:20:34,269 --> 00:20:35,400
It's okay.

556
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,039
(You have wounds on your face.)

557
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,880
This is brotherhood.

558
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,809
I was fine.

559
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:44,580
I think of it as a glorious wound.

560
00:20:45,009 --> 00:20:46,319
Thank you so much.

561
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:48,680
You can sit here.

562
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,549
(Signs of brotherhood)

563
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:53,259
- Come on.
- Hey.

564
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:56,360
You were totally beaten up.

565
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,360
The bandages are a bit big
compared to the size of the wounds.

566
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,900
- Yes.
- They are glorious wounds.

567
00:21:01,959 --> 00:21:04,469
I said they were glorious wounds,

568
00:21:04,469 --> 00:21:06,340
but I was scared that
they would leave scars.

569
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,600
- That's why.
- My stomach hurts.

570
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,670
Did they go away?

571
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:12,039
- I still have some light ones on my nose.
- Really?

572
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,309
I look a lot nicer now.

573
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,410
- I softened up so much.
- You're right.

574
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:18,450
You got hurt while acting up in India.

575
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:20,279
I guess I was getting stressed...

576
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,479
while I was traveling here,

577
00:21:22,479 --> 00:21:24,890
but I was at a place
where I could relieve it.

578
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:27,620
I was so into it at that moment,

579
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,160
with an adrenaline rush.

580
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,729
I think I was happiest in that moment.

581
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,830
- As long as you had no regrets.
- Yes.

582
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:37,330
- No way.
- He's not an ordinary guy.

583
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:39,999
It was a therapeutic time for me.

584
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,840
(Panting)

585
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,910
(Slowly sneaking over)

586
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,279
(Spotting Dex)

587
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:49,650
You're bleeding on your nose.

588
00:21:50,049 --> 00:21:52,410
Do you still have to exercise?

589
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:53,719
No, let's go.

590
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,390
Dex...

591
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,160
has wounds on his face. He's bleeding.

592
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,920
He keeps...

593
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,360
making me feel sad.

594
00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,100
He's sad.

595
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,729
He never shows his feelings to your face.

596
00:22:09,729 --> 00:22:11,370
He pretends not to care.

597
00:22:12,469 --> 00:22:14,269
(The guy who pretends not to care
looks for a pharmacy.)

598
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,769
Wait, is this it?

599
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:18,670
This one. Medicine.

600
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,140
Pharmacy.

601
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,739
(Pharmacy)

602
00:22:21,739 --> 00:22:22,979
I thought he said anesthesia for the arm.

603
00:22:22,979 --> 00:22:24,180
- "Pharmacy."
- I thought it was for anesthesia...

604
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:25,650
- "Anesthesia?"
- on his arm.

605
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,650
"Anesthesia."

606
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,650
Hello.

607
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,120
This ointment.

608
00:22:30,549 --> 00:22:31,620
- "Ointment?"
- This one?

609
00:22:32,289 --> 00:22:34,090
- And... What is "disinfectant?"
- Disinfectant.

610
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:35,559
- Alcohol gauze.
- Alcohol?

611
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,229
To wash blood.

612
00:22:37,229 --> 00:22:38,860
Yes, to wash blood.

613
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,130
To wash the blood, please.

614
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,299
- I will pay for this.
- Do you...

615
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,600
Okay.

616
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,940
And for mountain sickness...

617
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,170
- We're going to the Everest.
- We're going to the Everest.

618
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,239
Everest?

619
00:22:52,239 --> 00:22:53,680
- It's the Himalayas.
- It's the Himalayas.

620
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,080
- We said "Everest."
- The Himalayas.

621
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,279
- We didn't notice.
- Yes.

622
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,410
- We're going to the Everest.
- For headaches on the Everest.

623
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,950
High level...

624
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:02,049
(I want to breath, headache,
high altitude)

625
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:03,120
Headache...

626
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,390
- Medicine.
- Medicine.

627
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,959
Do you have Tylenol?

628
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:08,319
Tylenol?

629
00:23:09,259 --> 00:23:10,860
Oxygen? Yes, we need this.

630
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,029
- We need this.
- Yes, I need this.

631
00:23:12,029 --> 00:23:15,059
We got three, including Pani Bottle's.

632
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:16,330
- Okay.
- We need more?

633
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:17,330
Yes, that's right.

634
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,029
- Bye.
- Have a nice day.

635
00:23:19,029 --> 00:23:20,469
- You have a nice day too.
- Have a nice day.

636
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's disinfect this first.

637
00:23:23,809 --> 00:23:26,779
Look at him holding it
with the tip of his fingers.

638
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:27,779
Sure.

639
00:23:27,779 --> 00:23:29,340
Normally, you would have just grabbed it.

640
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,749
I would have touched it all over.

641
00:23:30,749 --> 00:23:31,779
I'm good at this.

642
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,049
He can be delicate when he needs to.

643
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:36,549
- This is how charming he is.
- Yes.

644
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:38,019
He wouldn't have done that
if it was his own wound.

645
00:23:38,019 --> 00:23:39,019
- Sure.
- Sure.

646
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:41,219
He was careful since it was me.

647
00:23:41,219 --> 00:23:42,289
Yes.

648
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,989
- Hello, hi.
- Okay, hello.

649
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,059
Hello. I'm your big fan.

650
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:47,100
- Did she recognize you?
- Okay.

651
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,400
- Hello.
- From "Single's Inferno?"

652
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,969
Hello. I'm your big fan.

653
00:23:49,969 --> 00:23:51,229
- Really?
- Yes.

654
00:23:51,229 --> 00:23:52,940
- Did you watch "Single's Inferno?"
- Dex has no time...

655
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,799
- to apply ointment.
- Okay.

656
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,239
- Thank you so much.
- Can we take...

657
00:23:56,239 --> 00:23:58,069
Please wait until he's done
with the treatment.

658
00:23:58,069 --> 00:23:59,469
Okay, wait a moment, please.

659
00:23:59,779 --> 00:24:02,840
(He is careful until the end.)

660
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,150
- Okay, well...
- Finished.

661
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,150
- Let me take a picture with her.
- Okay.

662
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,680
Okay.

663
00:24:08,779 --> 00:24:09,989
- Gosh.
- Oh, my gosh.

664
00:24:10,489 --> 00:24:12,590
Do you know him?

665
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,860
- Yes.
- You do?

666
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:15,660
"Single's Inferno," right?

667
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,860
Yes, I watched it.

668
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,489
- He's so famous.
- Okay, picture.

669
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:20,499
Yes.

670
00:24:20,499 --> 00:24:23,229
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle had gone to look
for a hair salon.)

671
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:26,640
This is not bad, right?

672
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,700
(Over there)

673
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,140
(Streetside hair salon)

674
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,269
- Yes, this one.
- Gosh.

675
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,979
It's like a barbershop.

676
00:24:35,539 --> 00:24:37,410
- Ram Ram Ji.
- Ram Ram Ji.

677
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,049
- Ram Ram Ji.
- Ram Ram Ji.

678
00:24:39,549 --> 00:24:41,150
Can you tell him
I just want a slight trim?

679
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,180
Yes.

680
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,489
Slight.

681
00:24:45,819 --> 00:24:47,519
A lot of Korean people
must have come here.

682
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,519
That's right.

683
00:24:50,090 --> 00:24:52,059
I see. They come here often.

684
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,229
- I'm curious.
- Here.

685
00:24:54,229 --> 00:24:55,259
Okay.

686
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,830
- Could you film this?
- Yes.

687
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,200
It will turn on if you press this.

688
00:24:58,200 --> 00:24:59,330
- Okay.
- Yes.

689
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,440
Naveen is filming now.

690
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:05,809
Naveen might cry...

691
00:25:05,809 --> 00:25:07,979
- when he sees this later on.
- "Naveen TV."

692
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:11,150
(Oh my gosh, "Naveen TV?")

693
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:14,749
- Your glasses.
- Glasses.

694
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:18,690
(He puts the glasses
on the glasses holder.)

695
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:22,620
(Even putting on the gown)

696
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,059
- Just a little bit?
- Little bit.

697
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,029
(Buzz)

698
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:30,029
He's cutting boldly.

699
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,029
(Buzz)

700
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,370
He's cutting boldly.

701
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,600
He's moving without hesitation.

702
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:39,209
Your eyes are shaking.

703
00:25:40,509 --> 00:25:42,039
Is this your first time in India?

704
00:25:42,479 --> 00:25:43,709
No, it's not my first time.

705
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:45,680
It's my third time.

706
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,319
(Is that right?)

707
00:25:47,319 --> 00:25:48,580
He's moving without hesitation.

708
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,920
(His movements are drawing attention.)

709
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:53,860
I think he misunderstood me
when I said "a little bit."

710
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:56,160
(Hair)

711
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,989
That's a bit too much...

712
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,259
Your head is turning bare.

713
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:01,959
(Laughing)

714
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,930
I...

715
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:07,370
told him "a little bit,"

716
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,940
but it feels like a shave.

717
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:11,269
(A heap of hair)

718
00:26:11,910 --> 00:26:13,880
(Focused)

719
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,910
This is Indian style, right?

720
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,749
Indian army style.

721
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:20,850
"Army style?" Okay.

722
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:21,920
I'm curious.

723
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,390
(The Indian army style is being finished.)

724
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:26,590
(He cuts his bangs without hesitation.)

725
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,090
You look handsome.

726
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:30,529
(What?)

727
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:31,989
Your sides...

728
00:26:31,989 --> 00:26:33,200
- are bare.
- His bangs...

729
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,600
Is that a broom?

730
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,799
That's just skin.

731
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,029
- "A broom?"
- "A broom?"

732
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:39,499
His head has a dent
because of his glasses.

733
00:26:39,499 --> 00:26:40,640
Yes.

734
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,700
(The dent for his glasses)

735
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:43,640
He looks younger.

736
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,670
(He restored his youth from
a 35-year-old to a 5-year old.)

737
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,809
A little bit.

738
00:26:45,809 --> 00:26:47,680
No. This is a lot.

739
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,340
- A lot?
- This is a lot.

740
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:54,450
(Pani Bottle said,
"Please cut a little bit.")

741
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,819
(The barber took it as,
"I will leave a little bit.")

742
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:57,789
He thought you wanted a little bit left.

743
00:26:57,789 --> 00:26:59,390
(There was some miscommunication.)

744
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,259
It's okay.

745
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,029
It's the army style.

746
00:27:04,029 --> 00:27:05,330
(It's okay since it's the army style.)

747
00:27:06,729 --> 00:27:09,870
(Nice Bottle never loses his smile.)

748
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:12,769
I think I'm done. Just a little bit.

749
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:15,900
(A little bit more?)

750
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,269
- I think he needs to stop.
- Yes.

751
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:21,410
Wait, I shouldn't say that.

752
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:26,080
Gosh.

753
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:28,049
Gosh.

754
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,190
(Hair)

755
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,690
He's bold.

756
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,819
He can cut that straight
without a bowl on his head?

757
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,130
(This is where he got
his short hairstyle from.)

758
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,400
(The fun part of traveling is
when things don't go as planned.)

759
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,559
Oh, no.

760
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,670
I think he's crying.

761
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:46,200
Is he crying or laughing?

762
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,539
(Laughing)

763
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,009
(He wipes his tears with laughter.)

764
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,640
I'm sweating.

765
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,880
Are you done?

766
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,910
No, one minute.

767
00:27:58,110 --> 00:27:59,610
- What is that?
- Is that sunscreen?

768
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,120
He's getting skincare.

769
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,580
It smells good.

770
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,249
It smells like soap.

771
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,719
Is it sunscreen?

772
00:28:07,259 --> 00:28:08,660
Oh no.

773
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,360
- He won't let him talk.
- I know.

774
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,430
- I don't think it's sunscreen.
- No.

775
00:28:12,989 --> 00:28:15,100
(Scrubbing)

776
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,400
Look at that.

777
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,569
It looks like shoe polish.

778
00:28:19,469 --> 00:28:20,739
(He rubs without mercy.)

779
00:28:20,739 --> 00:28:22,900
- It looks like it hurts.
- He's so rough.

780
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,739
(He put on the mystery cream.)

781
00:28:28,809 --> 00:28:31,049
(A towel?)

782
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,080
- What is that?
- He's plucking it.

783
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:39,890
(Rubbing)

784
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,819
(He does threading
with a thread plucked from the towel.)

785
00:28:41,819 --> 00:28:43,430
- Is he just using a towel thread?
- Threading?

786
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,559
Gosh, that's amazing.

787
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:45,930
(Throwing away)

788
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,799
(Smack)

789
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,900
(He reuses the towel to rub it off.)

790
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,670
(He looks like he is 5 months old now.)

791
00:28:52,670 --> 00:28:54,200
- He's a newborn.
- He's really a newborn.

792
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,499
He looks like he was just born.

793
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:58,569
It's finished, right?

794
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,509
(Baby Bottle restored his youth
with a haircut and shave.)

795
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:03,610
Nice. Okay.

796
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:05,610
How much?

797
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,380
I didn't ask for the price.

798
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:13,459
(Naveen)

799
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,489
They are in a heated...

800
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,330
(Fierce bargaining)

801
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,330
- It's fiery.
- Oh, no.

802
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:22,630
Naveen must know the usual prices.

803
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:24,600
- Yes.
- It's okay. I will pay it.

804
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,170
Wait a minute.

805
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,499
(Don't fight.)

806
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:30,569
(I will pay more.)

807
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,140
Up to 300?

808
00:29:33,479 --> 00:29:35,039
I have 100.

809
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,950
- He doesn't want them to fight.
- No.

810
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:37,950
- He felt bad.
- Okay.

811
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:39,549
- Goodness.
- I heard that...

812
00:29:39,549 --> 00:29:42,420
the barber asked for 1,000 rupees.

813
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:43,690
He asked for 1,000?

814
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,150
That's too expensive.

815
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,549
No way.

816
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,489
He's firm.

817
00:29:48,489 --> 00:29:49,620
(Haircut and massage, 300 rupees,
4.8 dollars)

818
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,989
Is 300 an okay price?

819
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:52,360
Yes, that's okay.

820
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,860
I don't want to trick...

821
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,999
Okay.

822
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:58,330
I don't want to make a bad image...

823
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,900
- Yes, you're right.
- about India.

824
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:03,940
That's what people worry about the most
when traveling to India.

825
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,910
Because they think they will be scammed.

826
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,340
- That's what they think.
- Yes.

827
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:09,680
- But that needs to change.
- Yes.

828
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,150
It has to change.

829
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:13,110
Is my hair okay?

830
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,279
- It's okay.
- Be honest.

831
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:16,350
Just go like this.

832
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,019
He didn't say it right away.

833
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,660
- Like this?
- No, wait.

834
00:30:22,289 --> 00:30:23,430
But it's cute.

835
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,529
- Yes, it is.
- It suits him.

836
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:25,559
It's cute.

837
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,729
It's okay now.

838
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,160
- Is it Indian style?
- Well...

839
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,529
Okay. I'm glad.

840
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:33,100
I was...

841
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,799
When I was seven years old,

842
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,440
I had a haircut like you.

843
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:39,209
(A vague compliment)

844
00:30:39,209 --> 00:30:41,080
- Is that good?
- When he was little.

845
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
It means he looks young.

846
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,450
- I need to buy some pants.
- Yes.

847
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,450
Okay.

848
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:47,749
They're comfortable.

849
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,789
Is this Indian style? I want to buy one.

850
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,319
- Can we do henna here?
- Yes.

851
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,390
Okay.

852
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,860
This says Pani Bottle.

853
00:30:56,759 --> 00:30:58,289
- He even drew a water bottle.
- That's cool.

854
00:30:58,289 --> 00:30:59,789
- Gosh.
- That's cute.

855
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,830
(A shopping spree with his friend)

856
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:04,130
Naveen, I have to go.

857
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:07,170
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

858
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,269
(Bowing to each other)

859
00:31:08,569 --> 00:31:09,940
- I will call you.
- Okay.

860
00:31:10,269 --> 00:31:12,209
- Bye.
- Thank you for helping me.

861
00:31:12,209 --> 00:31:14,279
I didn't help with anything.

862
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:16,380
You helped me. What did I do?

863
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,709
- Thank you.
- Go on.

864
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,249
Good luck.

865
00:31:19,249 --> 00:31:20,580
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

866
00:31:21,549 --> 00:31:23,519
How can they exercise in this heat?

867
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,890
Musclemen are amazing.

868
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,959
(The musclemen are having protein
at a Korean restaurant.)

869
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,330
(When he's about done
hydrating himself...)

870
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,499
(Vibrating)

871
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,100
(It's Pani Bottle.)

872
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,200
Wait.

873
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,269
Hello?

874
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
Where are you?

875
00:31:41,499 --> 00:31:42,769
Hey, Pani Bottle.

876
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,069
We're having a meal now.

877
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,809
Can you send me the address?

878
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:48,539
Okay. I'll send it to you.

879
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,749
- Our departure time was getting close.
- Let's go.

880
00:31:50,749 --> 00:31:53,249
- Time went by quickly.
- I see.

881
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,279
We were going to meet up here
with Pani Bottle.

882
00:31:57,489 --> 00:31:59,350
(They sit on the street
outside the restaurant.)

883
00:31:59,489 --> 00:32:03,120
<i>Pani Bottle</i>

884
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:05,890
- He's here.
- Pani Bottle is here.

885
00:32:06,999 --> 00:32:09,830
Pani Bottle even brought my backpack.

886
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:11,100
Why did you get a tattoo?

887
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,930
- And he was carrying that with one arm.
- This is henna.

888
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:15,039
- What?
- Gosh, that thing is so heavy.

889
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,100
What do you have in there?

890
00:32:16,299 --> 00:32:17,840
- Sit down.
- That's exhausting. Wait.

891
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,370
(They're going to take a breather.)

892
00:32:19,709 --> 00:32:21,779
Hey, did you go to a barbershop
or a hair salon?

893
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,340
Didn't they wash your hair?

894
00:32:23,479 --> 00:32:25,450
- I want to wash up too.
- Your hair...

895
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,549
There's a fly in your hair.

896
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:28,549
A fly?

897
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:29,850
- A fly.
- There's a fly.

898
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,350
Why is there a fly in your hair?

899
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,059
I clearly told him
to just trim a little bit.

900
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,459
The barber understood me.

901
00:32:36,459 --> 00:32:39,059
He said, "A little bit," but he cut a lot.

902
00:32:39,289 --> 00:32:40,700
- So I left it up to fate.
- It's like...

903
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,930
It looks cool. It suits you.

904
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,529
I didn't get to check my hair
with a mirror yet.

905
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,769
- It's...
- It might be better to keep it that way..

906
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,499
(Joking)

907
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,069
How many hours did you work out for?

908
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,910
We worked out a bit over an hour.

909
00:32:51,910 --> 00:32:54,110
He went head-to-head with a wrestler.

910
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,640
- Look. There's a wound on his face.
- Again?

911
00:32:55,940 --> 00:32:57,779
Again? What?

912
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,410
He went up against a wrestler
from New Delhi.

913
00:32:59,410 --> 00:33:00,680
- Today?
- Yes. Today.

914
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,950
He had another wrestling match
at the gym today.

915
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:06,690
I guess he can't stop getting pumped up
when he sees someone on his level.

916
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,319
- Right.
- No. Not when I see someone on my level.

917
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:11,529
- Then someone stronger?
- It has to be someone on a higher level.

918
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,830
Then you must get sleepy when you see me.

919
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,200
- No.
- Do you get sleepy?

920
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,059
When I see you, I have zero thoughts.

921
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,029
- I'm joking.
- Did you spar too?

922
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,370
So what do we do?
Should we head to the airport now?

923
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,870
- Let's go.
- Okay. Let's go.

924
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,910
(Let's go to the airport now.)

925
00:33:28,509 --> 00:33:29,880
Right. Is this the taxi?

926
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:33,110
Nine, R, six, eight.

927
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,350
(Suddenly washing his face with sunscreen)

928
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,680
I've never seen anyone applying sunscreen
like that in my life.

929
00:33:36,989 --> 00:33:38,890
His face will never get tanned.

930
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:41,459
- Gosh, Kian84. No.
- Do you want some?

931
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:43,360
- Do you want some?
- I already applied it.

932
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,860
Gosh. I should have applied it sooner.

933
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:49,029
It was really sunny.
I had to apply a lot of it.

934
00:33:49,029 --> 00:33:50,160
(He agrees.)

935
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,430
- This won't fit.
- Then...

936
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:52,729
I'll put mine first.

937
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,069
- Dex, the bag...
- It's good.

938
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:58,410
I don't think it will weigh over 20kg.

939
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,239
Okay. Let's go.

940
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,779
- Gosh. It's hot.
- This is already getting exciting.

941
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:06,279
We're at Delhi Airport.

942
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:07,319
(Delhi Airport, 7 p.m.)

943
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:10,180
We'll fly over to Amritsar.

944
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:11,519
That's how we'll get there.

945
00:34:12,249 --> 00:34:15,459
It takes about an hour via plane.

946
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:16,519
- It's pretty close.
- Yes.

947
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:18,930
The departure time was around 9 p.m.

948
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:20,400
- We had two hours.
- You got there early.

949
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,759
- That's perfect.
- Yes.

950
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:23,200
We should eat something.

951
00:34:23,459 --> 00:34:24,830
We're not going to eat once we arrive.

952
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:25,830
(Hungry Pani Bottle is looking for food.)

953
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,469
We don't have to eat a lot.

954
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:30,640
Which one should I get?
Gosh, the rice is too much.

955
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,009
(He orders the local meal
without hesitation.)

956
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,110
(Salivating)

957
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,140
He must have been hungry.

958
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,779
We don't need this.

959
00:34:37,479 --> 00:34:39,410
I can't do it. The red medicine.

960
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,180
You're the good-looking one.
I should take care of this wound.

961
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:43,850
He looks like a baby now.

962
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:45,090
Goodness.

963
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,590
And do you want me to put on the bandage?

964
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,620
Yes.

965
00:34:48,819 --> 00:34:50,390
If I put that on you...

966
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,489
I'll look like the number-one fighter.

967
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:53,489
You look like a character in "Crows Zero."

968
00:34:55,499 --> 00:34:57,200
- He looks like the actor too.
- Right.

969
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
(Perfect for the main character
of a teen action film)

970
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:00,499
You wanted me to put it horizontally.

971
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:02,469
- Gosh, Kian84 is sweet.
- I see. This is it.

972
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,209
(Turning into the number-one fighter)

973
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,080
(Pulling up his camera)

974
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,239
He likes it.

975
00:35:10,239 --> 00:35:12,650
I liked it. Kian84 did it for me.

976
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:15,850
(Staring)

977
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:17,319
You look good.

978
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:20,960
I should make a wound on my face too.

979
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,359
You should have asked Dex to punch you.

980
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,489
- I can do it right now.
- Yes, do it now.

981
00:35:25,489 --> 00:35:26,960
I can scratch you.

982
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,060
(The kitty punch is ready.)

983
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,830
We'll enjoy our dinner...

984
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,770
and go to our next city.

985
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:37,069
Gosh. Let's go.

986
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:39,109
(Finally getting on the flight
to Amritsar)

987
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:43,009
(They saw the present
and future of India...)

988
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:45,149
(in New Delhi.
As they say goodbye to the city,)

989
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:49,419
(they set out to Amritsar
for a side of India they haven't met yet!)

990
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:52,089
The sacred place of Sikhs.

991
00:35:52,089 --> 00:35:54,319
- The Golden Temple is there.
- Is that it?

992
00:35:54,689 --> 00:35:56,319
- Gosh. That looks amazing.
- Goodness.

993
00:35:56,319 --> 00:35:57,430
(The Golden Temple is in Amritsar.)

994
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,529
Amritsar...

995
00:35:59,529 --> 00:36:02,160
is a city located in the northwestern
Indian state of Punjab.

996
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,230
It's the center of the Sikh religion.

997
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:07,500
The Golden Temple,
Amritsar's representative architecture,

998
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,870
receives about 30 million Sikhs
every year.

999
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,870
- It's the holiest site for Sikhism.
- Gosh.

1000
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:15,109
(Welcome.)

1001
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:17,649
(From New Delhi,)

1002
00:36:17,649 --> 00:36:20,450
(it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes
to Amritsar.)

1003
00:36:20,549 --> 00:36:23,549
- About 1 hour and 30 minutes.
- It took less than 1 hour and 30 minutes.

1004
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,549
All right.

1005
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,689
Gosh, the smell.

1006
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,520
- It smells different here too.
- It's nice.

1007
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,790
- It's not that hot.
- Right.

1008
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,930
- The lodging we booked...
- It's a different one.

1009
00:36:32,989 --> 00:36:34,629
- is quite far.
- Okay.

1010
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,359
- So we have to take a taxi.
- Sure.

1011
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,129
Should we take that one?

1012
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:39,600
- We pay in advance.
- Prepaid taxis.

1013
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,339
- Yes.
- Prepaid taxis.

1014
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,370
- They don't have to bargain. That's good.
- Yes.

1015
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,069
- Namaste.
- This place...

1016
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:49,109
How much to the Golden Temple?

1017
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:50,910
- Hotel Sapphire Opposite Golden Temple.
- Yes.

1018
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:52,009
Eight hundred fifty.

1019
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,210
(Answering right away)

1020
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:54,620
- Eight hundred fifty.
- All taxis charge the same.

1021
00:36:55,419 --> 00:36:56,850
It takes 24 minutes.

1022
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,020
(It takes 25 minutes
to the Golden Temple.)

1023
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,089
We can't bargain the taxi fares here.

1024
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:01,460
We'll take it.

1025
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:03,859
This guy will give you the change.

1026
00:37:03,859 --> 00:37:05,359
- Okay.
- Yes.

1027
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:06,390
(Come with me.)

1028
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,560
I guess this guy is the driver.

1029
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,600
(Following the driver)

1030
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:11,399
The car isn't big.

1031
00:37:11,399 --> 00:37:12,700
Wait. This is the one.

1032
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:14,700
- We just have to fit the bags in here.
- Okay.

1033
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,969
- If we can put Dex's backpack in...
- Dex's backpack first.

1034
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,410
I doubt it.

1035
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:21,680
Right. It's as big as him. Goodness.

1036
00:37:22,509 --> 00:37:25,149
- Gosh. It will fit.
- It will fit.

1037
00:37:25,149 --> 00:37:26,850
(Luckily, there's enough space.)

1038
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,080
Thank you.

1039
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,520
The driver is pretty rough.

1040
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:35,589
Everyone, I'm trying
to sit in the passenger seat.

1041
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,629
What is it?

1042
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,460
There's no handle here.

1043
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:42,100
- Is it broken?
- Then how do you get in?

1044
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,430
(Don't you have a handle
that looks like this?)

1045
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:44,500
This...

1046
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:46,430
Maybe, it works like an IONIQ.

1047
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:49,169
- The moving handles?
- When you touch door handles?

1048
00:37:49,969 --> 00:37:51,540
There's no handle.

1049
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,439
This... Yes.

1050
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,239
I have to open it like a thief.

1051
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:58,509
I like how it feels so retro
with this car.

1052
00:37:58,710 --> 00:38:00,649
Look at the retro car seat.

1053
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:03,790
- That's a classic car seat.
- It was.

1054
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,020
Wait. Why...

1055
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,890
Why is the fuel tank open?

1056
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,560
(Being frugal)

1057
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,730
- He's so wild.
- Wait.

1058
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,189
He can fuel up his car fast.

1059
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,660
Let's go.

1060
00:38:16,259 --> 00:38:17,469
Let's go.

1061
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,700
Gosh. The taxi...

1062
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,200
(They set out
since the car seems to be moving.)

1063
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,969
Right, as long as the car moves.

1064
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,910
Hey, wait.

1065
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,509
- What?
- What is it?

1066
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,680
- What is it?
- Wait.

1067
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,009
Did you leave something behind?

1068
00:38:30,009 --> 00:38:31,609
Driver.

1069
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,549
How come there's no side-view mirror?

1070
00:38:34,549 --> 00:38:36,080
- How come...
- There's no side-view mirror?

1071
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,189
- There's no side-view mirror.
- What?

1072
00:38:38,189 --> 00:38:39,489
(Are you serious?)

1073
00:38:39,989 --> 00:38:41,359
(Staring)

1074
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:42,359
What is this?

1075
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,160
- The side-view mirror.
- How come there's no side-view mirror?

1076
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,390
- The left one is folded. Push it back.
- The side-view mirror...

1077
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,700
I'll push it back.

1078
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:49,359
There was one on my side.

1079
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,000
How come there's no side-view mirror?

1080
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,270
"How come..."

1081
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,270
I am checking this.

1082
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:56,669
- I see. Okay.
- I see.

1083
00:38:56,669 --> 00:38:58,939
I guess he checks the rear-view mirror
and doesn't check...

1084
00:38:58,939 --> 00:38:59,969
- the side-view mirror.
- I see.

1085
00:38:59,969 --> 00:39:01,339
I'm a good driver.

1086
00:39:01,609 --> 00:39:03,339
The best driver.

1087
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,250
Real masters don't need a lot of tools.

1088
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,549
We'll get there safely.

1089
00:39:07,549 --> 00:39:08,750
(Driving without any supplementary tools)

1090
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,589
How can you drive
without a side-view mirror?

1091
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,549
He said he could just check
the rear-view mirror without it.

1092
00:39:13,549 --> 00:39:15,290
That's what he said.

1093
00:39:15,290 --> 00:39:17,890
- That's just his style.
- Right.

1094
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,600
(Zooming by)

1095
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,569
He's wearing a turban instead of a helmet.

1096
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:27,100
(Wearing a turban instead of a helmet)

1097
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,270
Are turbans equivalent to helmets here?

1098
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:31,710
It's like they have
the deity's protection.

1099
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,040
Right. Just like in Varanasi,

1100
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,680
we saw some people wearing turbans.

1101
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,210
Were they all Sikhs?

1102
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:38,410
- Sikhs.
- They're all wearing that.

1103
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:40,620
- Do Yeon.
- Yes.

1104
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,520
- I'll ask a chic question.
- Go ahead.

1105
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,790
Can you tell us more about Sikhism?

1106
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:47,819
- I'll give you a chic answer too.
- Sure.

1107
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,160
(Chuckling)

1108
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,319
Sikhism...

1109
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:52,830
follows the doctrine that
we are all equal before the deity.

1110
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,500
As the most well-known characteristics,

1111
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,830
the religion rejects gender discrimination
and the caste system.

1112
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:58,029
(It's a religion about equality.)

1113
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:59,629
Rolling up their long hair
with the turban...

1114
00:39:59,629 --> 00:40:02,299
is the symbol of Sikhism.

1115
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:05,770
Moreover, people carry five Sikh symbols.

1116
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,609
Swords to protect themselves...

1117
00:40:07,609 --> 00:40:09,939
and bracelets that show
they belong to the deity are among them.

1118
00:40:09,939 --> 00:40:12,279
The religion encourages people
to wear these physical symbols.

1119
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,279
- Do you get it now?
- Yes. I get it now.

1120
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,750
This is nice. It's completely different.

1121
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,419
Now that I'm in Amitar...

1122
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,689
- "Amitar?"
- The population of Amitar...

1123
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:25,189
- It's Amritsar.
- It's Amritsar.

1124
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:28,200
The population of Amritsar is about
the same as the population of Suwon.

1125
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,069
- Armne... Armnechar.
- "Armne?"

1126
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,200
- How disrespectful.
- I do sound disrespectful.

1127
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,370
- How disrespectful.
- How disrespectful.

1128
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,009
Amritsar.

1129
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,270
Amritsar.

1130
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,879
Is it your first time in Amritsar?

1131
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:45,580
- Yes. It's our 1st time.
- It's our 1st time.

1132
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:47,779
- The Golden Temple in Amritsar.
- It's our first time.

1133
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:49,020
The Golden Temple.

1134
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,189
It's a good place.

1135
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,819
- Good place?
- Yes.

1136
00:40:53,189 --> 00:40:54,819
Beautiful place.

1137
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:57,259
Here, there's no problem
at the Golden Temple.

1138
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,989
Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims.

1139
00:40:59,989 --> 00:41:01,899
All people are here.
And there's no problem.

1140
00:41:01,899 --> 00:41:03,060
No problem.

1141
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,930
- All religions are accepted here.
- Yes.

1142
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:07,969
- All land is free. Be free...
- That's nice.

1143
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:09,939
in any way you can.

1144
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,609
- He's proud of his city.
- Yes, he is, indeed.

1145
00:41:12,609 --> 00:41:14,339
- Here...
- Yes.

1146
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,910
A big city. A good city. It starts here.

1147
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:19,609
(Amritsar starts here.)

1148
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,950
I see. It's starting now.

1149
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:24,149
I think he's saying
we'll start to see the beautiful city now.

1150
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,489
What? How there...

1151
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,520
No.

1152
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,660
- "How there?"
- This is...

1153
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,759
This is the museum.

1154
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,960
- A museum?
- That place is beautiful.

1155
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,529
(Splendid buildings welcome them
at the entrance of the city.)

1156
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:36,560
- No way.
- Gosh.

1157
00:41:37,259 --> 00:41:39,029
By the way, no one is...

1158
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,540
honking their horns here.

1159
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,739
But there aren't a lot of cars here.

1160
00:41:43,739 --> 00:41:46,870
No. But when we were
in New Delhi and Varanasi...

1161
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:47,879
Yes.

1162
00:41:47,879 --> 00:41:50,009
They still honked their horns
even if there weren't any cars.

1163
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:53,180
The drivers honked their horns
when they got bored.

1164
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:56,919
Compared to the two places,
we heard less honking.

1165
00:41:56,919 --> 00:41:58,189
Right. It's so quiet.

1166
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:00,819
Gosh. The streets are really clean.

1167
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,020
Right?

1168
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,189
There is no trash here.

1169
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:06,129
It's so clean. It's so different.

1170
00:42:06,129 --> 00:42:09,299
New Delhi is the capital city,
but it was cleaner than New Delhi.

1171
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,500
Right.

1172
00:42:10,799 --> 00:42:13,000
- Gosh. The chandelier.
- That's fascinating.

1173
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,839
- Right.
- It was like we were in Europe.

1174
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:17,200
- The lights are fancy.
- This is pretty cool.

1175
00:42:17,669 --> 00:42:20,509
Each city felt like a different country.

1176
00:42:20,509 --> 00:42:21,580
- Right.
- Yes.

1177
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,839
This place is so fascinating.

1178
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,980
(Frowning)

1179
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:30,919
(What's going on now?)

1180
00:42:30,919 --> 00:42:32,520
- What is it?
- He's yelling at someone.

1181
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,919
- It was peaceful.
- What is it?

1182
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,989
(The ice cream stall
is blocking the road.)

1183
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:39,129
- It's like, "Get out of the way!"
- The cars...

1184
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:40,660
- Gosh.
- Gosh, sir.

1185
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,160
(He suddenly gets out of the car.)

1186
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,230
He's quite aggressive.

1187
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,600
Is he telling them not to sell ice cream
in the middle of the road?

1188
00:42:46,169 --> 00:42:48,500
- The driver...
- This driver is getting things done.

1189
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:51,009
"Look. Cars have to go through here.
You can't block the road."

1190
00:42:51,009 --> 00:42:52,140
- Right.
- That's what it looks like.

1191
00:42:53,009 --> 00:42:55,410
(Reading the situation)

1192
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,480
I guess this is as far as
the car can go in.

1193
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:58,810
Yes.

1194
00:42:58,810 --> 00:43:00,980
(They quietly get out of the car
after reading the situation.)

1195
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,549
Master.

1196
00:43:02,549 --> 00:43:03,719
(They decide to walk.)

1197
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:08,390
Master.

1198
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:10,419
What? This place
is much better than New Delhi.

1199
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:12,560
The city is well-maintained.

1200
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,230
It's well-maintained.

1201
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,259
- Nice. It looks like a European city.
- Right? Doesn't it?

1202
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:18,069
There's so much to look at.
Look at the buildings.

1203
00:43:18,069 --> 00:43:19,100
Right.

1204
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:20,799
(The splendid architecture
pleases their eyes.)

1205
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:24,140
And there's no poop on the street.

1206
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,210
It's clean.

1207
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,739
It's really clean.

1208
00:43:27,779 --> 00:43:29,009
(Impressed by the cleanliness)

1209
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,379
We have to go that way.

1210
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,180
Pani Bottle already made a reservation...

1211
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:35,549
- the night before in New Delhi.
- Gosh.

1212
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:38,020
Goodness.

1213
00:43:38,649 --> 00:43:40,549
This feels so foreign.

1214
00:43:40,549 --> 00:43:42,759
We're in India, but it's so clean.

1215
00:43:42,759 --> 00:43:44,930
- And he's cleaning there.
- Right. This feels so foreign.

1216
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,730
(Cleaning)

1217
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,600
I guess the Deity of Sikhs
doesn't like garbage.

1218
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,270
(The broom is always on standby.)

1219
00:43:53,669 --> 00:43:54,799
That way.

1220
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:56,500
(They walk under Pani Bottle's guidance.)

1221
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:00,210
(Did he spot something?)

1222
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,239
What's this?

1223
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,710
What? This place
is so much better than New Delhi.

1224
00:44:04,710 --> 00:44:05,810
(They're amazed by what they see.
Where are they?)

1225
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:07,350
I love this place more than New Delhi.

1226
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:09,919
Gosh. This is Everland.
It's like we're at an amusement park.

1227
00:44:09,919 --> 00:44:11,089
- Everland.
- An amusement park.

1228
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:13,419
What is this place?

1229
00:44:13,419 --> 00:44:15,219
- This feels like an amusement park.
- Yes.

1230
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,689
- Gosh.
- This place is amazing.

1231
00:44:16,689 --> 00:44:18,230
- Right?
- A lot of things are open.

1232
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,589
- This is so cool.
- Yes.

1233
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:23,700
By that time,
it was past midnight and before 1 a.m.

1234
00:44:23,899 --> 00:44:25,129
But there were still a lot of people out.

1235
00:44:25,129 --> 00:44:27,169
- And the streets are so lively.
- Yes.

1236
00:44:27,169 --> 00:44:29,969
It feels like if I were to go in,
I might find Disneyland souvenirs.

1237
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,939
Don't you like this lively atmosphere?

1238
00:44:31,939 --> 00:44:33,040
Yes. It's really nice.

1239
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,680
Look at the signs.
When you go to Insa-dong,

1240
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,250
- the signs must be in Korean.
- Yes.

1241
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,509
This might be something similar to that.

1242
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:41,980
- The signs have conformity.
- Right.

1243
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,250
- So they don't look messy.
- Yes.

1244
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,719
It's the same design.

1245
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:46,950
I think
that's why this place looks neater.

1246
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,259
Personally, of all the places
we've been to, this is my favorite.

1247
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:52,529
Amritsar.

1248
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,830
It's clean and well-maintained.

1249
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:56,759
I was looking for
more worldly conveniences.

1250
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,500
- There's a sword.
- Where?

1251
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,540
Gosh. Look.

1252
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,239
(Dex spots swords.)

1253
00:45:04,239 --> 00:45:05,370
- Excuse me.
- This?

1254
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:07,069
- Is this a real sword?
- Yes.

1255
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:09,279
- Real swords?
- Yes. But not sharp. They're blunt.

1256
00:45:09,279 --> 00:45:10,810
I see. It's a replica sword.

1257
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:12,310
- Not sharp?
- Not sharp.

1258
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:13,649
- Can I see?
- Sure.

1259
00:45:13,649 --> 00:45:15,620
(Of course.)

1260
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,750
(As he grabs the sword,)

1261
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,450
(he gets super excited.)

1262
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:20,919
- Hold on. Can I draw it?
- Gosh.

1263
00:45:20,919 --> 00:45:22,219
No.

1264
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:25,390
(Amazed)

1265
00:45:25,930 --> 00:45:27,489
(Finding him cute)

1266
00:45:27,799 --> 00:45:29,060
- Be careful.
- This isn't sharp.

1267
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,060
I see.

1268
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,469
Those were all replicas.

1269
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:33,569
I touched it. It wasn't sharp at all.

1270
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:36,299
- It's not sharp.
- Is it made of steel?

1271
00:45:36,299 --> 00:45:37,439
Yes.

1272
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
- How much?
- Seven hundred.

1273
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:42,040
- What?
- Seven hundred.

1274
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,339
- Seven hundred?
- Seven hundred.

1275
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:44,549
- It's not bad.
- Seven hundred rupees?

1276
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,710
(Hesitant)

1277
00:45:46,950 --> 00:45:49,120
- We won't be able to bring it in.
- Right.

1278
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,089
- This is too bad. I really want one.
- Yes.

1279
00:45:51,089 --> 00:45:53,149
It'll be a hassle to carry it around.

1280
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,520
Thank you.

1281
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,689
(Bye.)

1282
00:45:55,689 --> 00:45:56,819
Let's go.

1283
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,189
It's fun to look around as we go.

1284
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:01,960
Wait. I think it's that one over there.

1285
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:03,899
- That one. The Golden Temple.
- The clock tower?

1286
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:05,430
Yes. That.

1287
00:46:06,169 --> 00:46:08,669
- It's in the heart of the city?
- The hotel we're going...

1288
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:11,509
is located right
in front of the Golden Temple.

1289
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:13,069
We'll see it from our hotel.

1290
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:15,739
- Hello. How are you?
- Hello.

1291
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,310
- Fine. And you?
- Islam?

1292
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,580
Korean.

1293
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,580
(Turning around)

1294
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,580
How old?

1295
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,620
- Fourteen years old.
- Fourteen?

1296
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,189
Fourteen? A student?

1297
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:26,850
- No.
- No?

1298
00:46:26,989 --> 00:46:28,359
Are you an elementary school student?

1299
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:29,989
He became a pied piper.

1300
00:46:29,989 --> 00:46:31,189
There's one more kid following him.

1301
00:46:31,430 --> 00:46:33,730
(He has a talent
in attracting young kids.)

1302
00:46:34,899 --> 00:46:36,759
(Even on Day 1,)

1303
00:46:36,759 --> 00:46:40,870
(the kids followed him from the alley.)

1304
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:42,799
When I walk...

1305
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:43,899
(When he starts walking,)

1306
00:46:43,899 --> 00:46:47,210
(the locals follow him.)

1307
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:49,210
He's a pied piper.

1308
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,339
He really is.

1309
00:46:50,339 --> 00:46:51,480
No.

1310
00:46:52,279 --> 00:46:54,180
- What?
- Do you need a room?

1311
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:56,319
We're here. We're at the Golden Temple.

1312
00:46:56,319 --> 00:46:57,719
That's the entrance.

1313
00:46:57,719 --> 00:46:58,750
Kids.

1314
00:46:58,750 --> 00:46:59,989
Gosh, look at this place.

1315
00:47:00,589 --> 00:47:02,089
How come they are sleeping here?

1316
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:03,089
- Where?
- Where?

1317
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:05,660
(In front of the Golden Temple...)

1318
00:47:05,989 --> 00:47:07,060
- Gosh.
- Why? Goodness.

1319
00:47:07,060 --> 00:47:08,060
(people are lying down.)

1320
00:47:08,060 --> 00:47:09,160
- What's this?
- What?

1321
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,129
It's cool here. So they're sleeping here.

1322
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:12,830
Is it like a square?

1323
00:47:12,969 --> 00:47:15,169
(The locals are sleeping comfortably
as if they're at home.)

1324
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:16,299
What a sight.

1325
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,540
(The Golden Temple offers everyone
a place to sleep.)

1326
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,939
Gosh. This is like a dry sauna.

1327
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:23,410
- Right. Look at the floor.
- Yes.

1328
00:47:23,410 --> 00:47:26,180
- Just like a dry sauna.
- The floor reminds me of a dry sauna too.

1329
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:27,819
This is the Indian version
of the dry sauna.

1330
00:47:28,719 --> 00:47:31,189
They're not sleeping there
because they don't have money.

1331
00:47:31,189 --> 00:47:33,620
They came here on a pilgrimage.

1332
00:47:33,819 --> 00:47:36,759
That's why they sleep
right in front of the temple.

1333
00:47:36,759 --> 00:47:38,830
(The pilgrims fall asleep
in front of the temple...)

1334
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,989
(as they want to be near the deity.)

1335
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:43,100
- Do you see the gold inside?
- Yes.

1336
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,669
- That's the Golden Temple.
- Golden Temple.

1337
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:51,270
(The beautiful Golden Temple greets them.)

1338
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,339
You sleep here?

1339
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:55,439
(Nodding)

1340
00:47:55,439 --> 00:47:56,480
Why?

1341
00:47:57,379 --> 00:48:01,219
You don't have a home?

1342
00:48:01,219 --> 00:48:02,649
No. This isn't a home.

1343
00:48:03,319 --> 00:48:04,850
Okay. Come back home.

1344
00:48:04,850 --> 00:48:06,790
- Goodnight.
- "Come back home."

1345
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,020
We can go in this way.

1346
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,489
- Right now...
- Into the alley.

1347
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:12,489
It's called Hotel Sapphire.

1348
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,529
- This is the place.
- Yes. This is the one.

1349
00:48:14,529 --> 00:48:15,930
- Sapphire.
- Sapphire.

1350
00:48:15,930 --> 00:48:18,200
- The Golden Temple.
- How many stars does the hotel have?

1351
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,430
- This is a 3-star hotel.
- A 3-star hotel.

1352
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:21,770
- Yes. It's a 3-star hotel.
- A 3-star hotel.

1353
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,000
- Yes.
- Nice.

1354
00:48:23,569 --> 00:48:25,239
- After staying in India for a while,
- Yes.

1355
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,739
these stars were important.

1356
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:27,910
Really?

1357
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:30,509
- They get stars for a reason.
- Right.

1358
00:48:30,509 --> 00:48:32,250
Gosh. I needed those stars.

1359
00:48:33,009 --> 00:48:35,049
- Hello. Namaste. Ram Ram Ji.
- Hello.

1360
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:37,450
- Ram Ram Ji.
- Namaste.

1361
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,589
Do you have a big room with three beds?

1362
00:48:40,989 --> 00:48:42,560
- Yes.
- Okay.

1363
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:44,089
Pani Bottle, how much is it
to stay here for a night?

1364
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:46,759
It's about 3,500 rupees.
How much is that in dollars?

1365
00:48:46,759 --> 00:48:48,160
That's...

1366
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,560
It's about 50 to 60 dollars.

1367
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:50,660
- Fifty to sixty dollars?
- Not bad then.

1368
00:48:50,660 --> 00:48:53,029
- Three people. Okay.
- Yes.

1369
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:56,500
Let's see.

1370
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,640
(They enter the room.)

1371
00:48:57,640 --> 00:48:58,739
Okay.

1372
00:49:00,239 --> 00:49:01,339
That's it.

1373
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:02,540
- There was a key holder?
- Yes.

1374
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,739
- It looks nice.
- Yes.

1375
00:49:03,739 --> 00:49:05,310
- Gosh, it was great.
- Yes. It looks great.

1376
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,350
- Let's sleep here for the night.
- Okay.

1377
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,549
- We can leave our bags here tomorrow.
- Okay.

1378
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:11,850
We can go to the temple tomorrow.

1379
00:49:11,850 --> 00:49:14,460
- They offer free meals.
- Wait. You said...

1380
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:16,620
- we'd sleep in the Golden Temple.
- Yes.

1381
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:20,629
You don't mean that we'll sleep
on the street like the dry sauna, right?

1382
00:49:20,629 --> 00:49:22,100
- It's...
- Sprawling on the street?

1383
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:24,469
- I don't know. I have to go and check.
- That's...

1384
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,830
Then we'll be sleeping on the street.

1385
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,600
But didn't you say you wanted to try it?

1386
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:30,870
- But...
- I'm not saying we'll do it, though.

1387
00:49:31,910 --> 00:49:33,910
(When he was traveling South America,)

1388
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:38,080
(he confidently presented
his dream of sleeping outdoors.)

1389
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,279
(People usually make a fire
when sleeping outdoors.)

1390
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:41,850
I can't...

1391
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,390
(Due to the differences, it still remained
unchecked on his bucket list.)

1392
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:47,649
- Right.
- Let me explain.

1393
00:49:47,649 --> 00:49:52,529
I thought we would be inside the temple
and sleep with walls around us.

1394
00:49:52,529 --> 00:49:54,160
But this place is too open.

1395
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:55,529
- When did you get so weak?
- What?

1396
00:49:55,529 --> 00:49:56,859
When did you get so weak?

1397
00:49:56,859 --> 00:49:59,000
- In Varanasi...
- This isn't the real Kian84.

1398
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,930
- He's someone else.
- It's because he's been to Varanasi.

1399
00:50:00,930 --> 00:50:02,100
Who are you right now?

1400
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,399
- He's not feeling good right now.
- You're Si Eon now, right?

1401
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:06,710
(The spirit of the city man
has possessed his body.)

1402
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:07,980
- No.
- Get rid of that mask.

1403
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,710
You're not Kian84, right?

1404
00:50:09,710 --> 00:50:11,379
Hey, I got too comfortable too.

1405
00:50:11,379 --> 00:50:12,680
(Suddenly repenting)

1406
00:50:13,350 --> 00:50:14,649
Then let's do that.

1407
00:50:15,950 --> 00:50:18,549
Let's say the floor is cold,
and we have to sleep outdoors.

1408
00:50:18,719 --> 00:50:20,189
Then let's pick up some boxes.

1409
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:22,060
(Shocked)

1410
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:24,790
Let's pick up boxes. So we can do...

1411
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,790
what homeless people do in Korea.

1412
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,230
- You want to make partitions?
- We can make partitions.

1413
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,469
- We can do something like that.
- Sounds good.

1414
00:50:32,469 --> 00:50:33,899
- I'm good with that.
- Okay.

1415
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:36,540
We have to wake up at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

1416
00:50:36,540 --> 00:50:38,640
- We'll have a packed day.
- At 8 a.m.

1417
00:50:38,770 --> 00:50:41,710
Here's my plan. We'll wake up at 8 a.m.

1418
00:50:41,710 --> 00:50:42,710
Yes.

1419
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:45,850
We can go to the Golden Temple
and look around.

1420
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,819
- Remember the flag hoisting ceremony...
- Right.

1421
00:50:48,819 --> 00:50:52,589
on the border between Pakistan and India?
We can go and watch that.

1422
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:55,120
After that,
we'll come back to the Golden Temple.

1423
00:50:55,319 --> 00:50:57,589
We can take a nap or rest up.

1424
00:50:57,589 --> 00:51:00,629
I plan to take a nap with the Sikhs.

1425
00:51:01,129 --> 00:51:03,160
- That sounds good. Yes.
- Can I do that?

1426
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,569
- They will embrace nappers too.
- You can do it.

1427
00:51:04,569 --> 00:51:06,000
- They will, right?
- Yes.

1428
00:51:06,129 --> 00:51:07,799
Because Sikhism is all about generosity?

1429
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:09,799
As long as you don't disturb other people.

1430
00:51:09,799 --> 00:51:10,870
- Okay.
- Yes

1431
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,710
We'll have a busy day tomorrow.

1432
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,239
We should wash up and go to sleep.

1433
00:51:14,239 --> 00:51:15,439
- Yes.
- Okay.

1434
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,239
(They will go to sleep early tonight!)

1435
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,480
(Their first morning in Amritsar)

1436
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,450
(Clicking)

1437
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:28,120
(The youngest member, Dex,
is diligent in the morning too.)

1438
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:31,160
Gosh, five minutes.

1439
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:33,730
I'll wake up at 45. It's 42 right now.

1440
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,000
It's only reasonable to be tired.

1441
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,029
(Slapping on)

1442
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:39,469
- Dex. You can't wear shorts...
- Yes?

1443
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:40,930
at the Golden Temple.

1444
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,140
- Really?
- You need to wear long pants.

1445
00:51:43,439 --> 00:51:46,069
Oh, no. What now? I have no long pants.

1446
00:51:46,839 --> 00:51:48,180
You don't?

1447
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,410
You better buy one.

1448
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:50,810
Goodness.

1449
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:53,250
Why not try on the ones
I bought yesterday?

1450
00:51:53,379 --> 00:51:54,680
- Your pants?
- Yes.

1451
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,850
Yours?

1452
00:51:56,350 --> 00:51:58,819
I bought it. It could fit you.

1453
00:51:58,819 --> 00:51:59,850
Really?

1454
00:51:59,989 --> 00:52:02,790
They're the pants
Pani Bottle bought yesterday.

1455
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:04,560
Pani Bottle likes to shop.

1456
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,060
- He's a shopaholic.
- Yes, he is.

1457
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:07,859
He's addicted to shopping.

1458
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:10,299
Those pants are pretty.

1459
00:52:10,299 --> 00:52:12,029
- It was better than I thought.
- Right.

1460
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:13,069
It's not bad.

1461
00:52:13,370 --> 00:52:15,370
- Thanks for lending it to me.
- It's slightly small, right?

1462
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,239
(Excited)

1463
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,569
(Meanwhile, Pani Bottle changes into...)

1464
00:52:20,469 --> 00:52:23,640
(the traditional Indian clothes
Naveen gave him last night...)

1465
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,009
(as a gift.)

1466
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,509
(Telling them the precautions)

1467
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:27,810
Listen.

1468
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,750
- You need to wear long pants.
- Yes.

1469
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:31,450
You have to be barefoot
when going into the temple.

1470
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,520
- Really?
- Yes.

1471
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,950
Shoes are not allowed inside.

1472
00:52:34,290 --> 00:52:36,020
- So keep that in mind.
- Okay.

1473
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:38,830
(Checking out of the hotel before leaving)

1474
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:42,100
These are clothes.

1475
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:44,870
- Laundry service.
- Right, to wash.

1476
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,169
And can we keep our luggage here?

1477
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:49,569
- Bag. Can you keep it? Okay.
- Yes.

1478
00:52:49,569 --> 00:52:51,239
- You want to keep them here?
- Yes.

1479
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:53,009
Okay. Key.

1480
00:52:53,109 --> 00:52:55,480
Let's leave our bags here.

1481
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,480
- Really?
- Leave them here?

1482
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,410
But take out your valuables from them,

1483
00:52:58,410 --> 00:52:59,980
like money and stuff.

1484
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,009
Okay.

1485
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:03,680
- Keep our clothes separated. Thank you.
- No problem.

1486
00:53:06,290 --> 00:53:08,589
(Pumping out)

1487
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:10,719
(Smearing on)

1488
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:11,759
Are you washing your face? What's that?

1489
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:13,290
- Sunscreen?
- Sunscreen.

1490
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:15,759
I lost my hat.

1491
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:18,200
The sunlight will run away
even before it hits you.

1492
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:19,299
He's so scary.

1493
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,629
Do you want some?

1494
00:53:20,899 --> 00:53:23,000
- No.
- The sunlight is really strong.

1495
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,069
(Slathering it on)

1496
00:53:24,069 --> 00:53:25,770
- I already put some on.
- I did too.

1497
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:26,810
You need to apply a ton.

1498
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:28,379
But you really do need
to put on sunscreen.

1499
00:53:28,379 --> 00:53:29,580
You need to put on a lot.

1500
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:32,450
(A lot)

1501
00:53:33,149 --> 00:53:35,319
- This is the right way to apply it.
- Right?

1502
00:53:35,419 --> 00:53:36,719
Yes, but it's funny.

1503
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:38,219
You need to put on a lot.

1504
00:53:38,219 --> 00:53:40,450
- I'm already tanned.
- Dex already put some on.

1505
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,489
(A clear difference in skin tone)

1506
00:53:42,489 --> 00:53:43,719
Dex already put some on.

1507
00:53:43,719 --> 00:53:45,759
- I did. I already put some on.
- Yes, you're pale.

1508
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:46,859
He's shining.

1509
00:53:47,529 --> 00:53:48,799
(Is that so?)

1510
00:53:48,799 --> 00:53:50,730
Gosh, my clothes...

1511
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,169
- You should wash them.
- They're so dirty.

1512
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:54,270
I wore this because it didn't smell.

1513
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:55,569
You didn't have any clothes?

1514
00:53:55,569 --> 00:53:57,700
My clothes over there reeked.
I couldn't wear them.

1515
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,140
(Oh, Kian84...)

1516
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,109
Why don't I lend you my clothes?

1517
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:02,980
- What?
- My clothes.

1518
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:05,980
- They are new.
- This is not my style.

1519
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:09,049
- Kian84 has his own style.
- I don't wear just anything.

1520
00:54:09,049 --> 00:54:10,850
He may not look like it,
but he cares about everything.

1521
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:13,350
- Gosh, I'm neat. Yes.
- He's delicate.

1522
00:54:13,419 --> 00:54:14,819
(I might look like I don't care,)

1523
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:16,290
(but I'm picky when it comes to fashion.)

1524
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,290
- You're lying.
- No, for real.

1525
00:54:19,390 --> 00:54:20,890
(He may wear discolored clothes.)

1526
00:54:20,890 --> 00:54:23,899
I can't wear clothes
that are not to my taste.

1527
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:26,870
(He's hopeless.)

1528
00:54:26,870 --> 00:54:28,700
We need to cover our heads.

1529
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,939
A turban.

1530
00:54:30,270 --> 00:54:32,969
Let's buy actual turbans
that Sikhs wear...

1531
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:34,739
- and wear them...
- Okay.

1532
00:54:34,810 --> 00:54:36,009
- to the temple.
- I'm in.

1533
00:54:36,009 --> 00:54:38,040
Do they put it on for us?

1534
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:39,279
- On our heads.
- Most likely.

1535
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:41,250
It's complicated, so we can't do it.

1536
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,520
- He's right.
- I see.

1537
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:43,750
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1538
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:44,750
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1539
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:46,489
(They're off to buy the turbans first.)

1540
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:47,950
Thank you. See you.

1541
00:54:48,560 --> 00:54:49,560
See you.

1542
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,219
Gosh, the weather is amazing.

1543
00:54:51,219 --> 00:54:53,529
(They walk out to the streets.)

1544
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,330
(Among the crowd,)

1545
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,500
(there are street foods...)

1546
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,230
(and various souvenir shops.)

1547
00:55:00,569 --> 00:55:01,870
Those guys over there.

1548
00:55:02,069 --> 00:55:04,540
- They're giving off LA rapper vibes.
- Totally.

1549
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:06,109
- He's right.
- Right?

1550
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:07,810
- California.
- Gosh.

1551
00:55:07,969 --> 00:55:09,009
Swag.

1552
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:10,040
(Singing)

1553
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,279
(Nodding)

1554
00:55:11,279 --> 00:55:12,279
He's excited.

1555
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,950
They look a lot like Tupac.

1556
00:55:15,279 --> 00:55:16,350
(Thumbs up)

1557
00:55:17,950 --> 00:55:20,989
(They arrive at the front yard
of the Golden Temple.)

1558
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:24,460
- This temple is always kept really clean.
- I see.

1559
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:26,160
Are they all volunteers?

1560
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,560
- Volunteers?
- Yes, I think so.

1561
00:55:27,830 --> 00:55:29,230
This was truly interesting.

1562
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,259
(People walk bare feet
from the front yard.)

1563
00:55:31,430 --> 00:55:33,270
Oh, that is why the temple must be clean.

1564
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:34,969
- I see.
- That's nice.

1565
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:37,169
They paid great attention to cleanliness.

1566
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:40,569
(Last night, many people were sleeping.)

1567
00:55:41,009 --> 00:55:42,080
(But it's clean during the day.)

1568
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,509
- They're keeping it clean.
- Yes.

1569
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:45,250
Last night's sauna.

1570
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,549
It's clean
because they got rid of all the trash.

1571
00:55:48,049 --> 00:55:49,319
Then anyone could sleep there.

1572
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:50,620
Even the water purity is controlled.

1573
00:55:50,750 --> 00:55:53,120
I can't believe
they aren't workers but volunteers.

1574
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,020
Right? It's amazing.

1575
00:55:55,259 --> 00:55:56,419
Do you know where it is?

1576
00:55:56,419 --> 00:55:59,089
Do you know which shop
helps with the turban?

1577
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:00,489
Remember the place...

1578
00:56:00,489 --> 00:56:02,799
- where we saw the swords last night?
- Yes.

1579
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:04,160
I might've seen one near there.

1580
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,270
- Really?
- Yes.

1581
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:07,029
- So let's head to that area.
- Okay.

1582
00:56:07,299 --> 00:56:08,569
Was it that way yesterday?

1583
00:56:09,339 --> 00:56:11,000
It's more crowded than last night.

1584
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,009
You're right.

1585
00:56:12,009 --> 00:56:13,810
I think we took that road last night.

1586
00:56:13,969 --> 00:56:16,180
- The main street.
- Yes, you're right. That way.

1587
00:56:16,310 --> 00:56:18,310
- Over there.
- What?

1588
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:21,149
Aren't they helping with this here?
This one.

1589
00:56:21,149 --> 00:56:23,279
- Oh, this?
- Yes. Won't they do this for us?

1590
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,419
(Welcome.)

1591
00:56:25,419 --> 00:56:26,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

1592
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:29,560
- Namaste.
- First, the colors.

1593
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:31,629
- Can we pick the color?
- Yes.

1594
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:33,629
Same color.

1595
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:36,629
- I'm getting the same color.
- "Same color?"

1596
00:56:37,859 --> 00:56:39,299
Dex, what color do you want?

1597
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:41,969
Gray or something like that.

1598
00:56:41,969 --> 00:56:43,669
How about a color like this one, Kian84?

1599
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:45,439
This color right here?

1600
00:56:45,439 --> 00:56:48,009
Yes. My top and bottom
are similar in color.

1601
00:56:48,009 --> 00:56:49,239
So I'm bringing up this color to the top.

1602
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,939
You want to finish the look
with dark brown?

1603
00:56:50,939 --> 00:56:52,109
- It's not bad, right?
- No, it's not.

1604
00:56:52,109 --> 00:56:54,049
- I knew you'd understand.
- Right?

1605
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:55,680
Matching colors...

1606
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,149
- Isn't it a basic rule in fashion?
- is the basic rule.

1607
00:56:58,850 --> 00:57:00,620
From what I can see,

1608
00:57:00,620 --> 00:57:03,689
Pani Bottle wearing an orange turban
is too much.

1609
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,589
He should wear white.

1610
00:57:06,189 --> 00:57:07,230
Really?

1611
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,100
But that's his personal color.

1612
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,899
I think white will make the look
more balanced.

1613
00:57:12,899 --> 00:57:15,000
The orange is taking up too much area.

1614
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,100
You're right on that.

1615
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,100
- Right, Kian84?
- Yes.

1616
00:57:17,169 --> 00:57:19,669
Sorry. Can I change the color?

1617
00:57:19,669 --> 00:57:20,870
To white.

1618
00:57:21,069 --> 00:57:22,640
- White color?
- Yes, white color.

1619
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,480
- What about you, Kian84?
- I'm thinking of denim.

1620
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,080
- Like this?
- Yes, this on my head.

1621
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,649
- I agree. As expected of you.
- Yes.

1622
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:31,750
(The 2nd oldest
is getting his head wrapped.)

1623
00:57:33,219 --> 00:57:34,319
What's wrong?

1624
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,020
(Like a boy getting his first topknot,)

1625
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,390
(he's nervous.)

1626
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:42,859
(The merchant helping with the turban...)

1627
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,430
(is nervous as well.)

1628
00:57:44,430 --> 00:57:46,230
It's like a coming-of-age ceremony.

1629
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,939
(Young Master Bottle
is getting his first topknot.)

1630
00:57:50,969 --> 00:57:52,770
Pani Bottle is going first.

1631
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,540
- They're professionals.
- That many?

1632
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:56,140
- Gosh.
- Does that all go on his head?

1633
00:57:56,140 --> 00:57:58,109
- We couldn't have done it ourselves.
- No.

1634
00:57:58,109 --> 00:57:59,850
- We could never do it.
- Right, never.

1635
00:58:00,950 --> 00:58:02,120
(He folds it,)

1636
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,379
(then folds it again.)

1637
00:58:03,379 --> 00:58:05,390
(Carrying)

1638
00:58:05,489 --> 00:58:07,189
- Let's watch.
- How does he do it?

1639
00:58:07,189 --> 00:58:08,189
(Focusing on them)

1640
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:11,460
Put this between your teeth. Yes.

1641
00:58:11,830 --> 00:58:13,129
(Laughing)

1642
00:58:13,930 --> 00:58:15,859
(Just look at him.)

1643
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,529
Why do you have a gag?

1644
00:58:17,529 --> 00:58:19,270
I can't feel my head.

1645
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:20,500
- You can't?
- No.

1646
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,870
Tell him to tie it loosely...

1647
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,370
- because you can't feel your head.
- Softly.

1648
00:58:23,370 --> 00:58:25,969
(Looking as if all his blood vessels
have been clogged)

1649
00:58:26,439 --> 00:58:27,710
(Snap)

1650
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,839
Is it a blackout?

1651
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,710
(Scratching)

1652
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,279
Everyone became used to it
after being in India for a few days.

1653
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:34,450
Nobody got startled.

1654
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,020
There are too many blackouts in India.

1655
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,549
It would be impossible
to run an Internet cafe here.

1656
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,489
You're right.
All the keyboards would get smashed.

1657
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:43,520
The kids would get furious.

1658
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:47,460
(Meanwhile,
his turban is almost complete.)

1659
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,460
So the last step is covering
the top of his head with the turban.

1660
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,730
I heard your hair shouldn't be visible.

1661
00:58:54,370 --> 00:58:56,669
(Arranging the hair
as a way of respecting the deity)

1662
00:58:56,669 --> 00:58:57,899
Even his ears got covered.

1663
00:58:58,739 --> 00:58:59,810
(Pulling)

1664
00:58:59,810 --> 00:59:01,609
We can't copy him even after watching it.

1665
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,779
(Being thorough until the end)

1666
00:59:03,779 --> 00:59:05,509
(In pain)

1667
00:59:06,649 --> 00:59:08,919
- Okay, please.
- Okay.

1668
00:59:08,919 --> 00:59:10,020
(Pani Bottle's turban is done.)

1669
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:13,089
It hurts. I have a pimple on my scalp.

1670
00:59:13,089 --> 00:59:14,390
- Master.
- Next person.

1671
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,989
I don't want it tight. Softly, please.

1672
00:59:17,219 --> 00:59:18,629
- Soft.
- Same.

1673
00:59:18,629 --> 00:59:20,560
- Not tightly.
- Not tightly.

1674
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:23,330
- Headache.
- Relax.

1675
00:59:23,859 --> 00:59:26,669
(A different headband)

1676
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:27,830
- Okay, soft.
- So that's first.

1677
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,770
I'm guessing this is the soft version.

1678
00:59:30,370 --> 00:59:31,870
- Not tightly.
- Good.

1679
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:33,310
Your head might feel numb.

1680
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,939
(Lift up your head.)

1681
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,080
- Lift your head.
- Yes. Okay.

1682
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,450
You look nice in that headband.

1683
00:59:41,009 --> 00:59:45,020
(After neatly putting on the headband)

1684
00:59:46,919 --> 00:59:47,989
(Biting)

1685
00:59:47,989 --> 00:59:50,359
- Gosh.
- Why is that in slow motion?

1686
00:59:51,219 --> 00:59:53,230
Because his head is small,
so is the turban.

1687
00:59:54,029 --> 00:59:56,060
(Custom-fit turban only for him)

1688
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:57,830
(Smiling)

1689
00:59:58,129 --> 00:59:59,129
(Staring)

1690
00:59:59,129 --> 01:00:00,370
Let's look in the mirror.

1691
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:05,509
(Dumpling Bottle)

1692
01:00:06,109 --> 01:00:08,609
He looks like a delicious dim sum.

1693
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:10,879
His sunglasses look like dipping dishes
for soy sauce.

1694
01:00:10,939 --> 01:00:12,210
"Dipping dishes for soy sauce."

1695
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:14,310
(Laughing)

1696
01:00:15,009 --> 01:00:16,149
So this is how I look.

1697
01:00:16,149 --> 01:00:17,149
(A dumpling
with dipping dishes for soy sauce)

1698
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,350
(For the eldest)

1699
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:21,790
- Why?
- "Why?"

1700
01:00:21,790 --> 01:00:22,819
(I'll wrap it loosely.)

1701
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:23,819
"Why?"

1702
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:27,259
My headband looks like leftover fabric.

1703
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,799
You remind me
of the Donghak Peasant Revolution.

1704
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:31,200
"Donghak Peasant Revolution?"

1705
01:00:31,759 --> 01:00:34,299
I saw it clearly with my two eyes.

1706
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,870
I saw it clearly.

1707
01:00:37,669 --> 01:00:39,469
I saw it clearly with my own two eyes.

1708
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:40,939
(He clearly gives off peasant vibes.)

1709
01:00:41,169 --> 01:00:42,839
Get on with the turban now.

1710
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:44,540
That was hilarious.

1711
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,710
Gosh, my side hurts.

1712
01:00:46,779 --> 01:00:47,779
(The youngest is almost done.)

1713
01:00:47,779 --> 01:00:50,049
(Sticking out)

1714
01:00:50,419 --> 01:00:52,450
Your back hair must be okay.

1715
01:00:52,819 --> 01:00:54,549
- He's pushing it in.
- He is?

1716
01:00:54,549 --> 01:00:55,859
- He's pushing my back hair in.
- Really?

1717
01:00:56,120 --> 01:00:57,120
(Pushing)

1718
01:00:57,120 --> 01:00:58,529
- I thought it was okay.
- It hurts.

1719
01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:00,529
- Okay.
- Okay.

1720
01:01:00,529 --> 01:01:01,560
(His turban is done.)

1721
01:01:01,859 --> 01:01:04,830
(Farmer84 is getting his turban wrapped.)

1722
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:09,040
(Biting)

1723
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,770
That was...

1724
01:01:11,770 --> 01:01:12,870
- Yes?
- Did it hurt?

1725
01:01:12,870 --> 01:01:14,640
a lot heavier and stuffier than I thought.

1726
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:16,710
My head was so itchy.

1727
01:01:17,910 --> 01:01:20,149
What? What's that?

1728
01:01:20,609 --> 01:01:21,680
What's going on?

1729
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,379
Didn't he stick a nail in?

1730
01:01:24,379 --> 01:01:25,419
(Fixing pin)

1731
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,790
Dangerous?

1732
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,689
- Not dangerous?
- No.

1733
01:01:29,189 --> 01:01:30,189
Okay.

1734
01:01:30,189 --> 01:01:32,790
- It's a soft clip.
- Okay.

1735
01:01:34,259 --> 01:01:35,299
(Confused)

1736
01:01:35,299 --> 01:01:37,129
I think they didn't use pins, though.

1737
01:01:37,529 --> 01:01:40,000
Are they not using pins? Is it okay?

1738
01:01:40,169 --> 01:01:42,370
- Is it the same?
- It's the same.

1739
01:01:42,370 --> 01:01:44,469
Your head is big.

1740
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:46,839
Big? My head is big?

1741
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:48,270
(He has a big head.)

1742
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:50,439
He used pins because I have a big head.

1743
01:01:51,910 --> 01:01:53,810
(He's cute.)

1744
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,779
I have a big skull.

1745
01:01:57,419 --> 01:01:59,250
Kian84 looks the best with it.

1746
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,290
Yes.

1747
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:02,189
He looks good with every kind of hat.

1748
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:03,620
It suits you.

1749
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:06,189
It really suits you.

1750
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,060
- His facial features are handsome.
- Yes.

1751
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:09,730
It really suits him.

1752
01:02:10,230 --> 01:02:11,799
- Okay.
- Okay.

1753
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:13,969
We're fully prepared.

1754
01:02:14,069 --> 01:02:15,270
People usually just go...

1755
01:02:15,270 --> 01:02:16,799
and find out that they can't enter
the Golden Temple.

1756
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,469
- It's all thanks to you.
- Yes.

1757
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:20,939
Is that what you wanted to hear?

1758
01:02:20,939 --> 01:02:21,939
Yes.

1759
01:02:22,580 --> 01:02:24,509
I was wondering when you would say that.
You should've said it.

1760
01:02:24,680 --> 01:02:26,649
- Please say it right away next time.
- Okay.

1761
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:29,279
Let me pay.

1762
01:02:30,149 --> 01:02:32,089
It's 1,200 rupees.

1763
01:02:32,089 --> 01:02:34,919
And this one. It's 250, right?

1764
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,489
He got a bracelet.

1765
01:02:36,489 --> 01:02:39,029
- He's a shopping addict.
- Yes. He shops a lot.

1766
01:02:40,529 --> 01:02:42,460
It's 1,450 rupees.

1767
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:43,460
Okay.

1768
01:02:44,259 --> 01:02:45,469
Is that right? Yes.

1769
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:47,230
(The India Brothers bought turbans
and a bracelet.)

1770
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,000
Let's go.

1771
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,339
- What kind of hat can't block the sun?
- Let's go.

1772
01:02:51,469 --> 01:02:53,739
I feel like I'm blending in now.

1773
01:02:53,910 --> 01:02:55,040
I blended in.

1774
01:02:55,169 --> 01:02:57,239
If we enter the Golden Temple
wearing this...

1775
01:02:57,239 --> 01:02:58,779
- and lie down on the floor,
- Yes.

1776
01:02:58,779 --> 01:03:00,649
we'll look like Sikhs.

1777
01:03:01,009 --> 01:03:03,279
So these hats are like...

1778
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:05,589
a free pass to the Golden Temple.

1779
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:07,089
- Right.
- A free pass.

1780
01:03:07,290 --> 01:03:08,759
By wearing turbans,

1781
01:03:08,759 --> 01:03:11,560
- you respected their religion.
- Absolutely.

1782
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,230
- You need to have manners.
- Yes.

1783
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:16,200
(They got to the entrance with manners.)

1784
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:17,529
This is... Hold on.

1785
01:03:18,029 --> 01:03:19,770
We should check our shoes somewhere.

1786
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:21,430
- Oh, right.
- Look at everyone.

1787
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,640
- They're walking around barefoot.
- They're barefoot.

1788
01:03:23,899 --> 01:03:26,839
I heard wearing shoes in temples
is considered disrespectful.

1789
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:28,239
That's why they take their shoes off.

1790
01:03:28,239 --> 01:03:31,040
They're barefoot to show respect.

1791
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:33,109
I think we should take them off now.

1792
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,879
- Let's take them off.
- We're the only ones wearing them.

1793
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,350
(They quickly show respect.)

1794
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:44,419
(Actually, shoes are allowed
outside the entrance.)

1795
01:03:44,790 --> 01:03:47,290
- The reason why there's a carpet here...
- Yes.

1796
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:49,629
is that you can't step on the tiles
when the weather is hot.

1797
01:03:49,629 --> 01:03:50,700
It's really hot.

1798
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,770
But it's not hot at all today
because the weather is nice.

1799
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:54,069
People usually walk on the carpet,

1800
01:03:54,069 --> 01:03:55,669
- but it's fine now.
- Okay.

1801
01:03:56,439 --> 01:03:58,640
There it is. We can check our shoes there.

1802
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,239
It's over there. The "shoe stand."

1803
01:04:01,439 --> 01:04:02,609
Shoes.

1804
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:05,080
It's a shoe stand.

1805
01:04:05,080 --> 01:04:06,350
(Every pilgrim uses the shoe stand.)

1806
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:08,719
Hello.

1807
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:10,719
Can we just give them our shoes?

1808
01:04:10,919 --> 01:04:12,450
Give me your shoes.

1809
01:04:12,689 --> 01:04:14,149
- What?
- I think we should check them together.

1810
01:04:14,149 --> 01:04:15,219
We should?

1811
01:04:15,489 --> 01:04:17,259
(Give them to me.)

1812
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:19,460
Is it free?

1813
01:04:19,830 --> 01:04:21,129
- It's free.
- Free.

1814
01:04:21,129 --> 01:04:22,160
Thank you.

1815
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:23,200
Free?

1816
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:24,930
Is it free?

1817
01:04:24,930 --> 01:04:26,330
(Good)

1818
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:29,040
(Good)

1819
01:04:29,469 --> 01:04:31,540
As expected of Sikhism, it's free.

1820
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:32,569
Yes.

1821
01:04:32,569 --> 01:04:33,910
They didn't charge us.

1822
01:04:36,279 --> 01:04:37,379
It's itchy.

1823
01:04:37,379 --> 01:04:38,509
- Your head?
- Yes.

1824
01:04:38,509 --> 01:04:40,049
Hold on.

1825
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:42,049
- What do you do when it's itchy?
- What can you do?

1826
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:44,719
Why?

1827
01:04:45,419 --> 01:04:46,589
It's because it's itchy.

1828
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:48,719
(He was roaming around a bush.)

1829
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,060
- You got it to scratch your head?
- Yes. It's so itchy.

1830
01:04:51,060 --> 01:04:52,230
I got a branch.

1831
01:04:52,230 --> 01:04:53,230
(He got a branch to scratch his head.)

1832
01:04:53,830 --> 01:04:55,660
(Scratching)

1833
01:04:55,660 --> 01:04:56,799
He must've felt much better.

1834
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,299
(Scratching)

1835
01:04:58,830 --> 01:05:00,770
(He's amazing.)

1836
01:05:00,969 --> 01:05:02,899
(The eldest one has an itchy head.)

1837
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,000
(The second one is fine.)

1838
01:05:05,469 --> 01:05:07,609
(And the youngest is a village idiot?)

1839
01:05:07,609 --> 01:05:08,839
My head is itchy.

1840
01:05:09,239 --> 01:05:10,439
It's itchy, isn't it?

1841
01:05:11,279 --> 01:05:13,250
Do you want to borrow it?

1842
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,980
- Do you want to use it?
- I'm fine.

1843
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,480
I should keep this.

1844
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,189
(Precious)

1845
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,450
"Please hand wash."

1846
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,890
It says, "Please hand wash."

1847
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:26,430
We must wash our hands. It's a ritual.

1848
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,089
You should wash your hands.

1849
01:05:28,830 --> 01:05:31,299
(The India Brothers join them
to wash their hands.)

1850
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:34,899
(And there's a woman
who is looking at her left fondly.)

1851
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,500
I love you.

1852
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,569
- "I love you?"
- She said she loved him.

1853
01:05:38,569 --> 01:05:39,710
I love you.

1854
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:41,009
(I love you.)

1855
01:05:41,469 --> 01:05:43,739
She said she loved him
when she just saw him.

1856
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,009
"When she just saw him."

1857
01:05:46,350 --> 01:05:47,509
They've never met before.

1858
01:05:48,250 --> 01:05:49,620
- A YouTuber.
- Yes.

1859
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:52,290
- A Korean YouTuber.
- Yes. Korean.

1860
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,520
Yes. BTS.

1861
01:05:54,520 --> 01:05:55,819
- Do you know BTS?
- How can she say...

1862
01:05:55,819 --> 01:05:57,759
she loves him when she just saw him?

1863
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,830
Gosh.

1864
01:05:58,830 --> 01:06:01,089
Everyone wants to talk to Dex.
It's the same everywhere.

1865
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:03,160
It feels like he's there as a diplomat.

1866
01:06:03,629 --> 01:06:05,230
It's not easy to hear something like that
when you meet for the first time.

1867
01:06:05,230 --> 01:06:06,299
Right.

1868
01:06:06,899 --> 01:06:08,500
- Did she say she loved you?
- What?

1869
01:06:08,500 --> 01:06:10,540
Did she say she loved you?
That's what I heard.

1870
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:11,669
No. She just...

1871
01:06:11,669 --> 01:06:13,169
No. Don't lie.

1872
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:14,339
(People love the youngest
wherever they go.)

1873
01:06:14,339 --> 01:06:15,580
Gosh, it's wet.

1874
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,609
- It's water.
- Really?

1875
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:18,609
There's water.

1876
01:06:18,609 --> 01:06:20,180
It's for washing your feet.

1877
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:21,379
It's very hygienic.

1878
01:06:21,379 --> 01:06:23,020
It's a sacred place.

1879
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,020
That's why they wash their feet like this.

1880
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:26,020
I see.

1881
01:06:26,219 --> 01:06:28,989
All the rituals here begin with water.

1882
01:06:28,989 --> 01:06:31,160
(All the religious rituals in India
begin with water.)

1883
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:34,089
I see it.

1884
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:38,000
(It's crowded with pilgrims.)

1885
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:41,899
(They follow them down the stairs.)

1886
01:06:43,299 --> 01:06:45,839
The Golden Temple is the building
in the middle of the pond, right?

1887
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:46,870
Yes.

1888
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:49,839
Gosh, the view is...

1889
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,250
It's great.

1890
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:55,520
(It's great!)

1891
01:06:57,719 --> 01:06:59,020
(The Golden Temple is
the most sacred place of Sikhism.)

1892
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:01,049
The Golden Temple...

1893
01:07:01,049 --> 01:07:02,390
that is the most sacred place
of Sikhism...

1894
01:07:03,020 --> 01:07:04,520
is known as Harimandir Sahib,

1895
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,060
which means the abode of the deity.

1896
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:10,830
It's visited
by more than 100,000 people every day.

1897
01:07:10,830 --> 01:07:12,700
During the weekend or a religious event,

1898
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:15,200
- almost 200,000 people visit this place.
- Gosh, that's a lot.

1899
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:16,339
- That's a lot.
- Yes.

1900
01:07:16,339 --> 01:07:19,410
They offer free meals and beds...

1901
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:21,140
without discrimination...

1902
01:07:21,140 --> 01:07:24,710
to practice equality,
one of the main beliefs of Sikhism.

1903
01:07:26,180 --> 01:07:30,379
It's maintained and serviced
by volunteers 24 hours a day.

1904
01:07:30,549 --> 01:07:33,049
The pond surrounding the Golden Temple
is known...

1905
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,960
for its miraculous healing effects.

1906
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,319
It's a famous place...

1907
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:40,589
where people bathe, praying to be cured.

1908
01:07:40,589 --> 01:07:46,029
(Sikhs pray toward the Golden Temple.)

1909
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:51,799
(Anyone can always come and rest
in the arms of the generous deity.)

1910
01:07:52,540 --> 01:07:57,439
(Everyone is equal in front of the deity
at the Golden Temple.)

1911
01:07:59,779 --> 01:08:01,580
Pani Bottle, let's pray together.

1912
01:08:01,580 --> 01:08:02,580
Pray?

1913
01:08:18,129 --> 01:08:20,069
I always pray when I go to a temple.

1914
01:08:20,069 --> 01:08:22,739
I made wishes there as well.

1915
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:25,100
For our safe journey.

1916
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:26,770
For my mom's...

1917
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:30,009
good health.

1918
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:33,350
I really didn't understand
why people prayed when I was younger.

1919
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:36,819
I guess people need something
to rely on as they get older.

1920
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:40,790
That's why I find peace after praying.

1921
01:08:41,219 --> 01:08:43,259
I got to enjoy praying more and more.

1922
01:08:43,960 --> 01:08:45,730
Because humans are very weak.

1923
01:08:45,730 --> 01:08:46,830
- Right.
- That's why they pray.

1924
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:50,200
It's a nice thing if you can rely on it
even for a moment.

1925
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,939
Let's take a walk to look around here
and eat.

1926
01:08:57,939 --> 01:08:59,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

1927
01:08:59,239 --> 01:09:00,739
(Looking around)

1928
01:09:01,069 --> 01:09:03,580
(Sparkling)

1929
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:06,810
Do you think that's real gold?

1930
01:09:07,779 --> 01:09:09,180
I'm really curious about that.

1931
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:10,779
That's what I was curious about the most.

1932
01:09:10,779 --> 01:09:12,750
- That's a worldly question.
- That's disrespectful.

1933
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,950
We just prayed there.

1934
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,660
Sorry. Excuse me.

1935
01:09:16,359 --> 01:09:17,790
Is that real gold?

1936
01:09:17,989 --> 01:09:19,290
- Real gold.
- Real gold?

1937
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,560
- Really?
- For real?

1938
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:21,960
- Real gold.
- Real gold.

1939
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:23,700
- Is it 24K?
- Is it 24K?

1940
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:25,500
- Is it 24K?
- Is it 24K?

1941
01:09:25,500 --> 01:09:26,769
- It's 24K.
- Really?

1942
01:09:27,269 --> 01:09:28,769
- Thank you very much.
- Okay. Thank you.

1943
01:09:28,769 --> 01:09:29,899
He says it's real.

1944
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,000
He said it was real gold,
so I looked it up.

1945
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:33,970
What's for sure is that...

1946
01:09:33,970 --> 01:09:37,710
the roof is 750kg of pure gold.

1947
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,279
The roof.

1948
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:40,779
How much is that?

1949
01:09:42,210 --> 01:09:45,250
The building is beautiful.

1950
01:09:46,189 --> 01:09:48,689
They're wearing something H.O.T wore...

1951
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:50,960
when they released their second album,

1952
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:52,359
"We Are the Future."

1953
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:53,729
The way they're standing
looks stylish as well.

1954
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:55,130
(They were trendsetters in Korea
in the late 20th century.)

1955
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:56,760
- It was in my day.
- Yes, it was.

1956
01:09:57,330 --> 01:09:59,000
It's the "We Are the Future" look.

1957
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,970
("We Are India")

1958
01:10:00,970 --> 01:10:02,029
Your style looks like...

1959
01:10:02,769 --> 01:10:05,939
a famous Korean idol group, H.O.T.

1960
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:08,210
You look like H.O.T.

1961
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:11,080
You look like K-Pop style.

1962
01:10:11,080 --> 01:10:12,380
- K-Pop style.
- K-Pop singers.

1963
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:15,080
<i>- We are the future</i>
- They might not know what K-Pop is.

1964
01:10:15,510 --> 01:10:17,620
(After meeting the "We Are India" guys,)

1965
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:19,149
(they could see people
wearing the same style everywhere.)

1966
01:10:19,149 --> 01:10:21,349
Why are they so many people wearing
the "We Are the Future" style?

1967
01:10:21,649 --> 01:10:24,460
We should've worn something stylish
like theirs.

1968
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:26,760
My head is so itchy.

1969
01:10:27,359 --> 01:10:29,300
Did you not wash your hair?

1970
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:31,529
- I washed my hair today.
- You did?

1971
01:10:31,529 --> 01:10:32,970
I washed my hair thoroughly.

1972
01:10:34,769 --> 01:10:37,540
Whenever they enter somewhere,
they wash their feet.

1973
01:10:37,540 --> 01:10:38,769
There aren't that many people.

1974
01:10:38,769 --> 01:10:40,710
(There aren't that many people.)

1975
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:42,979
It looks crowded. Is that not that many?

1976
01:10:42,979 --> 01:10:44,340
It's not a lot for them.

1977
01:10:44,340 --> 01:10:45,750
I see food trays.

1978
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:48,510
(Piled up)

1979
01:10:48,510 --> 01:10:49,880
How many people come here?

1980
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,880
I heard it's about 100,000 people.

1981
01:10:51,880 --> 01:10:53,319
(They offer free meals
to about 100,000 people every day.)

1982
01:10:53,319 --> 01:10:54,620
They have 100,000 people every day?

1983
01:10:56,819 --> 01:10:59,889
(The India Brothers join the others.)

1984
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:02,929
- Thank you.
- Namaste.

1985
01:11:04,399 --> 01:11:06,399
They give us silverware here.

1986
01:11:06,800 --> 01:11:07,830
Thank you.

1987
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,399
(Amazed)

1988
01:11:10,399 --> 01:11:11,439
Thank you.

1989
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,410
(After getting food trays,)

1990
01:11:14,410 --> 01:11:17,179
(they go to the cafeteria
on the 2nd floor.)

1991
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:19,210
(Watching)

1992
01:11:19,609 --> 01:11:21,450
Where are we?

1993
01:11:21,710 --> 01:11:24,179
Is it a cafeteria at the Golden Temple?

1994
01:11:24,750 --> 01:11:26,389
- Where is the line?
- The line is long.

1995
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:28,849
I can smell food cooking.
Gosh, the line is...

1996
01:11:28,849 --> 01:11:30,059
They're all rushing inside.

1997
01:11:31,189 --> 01:11:33,429
The wait isn't as long as it seems.

1998
01:11:33,429 --> 01:11:34,689
People eat and leave very quickly.

1999
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:37,000
This is the place where people eat
and leave the quickest on Earth.

2000
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:38,960
What's nice about this place is...

2001
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:42,099
- You always eat on the floor.
- Yes.

2002
01:11:42,569 --> 01:11:43,639
This place is exactly like that.

2003
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,439
That's good.

2004
01:11:46,269 --> 01:11:49,479
(They enter the cafeteria
that suits Kian84.)

2005
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,479
Gosh, what a view.

2006
01:11:52,010 --> 01:11:53,109
Gosh.

2007
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:58,479
(Pilgrims come in through the doors
that are all over the place.)

2008
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,989
Are we supposed to go this way?

2009
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:03,059
(The cafeteria got full in an instant.)

2010
01:12:03,059 --> 01:12:04,189
Come here.

2011
01:12:05,620 --> 01:12:07,660
Can people go there to eat at any time?

2012
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:10,130
Yes. The Golden Temple
is open 24 hours a day.

2013
01:12:10,130 --> 01:12:11,529
That's nice.

2014
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:14,830
We have to find a place to sit.

2015
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:18,370
- Do you want to sit here?
- Okay.

2016
01:12:18,370 --> 01:12:19,370
Goodness.

2017
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:21,739
(The India Brothers take a seat.)

2018
01:12:22,139 --> 01:12:24,340
This was such perfect timing.

2019
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:27,309
Nobody's eating right now.

2020
01:12:27,309 --> 01:12:28,950
People are just now taking their seats.

2021
01:12:29,420 --> 01:12:32,120
We came here a bit late for breakfast.

2022
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,750
Perfect timing.

2023
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,319
There are so many people,

2024
01:12:35,319 --> 01:12:37,460
- but they're behaving in an orderly...
- They're well-ordered.

2025
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,260
Right. It's so amazing.

2026
01:12:39,359 --> 01:12:40,590
People are eating with their hands here.

2027
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,559
- No, you don't have to use your hands.
- You can use spoons instead.

2028
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:43,929
They're giving us food.

2029
01:12:43,929 --> 01:12:45,130
Gosh.

2030
01:12:46,899 --> 01:12:48,229
- Curry.
- Curry.

2031
01:12:48,229 --> 01:12:49,739
- They gave generous servings.
- Goodness.

2032
01:12:51,239 --> 01:12:52,710
Bread. They're giving us bread.

2033
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:54,910
- Use both hands to accept.
- Both hands.

2034
01:12:54,970 --> 01:12:56,109
Use both hands.

2035
01:12:57,309 --> 01:12:58,679
You have to be as respectful as you can.

2036
01:12:58,679 --> 01:13:00,349
- Because you're thankful.
- "Thank you."

2037
01:13:01,179 --> 01:13:02,250
(Give me bread, please.)

2038
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:05,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2039
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:06,550
(Another type of curry is served.)

2040
01:13:06,550 --> 01:13:07,620
It looks good.

2041
01:13:07,620 --> 01:13:09,790
(Another type of curry is served.)

2042
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,519
The way they serve water is interesting.

2043
01:13:13,859 --> 01:13:14,989
It is interesting.

2044
01:13:14,989 --> 01:13:16,460
- This way.
- Gosh.

2045
01:13:16,859 --> 01:13:18,960
- It's like how they paint the roads...
- Goodness.

2046
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:20,929
(They serve equal amounts of water
using a machine.)

2047
01:13:23,340 --> 01:13:25,000
(Amazed)

2048
01:13:25,300 --> 01:13:27,170
Let's eat. People are eating.

2049
01:13:29,639 --> 01:13:31,340
(Kian84 takes a bite first.)

2050
01:13:31,340 --> 01:13:33,510
This must be freshly made.

2051
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:35,679
(Delicious)

2052
01:13:37,620 --> 01:13:38,720
This is good too.

2053
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:39,920
(He eats a spoonful of curry.)

2054
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,889
- This is good.
- Yes, this is good.

2055
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:46,130
(He's making a wrap.)

2056
01:13:48,260 --> 01:13:50,130
(He's cleaning his fingers.)

2057
01:13:50,929 --> 01:13:53,099
(Let me start eating too.)

2058
01:13:54,529 --> 01:13:57,300
(India's son takes a huge spoonful
of curry as his first bite.)

2059
01:13:57,670 --> 01:13:58,800
This is good.

2060
01:14:01,569 --> 01:14:03,840
(Some curry fell on his leg.)

2061
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,210
(He picks it up right away and eats it.)

2062
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:09,109
(He finishes off by wiping the remainder
with bread and eating it.)

2063
01:14:09,109 --> 01:14:10,120
What?

2064
01:14:10,620 --> 01:14:11,849
He washed himself.

2065
01:14:11,849 --> 01:14:13,149
He's been washing himself, so it's fine.

2066
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:14,489
- He's clean.
- Right.

2067
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,460
(Wiping food off and eating it is
a privilege of having clean feet.)

2068
01:14:18,819 --> 01:14:19,989
This is really good.

2069
01:14:20,929 --> 01:14:23,359
(India's son is enjoying the food
of his hometown.)

2070
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,769
(Devouring the food)

2071
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:31,599
(In the merciful temple,)

2072
01:14:31,599 --> 01:14:33,910
(his mouth knows no mercy.)

2073
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,380
Has he been starved?

2074
01:14:38,639 --> 01:14:40,609
He's been eating a lot recently.

2075
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:41,710
He's eating a lot.

2076
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:42,920
Maybe he's going through a growth spurt.

2077
01:14:42,920 --> 01:14:44,380
Right. He's like a baby right now.

2078
01:14:44,380 --> 01:14:45,620
He eats a lot these days.

2079
01:14:45,679 --> 01:14:48,420
(Baby Bottle is happily eating his food.)

2080
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:49,760
Goodness.
It's good to see him eat, though.

2081
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,720
Pani Bottle came to bulk up.

2082
01:14:53,529 --> 01:14:55,189
Just respond.

2083
01:14:55,189 --> 01:14:56,200
(Do you want another one?)

2084
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:57,800
- We're okay.
- No, thank you.

2085
01:14:58,399 --> 01:14:59,569
He's just giving it to us.

2086
01:14:59,569 --> 01:15:00,800
They serve more
if people don't have enough.

2087
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:02,170
- Really? That's great.
- Gosh.

2088
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:04,439
I wasn't going to eat,
but he gave it to me so...

2089
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:07,840
(Round 2 begins)

2090
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,010
He looks like he gained weight.

2091
01:15:09,010 --> 01:15:10,979
- Right. He's gaining weight right now.
- Yes. He's gaining weight.

2092
01:15:11,580 --> 01:15:13,080
(The older two
are filling up their stomachs.)

2093
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,580
(Glance)

2094
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:18,050
Take a look at Dex.

2095
01:15:18,450 --> 01:15:19,519
Look at him.

2096
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:22,290
- He didn't like the food?
- He didn't like the food?

2097
01:15:22,620 --> 01:15:25,889
It's like it's his third day
of preparing for a competition.

2098
01:15:25,889 --> 01:15:27,130
(A very small bite)

2099
01:15:27,130 --> 01:15:28,359
Day three of preparing for a competition.

2100
01:15:28,359 --> 01:15:29,660
- Don't force yourself to eat.
- Right.

2101
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:32,700
He only has ten percent body fat.

2102
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,899
(The youngest can't even eat
the smallest piece of bread in one bite.)

2103
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:35,370
(Meanwhile,)

2104
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:37,569
(Pani Bottle is eating spoonfuls of food.)

2105
01:15:37,569 --> 01:15:39,269
Isn't this good? No?

2106
01:15:39,269 --> 01:15:40,870
(Respect)

2107
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,779
- Hey, this is...
- You're eating with your spoon.

2108
01:15:42,779 --> 01:15:43,979
I like it.

2109
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:47,750
I shouldn't be leaving leftovers
of precious food...

2110
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:49,550
I felt bad.

2111
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:50,979
I felt like I was causing them
an inconvenience.

2112
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:52,450
- You didn't have a choice.
- Right.

2113
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:54,090
- It's tough.
- After being sick the way you were,

2114
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:55,420
- it's normal to be scared to eat.
- Right.

2115
01:15:57,359 --> 01:16:01,059
(Physical Dex is doing his best.)

2116
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,399
I understand.

2117
01:16:03,630 --> 01:16:06,300
It's usually like that for people
visiting India for the first time.

2118
01:16:06,300 --> 01:16:07,429
Being like,

2119
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:11,269
"Hey, you have to try this
since you're here," is wrong.

2120
01:16:11,269 --> 01:16:14,609
Since Dex is a first-time traveler,

2121
01:16:14,609 --> 01:16:16,080
it's very understandable.

2122
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,510
It was very delicious to me.

2123
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,910
I like creamy food.

2124
01:16:19,179 --> 01:16:21,649
I'm going to gain so much weight
this time. This is a problem.

2125
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:22,849
Look at how his face is chubbier.

2126
01:16:22,849 --> 01:16:23,880
(Pani Bottle who gained weight,
Just Pani Bottle)

2127
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:25,679
- Right. He looks happier.
- He really does.

2128
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:30,059
- He looks so happy.
- He's eating like crazy.

2129
01:16:31,189 --> 01:16:32,519
(He's stealing from Dex's plate
since he is a picky eater.)

2130
01:16:32,519 --> 01:16:34,989
He even took my food. I appreciated him...

2131
01:16:34,989 --> 01:16:37,000
- for emptying my plate.
- Rather than having leftovers.

2132
01:16:37,399 --> 01:16:38,660
(He finished cleaning the dishes.)

2133
01:16:38,660 --> 01:16:40,000
I won't be able to lose weight here.

2134
01:16:42,330 --> 01:16:44,269
(He has another bite
while worrying about his weight.)

2135
01:16:44,269 --> 01:16:46,000
- He's adorable.
- He's adorable.

2136
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,010
(There are so many people
in the huge cafeteria.)

2137
01:16:49,010 --> 01:16:50,410
What a view.

2138
01:16:50,410 --> 01:16:52,210
(There are so many people
in the huge cafeteria.)

2139
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:57,179
Feeding all these people every day...

2140
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,220
would cost them a fortune.

2141
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,319
There are a lot of rich people,

2142
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:03,059
and they keep donating.

2143
01:17:03,059 --> 01:17:04,319
- Donating.
- Yes.

2144
01:17:05,160 --> 01:17:06,760
I guess those people
who have worked hard...

2145
01:17:06,760 --> 01:17:09,189
take care of people who are hungry.

2146
01:17:09,599 --> 01:17:11,130
So the cycle flows.

2147
01:17:11,130 --> 01:17:12,870
- They must donate a lot of money.
- Right.

2148
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:13,929
It's nice.

2149
01:17:14,330 --> 01:17:16,599
(Meanwhile, the youngest...)

2150
01:17:16,599 --> 01:17:17,670
Where are you from?

2151
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:19,870
I'm from South Korea.

2152
01:17:19,870 --> 01:17:22,210
- South Korea? I love that country.
- Yes.

2153
01:17:22,210 --> 01:17:23,239
Really?

2154
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:25,510
- Are you a member of an idol group?
- "Are you a member of an idol group?"

2155
01:17:26,179 --> 01:17:27,580
I'm not an idol group member.

2156
01:17:28,149 --> 01:17:30,649
- I'm just a YouTuber.
- Oh, okay.

2157
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:31,979
I'm not an idol group member.

2158
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,689
Thank you so much.

2159
01:17:33,689 --> 01:17:35,319
This one kind of tastes like...

2160
01:17:35,319 --> 01:17:36,720
Korean instant curry.

2161
01:17:36,720 --> 01:17:38,319
Right. Like Ottogi's instant curry.

2162
01:17:38,319 --> 01:17:39,529
And it tastes like aged kimchi
was mixed into it.

2163
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:40,760
- It tasted like Ottogi's instant curry.
- Right.

2164
01:17:40,760 --> 01:17:42,090
And I wish the bread...

2165
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:44,500
- was a bit crispier.
- I see.

2166
01:17:44,599 --> 01:17:47,269
They're evaluating the food over here.

2167
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:49,200
It feels like a line should be drawn.

2168
01:17:49,200 --> 01:17:50,540
The two of them are in a separate group.

2169
01:17:51,139 --> 01:17:53,510
He's filming a romance
while they're filming an eating show.

2170
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:56,010
Watch whatever you prefer, everyone.

2171
01:17:57,340 --> 01:17:59,710
I had this rice porridge three years ago.

2172
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:01,349
- It tastes exactly the same.
- Really?

2173
01:18:01,349 --> 01:18:03,179
Yes. It tastes how it did back then.

2174
01:18:03,580 --> 01:18:05,450
- The taste that does not change.
- Right.

2175
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:08,819
As you cook a larger portion of food,

2176
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:12,019
the food usually ends up
being less delicious.

2177
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:14,630
Since they're serving the food for free,

2178
01:18:14,630 --> 01:18:15,989
I didn't expect it to be delicious.

2179
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:17,460
But it was good.

2180
01:18:17,460 --> 01:18:19,229
I liked it.

2181
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:22,300
The feeling of everyone eating together...

2182
01:18:22,630 --> 01:18:24,399
was new to me.

2183
01:18:25,099 --> 01:18:28,809
Out of all the restaurants I've been to,

2184
01:18:29,309 --> 01:18:30,510
that was the largest.

2185
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:31,710
In size.

2186
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:33,179
There were more people than when I was...

2187
01:18:33,179 --> 01:18:34,849
- at the army training center.
- Right.

2188
01:18:34,849 --> 01:18:37,250
And everyone eating together
on the floor...

2189
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:38,250
Yes.

2190
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:41,950
made me feel as if that was...

2191
01:18:41,950 --> 01:18:43,389
my childhood hometown.

2192
01:18:43,389 --> 01:18:45,660
- You felt at ease there, even though...
- Like when Son Goku...

2193
01:18:45,660 --> 01:18:48,489
- it was an unfamiliar place.
- Like when Son Goku...

2194
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:51,800
returns to Saiyan.

2195
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,599
You felt that in that moment.

2196
01:18:53,599 --> 01:18:54,670
Yes.

2197
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:58,269
(People leave Goku84's hometown
after eating.)

2198
01:18:59,269 --> 01:19:01,710
As it got closer to lunchtime,

2199
01:19:01,809 --> 01:19:03,779
- a lot of people...
- Gosh.

2200
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:05,809
- You guys went there a bit early.
- Yes.

2201
01:19:06,279 --> 01:19:08,450
(Kian84 finishes up eating
with a palate cleanser.)

2202
01:19:09,179 --> 01:19:10,349
(Dex wraps up his diplomatic activities.)

2203
01:19:10,349 --> 01:19:12,050
He took pictures there too.

2204
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:13,090
Let's go.

2205
01:19:14,290 --> 01:19:15,519
Thank you for the food.

2206
01:19:16,859 --> 01:19:18,120
Bye.

2207
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:21,359
(He squeezed her hand.)

2208
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,729
(Look at that.)

2209
01:19:23,899 --> 01:19:25,559
(He's embarrassed.)

2210
01:19:25,729 --> 01:19:26,800
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2211
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,700
That is blasphemous.

2212
01:19:29,399 --> 01:19:31,269
How dare you,
in the face of the Deity of Sikhism?

2213
01:19:32,139 --> 01:19:36,010
Actually, Sharkhism...

2214
01:19:36,010 --> 01:19:37,380
- Sikhism.
- Sikhism.

2215
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:39,010
- "Sharkhism."
- You kept taking pictures...

2216
01:19:39,010 --> 01:19:41,050
and doing things like this.
That's why you don't know.

2217
01:19:41,050 --> 01:19:43,120
- It's Sikhism.
- Sikhism.

2218
01:19:43,420 --> 01:19:44,580
- "Sharkhism."
- "Sharkhism."

2219
01:19:44,580 --> 01:19:47,050
- That sounds so scary.
- It's not a religion of sharks.

2220
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:49,189
The Deity of Sikhism can
even embrace such things.

2221
01:19:49,189 --> 01:19:50,960
- That's so funny.
- That was cute.

2222
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:52,059
Let's go.

2223
01:19:52,059 --> 01:19:54,389
(The India Brothers finished their meal.)

2224
01:19:54,790 --> 01:19:57,130
We are now heading toward the exit.

2225
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:00,899
That's the exit.

2226
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:04,170
(People are standing in a long line...)

2227
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:07,670
(and are passing the food trays
down the line.)

2228
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:11,510
(The three return their trays.)

2229
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:14,080
The people who are working
are all volunteers.

2230
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:16,319
They don't get paid.

2231
01:20:16,450 --> 01:20:17,720
- Really?
- Yes.

2232
01:20:17,720 --> 01:20:21,189
It's amazing that they're all volunteers.

2233
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:24,090
- Can we head over there?
- Yes. Let's go.

2234
01:20:25,889 --> 01:20:27,960
(They enter the place to take a look.)

2235
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,359
(Thumping)

2236
01:20:30,359 --> 01:20:31,359
(Clattering)

2237
01:20:32,359 --> 01:20:34,630
(Surprised)

2238
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:39,170
(Throwing)

2239
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:40,540
- Be gentle.
- Oh, gosh.

2240
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,410
- Gosh.
- It's more aggressive than I thought.

2241
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:45,410
They're volunteers, but they're mad.

2242
01:20:45,410 --> 01:20:46,950
They just throw them.

2243
01:20:46,950 --> 01:20:48,279
It's because they're busy.

2244
01:20:50,420 --> 01:20:53,090
(Startled)

2245
01:20:53,090 --> 01:20:55,420
- Oh, my.
- Something kept popping up.

2246
01:20:55,819 --> 01:20:58,420
I can't hear anything. It's a battlefield.

2247
01:20:59,790 --> 01:21:01,260
Because there are many people,

2248
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:03,029
- they need to get things done quickly.
- Yes. They're busy.

2249
01:21:03,630 --> 01:21:06,000
People on this side...

2250
01:21:06,769 --> 01:21:08,529
are washing dishes.

2251
01:21:08,529 --> 01:21:10,670
(Volunteers who do the dishes)

2252
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:12,399
It reminds me
of when I was doing the dishes...

2253
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:15,739
in the military about 20 years ago.

2254
01:21:17,179 --> 01:21:18,679
The sound of food trays.

2255
01:21:18,679 --> 01:21:20,050
(It reminds him of the time
when he was serving in the military.)

2256
01:21:20,479 --> 01:21:22,750
They're not doing the dishes...

2257
01:21:22,750 --> 01:21:24,620
because they're newbies.

2258
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:27,290
They volunteered...

2259
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,290
to do this.

2260
01:21:30,290 --> 01:21:31,859
- They're willing to do it.
- Yes.

2261
01:21:31,859 --> 01:21:33,330
(They're looking at the rare sight.)

2262
01:21:33,330 --> 01:21:35,229
(Approaching)

2263
01:21:36,029 --> 01:21:37,399
(Do you want to try it?)

2264
01:21:37,399 --> 01:21:39,330
(Washing the dishes)

2265
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,330
(Follow me.)

2266
01:21:41,330 --> 01:21:43,069
(Clattering)

2267
01:21:43,069 --> 01:21:44,170
I can't hear anything.

2268
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,639
It was so loud there.

2269
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,269
The sound of clattering food trays.

2270
01:21:50,309 --> 01:21:52,840
(The 2 elders are assigned
to their posts 1st.)

2271
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:54,410
Over here? Thank you.

2272
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:58,979
(The youngest also goes to work.)

2273
01:21:59,679 --> 01:22:00,689
(Glancing)

2274
01:22:00,689 --> 01:22:01,849
There's nothing to wash the dishes with.

2275
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:04,620
(Here it is.)

2276
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:08,330
Thank you. Where are the food trays?

2277
01:22:09,189 --> 01:22:11,000
(Sponge)

2278
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,130
- Thank you.
- So many people gave him a sponge.

2279
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:14,670
- They're kind.
- Yes.

2280
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:19,370
(Thanks to their kindness,
he starts doing the dishes.)

2281
01:22:20,939 --> 01:22:23,880
(He's done with one.)

2282
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,510
Why?

2283
01:22:27,779 --> 01:22:29,149
There's nothing to do.

2284
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:31,050
The volunteers worked so hard...

2285
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:32,580
that everyone was waiting.

2286
01:22:33,080 --> 01:22:35,019
- There's nothing to do.
- There's nothing to do.

2287
01:22:35,889 --> 01:22:36,920
Here it is.

2288
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:38,819
- Oh, my.
- What's the matter?

2289
01:22:38,819 --> 01:22:40,830
- Here's the work.
- What is this?

2290
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,130
Here it is.

2291
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:44,859
Here's the work.

2292
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:48,599
It's a work party.

2293
01:22:51,739 --> 01:22:53,269
(A big smile)

2294
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:56,109
They poured them...

2295
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:57,580
- as if they were feeding cows.
- I know.

2296
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:59,340
Even though I was working
without getting paid,

2297
01:22:59,340 --> 01:23:01,050
I felt happy when I had something to do.

2298
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,779
Right as we said
that we had nothing to do...

2299
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,620
That's why you shouldn't say
something like that.

2300
01:23:05,679 --> 01:23:07,450
You shouldn't say, "Why is it so quiet?"

2301
01:23:08,250 --> 01:23:10,260
The moment we said,
"There's nothing to do,"

2302
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,859
we got so much.

2303
01:23:11,859 --> 01:23:13,059
Look at this.

2304
01:23:13,460 --> 01:23:16,090
When I was in the military,

2305
01:23:16,599 --> 01:23:18,330
my superiors told me off...

2306
01:23:18,330 --> 01:23:20,029
when they saw my hands
while washing the dishes.

2307
01:23:20,529 --> 01:23:22,599
I'm really good at doing the dishes.

2308
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,809
(He's showing off his dishwashing skills
he learned from his superiors...)

2309
01:23:26,809 --> 01:23:29,139
(when he was serving in the military.)

2310
01:23:31,609 --> 01:23:32,880
The man behind him looks pleased.

2311
01:23:33,139 --> 01:23:34,210
(He gives him a gentle pat
to compliment him.)

2312
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,380
He received a compliment.

2313
01:23:37,519 --> 01:23:39,179
The old man acknowledged me.

2314
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,920
(Laughing)

2315
01:23:44,389 --> 01:23:45,559
Hurry up.

2316
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:48,189
I liked doing the dishes.

2317
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,760
(The compliment made him excited,
and he started working hard.)

2318
01:23:51,300 --> 01:23:52,960
What I felt there was...

2319
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:54,630
I heard this is what Sikhism teaches.

2320
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:58,239
You should work hard to earn money.
That's something they believe in.

2321
01:23:58,769 --> 01:24:02,439
I felt that when I saw
how they did the dishes there.

2322
01:24:03,679 --> 01:24:05,609
We have similar mindsets.

2323
01:24:07,149 --> 01:24:10,120
(As much as others worked for them,
they work for others as well.)

2324
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:11,979
Where is Dex?

2325
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:14,590
I was working separately.

2326
01:24:16,489 --> 01:24:18,660
(Singing)

2327
01:24:20,889 --> 01:24:24,059
(The youngest didn't eat much
as the food didn't suit his palate.)

2328
01:24:24,729 --> 01:24:26,800
(You left so much food.)

2329
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:29,729
(Pray to wash your sin away.)

2330
01:24:31,099 --> 01:24:32,300
That's why you worked harder.

2331
01:24:32,300 --> 01:24:34,470
Yes. I thought
I had to work hard, at least.

2332
01:24:36,510 --> 01:24:40,349
(He's atoning by volunteering
instead of praying.)

2333
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:42,609
(How adorable you are.)

2334
01:24:42,609 --> 01:24:44,479
His eyes could pierce his face.

2335
01:24:44,479 --> 01:24:45,849
He has hearts in his eyes.

2336
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:49,250
It was quite funny
when I was doing the dishes.

2337
01:24:49,250 --> 01:24:52,319
The elderly gentleman next to me
smiled at me.

2338
01:24:52,590 --> 01:24:54,460
Even when I was doing a bad job,

2339
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:56,700
he adored me as if I was his grandson.

2340
01:24:57,429 --> 01:24:59,500
I felt that everyone was kind.

2341
01:25:01,929 --> 01:25:05,899
(While the youngest who is atoning
is being adored...)

2342
01:25:06,300 --> 01:25:08,410
I'll bring more food trays.

2343
01:25:08,410 --> 01:25:09,840
- Okay.
- It didn't take long.

2344
01:25:11,710 --> 01:25:14,380
(The eldest one who is passionate
goes to get more stuff to work on.)

2345
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,279
(Clattering)

2346
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:17,279
(Let me see.)

2347
01:25:17,279 --> 01:25:18,580
Did you have to take those?

2348
01:25:18,580 --> 01:25:20,090
By yourself?

2349
01:25:21,050 --> 01:25:22,450
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

2350
01:25:27,630 --> 01:25:30,300
(The eldest,
who was hesitating, joins in.)

2351
01:25:33,429 --> 01:25:34,599
Get up quickly.

2352
01:25:35,029 --> 01:25:36,029
My gosh.

2353
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:39,000
Oh, no. It might hit his face.

2354
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,470
(Why isn't he coming?)

2355
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:43,840
(The second eldest goes to find
the eldest.)

2356
01:25:45,910 --> 01:25:48,380
(He's frozen like that.)

2357
01:25:48,849 --> 01:25:51,420
(Kian84?)

2358
01:25:54,120 --> 01:25:59,290
(What will happen to the eldest who can't
get it together on the battlefield?)

2359
01:26:00,160 --> 01:26:01,330
(No work,)

2360
01:26:01,330 --> 01:26:02,889
(no food!)

2361
01:26:03,429 --> 01:26:07,069
(Endless work)

2362
01:26:07,069 --> 01:26:08,200
My eyes are burning.

2363
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,500
(They're light-headed.)

2364
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,840
(Tears are falling.)

2365
01:26:12,439 --> 01:26:14,410
(The India Brothers work hard
for what they ate.)

2366
01:26:14,670 --> 01:26:16,170
(And...)

2367
01:26:16,540 --> 01:26:18,979
(the lowering of the flags ceremony...)

2368
01:26:18,979 --> 01:26:20,910
(at the border between India and Pakistan)

2369
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:25,080
(Welcome to Wagah Border.)

2370
01:26:26,019 --> 01:26:27,019
(Screaming)

2371
01:26:27,420 --> 01:26:29,220
(Bollywood84 appears again.)

2372
01:26:29,519 --> 01:26:31,760
(The youngest joins him today.)

2373
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,929
(The cheerleader's hand gesture...)

2374
01:26:34,260 --> 01:26:36,359
(brings up the energy.)

2375
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:38,700
(Guys, I'm having so much fun.)

2376
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,700
(I'm having so much fun.)

2377
01:26:40,170 --> 01:26:43,569
(He fell in love with the charm of India
today as always.)

2378
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,840
(Thumping)

2379
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:52,840
(What on earth happened?)

2380
01:26:54,349 --> 01:26:57,420
(You can't predict anything on this trip.)

2381
01:26:57,950 --> 01:26:59,220
Can the car even go?

2382
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,489
(Adventure by Accident 2)
