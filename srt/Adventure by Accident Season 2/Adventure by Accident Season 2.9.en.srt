1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:03,169
My hands are freezing

2
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:05,440
- My feet are freezing
- My feet are freezing

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:09,849
(The younger ones are very excited,
walking downhill.)

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:11,349
(Whooping)

5
00:00:11,949 --> 00:00:13,949
Everyone has gone mad
because of altitude sickness.

6
00:00:13,949 --> 00:00:14,949
(Screaming)

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:18,719
- Let's go quickly.
- These guys are crazy.

8
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,760
I will never think lightly
of altitude sickness again.

9
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:23,230
(He must've had a hard time.)

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,500
My gosh.

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,070
The word "cold" doesn't suit this place.

12
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:28,600
It's ice cold.

13
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,969
- It feels like my ears...
- I'm losing my mind.

14
00:00:29,969 --> 00:00:32,770
will be frozen to the point
that they'll split apart.

15
00:00:33,609 --> 00:00:35,109
We're going down.

16
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:37,009
It was minus 12℃. Gosh.

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,579
We went up to 5,300m. Now, it's 4,900m.

18
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:40,579
(The altitude is getting lower.)

19
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:41,909
(Running under the clear sky
while being welcomed by the clouds)

20
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,310
The snow is disappearing.

21
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,780
The road is clear now.

22
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,850
It's nice.

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,350
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

24
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,689
- It looks like a movie.
- That's cool.

25
00:00:48,689 --> 00:00:49,950
- The scenery here...
- It's wonderful.

26
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,659
is completely different from earlier.

27
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:53,189
Why is it so different? It's interesting.

28
00:00:53,189 --> 00:00:55,530
- Gosh, this place is...
- Doesn't it kind of look like Mongolia?

29
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:57,500
- Yes.
- Yes. It was like Mongolia.

30
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,200
(Leh at 3,300m, Taglang La at 5,328m,
Puga Hot Springs)

31
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,439
(It takes about 2 hours and 30 minutes.)

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,170
We're going to Puga.

33
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:08,840
- Puga. Puga Village.
- Puga?

34
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,180
- Okay.
- Okay.

35
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:11,640
Let me...

36
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,909
- The sun can't get through to his skin.
- I bought...

37
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,010
just one bottle of sunscreen.
And I used it all before I left.

38
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,519
Well done. You made the best of it.

39
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,920
Are we sleeping here today?

40
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,519
Let's find a place to pitch a tent.

41
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,790
I hope it's by the river.

42
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,430
- So that we can do the dishes.
- Yes.

43
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:29,129
- You're right.
- He looks so pretty.

44
00:01:29,129 --> 00:01:30,430
(Delicate)

45
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,060
Let's get out.

46
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:34,730
(After thoroughly applying sunscreen,
they get out of the car.)

47
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,329
Should we go over there?

48
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,939
I heard we should go farther in.

49
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:40,810
The hot spring is in the center
of the plateau.

50
00:01:41,069 --> 00:01:42,239
So we had to walk quite a lot.

51
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,780
Gosh, why is the water so clear?

52
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,109
The water is so clear.

53
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:48,579
(A clear brook is flowing
as if it's welcoming them.)

54
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:50,579
- This was fascinating.
- It's amazing.

55
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,480
It's like "National Geographic."

56
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,750
(In spring,
life comes back, and it turns green.)

57
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,019
What's this?

58
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,989
(It's a habitat
for various wild animals...)

59
00:02:00,019 --> 00:02:01,489
- Gosh.
- Gosh, what is this?

60
00:02:01,489 --> 00:02:03,030
(and a comfortable shelter for nomads.)

61
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,170
(There are hot springs
in unique shapes everywhere.)

62
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,930
- Oh, my.
- It's a hot spring.

63
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,240
It's a natural hot spring.

64
00:02:12,169 --> 00:02:14,240
(Ladakh's gem...)

65
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,370
(that is blessed by nature)

66
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:16,879
It's magnificent.

67
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,009
(Puga Hot Springs)

68
00:02:19,009 --> 00:02:21,050
It looks like CGI.

69
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,620
- Isn't it mysterious?
- Yes.

70
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:28,550
How do we cross it?

71
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,020
- Just jump.
- Will it be okay?

72
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:33,860
(Jumping)

73
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,330
- Gosh.
- As expected.

74
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,659
Did you cross it?

75
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,560
I might fall. I don't know.

76
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,729
(Groaning)

77
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:44,870
Okay. Easy.

78
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,900
(Following the youngest,
the two older ones made it as well.)

79
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,610
(They start walking
in search of the hot spring.)

80
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,069
(Windy)

81
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:54,479
(The strong wind
hits their entire bodies.)

82
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:56,449
I just walked for a moment.

83
00:02:56,449 --> 00:02:58,050
And I'm running out of breath.

84
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,090
Where is the hot spring? It's over there.

85
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,020
- It's steaming.
- Over there.

86
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,159
(Across the flat field
where the three brothers are)

87
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,990
(Passing by the bumpy land)

88
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:13,569
(Even crossing the wetland)

89
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:15,569
(They need to walk for a long time...)

90
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,599
(to finally see the hot spring.)

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,900
- This is it.
- It's unique.

92
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,379
- The land is...
- It's very interesting terrain.

93
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:28,150
Gosh, it's a continuous mix
of uphill and downhill.

94
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:31,449
The area has a lot of geothermal energy.

95
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,689
So the mud around the hot springs...

96
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:35,990
form small mounds like that.

97
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,990
I see.

98
00:03:37,789 --> 00:03:40,120
(They start walking on bumpy mounds.)

99
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:42,689
(Panting)

100
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,800
(It's more difficult to walk
because of the high altitude and terrain.)

101
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,270
It's also at a high altitude.

102
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,300
It's about 4,400m high.

103
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:52,469
What are they? Water buffalos?

104
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,139
They look like yaks.

105
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,639
Yaks.

106
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,439
I see so many things
that look like some goat poop.

107
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,550
(Poop)

108
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,180
There was a lot of poop.

109
00:04:04,349 --> 00:04:05,780
I think it's a little muddy here.

110
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,319
- Be careful here.
- It's muddy.

111
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,289
The color of the grass is also different.

112
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:10,460
(It's a wetland after the mounds.)

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,219
Follow me in a place like this.

114
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:14,860
Come this way.

115
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,300
(In case their shoes get wet,)

116
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,170
(the youngest leads them
to where it's dry.)

117
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,970
Did they film "The Lord of the Rings"
in India?

118
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:28,310
It looks like that movie.

119
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,379
(A vast scenery that looks
like a scene from a movie)

120
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,910
This is magnificent.

121
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:35,310
- It looks amazing.
- It's wonderful.

122
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,879
When I saw it for the first time,

123
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,779
it didn't feel real.

124
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:42,089
It's a cliche,
but it looked like a picture.

125
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:45,060
It was majestic.

126
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,959
A natural scenery like this
is overwhelming.

127
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:48,060
- Seriously.
- Yes.

128
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,990
(The Three Brothers walk endlessly.)

129
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,360
It seems they're walking a lot.

130
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,300
We're here.

131
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:58,300
It's here.

132
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,300
(They have arrived.)

133
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,339
It's fascinating.

134
00:05:00,339 --> 00:05:02,240
It's not a manmade structure.

135
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,439
I think the rock was naturally shaped
like that as the water kept shooting out.

136
00:05:06,579 --> 00:05:08,579
Did it become like that
as pebbles piled up?

137
00:05:08,579 --> 00:05:10,420
- It looks like a fountain.
- I know.

138
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,550
It's very warm.

139
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,620
It's warm.

140
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:17,660
It's not deep enough to take a bath.

141
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,860
I was going to have a bath
if it was deep enough.

142
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,959
I thought I should take a bath...

143
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,930
- like I did in Peru.
- I see.

144
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,060
But I couldn't.

145
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,699
(He's disappointed at this moment.)

146
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,899
(Splashing)

147
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,600
It's like face mist.

148
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,740
I need to absorb the moisture
because it's dry.

149
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,810
(He's happy with the natural mist
instead of a bath.)

150
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:37,939
Sulfur mist.

151
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,939
He's becoming like Kian84.

152
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,550
(Meanwhile,)

153
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,949
(the original Kian84 is...)

154
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,350
(Patting)

155
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,620
(Flopping)
He will lie down.

156
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,790
He should lie down.

157
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,790
(Comfortable)

158
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:56,790
The posture.

159
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,660
(Meanwhile, the second oldest
absorbed enough moisture.)

160
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:03,199
(He rolls up his pants.)

161
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,699
(He even takes his socks off
without hesitation.)

162
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,269
Is he Pak Se Ri?

163
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,579
(With the energy of the national hero,)

164
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,680
(he goes into the water.)

165
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
(Groaning)
It's hot.

166
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:17,009
Is it hot? Be careful.

167
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:19,620
(Thrilling)

168
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,120
(Laughing)

169
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,149
This is nice.

170
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,720
(Laughing)

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,160
(Moaning)

172
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,889
(In their own ways,)

173
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,430
(they're enjoying the break.)

174
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,629
What do you think?

175
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,899
It's so warm and nice when I go in.

176
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,769
- But it'll be cold when you get out.
- I don't know what to do after that.

177
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:41,509
In the end, my feet might be frozen.

178
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:42,509
Right?

179
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,540
(Staring)

180
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,110
Put your foot back in the water.

181
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,279
- Put your foot back in the water.
- In the water?

182
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,310
To keep your foot warm.

183
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,120
(He does as he says for now.)

184
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,420
- Okay.
- Then...

185
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,949
(Wiping)

186
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,019
- Is your jacket okay?
- Yes.

187
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:59,860
(He's wiping his muddy foot
with his clothes!)

188
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,990
(My gosh!)

189
00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:03,129
- That's sweet.
- Is he Alex?

190
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:05,060
Right.

191
00:07:05,529 --> 00:07:06,730
- Is your jacket okay?
- Yes.

192
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,899
Once your feet get cold and freeze...

193
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,800
It would be hard to do that
even for your girlfriend.

194
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,040
It was my first time.

195
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,339
My foot must be dirty.

196
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:17,779
It's okay.

197
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,850
- Now...
- Now...

198
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:22,250
You should wear the sock quickly now.

199
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,879
(Staggering)

200
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,819
- He's holding him.
- It's heart-warming.

201
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:30,620
(Aldex, a guy
who is even more romantic than Alex)

202
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,220
Come on.

203
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,360
Okay.

204
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:36,160
- Okay.
- Okay.

205
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,300
- Your right foot.
- Yes.

206
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:38,930
- Your right foot.
- Okay.

207
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,300
You were watching as well?

208
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,370
(He saw the other two
having a sweet moment.)

209
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:43,769
Hey, use mine.

210
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,470
(Kilex is here.)

211
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,110
- What's this?
- "Kilex."

212
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,470
(Kilex versus Aldex,
a battle between romantic guys)

213
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,509
- What's this?
- "Kilex."

214
00:07:50,509 --> 00:07:51,980
I can't lose.

215
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,009
A sweet battle.

216
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,850
Feel my sweetness.

217
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:58,519
(Being unsophisticated yet sweet
is Kilex's charm.)

218
00:07:59,949 --> 00:08:04,790
(They're being overly sweet
when no one wants them to be.)

219
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:05,920
It's funny.

220
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:08,790
Why is your foot so swollen?
What's wrong with it?

221
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,759
(Chubby)

222
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,730
That looks like a baby's ankle.

223
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,829
That's enough.

224
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,870
Thank you.

225
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:19,339
Gosh, my baby has pretty feet.

226
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,939
Your feet are so chubby.

227
00:08:20,939 --> 00:08:22,670
(Amazed)

228
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:23,980
Why would you say that?

229
00:08:24,209 --> 00:08:26,839
You should be able to see
where the bones are.

230
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,110
But you can't see them.

231
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,910
(Laughing quietly)

232
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,980
Thank you.

233
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,379
(He quickly covers his cute baby ankles.)

234
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,419
Let's go.

235
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,019
The sun will set soon.
We should pitch the tent quickly.

236
00:08:37,889 --> 00:08:40,389
I think that looks like a nice spot.

237
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,090
- The white spot?
- Inside there.

238
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:44,159
Do you see the elevated area?

239
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:46,259
Inside the elevated area.

240
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:51,000
That looks like a nice spot.
It will block the wind.

241
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
A mountain in the back
and a river in the front.

242
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,340
A mountain in the back
and a river in the front.

243
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,169
- "A mountain and a river?"
- "A mountain and a river?"

244
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,340
Isn't it a perfect spot?

245
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,779
The price of the land will rise.

246
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:01,149
There's a mountain in the back
and a river in the front.

247
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,250
Inside the elevated area.

248
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,279
- Okay.
- Yes.

249
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,820
Should we put the bags down first?

250
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,049
(As we decided on the spot,
should we put the bags down first?)

251
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,220
Gosh, it's heavy.

252
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,159
(They're moving the bags
with light hearts.)

253
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:15,629
- They unloaded all the bags.
- Yes.

254
00:09:15,629 --> 00:09:16,690
Where's the driver?

255
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:18,159
He slept in a lodging.

256
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,269
We decided to meet the next day...

257
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,570
- before we said goodbye.
- That's nice.

258
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,070
First, we'll set up a tent here.

259
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,169
I'll flatten the ground.

260
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:30,440
In the meantime, you guys open the tent...

261
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,039
- and set things up.
- Okay.

262
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,379
We didn't have much time back then.

263
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:36,379
- You had to do it before the sunset.
- No matter what.

264
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,980
(The youngest quickly divides the roles
as they don't have much time.)

265
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,049
Captain Dex.

266
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,889
Before I dig...

267
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,320
(Let me see.)

268
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:48,529
Why did you edit it like this?

269
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:49,629
(His eyes are on UDT mode.)

270
00:09:50,429 --> 00:09:52,429
(He studies the terrain with his eyes
that used to search for enemies.)

271
00:09:52,429 --> 00:09:53,629
(Okay)

272
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,899
(He begins immediately.)

273
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
(Digging)

274
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,809
(As he's digging without hesitation,)

275
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,139
(the soil is splattering.)

276
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,980
(Digging)

277
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,779
(Taking out stones)

278
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:10,279
(Pressing)

279
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,279
It was harder to breathe,
and I was more tired than usual.

280
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,820
- Right.
- But I thought I had to be responsible...

281
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,950
as I took them there.

282
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,559
(Meanwhile, the two older guys)

283
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:23,730
I really moved just a little bit.

284
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,730
Yes.

285
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,700
But it feels like I ran.

286
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,799
- You're out of breath, right?
- Yes.

287
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:29,769
(Taking out)

288
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:33,139
(Breathing in)

289
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
(Breathing out)

290
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,509
(He did nothing, but he needs oxygen.)

291
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:40,309
He's tired even when he's just standing.

292
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:41,549
(Accepting that he has altitude sickness,
he inhales it with no hesitation.)

293
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,419
- Did you already use it all?
- Yes.

294
00:10:48,049 --> 00:10:49,190
Who used this all up?

295
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,919
(It was him.)

296
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,990
How do I do this?

297
00:10:54,559 --> 00:10:56,559
Let's do it together.

298
00:10:57,559 --> 00:10:59,230
(They start setting up the tent together.)

299
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,299
Push it.

300
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,429
- Push.
- Push.

301
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,570
- It looks quite good now.
- Yes. It's done.

302
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:06,470
Gosh.

303
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,440
I'm tired.

304
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,039
(The older guys got tired soon.)

305
00:11:11,039 --> 00:11:12,080
I'm dizzy.

306
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,080
(And...)

307
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:21,049
(there's someone who doesn't get tired.)

308
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,590
- Dex.
- Yes.

309
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,490
Didn't you say that you'll have
a therapeutic time in the Himalayas?

310
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,860
Isn't this therapeutic?

311
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,090
I forced them to feel
the therapeutic energy.

312
00:11:28,629 --> 00:11:29,659
Gosh.

313
00:11:29,659 --> 00:11:31,500
- Their teamwork is great.
- Yes.

314
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,960
(As they worked hard with the guy
who claims to have a therapeutic time,)

315
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,600
(they finished it before the shadow of
the mountain completely covered the land.)

316
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:38,870
It's done.

317
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,639
(That's how a piece of Dex's dream
is completed.)

318
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,309
You're going to cook now, right?

319
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:45,009
Was it our 1st meal or the 2nd meal?

320
00:11:45,009 --> 00:11:46,139
We pretty much didn't eat anything.

321
00:11:46,139 --> 00:11:48,450
- You're going to cook ramyeon, right?
- Yes. Ramyeon.

322
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,649
- It's going to be amazing.
- It would be nice.

323
00:11:50,649 --> 00:11:52,950
- If I find tree branches around here,
- Yes.

324
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,049
- I'll try making chopsticks with them.
- Make chopsticks.

325
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,090
We bought so many things,
but we didn't buy chopsticks.

326
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,830
I'll make a kitchen then.

327
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:01,830
Okay.

328
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:05,059
I will make a fire...

329
00:12:05,659 --> 00:12:09,629
with horse poop.
I saw people making a fire with it.

330
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,139
(He saw it in a documentary.)

331
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:14,370
Because there aren't many trees.

332
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,370
Right. There are no trees at all.

333
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,110
But it lasts longer than wood.

334
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,080
How did they find that out?

335
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,179
(Drying)

336
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,549
Wait. I need to bring a pile of poop.

337
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:26,720
There was fuel all around us.

338
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,250
Gosh. It's a field of poop.

339
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:31,889
(Exclaiming)

340
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,490
(Picking up)

341
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,830
He picked up poop.

342
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:37,360
I picked up poop.

343
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,529
There's a lot over there.

344
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,169
(He goes to the area with a lot of poop.)

345
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,700
There's a lot of poop.

346
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,870
(It looks like a picture
of the guy who picks up poop.)

347
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,309
(Fuel)

348
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,110
(Touching)

349
00:12:51,379 --> 00:12:52,480
Oh, gosh.

350
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,809
It's so wet.

351
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,309
(Fuel)

352
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:58,549
It was dry outside and moist inside.

353
00:12:58,549 --> 00:12:59,919
- "Dry outside and moist inside."
- "Dry outside and moist inside."

354
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,019
I can't use something
that is dry outside and moist inside.

355
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:05,090
(He carefully distinguishes fuel.)

356
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,220
(Fuel)

357
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,259
It's like
"TV Show Authentic Masterpieces."

358
00:13:07,259 --> 00:13:08,590
- "TV Show Authentic Poop."
- "TV Show Authentic Poop."

359
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,659
(He throws away the fake ones.)

360
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,100
(Fuel)

361
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,429
(He checks how moist it is
as if he's appraising it.)

362
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:14,629
He looks like an appraiser.

363
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:15,799
- He's...
- It's crispy.

364
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,600
a poop appraiser.

365
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
Those ones burn well.

366
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,110
(While the eldest is appraising poop
to find crispy fuel...)

367
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,970
Something like this.

368
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:24,639
Something like this.

369
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:26,539
(One more)

370
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,009
- How will you eat without chopsticks?
- These will do.

371
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:33,850
Gosh, what's he doing?

372
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:35,049
- Is he making chopsticks?
- What?

373
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,149
(The first step toward
developing the human culture)

374
00:13:37,789 --> 00:13:39,659
(This looks like the Stone Age.)

375
00:13:39,659 --> 00:13:41,330
- Gosh.
- Okay.

376
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,299
- These are good.
- He even tried them out.

377
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,600
- Great.
- All good.

378
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,570
(He made nice chopsticks
for the brothers.)

379
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,629
All good.

380
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,200
Okay. And as for these...

381
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:53,769
(Washing them in the ice-cold river)

382
00:13:53,769 --> 00:13:54,809
(Groaning)

383
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:55,940
(The handmade chopsticks are ready.)

384
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,580
- Okay.
- The water was really cold.

385
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:58,580
(Falling backward)

386
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:02,409
(Screaming out)

387
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:04,419
This is the wildlife.

388
00:14:05,049 --> 00:14:07,080
He looks like he belongs in a documentary.

389
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,620
- The wildlife.
- For some reason...

390
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,620
- He does look like a local.
- Yes. This place suits him.

391
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,389
- Dex.
- Yes.

392
00:14:13,389 --> 00:14:14,529
I made wooden chopsticks.

393
00:14:14,529 --> 00:14:15,690
(Showing off the chopsticks
he made to the youngest)

394
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,899
There were branches?

395
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,659
These are all we have.
There aren't any more branches here.

396
00:14:20,659 --> 00:14:22,169
- No more?
- There are no more branches.

397
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,070
Where's Kian84, by the way?

398
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,399
Over there.

399
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,970
He's shopping right now.

400
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:28,240
- He's shopping?
- Yes.

401
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,539
(Looking around)

402
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,279
I see. Is he picking up poop?

403
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,379
(Panting)

404
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,250
It won't take long.
There's a lot of poop here.

405
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,019
The bag is pretty full now.

406
00:14:41,289 --> 00:14:42,320
(Heavy)

407
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,620
He collected a lot.

408
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:46,059
It was like he was going
to stay there for four days.

409
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,059
Right.

410
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,730
(He returns to the tent
with a bag full of poop.)

411
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,629
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

412
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:53,399
Gosh, everyone.

413
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,799
(Is there something
Kian84 wants to say all of a sudden?)

414
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,899
My stomach hurts. Can I use the bathroom?

415
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:02,240
- Are you serious? Or are you acting?
- I'm sorry.

416
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,710
(Actually,)

417
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,480
(he couldn't laugh
when everyone was laughing.)

418
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,580
(Restless)

419
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,879
(Anxious)

420
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:12,279
(His clueless stomach was bubbling.)

421
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,049
(In the end, he gives in.)

422
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,820
- After watching the clip?
- The whole day is about poop.

423
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,629
- He's so cool.
- That's original.

424
00:15:22,629 --> 00:15:23,830
- My stomach hurts.
- Hurry.

425
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,600
- I mean... So...
- Did that stimulate his stomach?

426
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,399
- He picked up and discharged poop.
- He's so cool.

427
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:30,269
- Right. He showed us poop in many ways.
- Yes

428
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,539
- That was fast.
- I made it quick.

429
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,980
I was holding it in for a long time.

430
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,379
I'm sorry.

431
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,850
- Let's make a fire.
- Yes.

432
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:48,019
Kian84, let's stack up the rocks.

433
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Is the poop ready?

434
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,820
Right here.

435
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,419
- The poop we can use as fire fuel.
- It's all poop.

436
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,929
(Lighting a pile of paper
and toilet paper)

437
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:57,860
(Burning)

438
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,259
Fire.

439
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:01,399
All right. And now,

440
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,870
let's toss in some poop.

441
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,570
- Gosh.
- With the poop...

442
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,240
I'm curious.
I want to see them making the fire now.

443
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,470
But didn't you borrow some gas?

444
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,710
No. Here's a thing.

445
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:14,309
- We had the butane gas to cook ramyeon.
- Yes.

446
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:16,279
- But we needed a fire to warm up...
- To warm up your bodies.

447
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:18,350
- our bodies.
- We needed a campfire.

448
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,750
- It must have been big then.
- You needed to gaze at the fire too.

449
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,820
- Right.
- You need a big fire then.

450
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,190
- That's a must.
- Right.

451
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,120
I'm not sure if it will burn
since it's wet.

452
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,519
(The youngest is trying to revive
the flame by breathing into it.)

453
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,460
(Coughing)

454
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,200
I can smell the gas from the poop.

455
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,460
It was really smoky.

456
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,399
Why do I feel like
this became a survival show?

457
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,529
We're on a camping trip.

458
00:16:37,799 --> 00:16:39,169
Turning on the beam projector...

459
00:16:39,169 --> 00:16:40,769
and watching moves on that...

460
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:42,409
can't be called camping.

461
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:46,610
To be honest,
the camping trip I had in mind...

462
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:48,610
was doing things smoothly
with the right equipment.

463
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,879
That's what I had in mind.

464
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,350
- Right. Like this.
- Gosh.

465
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,580
- Goodness.
- This is what I'm talking about.

466
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,519
But it felt like we were here
to survive in the wild.

467
00:16:56,889 --> 00:16:58,320
I had to flatten the land.

468
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,759
- He looks like that guy. Bear Something.
- Right.

469
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,159
- Bear Grylls.
- Yes.

470
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:04,289
The genre of the show slowly turned
into a survival show.

471
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,730
(Rummaging through the box)

472
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:09,470
We have forks here.

473
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,299
- We had forks?
- Yes.

474
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:13,200
But he went through all that trouble
to make chopsticks. There were forks?

475
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,970
I didn't borrow any chopsticks.

476
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:16,970
But the owner must have put them in
which was considerate of him.

477
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:17,980
(The kind owner packed the forks.)

478
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,109
- Oh, no.
- He did his best to make them.

479
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:20,240
This is a good memory.

480
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,480
(What? Hold on.)

481
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,279
(Getting up)

482
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,390
Hey, let's use them as firewood.

483
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,390
- We don't have any firewood.
- Come on.

484
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,190
I did my best to make them.

485
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:35,329
- Okay.
- You can be pretty cruel.

486
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,430
- No. This...
- Pani Bottle...

487
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,930
- Didn't you even scream earlier?
- Really?

488
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,029
- He even screamed while making them.
- Do you want to eat with these?

489
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:45,400
No. They already touched the black thing.
Just put them in.

490
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:46,970
- Right.
- He was already hurt.

491
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,210
- There's disappointment on his face.
- Gosh.

492
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,470
- He did his best.
- Wait.

493
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,279
Like the elephant bag,
shouldn't you buy him some chopsticks?

494
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,240
- Gosh. I should go to a department store.
- Go shopping.

495
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:56,450
- You should go shopping.
- Gosh.

496
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,150
The forks...

497
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,619
(Feeling sorry)

498
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,390
I'll cook yours first.

499
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,589
(Cooking ramyeon at high altitude)

500
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,190
(Adding all of the powder)

501
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:11,559
How come the poop won't burn?

502
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:13,630
When I went to Mongolia...

503
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,799
This one is burning slightly.

504
00:18:14,829 --> 00:18:16,500
What? Is it burning?

505
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,769
- What?
- Gosh.

506
00:18:17,769 --> 00:18:19,440
(Is it finally burning?)

507
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,009
Gosh. It goes out so easily. Darn it.

508
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:24,480
They need to keep the fire going.

509
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,579
You need to keep fanning it.

510
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,609
(Trying to revive the fire that went out)

511
00:18:30,009 --> 00:18:31,420
Did you have a hard time burning the poop?

512
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,480
It was the poop.

513
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,119
The poop wasn't dried completely.

514
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,849
- Right.
- The poop was on the wetland.

515
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,619
- He brought it from there.
- Right.

516
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:40,519
What do you think is our percentage?

517
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,430
I think it's 15 percent.

518
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,430
That's pretty high.

519
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,430
Once it started to burn,
it would have kept burning.

520
00:18:48,430 --> 00:18:49,500
But that was the hard part.

521
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:53,400
(Constantly adding the fire fuel)

522
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,710
(But it won't burn.)

523
00:18:56,170 --> 00:18:57,910
You're obsessing over the fire.

524
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,039
No, he said it would work.
So we can start the fire.

525
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,150
(He dreamed of camping around the bonfire
starting in South America.)

526
00:19:05,819 --> 00:19:08,220
(But he never got his wish
because Si Eon kept protesting.)

527
00:19:08,519 --> 00:19:10,119
That's not easy.

528
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,420
(Looking glum)

529
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,220
(But he will get his wish this time!)

530
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,329
I'm dizzy.

531
00:19:17,329 --> 00:19:18,930
(The younger ones are watching him
trying to make a fire.)

532
00:19:19,259 --> 00:19:22,400
Here's a thing about Kian84.
He needs to try things out...

533
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,170
and challenge himself to make it work
until he realizes it can't be done.

534
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:28,809
I knew that it wouldn't work.

535
00:19:28,809 --> 00:19:31,069
But I didn't want us to have any regrets
after coming all the way here.

536
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:34,079
So I wanted to respect
what he wanted to do.

537
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:36,079
Unlike the fire,
the ramyeon is coming along nicely.

538
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,579
- Great.
- That's a relief.

539
00:19:37,579 --> 00:19:39,980
- I can't look bad compared to that.
- Ramyeon looks great.

540
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,589
I'm just smelling it.
And it's already giving me energy.

541
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,220
(That look alone is enough
to whet their appetite.)

542
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,420
- Gosh. This is...
- It looks amazing.

543
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,819
- Here you go.
- I should eat that for lunch.

544
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:48,960
- Is it ready?
- Yes.

545
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,589
- Gosh, thank you.
- You can eat this.

546
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
(Slurping)

547
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:57,829
- Goodness. That's nice.
- Gosh.

548
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:58,900
Is it good?

549
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,400
It's so good.

550
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:03,069
It doesn't taste the same at home.

551
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:06,240
- You must eat it after working hard.
- Right.

552
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,809
Right. You can't enjoy food
without doing any work.

553
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,279
Do you get that?

554
00:20:10,279 --> 00:20:11,880
(Do you get that?)

555
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,279
(Putting down the ramyeon
he enjoyed eating after a long struggle)

556
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,089
(Staring)

557
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:17,990
- What's on my nose?
- There's a dewdrop on your nose.

558
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,089
- Isn't it snot?
- He must be cold.

559
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:20,190
It was freezing there.

560
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,230
(Rummaging through)

561
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,529
Let me eat the perilla leaves.

562
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:25,000
- Gosh. You guys had perilla leaves?
- Go ahead.

563
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,430
- I had a few MREs...
- This.

564
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,400
and side dishes left.

565
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:30,230
- I'll have a salty meal.
- Gosh.

566
00:20:30,569 --> 00:20:31,670
That's great.

567
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,500
(Salivating)

568
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,640
That's really good. Gosh.

569
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,009
(Separating the perilla leaves
with his mouth)

570
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,940
(Adding the perilla leaf in the ramyeon)

571
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,880
- That looks so good.
- That's great.

572
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,809
You don't need steak
from a high-end restaurant then.

573
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:45,680
- That's all you need. Seriously.
- Gosh.

574
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:48,990
- Gosh.
- Goodness. Look.

575
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:51,250
That looks good.
Ramyeon and the perilla leaves.

576
00:20:52,859 --> 00:20:55,390
(Eating the ramyeon with gusto
after starving for 11 hours)

577
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,160
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

578
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,299
Goodness.

579
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
(Hitting the spot)

580
00:21:01,529 --> 00:21:04,000
- Gosh. He knows how to eat.
- Look at him. Goodness.

581
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,299
It tasted so good.

582
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,369
(He's focused on his food.)

583
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,740
(Smoke rising)

584
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,309
Kian84, you gave up on the fire, right?

585
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,619
Wait. Let me try it one more time.

586
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:20,650
It was getting really smoky.
I was about to splash water.

587
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,650
- Really?
- Yes.

588
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,319
Do whatever you want.

589
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,690
- Let me try one more time.
- Okay.

590
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:26,420
Hey, it took 30 minutes
to pick up the poop.

591
00:21:27,259 --> 00:21:29,130
(Munching)

592
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:31,400
Let's not leave any regrets.
After all, we came all the way here.

593
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,960
Is it ready?

594
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,059
(Snot)

595
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,799
Dex, I'll heat up the water for yours.

596
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,230
No, I'll do it.

597
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,000
Gosh, it's so good.

598
00:21:40,539 --> 00:21:42,440
I'll make mine the Himalayan Edition.

599
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:45,180
- You used the water from the river?
- Yes. That's right.

600
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,480
I had to enjoy nature around here
since I went all the way there.

601
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,880
(The oldest is enjoying his food.)

602
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,819
(He's mixing the noodles.)

603
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,420
Pani Bottle is known
for not having any altitude sickness.

604
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,690
- Right.
- He's struggling there.

605
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,119
- He has a big appetite.
- Yes.

606
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:02,630
(The oldest is done eating.)

607
00:22:02,930 --> 00:22:04,059
I should start the fire.

608
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,500
(I should start the fire
now that I finished eating.)

609
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,759
(Panting)

610
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,369
- I can't eat.
- Why not?

611
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:10,500
I have no appetite.

612
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,470
- You're not doing well.
- Right.

613
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,569
Go inside and rest up.

614
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:18,180
Pani Bottle,
you should go inside for a bit.

615
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,480
Okay.

616
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:22,049
Who wants the middle spot?

617
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,380
- Okay.
- I want the side spot.

618
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:25,680
I should brush my teeth.

619
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,390
Gosh. Whatever. I don't care right now.

620
00:22:28,519 --> 00:22:31,049
You guys said things got tougher
as the trip went.

621
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,589
- You guys had an easy time in New Delhi.
- I can't breathe.

622
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:34,890
(In the meantime,
the Himalayan Edition ramyeon is ready.)

623
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,259
Gosh, that looks good.

624
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,029
I should eat over there too.

625
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:40,930
It's warm.

626
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:42,700
No.

627
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,000
(Flinching)

628
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:45,769
Be careful.

629
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,140
The fire can't go out.

630
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,240
I see. You weren't worried
about me getting injured.

631
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,680
Were you worried about the fire going out?

632
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,480
No. I was worried
about your safety the most.

633
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,880
- Right? I thought I misheard you.
- Yes.

634
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,650
Let me explain it, though.

635
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,319
- I was worried it'd be cold at night.
- In case it got cold.

636
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,390
Right.

637
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,589
You almost broke my heart.

638
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,490
Thank you for the food.

639
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,690
- He's finally eating.
- It's...

640
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,130
- Gosh.
- At last.

641
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:11,390
- Gosh.
- Great.

642
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,230
- It was so good.
- It looks good.

643
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,359
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

644
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,029
(He slurps up the ramyeon
Pani Bottle didn't finish.)

645
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,539
Snot keeps coming out.

646
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:22,210
(But I'm still happy.)

647
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,140
It looked different
when the sun went down.

648
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,410
- It looks picturesque.
- Right.

649
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,779
- That's a romantic sight.
- It really was.

650
00:23:29,079 --> 00:23:30,849
The poop turned into charcoal now.

651
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,319
Really?

652
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:35,150
Look at this one here.
It looks like charcoal now.

653
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:37,089
- It's producing a lot of smoke.
- That's...

654
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,559
It was smoking a lot.

655
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,759
(But why is the smoke
going toward the tent?)

656
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,690
(Coughing)

657
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,390
The tent is filled with smoke right now.

658
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:44,829
Is it going inside?

659
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:46,259
Yes. It's no joke.

660
00:23:46,529 --> 00:23:47,960
Gosh. I just got the fire going.

661
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,799
I wasn't helpful at all.

662
00:23:51,329 --> 00:23:53,200
(The fire fuel starts burning
after 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

663
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,970
(He made the fire to fulfill his dream.)

664
00:23:56,609 --> 00:23:57,809
It's too smoky.

665
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:01,480
(After hearing Pani Bottle's comment
on how smoky it is, he grabs a shovel.)

666
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:04,819
(He bitterly puts out the fire.)

667
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,220
I'm tired.

668
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,250
(Sighing)

669
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:11,019
(Opening up the tent)

670
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,319
Hey, it's way too smoky in here.

671
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:15,759
Yes. I told you.

672
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,329
- We should turn it off.
- Gosh.

673
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,259
Is it warm inside?

674
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,900
It's okay. This is doable.

675
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,529
- I think I can fall asleep here.
- You think you can fall asleep.

676
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,569
Okay. Let's go inside.

677
00:24:23,569 --> 00:24:25,099
Why is the sleeping bag wet?

678
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,869
(Quickly getting ready to sleep)

679
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,509
- Gosh. That's 7 p.m.
- It's only 7 p.m.

680
00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:32,279
- But it's pitch-dark.
- It's really dark.

681
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,740
I can skip brushing my teeth for a night,
can't I?

682
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:36,150
Gosh.

683
00:24:36,609 --> 00:24:38,650
By the way,
it's so nice in the sleeping bag.

684
00:24:39,349 --> 00:24:40,420
Gosh. This is nice.

685
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,250
What time are we waking up tomorrow?

686
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,690
- It's 7:30 p.m. now.
- It's 7:30 p.m. now?

687
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,660
- Yes. Let's sleep in tomorrow.
- Let's sleep in tomorrow.

688
00:24:47,990 --> 00:24:50,230
- It's been a while since I did this.
- Really?

689
00:24:50,529 --> 00:24:53,259
I don't care about washing up
or brushing my teeth.

690
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:56,130
I came into the sleeping bag to sleep.
I haven't done this in a while.

691
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,900
Are you finally going back
to your initial phase?

692
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,339
I don't want to go back.
I'll let people criticize me.

693
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,210
You must go back.

694
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:04,670
How are you, Dex? Are you okay?

695
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,880
I had so much fun today.

696
00:25:06,009 --> 00:25:07,609
Dex...

697
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,309
seems happy
now that things are getting tough.

698
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:10,910
This is the kind of tough trip I like.

699
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:13,420
- I see. This.
- Not the tough trip in Varanasi.

700
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,420
I'm just physically exhausted here.

701
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:17,390
I really liked being away from the crowd.

702
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,289
I also liked that
it felt like I was isolated in nature.

703
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,829
I actually like the tough trip
in Varanasi.

704
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:23,890
Same here. I'll go to Varanasi.

705
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,660
On top of that,
I drank a lot from Mother Ganga.

706
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:29,970
Watching the bodies get cremated...

707
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,369
and going to the wedding.

708
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,109
- The wedding.
- The wedding.

709
00:25:36,569 --> 00:25:38,980
- And the train.
- Gosh, he did a lot of things.

710
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,809
(Varanasi was the perfect destination
for Kian84.)

711
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:43,109
I liked washing the dishes at the temple.

712
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,420
Talking about this reminds me
of all the episodes from the beginning.

713
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,190
That was memorable.

714
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,289
What about you, Dex?

715
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,190
My favorite part of the trip was...

716
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,130
arriving in Leh.

717
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,329
Every moment since then
has been my favorite.

718
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,960
- Same here. Leh was amazing.
- Right.

719
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,400
After arriving in Leh,
I can't choose just one part.

720
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,369
I think Leh was the best destination
in my entire life.

721
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:07,269
But I don't think
Leh will be memorable for me.

722
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:08,940
- Really?
- Yes.

723
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,109
Actually, this will be memorable for me.

724
00:26:11,109 --> 00:26:12,740
- I see. This moment?
- Gosh.

725
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,809
Because this is so exhausting.

726
00:26:14,809 --> 00:26:15,809
- What?
- The first day...

727
00:26:15,809 --> 00:26:18,250
The first day in Leh was pretty relaxing.

728
00:26:19,049 --> 00:26:20,519
You don't remember much of it
unless you struggle.

729
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:22,619
But it's cozy to be next to each other.

730
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,619
- It's warm.
- Yes. I can feel the warmth.

731
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,019
Lying down next to other people
in a small tent...

732
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:30,359
I don't like doing that personally.

733
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,230
But I must have grown attached to them
during the trip.

734
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,500
It was cramped inside the tent,
and I was lying next to them.

735
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,700
But it wasn't uncomfortable.

736
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,299
I actually thought it was warm and nice.

737
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:40,640
Pani Bottle's body is exuding warmth.
He must be hot.

738
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,109
(Groaning)

739
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,279
The altitude here is 4,000m to 5,000m.

740
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:46,940
I started to suffer
from altitude sickness.

741
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,710
I got the cold too.
With the altitude sickness together,

742
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:49,849
it made things worse.

743
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:50,849
(He was in bad condition.)

744
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,019
But I know this for sure.
After many years pass by,

745
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,890
I will remember this trip a lot more.

746
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:00,420
- Once I go back to Korea after this,
- Yes.

747
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,029
I will appreciate a lot of things.

748
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,359
- Right.
- Totally.

749
00:27:03,359 --> 00:27:04,490
- Korea is the best.
- Yes.

750
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:06,029
- You realize how great Korea is.
- Yes.

751
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,430
- Goodnight.
- Okay.

752
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,569
Goodnight.

753
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,730
- Good job today.
- Good job today.

754
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,940
Good job.

755
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,240
When you suffer in youth,
you will get ill.

756
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,769
(Is that the lesson of the day?)

757
00:27:17,539 --> 00:27:20,839
(It's 7 a.m.,
and the current temperature is 1°C.)

758
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,710
(They wake up in the morning...)

759
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,809
(in the arms of the animals
at 4,400m high.)

760
00:27:25,579 --> 00:27:27,779
(The older guys are still in dreamland.)

761
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,289
(But where's the youngest?)

762
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:32,990
(Fluttering)

763
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,130
Why did you wake up so early?

764
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,589
- I just wanted to enjoy this view.
- Hey.

765
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,769
(The youngest wanted to enjoy the view
in the morning by himself.)

766
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,269
(In front of him is only Mother Nature.)

767
00:27:45,269 --> 00:27:48,869
(And a bird is greeting him.)

768
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:50,609
(Ice)

769
00:27:50,609 --> 00:27:52,240
It's so cold here.

770
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,410
(He's cold,
but he's satisfied with the view.)

771
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:00,720
Hey, the water is frozen.

772
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,150
- The water?
- The water is frozen.

773
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:05,319
- Gosh. It's frozen.
- It's that cold.

774
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:06,720
(The frozen water shows
how cold it was last night.)

775
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,259
Microwave it to melt the water.

776
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,099
(He blurts out his 1st nonsensical comment
as soon as he wakes up.)

777
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:16,470
It's so warm inside.
It's like a dry sauna.

778
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:18,200
- Right.
- It's a dry sauna in there?

779
00:28:18,329 --> 00:28:19,470
It's hot in the tent.

780
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,170
The sun was right above our tent.
It got really hot.

781
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,240
It's so hot in here.

782
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,009
There's no middle ground
with the weather over there.

783
00:28:25,009 --> 00:28:26,609
(It's hot inside
with a big temperature difference.)

784
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:28,880
You don't want to eat breakfast, right?

785
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,750
I'm not hungry.

786
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,579
Then let's get up...

787
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,420
and keep it simple.
We can have a cup of coffee.

788
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,420
- Okay.
- Let's do that.

789
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,920
Why don't we roll up the sleeping bag?

790
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,930
Are you feeling better today?

791
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,460
- No.
- No?

792
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,930
Gosh, let's go down now.

793
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,869
Let's get out of this place. Siberia.

794
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,069
"Siberia."

795
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,470
I mean, not Siberia. We're in Alaska.

796
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:55,410
No. Where are we?

797
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,609
The Himalayas.

798
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,579
(It's fine as long as they understand me.)

799
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,009
The weather is really nice.

800
00:29:02,549 --> 00:29:04,680
It's not windy because it's the morning.

801
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,779
(He gets ready to go out
at the news of good weather.)

802
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,920
When you look at us,
our movements are slow.

803
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,089
That's all
because of the altitude sickness.

804
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:14,819
(Putting on the shoes is difficult
due to the altitude sickness.)

805
00:29:15,190 --> 00:29:18,930
It started to take a toll on me
by that time.

806
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,000
- Was it tough?
- Yes, it was.

807
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,130
(He barely manages to stand up
after putting on his shoes.)

808
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,200
(Bloated)

809
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
(Panting)

810
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:31,309
(Coughing)

811
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:33,779
(Plopping down)

812
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,880
We can't cook here.

813
00:29:36,609 --> 00:29:38,309
- We can't cook.
- Let's just make coffee.

814
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,650
- Coffee.
- Let's have a cup of coffee.

815
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:43,420
Oh, no. You guys bought
a lot of ingredients.

816
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,990
- They bought a lot at the supermarket.
- Yes.

817
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:47,119
- We shared everything and finished it.
- We shared everything. Right.

818
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:50,430
The oxygen saturation level
kept going down.

819
00:29:50,859 --> 00:29:52,799
To be honest,
I couldn't do anything by then.

820
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,200
- Coffee.
- Let's have a cup of coffee.

821
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,369
(Urgently in need of caffeine)

822
00:29:55,829 --> 00:29:58,230
- I want coffee.
- Do you know what young kids say...

823
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,269
about having cold coffee
on a day like today?

824
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:02,970
Fight cold with cold?

825
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,009
- Fight cold with cold?
- IAFD.

826
00:30:05,009 --> 00:30:06,180
Why is that IAFD?

827
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,839
Iced Americano, even if I freeze to death.

828
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,049
- That's what it means?
- Yes, that's what it means.

829
00:30:10,049 --> 00:30:11,609
It's really cold here.

830
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,750
I've heard people use that expression.

831
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,619
I thought it had to do with some liquor.

832
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,119
IAFD.

833
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,519
- What's he doing now?
- Fight the fire with fire?

834
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,529
What's he doing?

835
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:26,559
- What's he doing? What's wrong?
- What is this?

836
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,599
Are you washing up?

837
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:29,170
- Are you throwing up or washing up?
- What?

838
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:31,700
(He's throwing cold water on his face.)

839
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,740
(Groaning)

840
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,339
(After crying out like an elephant...)

841
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:36,339
(Sinking)

842
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,009
(Dipping his head into the river)

843
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,210
- The water was ice-cold.
- Gosh.

844
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,279
- He's a real man.
- He's a man.

845
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,019
(Washing his hair without soap)

846
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,059
(That's how a real man washes his face.)

847
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,759
(Groaning)

848
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:59,000
(My hands are so cold.)

849
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,700
(He keeps screaming out.)

850
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,769
(Where is this scream coming from?)

851
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:11,339
- He's gotten weird too.
- Yes.

852
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,210
- Let's dump him here.
- "Dump him here."

853
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:16,809
Kian84, you should wash your face.

854
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:18,009
Wash my face?

855
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,319
- It's the best.
- No.

856
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,819
(He doesn't wash up unless he has to.)

857
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:23,220
(He washes up,
even if it's freezing cold.)

858
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:24,849
The kettle...

859
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,359
Gosh, that's nice.

860
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:27,519
(Observing)

861
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,559
Use that.

862
00:31:28,789 --> 00:31:29,859
This...

863
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:32,099
This is a kettle from the underworld.

864
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,200
- What is it?
- It's rusted.

865
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,670
- Let me see.
- Can we use this to boil water?

866
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,730
In this kettle?

867
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,500
It's not dirty.

868
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,339
- What? This isn't dirty?
- No.

869
00:31:40,769 --> 00:31:42,910
Look right here. It's rusted.

870
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,069
Gosh. I'll go and wash it.

871
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:47,980
Since you're going there to wash it,

872
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:49,950
can you get some water too?

873
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,309
Okay. In the kettle?

874
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:53,849
Yes. Enough for our coffee.

875
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:56,319
(The oldest is checking out his pants.)

876
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,089
(Brushing off)

877
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:00,089
(Licking)

878
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,190
(Is he eating the surface of his pants?)

879
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,859
(Licking)

880
00:32:04,859 --> 00:32:06,900
I see. This is salt.

881
00:32:07,359 --> 00:32:08,430
- What?
- I can brush my teeth.

882
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:10,630
- This is salt.
- Where?

883
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,670
The white thing here. It's salt.

884
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:17,309
(The white material around them is salt?)

885
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,609
(He starts studying the material
on the ground.)

886
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,549
This is all salt.

887
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:24,910
(Licking)

888
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:27,549
(When he was in the salt hotel
while traveling Bolivia,)

889
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,819
(he happily brushed his teeth with salt.)

890
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,619
(Walking down memory lane)

891
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,759
(Tasting)

892
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:37,460
(Spitting it out)

893
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,730
What? Isn't this salt?

894
00:32:39,329 --> 00:32:40,460
What's this?

895
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:43,329
(Coughing it out)

896
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,829
(Retching)

897
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,470
(Emptying out his stomach)

898
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,309
What's wrong with him?

899
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:53,309
(What's wrong with these guys?)

900
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,109
It didn't surprise me anymore.

901
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:58,819
I think my finger was salty.

902
00:32:58,819 --> 00:32:59,819
Right.

903
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,750
(The youngest is wailing
at their strange behaviors.)

904
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,519
(Sniffling)

905
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:05,589
What on earth is that?

906
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,019
(It must taste like
what he collected the day before.)

907
00:33:08,289 --> 00:33:10,089
Gosh. I'm out of breath
after only walking a few steps.

908
00:33:10,859 --> 00:33:12,329
I saw some stuff in the water.

909
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,700
- But once we boil it, it'll be fine.
- Okay.

910
00:33:15,569 --> 00:33:17,430
But this is too much.

911
00:33:17,769 --> 00:33:18,769
What?

912
00:33:18,769 --> 00:33:20,599
- I'm fine.
- Really?

913
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,769
Right. It should be okay.

914
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,970
- I've partially given up too.
- Right.

915
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,539
- This is making me let go of things.
- Yes.

916
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:29,549
We don't have enough oxygen here.

917
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,410
It's hard to breathe now.

918
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,049
I feel like I'm getting dumb here.

919
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,019
Is that salt?

920
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:36,589
- It's not salt.
- What is it?

921
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,349
I don't know. It's like...

922
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:41,119
K-Ca-Na-Mg... What do you call that?

923
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,259
What?

924
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:45,930
- K-Ca-Na-Mg... Are you chanting a spell?
- It's...

925
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:47,660
- That...
- You don't know what it is?

926
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:48,829
What is it?

927
00:33:48,829 --> 00:33:49,900
I thought you majored in science.

928
00:33:50,269 --> 00:33:51,599
I did, but...

929
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,869
(I did, but...)

930
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,170
The 12 element symbols or something.

931
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:58,309
There are 12 element symbols?

932
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:00,480
Sodium, magnesium,

933
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,109
calcium, potassium, and so on.
You know those elements?

934
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:04,680
The basic element symbols.

935
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,119
That was drilled into him.

936
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:07,119
(Gazing afar)

937
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,380
Didn't you learn them?

938
00:34:08,849 --> 00:34:10,719
I must have dozed off
when my teacher taught us that.

939
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:13,860
Your teacher
must have talked about them...

940
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,789
for 3 or 4 hours.

941
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,260
You really didn't study at all.

942
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:21,230
I'm sorry. I'll learn them
by the time we meet again.

943
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,630
(The science major is disappointed.)

944
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,539
Hey, are we going to eat the watermelon?

945
00:34:26,539 --> 00:34:27,840
Let's eat.

946
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,309
Let me cut the watermelon for you.

947
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,039
- Yes. They bought it at the supermarket.
- Right.

948
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:34,409
- This came all the way from New Delhi.
- Yes, it did.

949
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,309
(It wasn't from New Delhi.
It was from Amritsar.)

950
00:34:36,309 --> 00:34:37,409
- This...
- It was from Amritsar?

951
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,519
- Did we buy this for the elephant?
- Yes.

952
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,550
This came a long way.

953
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,849
(Afterward, the watermelon stayed
with them until reaching 4,400m.)

954
00:34:43,889 --> 00:34:46,059
This is our fourth member.

955
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,190
- The watermelon traveled with us.
- Yes.

956
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,989
Hey, I feel kind of bad
now that we have to kill it off.

957
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:54,659
Watch your fingers.

958
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,429
(After coming a long way with them,)

959
00:34:57,429 --> 00:35:00,400
(the 4th member gets dissected.)

960
00:35:00,739 --> 00:35:02,510
It was with us in New Delhi
for 2 or 3 days.

961
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,210
(Opening)

962
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:06,780
- Great.
- Gosh, look at the color.

963
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:10,510
- Let's eat it like this.
- Be careful.

964
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,480
(Cutting that into three big pieces)

965
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,550
That looks good.

966
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,489
(Taking a bite from the chunk)

967
00:35:16,219 --> 00:35:17,789
Use the spoon to scoop it up.

968
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,159
- Hey.
- Is it good?

969
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:20,389
- You guys needed to replenish some sugar.
- That looks great.

970
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:22,090
Gosh, nice.

971
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:24,489
(Swallowing)

972
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:30,530
(The dirty ladle)

973
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,929
This is so good.

974
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,170
(Scooping it up with the ladle)

975
00:35:33,369 --> 00:35:35,369
That's the ladle we used
the night before for ramyeon.

976
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:38,070
The ladle was covered
in the ramyeon broth.

977
00:35:38,639 --> 00:35:39,880
So it's salty and sweet at the same time.

978
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,380
Kian84, I used that last night to eat.

979
00:35:43,579 --> 00:35:44,579
(Ramyeon and watermelon)

980
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,719
It's sweet and salty.

981
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,320
(The perfect combination
of sweet and salty)

982
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,889
(Humming in approval)

983
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,559
- Gosh.
- That was really good.

984
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:56,360
Altitude Sickness Bottle
didn't have dinner last night.

985
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,289
(The three brothers become one
with the Indian watermelon.)

986
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,559
Gosh, this is crazy.

987
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:03,429
Was it 100 rupees for 2?

988
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,730
It was 80 cents per watermelon.

989
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,000
(This is great.)

990
00:36:06,269 --> 00:36:08,699
I should have eaten more fruit here.

991
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:10,969
Gosh. What do we call this?
The meat juice?

992
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,710
- The meat juice is insane.
- Gosh, the meat juice.

993
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,110
"The meat juice is insane."

994
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,050
Isn't this fruit juice?

995
00:36:16,309 --> 00:36:18,679
- The fruit juice.
- The meat juice is from the meat.

996
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,380
- This is...
- We're getting dumb here.

997
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,550
I don't correct myself now.

998
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,190
It's fine as long as
we understand each other.

999
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,159
- Yes.
- Right.

1000
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,690
That's true.

1001
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,760
- Everyone is becoming generous.
- Yes.

1002
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,230
(The youngest is becoming
like the other two brothers.)

1003
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,099
It's cold, but it's so good.

1004
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:34,500
- It's the lucky mole.
- Yes.

1005
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,369
- That's cute.
- Actually, after getting sick,

1006
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,070
I've let go of myself a lot.

1007
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,539
The old me would have put down the mat...

1008
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:43,710
if the bed was damp at the hotel.

1009
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,840
I had to sleep on the mat
on a nice, dry surface.

1010
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,480
"Gosh, whatever."

1011
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,110
"Let's just enjoy this trip."

1012
00:36:49,349 --> 00:36:51,980
If there's no water,
I can drink from the river.

1013
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,980
I started to change the way I thought.

1014
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,150
I noticed that about myself too.

1015
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:57,150
(Dex easily adjusted to the local style.)

1016
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,719
(Using a spoon or a fork is a luxury now.)

1017
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:01,889
He's turning into Kian84 now.

1018
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,260
(Enjoying the trip as it is,
even if he doesn't have everything)

1019
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:05,860
(The water from the river
is at the perfect boiling point.)

1020
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:08,059
Here comes the coffee.

1021
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,570
(He opens up the instant coffee mix
from Korea.)

1022
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,500
Gosh, the instant coffee.

1023
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,539
(Looking forward to trying
the instant coffee at high altitude)

1024
00:37:12,539 --> 00:37:14,369
- That's the best.
- It's the best.

1025
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,570
My gosh.
Is it because we're at a high altitude?

1026
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:17,610
The bags are bloated.

1027
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,010
- You're right.
- Right?

1028
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,639
- They are bloated now.
- They are.

1029
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:22,780
- You're right.
- Right. We learned that last week.

1030
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,110
The same thing happened
with the chips too.

1031
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,550
I want two shots.

1032
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,880
- Two shots.
- Two shots.

1033
00:37:28,349 --> 00:37:30,789
I got it, sir. Two shots for you.

1034
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:34,090
(The eldest's coffee is getting
mixed first with the extra shot.)

1035
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,559
(Pouring)

1036
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,500
(Gazing)

1037
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,400
Gosh, Dex. You look cool.

1038
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,670
Don't I look like a barista?

1039
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,639
No. Watching you make coffee
at the campsite...

1040
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:47,369
This is a pretty sight.

1041
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,409
I made a rich extract with two bags.

1042
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:53,340
- How can we complete IAFD?
- Yes.

1043
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,150
- Ice?
- That's right. It's ice.

1044
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,309
(The water bottle froze overnight.)

1045
00:37:58,480 --> 00:37:59,550
(Pounding)

1046
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,719
Nice.

1047
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,150
(Cutting the ice like a man)

1048
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,050
The water wasn't frozen in a fridge.

1049
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,289
Gosh, this is from nature.

1050
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:08,159
- It was frozen at high altitude.
- Right.

1051
00:38:08,159 --> 00:38:09,789
- Here comes the ice.
- Okay.

1052
00:38:09,789 --> 00:38:11,429
(Here comes the ice.)

1053
00:38:11,429 --> 00:38:13,159
- Goodness. Nice.
- Gosh.

1054
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:16,269
I'll pour the nicely extracted coffee
over this.

1055
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,699
(Pouring)

1056
00:38:20,699 --> 00:38:22,269
You did it right.

1057
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:24,340
I think we went there to have that.

1058
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:28,880
Sir, here's the iced Americano
you ordered. It's ready.

1059
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,250
Gosh, thank you.

1060
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,309
You too, Pani Bottle.

1061
00:38:32,309 --> 00:38:33,320
(Tasting his first iced coffee in India)

1062
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,150
- I'll make yours quickly.
- Thank you.

1063
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:36,949
- I bet it tasted amazing.
- Gosh.

1064
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:40,619
(Slurping)

1065
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,130
(Humming in approval)

1066
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,699
(He can't stop crossing his legs.)

1067
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,329
(The caffeine flows down his entire body.)

1068
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,539
This coffee tastes so fancy.

1069
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,940
Gosh, this is so good.

1070
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:03,010
(The youngest feels proud
from seeing their reactions.)

1071
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:04,849
(Drinking it up in one go)

1072
00:39:12,789 --> 00:39:15,460
- It's richer since we added two bags.
- Yes.

1073
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:17,929
Of course.
It's richer because we added two bags.

1074
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,500
- Add some water, then.
- That's true.

1075
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,000
- I like strong coffee.
- You...

1076
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,070
- Really?
- Yes.

1077
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,769
What you said was pretty obvious.

1078
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,500
He was strict only with me.

1079
00:39:27,269 --> 00:39:29,269
(That guy must be a thinker,
not a feeler.)

1080
00:39:30,239 --> 00:39:31,309
This is nice.

1081
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:33,380
(But this is still nice!)

1082
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,750
Hey, this is my favorite moment
of this camping trip.

1083
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:39,349
- Is this your favorite moment?
- Yes, this relaxing coffee time.

1084
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:41,750
Right. People ought to relax.

1085
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,690
Gosh, this is camping.

1086
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:44,750
(Enjoying their time at the campsite
around Mother Nature)

1087
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,619
I really have no regrets,
even if I freeze to death here.

1088
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:47,920
(Touched)

1089
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,789
This is why people drink
iced Americano even in cold weather.

1090
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,860
So do we just clean up and leave...

1091
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,400
after this coffee?

1092
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,099
First of all, I'll bid you farewell here.

1093
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,840
It's suddenly making me sad.

1094
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,070
The word "farewell" made me sad.

1095
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:04,010
There's nothing we can do.

1096
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,610
Pani Bottle and I need to be in Korea
in two days for work.

1097
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:08,980
So we have to get going first.

1098
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:11,210
It was true that we had work in Korea.

1099
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,679
But one of the goals for this trip...

1100
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,349
was Kian84...

1101
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:17,019
- to start and finish the trip alone.
- Right.

1102
00:40:17,019 --> 00:40:18,789
Since that was the goal...

1103
00:40:18,789 --> 00:40:20,389
Guys,

1104
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:22,530
before we put away the tent, let's draw.

1105
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,590
- Okay.
- Draw?

1106
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,489
- Gosh.
- What should we draw?

1107
00:40:25,929 --> 00:40:28,630
People who watched the first season...

1108
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:29,929
might probably remember this.

1109
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,769
There's an important signature
of our show.

1110
00:40:31,769 --> 00:40:33,269
Especially with the ending scene.

1111
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:35,000
We hung this in the Uyuni Salt Flats.

1112
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,639
- Right. I remember that.
- The flag.

1113
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:41,309
This time, I want it to be diverse.

1114
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:44,309
I want the three of us to draw.

1115
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,849
We'll draw it first.

1116
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:48,320
And I'll look for a place to hang them.
I'm sure I'll find one.

1117
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:49,849
Drawing pictures is different...

1118
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:51,019
- from taking pictures.
- It's different.

1119
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,289
- Right. It's different.
- Yes.

1120
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:54,389
When we were in New Delhi,
we bought paint.

1121
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:56,090
We bought some supplies.

1122
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:57,789
(They bought drawing tools
while traveling together.)

1123
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:01,400
It's an honor to draw with Kian84.

1124
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,530
Gosh. Don't say that.

1125
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,369
It's an honor that
we're doing this together.

1126
00:41:06,139 --> 00:41:08,570
When I was in elementary school,
I dreamed of becoming a painter.

1127
00:41:08,739 --> 00:41:09,840
Gosh. Really?

1128
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,940
Drawing...

1129
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,309
He liked everything but studying.

1130
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:14,110
(He was destined to be
in the entertainment and arts industry.)

1131
00:41:14,309 --> 00:41:16,480
I need to come up with a nice composition.

1132
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,519
(Roughly drawing the lines)

1133
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,750
(Gently dabbing)

1134
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:26,260
(Painting little by little)

1135
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,119
(Inch by inch,)

1136
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:30,789
(he's bringing his artistic soul to life.)

1137
00:41:31,389 --> 00:41:32,929
How can I make gray?

1138
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,400
You can mix white and black.

1139
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,900
- We have white.
- Yes.

1140
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:38,599
Squeeze them out, guys.

1141
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:40,900
(Picking up his sunglasses)

1142
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,610
- Squeeze them out. No.
- Everything? Not just the ones we need?

1143
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,769
The colors...

1144
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,039
He wore sunglasses
when we were about to paint.

1145
00:41:45,039 --> 00:41:46,079
(Covering up his eyes before painting)

1146
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:49,409
(As he can't see well,
he gets a lot of paint.)

1147
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,650
(A confident brushstroke)

1148
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,650
- Pani Bottle wasn't hesitant at all.
- Gosh.

1149
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,949
(Meanwhile, this pop-art artist...)

1150
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,559
(is painting...)

1151
00:42:01,559 --> 00:42:05,690
(without any hesitation
as if he's in his element.)

1152
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,929
(When Dex drew 3 lines...)

1153
00:42:10,769 --> 00:42:13,699
(and Pani Bottle
was coloring the paper...)

1154
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,269
(Coloring)

1155
00:42:16,269 --> 00:42:18,840
(Adding contrast)

1156
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,480
- I see.
- Let's go. Yes.

1157
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,110
- He was like a different person.
- Sexy.

1158
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,349
(Focused)

1159
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:26,480
(He's the coolest when he's an artist.)

1160
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,750
Painting is so fun.

1161
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,389
(Showing interest)

1162
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,789
What's this?

1163
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:35,019
- What's this?
- What is it?

1164
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,289
I was trying to draw the sleeper cars
on the train.

1165
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,130
It looks like a mural
from the ancient times.

1166
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,500
- You're right.
- Gosh.

1167
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,630
There's a lion.

1168
00:42:44,969 --> 00:42:48,340
Painting this is making me feel
like we're really wrapping up the trip.

1169
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:50,670
It didn't feel real,
but it's starting to hit me now.

1170
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:51,739
Yes.

1171
00:42:52,409 --> 00:42:54,940
- When you paint, you look back...
- Time really flew by.

1172
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,179
on the trip and keep thinking about it.

1173
00:42:56,179 --> 00:42:57,250
Wasn't it fun, though?

1174
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:59,849
I'm kind of sad that our trip is
coming to an end like this.

1175
00:42:59,849 --> 00:43:01,480
- It was fun.
- Yes.

1176
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:03,320
Everything is bound to come to an end.

1177
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,849
- Right.
- Yes.

1178
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,090
Trips are bound to end.

1179
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,260
(Their trip down memory lane...)

1180
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,360
(is reaching its end now.)

1181
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,030
Let's talk about what we painted.

1182
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:18,530
I painted...

1183
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,099
- Leh?
- this place.

1184
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,469
- This place?
- Here?

1185
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:22,469
Yes.

1186
00:43:22,469 --> 00:43:23,610
- I see.
- Ladakh.

1187
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,739
(Even the son of India
was new to this city.)

1188
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,179
(Each view is stunning.)

1189
00:43:31,849 --> 00:43:34,179
(He's being 1,200 percent sincere.)

1190
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:37,920
(It makes them accept
their altitude sickness.)

1191
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,059
(Ladakh)

1192
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:42,860
- It turned out nice.
- He was good.

1193
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,730
This is the free thali...

1194
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,829
we ate in Amritsar.

1195
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:49,260
(Title - Free Thali at the Golden Temple,
Artist - Pani Bottle)

1196
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:50,670
It's so good.

1197
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:51,699
(That's where he started eating
in earnest!)

1198
00:43:51,699 --> 00:43:53,639
- He really enjoyed it.
- It looked good.

1199
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,840
He's so cute.

1200
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:58,440
(Chubby)

1201
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,909
(The free food they enjoyed
at the Golden Temple)

1202
00:44:01,909 --> 00:44:03,449
- The sweet one.
- Yes.

1203
00:44:03,449 --> 00:44:04,949
It was like porridge.

1204
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:06,849
It's a good thing that
you're not a webtoon artist.

1205
00:44:06,849 --> 00:44:08,449
(It's a good thing that
he's not a webtoon artist.)

1206
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:09,920
In my case...

1207
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,949
(Dex, who used to do art, shows his work.)

1208
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:13,119
When we traveled from Varanasi to Delhi,

1209
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,159
(Chuckling)

1210
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,289
we experienced
the real-life "Snowpiercer" train.

1211
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:18,329
(Title - Real-life "Snowpiercer" Train,
Artist - Dex)

1212
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:19,829
The first class had...

1213
00:44:19,829 --> 00:44:22,059
- The first class...
- the strongest air conditioning.

1214
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,170
Business class...

1215
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,099
- Business class.
- had weaker air conditioning.

1216
00:44:25,099 --> 00:44:26,469
- You can see the wind.
- You can see the wind.

1217
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:27,539
(Detailed)

1218
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:29,039
- Economy class.
- The economy class had fans.

1219
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:30,110
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1220
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,809
- That left an impression.
- Why is...

1221
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:36,250
- Why is this man doing push-ups?
- What?

1222
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,510
- No, the people on the top...
- Yes.

1223
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:40,050
were looking down like this.

1224
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:42,050
(They're not doing push-ups.
They were looking down from the top.)

1225
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,019
- It's so detailed.
- Yes.

1226
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:45,789
- Gosh.
- Like this.

1227
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:48,760
I tried to express
the real-life "Snowpiercer" train.

1228
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,929
That's interesting.

1229
00:44:49,929 --> 00:44:52,090
- Dex's style...
- Yes?

1230
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,929
- I like it.
- Really?

1231
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:57,170
It doesn't include any of your emotions,

1232
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:59,030
and it's very objective.

1233
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,800
It's very raw.

1234
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,010
- It would feel different on paper.
- Yes.

1235
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,510
- It's special.
- You can feel the rough environment.

1236
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,079
And...

1237
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:12,110
This drawing shows what I wanted to feel
the most on this trip.

1238
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:14,280
- Okay.
- The left side...

1239
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:16,820
- shows Mother Nature from afar.
- Okay.

1240
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:19,320
From afar,

1241
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:23,190
it feels like Mother Nature will embrace
everything for you,

1242
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,130
with mercy and patience.

1243
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:29,130
- But in reality, from up close,
- Yes.

1244
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:32,070
it's more like, "Try if you dare."

1245
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:35,699
It overpowers you.

1246
00:45:36,039 --> 00:45:40,139
It brings out
our will to take a challenge.

1247
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,639
In order to win against Mother Nature.

1248
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:44,250
- Yes, that's nice.
- That's what I felt.

1249
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,280
Good job.

1250
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:46,719
This is mine.

1251
00:45:47,579 --> 00:45:48,579
I can't wait.

1252
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,190
(Anticipating)

1253
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,619
(Coming soon)

1254
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,159
This is mine.

1255
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:56,230
This is India.

1256
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,989
(Title - indi A, Artist - Kian84)

1257
00:45:57,989 --> 00:46:01,360
I saw as many animals in India
as I did people.

1258
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:03,400
I was thinking of drawing a dog.

1259
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,170
But this isn't a dog.

1260
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:06,300
- What?
- What?

1261
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,869
This is sort of a dog, cow, goat...

1262
00:46:10,010 --> 00:46:12,469
A mix of all four-legged animals...

1263
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,610
- that we saw.
- It's a mix.

1264
00:46:13,679 --> 00:46:15,409
I couldn't tell at all
without your explanation.

1265
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:16,449
Sure.

1266
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,480
And the elephant we met.

1267
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,619
- It's the elephant?
- The elephant.

1268
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:25,289
- In front of the fruit market.
- The elephant in front of the market.

1269
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:28,960
The lovely elephant
with hearts on his forehead.

1270
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:30,530
It was for a short time,

1271
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,190
- but it left a strong impact.
- Yes.

1272
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,230
And...

1273
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,260
This is the monkey.

1274
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:37,269
It was screaming.

1275
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:38,800
The monkey that you loved and hated.

1276
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:39,869
(Hi)

1277
00:46:39,869 --> 00:46:41,739
And this is the Mother River.

1278
00:46:41,739 --> 00:46:43,639
- The Ganges.
- The Mother River.

1279
00:46:43,639 --> 00:46:46,210
(The Ganges is like a mother for Indians.)

1280
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:51,210
(The first son became one with India
in the mother's arms.)

1281
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:52,610
And this...

1282
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,349
This is so good. It's amazing.

1283
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,019
I was amazed as soon as I saw it.

1284
00:46:56,019 --> 00:46:57,949
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1285
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:58,949
Dex.

1286
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:00,590
You did a good job
showing the characteristics.

1287
00:47:00,590 --> 00:47:02,389
- The long hair in the back.
- The long hair.

1288
00:47:02,389 --> 00:47:03,760
Yes, his hair.

1289
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,360
He did such a good job
showing the characteristics.

1290
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:09,000
My mouth was always like this.

1291
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:11,929
And Pani Bottle is always smiling.

1292
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:12,969
So, there's Pani Bottle.

1293
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:15,599
That's how I drew it.

1294
00:47:15,739 --> 00:47:17,469
- He's such a good artist.
- It's so good.

1295
00:47:17,469 --> 00:47:18,769
It's nothing.

1296
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:20,809
Anyway, this is...

1297
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:25,409
I will hang this at my last destination.

1298
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:26,780
With yours as well.

1299
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,820
- Okay.
- Yes.

1300
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:29,889
- We will leave this up to you.
- Give it to me.

1301
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:31,920
Please take my drawing.

1302
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:35,460
I will have your drawings...

1303
00:47:36,289 --> 00:47:37,789
- even after you leave.
- He will have that.

1304
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,090
(Adventure by Accident 2)

1305
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,059
- They each have their own style.
- The style...

1306
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:43,199
- They are different.
- Yes.

1307
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:47,369
I'm curious how they will look on display.

1308
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:49,539
Let's pack this up, then.

1309
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:53,539
(A piece of the youngest one's dream...)

1310
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,380
(becomes a page of the long journey.)

1311
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,679
- I'm sad it's over.
- Oh no.

1312
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,650
These two will go to Leh,

1313
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,679
and I will head to the last destination.

1314
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:03,949
(The three brothers prepare
to go their own ways.)

1315
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:05,519
It's really goodbye.

1316
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:08,989
Kian84, you suddenly look gloomy.

1317
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:10,730
- What?
- Since we're leaving.

1318
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:11,960
I suddenly feel...

1319
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,199
- Yes?
- so solitary.

1320
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:16,769
- How?
- It's not just loneliness.

1321
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,829
Like you're alone in this world?

1322
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:19,969
Yes. Just like that.

1323
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:23,340
(They part at 4,400m above sea level.)

1324
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,239
I prepared a last gift for you...

1325
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,909
to comfort your solitary feeling.

1326
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:29,440
- What is it?
- Use it when it gets really hard.

1327
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:30,980
(Something to comfort him
when it gets really hard.)

1328
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,980
(A sip of alcohol!)

1329
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:36,079
- It's vodka.
- Drink up.

1330
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:37,889
- That's awesome.
- He's an angel.

1331
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:39,449
I thought he was a fairy.

1332
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,989
(The fairy gave him a piece of his heart,
not just alcohol.)

1333
00:48:42,989 --> 00:48:44,329
- Thank you.
- It's perfect.

1334
00:48:44,329 --> 00:48:46,159
I will think of you guys
when I drink this.

1335
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,000
I have something to give you too.

1336
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,730
This is the camera I used while traveling.

1337
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:52,829
It prints right away.

1338
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,969
- No matter who you get to meet,
- Yes.

1339
00:48:54,969 --> 00:48:56,969
I hope you make good memories.

1340
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:59,710
- They gave him goodbye gifts.
- See you in Korea.

1341
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,110
Well... Okay. See you in Korea.

1342
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:07,019
(He cannot easily leave.)

1343
00:49:07,019 --> 00:49:08,449
- Goodbyes are hard.
- Take care.

1344
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:11,090
- It's hard to say goodbye.
- All three of them can't leave easily.

1345
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,289
It really is too bad that it's over.

1346
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,960
- It is.
- Yes.

1347
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,389
(It really is too bad.)

1348
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,400
It felt weird.

1349
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,429
I'm actually quite introverted,

1350
00:49:24,429 --> 00:49:26,570
so I may look close to people,

1351
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:29,769
but it's hard for me to get
really intimate with others.

1352
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:32,440
I think we really did get very close.

1353
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,780
(I think I got very close with them.)

1354
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:40,349
I really did feel sad that it was over.

1355
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,849
It's touching to hear that.

1356
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:44,519
- You never heard him say that, right?
- Yes.

1357
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,360
He doesn't tell us that.

1358
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,889
(He couldn't say
his true feelings to them.)

1359
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,659
Okay. Well...

1360
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,829
(He tries to pull himself together.)

1361
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:54,199
I have your drawings,
so I will look at them.

1362
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,760
Make sure to return that safely.

1363
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,599
He says that because he's awkward.

1364
00:49:57,599 --> 00:49:59,400
We will return them.

1365
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:00,940
You look happy.

1366
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:03,110
No, I'm so sad.

1367
00:50:04,039 --> 00:50:06,039
- He's smiling from ear to ear.
- Look at him.

1368
00:50:06,039 --> 00:50:08,440
(He's smiling from ear to ear!)

1369
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,849
- Good job, Dex.
- See you.

1370
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,050
- Don't get hurt.
- Okay.

1371
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,380
- We'll get going.
- Go on.

1372
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,690
- Bye.
- Okay.

1373
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:19,090
Let's go.

1374
00:50:19,090 --> 00:50:20,360
(They have a hard time leaving.)

1375
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:21,920
I'm full of regrets.

1376
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,989
(They have a hard time leaving.)

1377
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:25,789
Bye.

1378
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:31,329
(He gives them a tap for no reason.)

1379
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:37,070
I don't feel good about leaving.

1380
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,510
- Bye, Kian84.
- Go on.

1381
00:50:41,579 --> 00:50:42,639
I had fun.

1382
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,780
- Bye.
- Good luck.

1383
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,809
Okay.

1384
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,289
I had a hard time in India,

1385
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:52,590
both mentally and physically.

1386
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,820
(Unfamiliar sounds)

1387
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:57,690
(Unfamiliar place)

1388
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,159
(He had a rough start
due to the unfamiliarity.)

1389
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:03,429
But as I spent time with Kian84,

1390
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:05,269
he was such a good person.

1391
00:51:05,269 --> 00:51:07,440
(He was such a good person.)

1392
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,409
(The unfamiliarity was the same for him,)

1393
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:17,050
(but his pureness allowed him
to take it in wholly.)

1394
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,449
(I bought ice cream. Try it!)

1395
00:51:19,449 --> 00:51:20,949
The ice cream was so good.

1396
00:51:20,949 --> 00:51:22,320
(Reminiscing)

1397
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:24,219
(Dex, come here!)

1398
00:51:24,219 --> 00:51:26,519
(Were you not able to sleep?)

1399
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,460
(The oldest one always took care of
the youngest one.)

1400
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:33,429
(I felt that he was a really mature
and good adult.)

1401
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:36,969
(I think I was truly able to
enjoy this trip from then on.)

1402
00:51:37,699 --> 00:51:39,500
(You don't like crowds.)

1403
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,400
(But I have you with me,)

1404
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,900
(so you're my tranquilizer.)

1405
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:45,940
(Thanks to the oldest brother,)

1406
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,639
(the trip was filled with happiness.)

1407
00:51:48,639 --> 00:51:51,079
With Pani Bottle,

1408
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:54,449
he goes forward
and tries to figure things out.

1409
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:56,719
He led us.

1410
00:51:56,719 --> 00:52:00,090
(He always took the lead.)

1411
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:03,460
He said, "Let's go somewhere
that serves food that you can eat."

1412
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:07,199
I was thankful that he would say that.

1413
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,130
(The reliable second brother)

1414
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,530
I have a love-hate relationship...

1415
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,469
with India.

1416
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,170
(I became famous
because of my trip to India,)

1417
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:17,570
(but I got so angry with the Indians.)

1418
00:52:18,139 --> 00:52:22,110
(He came to settle his sense of debt.)

1419
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:28,119
(There were times
when he was taken aback,)

1420
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,219
(but he was able to smile it off.)

1421
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:32,619
He was always smiling.

1422
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:36,559
(I liked that
the three of us were together.)

1423
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:40,300
(Because they were together,
it was merrier...)

1424
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,900
(and happier.)

1425
00:52:46,170 --> 00:52:47,840
(Whatever they do...)

1426
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,599
(and wherever they go...)

1427
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,909
The days pass by like a panorama.

1428
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:53,210
Yes, it feels weird.

1429
00:52:53,210 --> 00:52:54,409
(Each moment felt special
because they were together.)

1430
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:57,610
Each member was essential to the team.

1431
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:59,110
Yes, they are perfect.

1432
00:52:59,110 --> 00:53:00,980
- It's amazing.
- An amazing combination.

1433
00:53:02,349 --> 00:53:06,190
I think we all had a happy ending.

1434
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:10,329
(It was a happy journey for them all.)

1435
00:53:11,789 --> 00:53:13,699
Why are you acting like
we won't see each other forever?

1436
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:17,269
We got to see each other after a week.

1437
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:20,900
I only cry after fighting with my mom.

1438
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:22,500
(I only cry after fighting with my mom.)

1439
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,880
(A good son)

1440
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:29,380
- Bye.
- Good luck.

1441
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,420
Bye, for real.

1442
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:36,250
(Bye, for real)

1443
00:53:40,820 --> 00:53:44,760
(He watches them say goodbye
from behind...)

1444
00:53:46,829 --> 00:53:51,070
(and barely manages to walk away.)

1445
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:57,539
This feels weird.

1446
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

1447
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,710
My friends are going home.

1448
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:06,210
- Going home? Okay.
- Going home.

1449
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:10,389
(Something he regretted
during the trip to South America)

1450
00:54:11,150 --> 00:54:15,320
(The stay overnight with Porfi
was too short.)

1451
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:18,090
- I need to live there.
- Yes.

1452
00:54:19,489 --> 00:54:22,300
(He dreams of a deeper
and stronger relationship.)

1453
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:28,139
(Kian84's journey...)

1454
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,809
(begins again!)

1455
00:54:32,469 --> 00:54:33,780
(He follows the staff's guide.)

1456
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:35,079
Two hours later?

1457
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,050
They say it is the highest village.

1458
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,619
It opened up to the world not long ago,

1459
00:54:40,619 --> 00:54:43,179
so the people living there are very pure.

1460
00:54:44,150 --> 00:54:47,690
(The unknown world will be
his last destination.)

1461
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:53,559
(Leh, Puga Hot Springs, last destination)

1462
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:55,000
This is very interesting.

1463
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:56,670
Since I don't know
what happened after this.

1464
00:54:56,670 --> 00:54:58,369
- Yes, we feel the same.
- Yes.

1465
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,800
(The one who is heading to
the last destination...)

1466
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,610
(is just him alone.)

1467
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:10,750
This is so lonely.

1468
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:12,349
(Lonely)

1469
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,380
They used to be...

1470
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,019
in the back.

1471
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:22,860
I can feel their absence.

1472
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:27,099
The absence must be huge.

1473
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:29,400
We were together all the time,
24 hours a day.

1474
00:55:29,929 --> 00:55:33,070
(The times when it was loud and noisy...)

1475
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:36,840
(disappeared without a trace.)

1476
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:40,110
They're all alive!
Why are you acting like they died?

1477
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,210
- They're all alive and well.
- I'm here.

1478
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,050
- Why are you acting like that?
- I'm alive.

1479
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,650
This feels weird.

1480
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,349
But...

1481
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,849
We are alone in our lives.

1482
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,420
I think I'm at the age
where I can enjoy this loneliness.

1483
00:55:58,289 --> 00:56:01,059
(The journey
where he will meet a new friend)

1484
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:04,969
(Half excited and half scared)

1485
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:09,940
(Humming)

1486
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:13,440
Sir, is it okay if I sing?

1487
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,239
- Yes, okay.
- Sorry.

1488
00:56:15,239 --> 00:56:16,309
It's okay, no problem.

1489
00:56:16,309 --> 00:56:18,409
- Sing a good song.
- Okay.

1490
00:56:19,349 --> 00:56:21,280
He was driving for such a long time.

1491
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:23,550
Yes, he will like it.

1492
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:29,690
(No mic, no background music,
and no chorus)

1493
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:35,360
(He sings live in the Himalayas.)

1494
00:56:36,829 --> 00:56:38,829
(I will treat you better, guys.)

1495
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:44,739
(If you stay next to me)

1496
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:49,809
(Poor driver)

1497
00:56:49,809 --> 00:56:52,480
- What is that?
- Are you okay?

1498
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:55,119
(It became a tough job.)

1499
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,389
(He became emotional in his own world.)

1500
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:02,219
I haven't been able to use
my smartphone...

1501
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:03,860
for about four days.

1502
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,889
I'm not able to communicate
with the world,

1503
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:07,260
and I have nothing to do.

1504
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:09,059
But...

1505
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,900
I had some songs...

1506
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:13,230
downloaded on my phone.

1507
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,199
So I listened to them.

1508
00:57:17,670 --> 00:57:19,670
- The lyrics must really get to you.
- They did.

1509
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:25,309
(Whirring)

1510
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:30,190
(Vocalizing)

1511
00:57:30,519 --> 00:57:33,349
(Singing a mysterious song)

1512
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:38,690
(Goodness)

1513
00:57:39,130 --> 00:57:42,059
- He gets why you apologized beforehand.
- He's shocked.

1514
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,869
I apologized in advance.

1515
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:48,440
(His emotions soar all the way.)

1516
00:57:49,039 --> 00:57:51,239
(Climax)

1517
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,039
(Coughing)

1518
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:58,110
(The performance ends
with a lung-flipping performance.)

1519
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,349
I was coming down with a bad cold.

1520
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:04,320
(His fear goes away with his cough.)

1521
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:09,389
(The trip fills with excitement.)

1522
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:13,760
(Driving a long time
with loneliness by his side,)

1523
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,630
(Kian84 arrives at the village entrance.)

1524
00:58:19,099 --> 00:58:21,699
It took four hours...

1525
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:24,010
from the city of Leh.

1526
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:27,340
And then we drove for two more hours.

1527
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:30,650
I didn't have to travel this far
even in the Amazon.

1528
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,380
I don't know how they live here.

1529
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:36,420
(Deserted)

1530
00:58:36,519 --> 00:58:39,019
Gosh, it's so quiet here.

1531
00:58:40,119 --> 00:58:41,789
It felt like the quiet city...

1532
00:58:41,789 --> 00:58:43,760
in the animation "Galaxy Express 999."

1533
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:48,159
Gosh. There are some villagers here.

1534
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,860
(He starts to see the villagers.)

1535
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:52,300
The people here...

1536
00:58:53,030 --> 00:58:55,300
don't go out into the world.

1537
00:58:55,300 --> 00:58:57,210
They are disconnected from the world...

1538
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:00,409
and live here on their own.

1539
00:59:00,409 --> 00:59:01,940
I'm sure there aren't any buses...

1540
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,679
- that go there.
- There aren't.

1541
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,610
- It's a village where time has stopped.
- Yes.

1542
00:59:06,510 --> 00:59:08,619
If you want to go to the airport,

1543
00:59:08,650 --> 00:59:09,780
(Namaste)

1544
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,750
it would take...

1545
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:15,690
(Dancing)

1546
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,329
Show me your dance.

1547
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:21,230
- It's like Kian84's dance.
- It's similar.

1548
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:24,170
(The small body has Kian84's moves.)

1549
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,429
That's it.

1550
00:59:25,429 --> 00:59:26,630
(He's good.)

1551
00:59:27,099 --> 00:59:28,269
- Here?
- Yes.

1552
00:59:28,269 --> 00:59:29,670
Good job.

1553
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,639
- Good.
- Good.

1554
00:59:32,409 --> 00:59:35,210
How high is this place?
It's hard to breathe here as well.

1555
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:37,909
It's 4,570m above sea level.

1556
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,349
It's a bit higher again.

1557
00:59:41,179 --> 00:59:43,320
This is the deepest I've ever been...

1558
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:46,090
in my life.

1559
00:59:46,619 --> 00:59:50,260
It's like a village in
"Castle in the Sky."

1560
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:54,659
- It's cool.
- It's a sky village.

1561
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:56,260
(Korzok Village)

1562
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:59,400
So, this is Korzok Village.

1563
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,800
It's one of the highest villages
in the world,

1564
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:04,610
and it is isolated
from modern civilization.

1565
01:00:04,710 --> 01:00:07,239
It is located in the cold
and dry highlands,

1566
01:00:07,239 --> 01:00:10,750
so the people here raise livestock
as a means of living...

1567
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:13,179
and live a self-sufficient life.

1568
01:00:13,179 --> 01:00:16,719
(The first village under the sky)

1569
01:00:16,719 --> 01:00:19,989
There is the Korzok Temple up there.

1570
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,059
"Korzok?"

1571
01:00:21,219 --> 01:00:23,420
If you go up,
you will be able to meet them.

1572
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,429
Okay.

1573
01:00:24,860 --> 01:00:26,030
First of all...

1574
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,130
(He starts off
by looking around the village.)

1575
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:28,300
If you see here...

1576
01:00:29,199 --> 01:00:31,670
I don't know how to describe this scenery.

1577
01:00:32,969 --> 01:00:34,539
I don't know if they didn't get to
finish building this...

1578
01:00:34,539 --> 01:00:36,000
or if it's meant to be like this.

1579
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:37,409
(Panting)

1580
01:00:37,409 --> 01:00:39,239
It's 4,570m above sea level,

1581
01:00:39,539 --> 01:00:41,610
so I'm out of breath just from walking.

1582
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:43,039
There's no oxygen.

1583
01:00:43,510 --> 01:00:45,050
The people who live here...

1584
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,480
are called the Korkzoks.

1585
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:49,480
- They're the Korzoks, not Korkzoks.
- Korzok.

1586
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,719
They're the Korzoks.

1587
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:54,019
Hello.

1588
01:00:54,659 --> 01:00:55,820
Hello?

1589
01:00:56,420 --> 01:00:57,489
Hello?

1590
01:00:57,489 --> 01:00:59,590
- Hello, how are you?
- How are you?

1591
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:01,960
Supermarket?

1592
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,599
"Supermarket?"

1593
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,199
- Do you sell whiskey?
- No.

1594
01:01:06,199 --> 01:01:07,840
- No alcohol?
- No.

1595
01:01:07,840 --> 01:01:09,869
- No alcohol?
- They don't sell alcohol?

1596
01:01:09,869 --> 01:01:12,469
(The Korzok Village doesn't sell alcohol.)

1597
01:01:12,809 --> 01:01:15,139
I think they are really pure.

1598
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,380
They can be happy without alcohol?

1599
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,619
I need to learn from them.

1600
01:01:21,780 --> 01:01:24,920
(Panting)

1601
01:01:25,190 --> 01:01:26,519
What could that be?

1602
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,619
(Flapping)

1603
01:01:29,619 --> 01:01:31,190
Yes, it's a dragon.

1604
01:01:31,559 --> 01:01:32,989
I will go inside.

1605
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,000
(Getting drawn in)

1606
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:35,900
What is this place?

1607
01:01:37,630 --> 01:01:38,800
Gosh.

1608
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,639
The house... Is it a school?

1609
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,440
What's this?

1610
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:45,409
What's this? A temple? A Buddhist temple?

1611
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:47,039
- Buddhist temple.
- Buddhist temple?

1612
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:49,179
This is where Buddha is.

1613
01:01:49,179 --> 01:01:51,750
- A temple?
- Buddha... What?

1614
01:01:52,309 --> 01:01:54,150
(Come on in.)

1615
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,349
It's like the altar portrait of Buddha
in Korea.

1616
01:01:59,519 --> 01:02:01,820
The style is very similar to...

1617
01:02:02,289 --> 01:02:04,090
Korea's Buddhist art.

1618
01:02:04,260 --> 01:02:06,190
- The colors and style...
- It's really similar.

1619
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:07,300
are very similar.

1620
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,699
(Sniffing)

1621
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:10,030
Are you smelling that?

1622
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,070
(Sniffing)

1623
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:12,530
Through the crack,

1624
01:02:13,130 --> 01:02:15,039
I can smell the scent...

1625
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:16,570
the temple.

1626
01:02:16,570 --> 01:02:18,269
(It sounds like he could faint
if he tried to smell it twice.)

1627
01:02:18,269 --> 01:02:19,739
I will try going inside.

1628
01:02:23,510 --> 01:02:25,409
(Really amazed)

1629
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:30,280
(The inside is a lot like
Korea's Buddhist temple.)

1630
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:32,889
Here's another Buddha.

1631
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:36,289
Gosh. Can you see the Buddha inside?

1632
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,389
- There's a Buddha inside.
- A Buddha here.

1633
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,269
This... Offering? Money?

1634
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:45,630
How?

1635
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,599
An offering.

1636
01:02:48,239 --> 01:02:50,170
I asked Buddha to let my last trip...

1637
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,170
go well without any problems.

1638
01:02:52,809 --> 01:02:57,550
(He carefully lights up an incense.)

1639
01:02:58,710 --> 01:03:02,679
(Kian84's first bow
filled with his sincerity)

1640
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:10,659
(Bowing for the 2nd time)

1641
01:03:10,659 --> 01:03:14,230
(Bowing for the 3rd time)

1642
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:17,570
(Bowing for the 4th time)

1643
01:03:17,570 --> 01:03:20,429
You met and prayed
to all the deities in India.

1644
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,400
- Yes, I met all the deities.
- Right.

1645
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:25,409
(With sincerity and heavy breathing,
he bowed 4 times.)

1646
01:03:25,809 --> 01:03:27,510
(Breathing heavily)

1647
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,139
Why am I out of breath after two bows?

1648
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,050
(Memory loss due to altitude sickness)

1649
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:33,480
Really, the altitude sickness.

1650
01:03:34,019 --> 01:03:35,079
Bowing...

1651
01:03:35,719 --> 01:03:37,449
a thousand times here would be impossible.

1652
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:39,119
You'd lose your breath.

1653
01:03:41,989 --> 01:03:43,460
(Altitude sickness is this dangerous.)

1654
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,489
He's exhausted.

1655
01:03:47,429 --> 01:03:48,460
Namaste.

1656
01:03:49,199 --> 01:03:50,460
Are you a temple man?

1657
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:51,869
A temple man?

1658
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,530
I believe in Buddha.

1659
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,500
- Buddhism.
- Yes, Korea's Buddha.

1660
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:57,269
I believe in Korean Buddha.

1661
01:03:58,940 --> 01:04:00,440
Is this Tibetan Buddha?

1662
01:04:00,809 --> 01:04:02,010
Buddha Sakyamuni.

1663
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:03,480
"Buddha Soccermuni?"

1664
01:04:04,150 --> 01:04:05,409
"Buddha Soccermuni?"

1665
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,150
- "Buddha Soccermuni?"
- What does that mean?

1666
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:10,280
- Wasn't it Sakyamuni?
- Sakyamuni.

1667
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,420
I don't think Soccermuni exists
in Buddhism.

1668
01:04:12,420 --> 01:04:14,159
- "Sakyamuni?"
- How disrespectful.

1669
01:04:14,159 --> 01:04:16,119
- How disrespectful.
- I couldn't understand him.

1670
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:18,230
Can you not speak English?

1671
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:20,599
- Only a little bit.
- "A little bit?"

1672
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:21,699
(Shy)

1673
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:22,900
(Thinking)

1674
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,099
How old are the temple men?

1675
01:04:26,469 --> 01:04:28,300
- Thirty.
- "Thirty?"

1676
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,570
- Thirty years old.
- "Thirty?"

1677
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:30,809
- He's younger than you.
- "Forty?"

1678
01:04:30,809 --> 01:04:31,940
Thirty.

1679
01:04:32,239 --> 01:04:33,340
- "Thirty?"
- Thirty.

1680
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,840
Thirty-four years old.

1681
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,280
- "Thirty-four?"
- "Thirty-four."

1682
01:04:37,780 --> 01:04:40,409
How many temple men are here?

1683
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,449
Fifty.

1684
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:43,480
- "Fifty."
- Fifty here.

1685
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,250
So about 15 men live here.

1686
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:47,789
- Fifty.
- This...

1687
01:04:48,059 --> 01:04:49,960
- He clearly said 50.
- temple...

1688
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:53,260
What time do many people pray?

1689
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,659
(Pray)

1690
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:57,730
Prayers?

1691
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,429
Praying time.

1692
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,900
Gosh, I need Pani Bottle here.

1693
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:04,909
Well...

1694
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:07,340
Many people.

1695
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,539
It's back to charades.

1696
01:05:09,539 --> 01:05:10,650
What time?

1697
01:05:10,650 --> 01:05:13,909
During this time, they stay here all day.

1698
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:16,349
Okay. I know.

1699
01:05:16,349 --> 01:05:18,920
We'll interpret for you
as you look around.

1700
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,860
Please interpret for me. I'm dying here.

1701
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:24,929
How long will you stay here?

1702
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:26,960
I'm staying here...

1703
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:30,460
today, tomorrow,
and the day after tomorrow.

1704
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:31,500
Okay.

1705
01:05:31,869 --> 01:05:35,969
Do you like this village?
The monastery and village.

1706
01:05:35,969 --> 01:05:37,039
Do you like it?

1707
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:39,070
- "Lake?"
- Like.

1708
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:41,610
"Like?" I like temples.

1709
01:05:41,909 --> 01:05:42,980
And...

1710
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:44,880
(Thinking)

1711
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:45,909
Maybe...

1712
01:05:47,050 --> 01:05:48,150
a temple stay?

1713
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,949
You're asking if there's a temple stay.

1714
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,150
Can I stay at the temple?

1715
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:54,820
Can I sleep here?

1716
01:05:55,019 --> 01:05:57,989
Tonight, you can sleep with our students.

1717
01:05:57,989 --> 01:06:00,159
- Okay. Sleep here?
- Yes, sleep here.

1718
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,960
Guys.

1719
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:04,269
It seems there's a temple stay.

1720
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:07,000
How much is it to stay...

1721
01:06:07,969 --> 01:06:09,099
for one day?

1722
01:06:09,639 --> 01:06:11,710
There is no fixed price.

1723
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:13,570
- No?
- Pay as you'd like.

1724
01:06:14,409 --> 01:06:16,840
I see. I pay as much as I want to.

1725
01:06:17,110 --> 01:06:18,250
That's more pressure.

1726
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,550
Having a fixed price is more comfortable.

1727
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,519
Tonight, you will stay here.

1728
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:26,389
- Sleep here with our students.
- Sleep here?

1729
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:27,760
Hello.

1730
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,889
- Hello.
- Hi.

1731
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:29,920
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1732
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:31,789
- Hello.
- How adorable.

1733
01:06:31,789 --> 01:06:33,389
- How are you?
- They look like baby birds.

1734
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,460
I'm fine.

1735
01:06:35,059 --> 01:06:37,869
They are the promising kids...

1736
01:06:38,599 --> 01:06:40,469
of the Ladakh area.

1737
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,440
(Awkward)

1738
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:46,440
Well...

1739
01:06:47,940 --> 01:06:50,849
Meeting them for the first time
was awkward.

1740
01:06:51,780 --> 01:06:54,579
Is your dream to become a Buddhist monk?

1741
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:56,449
(Nodding)

1742
01:06:56,449 --> 01:06:57,650
Is it your dream?

1743
01:06:58,190 --> 01:06:59,690
In Korea,

1744
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:02,659
I'm also a believer in Buddhism.

1745
01:07:02,920 --> 01:07:04,460
What are Buddha's teachings?

1746
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:06,559
Tell me what you know.

1747
01:07:07,559 --> 01:07:09,960
Let's live peacefully
without causing harm.

1748
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,599
"Let's live quietly?"

1749
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:14,269
You already learned
an important lesson about enlightenment.

1750
01:07:14,269 --> 01:07:17,570
(You already realized
something important.)

1751
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:19,210
Am I good-looking?

1752
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:21,710
(Yes.)

1753
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:23,980
You've found enlightenment.

1754
01:07:24,380 --> 01:07:26,849
(Laughing)

1755
01:07:27,550 --> 01:07:30,019
- Sleep here tonight.
- Me?

1756
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,750
You can stay and sleep here.

1757
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:34,860
May I sleep here?

1758
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:36,389
- Okay.
- Okay.

1759
01:07:36,389 --> 01:07:39,460
Really? Thanks, guys.

1760
01:07:39,989 --> 01:07:41,099
- Do Yeon.
- Yes?

1761
01:07:41,099 --> 01:07:44,530
Do the young monks stay at the temple
starting at a young age...

1762
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:46,730
to become monks?

1763
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:47,739
That's right.

1764
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:50,340
Those kids have all gathered
to become monks.

1765
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:53,769
In Tibetan Buddhism,
a child of a family joining the temple...

1766
01:07:53,769 --> 01:07:56,179
to become a monk is a tradition.

1767
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:58,409
They consider it a pride,

1768
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:00,550
so there are many young monks.

1769
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,389
Are you hungry?

1770
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,820
(No.)

1771
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:08,820
But I'm hungry. Let's eat together.

1772
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,760
(Okay.)

1773
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:14,829
You'll eat dinner at 8 p.m.
with the young monks.

1774
01:08:14,829 --> 01:08:17,300
Okay, dinner. Let's have dinner together.

1775
01:08:17,569 --> 01:08:19,970
- You eat together.
- Together. Okay.

1776
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:23,239
I thought there was a temple stay.

1777
01:08:23,239 --> 01:08:25,970
But there isn't one.

1778
01:08:26,909 --> 01:08:29,979
Instead, it's me
and these seven small kids.

1779
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:31,710
It's Snow White84.

1780
01:08:32,050 --> 01:08:33,350
"Snow White84."

1781
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:36,779
Let's go. Have fun outside.

1782
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,119
(The 7 young monks leave
after the awkward greeting.)

1783
01:08:38,119 --> 01:08:39,289
The sun is already setting.

1784
01:08:39,289 --> 01:08:41,119
I'll eat together with the kids later.

1785
01:08:41,819 --> 01:08:43,020
I like temple food.

1786
01:08:43,359 --> 01:08:44,789
My tongue is stiff from the cold.

1787
01:08:45,460 --> 01:08:46,890
I like temple food.

1788
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,899
I wonder what the food here will be like.

1789
01:08:49,899 --> 01:08:51,229
(Taking a rest
while looking forward to the meal)

1790
01:08:52,399 --> 01:08:54,840
(He's taking a break
for the first time...)

1791
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,739
(after sending the brothers off.)

1792
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,239
- Hello.
- Hello.

1793
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,079
- Hello.
- Hello.

1794
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,140
Your name?

1795
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,449
My name is Nauan Taldan.

1796
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:06,909
- Nang?
- No.

1797
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,319
You look a lot like a Muay Thai champion.

1798
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,720
Buakaw.

1799
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,949
- Buakaw.
- He looked like Buakaw.

1800
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,260
Your name?

1801
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:18,090
- Jigmed Lachok.
- Jigmed Lachok.

1802
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:20,159
- Jigmed Lachok.
- Jigmed Lachok.

1803
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:21,460
"Jugmen Lacho."

1804
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:22,960
What a hard name.

1805
01:09:22,960 --> 01:09:24,500
I doubt Kian84 will remember the names.

1806
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:26,399
Your name?

1807
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,199
- Tiring Sandup.
- "Chiring Sadup."

1808
01:09:28,399 --> 01:09:31,170
- Memorizing their names won't be easy.
- Tiring Sandup.

1809
01:09:31,170 --> 01:09:32,239
Your name.

1810
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:33,539
- Jigmed.
- Jigmed Chaepal.

1811
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:35,439
- "Pal?"
- Jigmed Chaepal.

1812
01:09:35,609 --> 01:09:36,640
"Jepal Chapal."

1813
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:39,010
What's your name?

1814
01:09:39,350 --> 01:09:41,250
- Jigmed Skarzan.
- "Jema Pazang."

1815
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:45,319
The kids are starting to laugh.

1816
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:46,449
Yes, slowly.

1817
01:09:46,989 --> 01:09:48,020
Your name?

1818
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:49,460
My name is Yisei Dorjeh.

1819
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:50,789
"Shisha Shase."

1820
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:52,590
Your name?

1821
01:09:53,090 --> 01:09:54,529
My name is Dosei Gyaltsen.

1822
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,829
"Gaze Gaze."

1823
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,899
They're starting to warm up to him.

1824
01:10:00,369 --> 01:10:02,439
Your age. Fifteen years old?

1825
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,100
Eighty.

1826
01:10:04,369 --> 01:10:05,710
- Eighteen.
- "Eighty."

1827
01:10:05,710 --> 01:10:07,109
- How old?
- Five.

1828
01:10:07,109 --> 01:10:08,239
- "Five?"
- Yes.

1829
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:10,279
That's the prime of life.

1830
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:11,850
Five is the best age.

1831
01:10:12,210 --> 01:10:13,279
Five. You?

1832
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:15,550
- Six.
- "Six."

1833
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:17,449
I'm eleven.

1834
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:19,619
- "Eleven?" Eleven years old.
- Yes.

1835
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:22,960
- I'm nine.
- "Nine."

1836
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:25,659
- Children.
- "Children."

1837
01:10:25,659 --> 01:10:27,159
- My...
- "My..."

1838
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:28,960
My job.

1839
01:10:29,229 --> 01:10:30,329
"My job."

1840
01:10:31,130 --> 01:10:32,199
They're repeating after him.

1841
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:34,869
Repeat after me. Who am I?

1842
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,170
- "Who am I?"
- "Who am I?"

1843
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:38,310
- A cartoonist.
- "A cartoonist."

1844
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:40,670
- How cute.
- An entertainer.

1845
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:41,779
- "An entertainer."
- "An entertainer."

1846
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,409
- YouTuber.
- "YouTuber."

1847
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:45,449
That's who I am.

1848
01:10:45,449 --> 01:10:47,149
- "That's who I am."
- "That's who I am."

1849
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,619
- The kids will master Korean.
- They're good.

1850
01:10:50,050 --> 01:10:51,689
- My name.
- "My name."

1851
01:10:51,689 --> 01:10:53,350
- My name is...
- "My name is..."

1852
01:10:53,819 --> 01:10:55,289
- Kim...
- "Kim..."

1853
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:56,760
- Hee...
- "Hee..."

1854
01:10:56,760 --> 01:10:57,930
- Min.
- "Min."

1855
01:10:58,329 --> 01:10:59,460
Kim Hee Min.

1856
01:10:59,460 --> 01:11:00,630
- "Kim Mee Ming."
- "Kim Mee Ming."

1857
01:11:00,960 --> 01:11:02,260
They're adorable.

1858
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:03,260
"Kim Mee Ming."

1859
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:05,829
- That is my name!
- "That is my name!"

1860
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:08,340
(Giggling)

1861
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,439
You say, "Kim."

1862
01:11:10,439 --> 01:11:11,539
- You say, "Kim."
- You say, "Kim."

1863
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:13,670
- I say, "Ho."
- "I say, Ho."

1864
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:14,739
You say?

1865
01:11:14,840 --> 01:11:16,279
- "You say."
- "Kim."

1866
01:11:16,279 --> 01:11:17,949
- Kim.
- One kid understood.

1867
01:11:18,409 --> 01:11:21,250
Guys. Say, "Dad."

1868
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:23,479
- Dad.
- "Dad."

1869
01:11:23,880 --> 01:11:25,689
- Dad.
- "Dad."

1870
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,890
Why did you tell them to say "Dad?"

1871
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:30,090
I just wanted to hear them say it.

1872
01:11:30,090 --> 01:11:31,460
Do you want to be a dad?

1873
01:11:31,460 --> 01:11:33,159
No, it's just that they were adorable.

1874
01:11:33,630 --> 01:11:35,659
In a way,
they're young enough to be my sons.

1875
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:38,899
I'm your dad. I'm...

1876
01:11:38,899 --> 01:11:39,899
(Laughing)

1877
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:42,039
Guys, who am I?

1878
01:11:42,340 --> 01:11:44,539
- Dad.
- That's right, my sons.

1879
01:11:45,539 --> 01:11:47,010
(They don't understand him
but they're giggling.)

1880
01:11:47,010 --> 01:11:48,409
They just think you're funny.

1881
01:11:50,279 --> 01:11:51,479
Did someone fart?

1882
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,180
What's that smell?

1883
01:11:53,649 --> 01:11:55,920
Who was it?

1884
01:11:56,220 --> 01:11:58,189
Who's the culprit?

1885
01:11:58,250 --> 01:11:59,250
Raise your hand.

1886
01:12:00,619 --> 01:12:02,289
- Did you fart?
- Gosh.

1887
01:12:02,989 --> 01:12:04,260
Well, regardless of nationality,

1888
01:12:04,260 --> 01:12:05,989
- everyone finds poop and fart funny.
- Right.

1889
01:12:05,989 --> 01:12:08,699
This doesn't smell like a fart that could
come from someone who only eats greens.

1890
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:10,729
(Strangely, they're able to communicate
even without an interpreter.)

1891
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:12,029
He's lying down the whole time.

1892
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:14,939
To be honest,
I was having a hard time back then...

1893
01:12:14,939 --> 01:12:16,699
- because of altitude sickness.
- That's why you kept lying down.

1894
01:12:16,699 --> 01:12:19,010
So I only had the energy to move my mouth.

1895
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:20,510
- You were all talk.
- You really were all talk.

1896
01:12:20,510 --> 01:12:21,739
I've heard so much about you.

1897
01:12:21,739 --> 01:12:23,310
- The guy who's all talk.
- He's all talk.

1898
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:25,710
Like the ants that flung themselves
at the grasshopper,

1899
01:12:25,810 --> 01:12:27,850
they approached me slowly.

1900
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,479
Still, you're a pro.
You were able to talk while you were sick.

1901
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:30,479
(Pro84 kept talking
in the midst of hardship.)

1902
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,250
(He's opening his mouth.)

1903
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,619
Hey, kiddo.

1904
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:35,260
(He rushed over to Kian84.)

1905
01:12:35,260 --> 01:12:36,260
All right.

1906
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,890
- Say "Dad."
- Ta-da.

1907
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:40,460
- Dad.
- Dad.

1908
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:41,500
- Good.
- How adorable.

1909
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,960
What was his name again?

1910
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,329
Chim.

1911
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,600
Kim Hee...

1912
01:12:46,600 --> 01:12:48,239
You're so cute.

1913
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:49,539
Kim Hee...

1914
01:12:49,770 --> 01:12:51,340
My name is Kim...

1915
01:12:51,340 --> 01:12:52,840
(They're loud when they're together.)

1916
01:12:53,310 --> 01:12:55,310
They're adorable.
They're just like kids their age.

1917
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,640
Watching them now, these kids...

1918
01:12:58,479 --> 01:13:01,319
lied to me a bit.

1919
01:13:01,319 --> 01:13:02,779
They lied to me about...

1920
01:13:03,649 --> 01:13:05,220
Earlier, they definitely said...

1921
01:13:05,689 --> 01:13:07,289
that what they learned here...

1922
01:13:07,989 --> 01:13:10,260
is the need for quiet lives.

1923
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,630
A little more...

1924
01:13:12,630 --> 01:13:16,329
(Screaming)

1925
01:13:16,729 --> 01:13:19,300
Yes! Come on!

1926
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,340
- Yes!
- This night won't be easy.

1927
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,000
They definitely said...

1928
01:13:24,510 --> 01:13:26,970
they learn to live quiet lives.

1929
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:29,079
(What is Buddha's lesson?)

1930
01:13:29,079 --> 01:13:31,750
(To not harm others and live quietly.)

1931
01:13:32,210 --> 01:13:35,020
(He thought
they had reached enlightenment.)

1932
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,050
I think they still need to train more.

1933
01:13:39,319 --> 01:13:42,689
I think the kids need more training.

1934
01:13:43,590 --> 01:13:46,729
You guys still need Buddha's...

1935
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:47,729
(No, we don't.)

1936
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:53,229
(He closes his eyes tightly.)

1937
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,270
Do whatever you want.

1938
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,640
Whatever you want.

1939
01:13:56,640 --> 01:13:58,140
- Whatever you want.
- Do whatever you want.

1940
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,840
Whatever you want.

1941
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:02,010
- Whatever you want.
- They were so loud.

1942
01:14:02,010 --> 01:14:03,880
- Whatever you want.
- There's an echo here too.

1943
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:07,210
(Laughing)

1944
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:11,149
I don't think I'll be able to sleep here.

1945
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:13,949
I don't think...

1946
01:14:13,949 --> 01:14:14,989
(He's going nuts.)

1947
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:17,359
I don't think I'll be able to sleep here.

1948
01:14:17,359 --> 01:14:18,529
This is so funny.

1949
01:14:18,659 --> 01:14:21,060
These kids were very well-behaved earlier.

1950
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:23,329
But they're...

1951
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,029
They're completely different
from their first impressions.

1952
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:26,729
So it got me wondering...

1953
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:29,300
what it would have been like
if we had been a bit awkward.

1954
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,239
(What would it have been like
if we had been a bit awkward?)

1955
01:14:31,340 --> 01:14:33,010
If I was a bit more uncomfortable there.

1956
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:34,069
They relaxed quickly.

1957
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:35,739
- Yes.
- In 30 minutes after meeting them...

1958
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:37,979
- They relaxed too quickly.
- You became that close with them.

1959
01:14:37,979 --> 01:14:40,010
He's giving up right away.

1960
01:14:40,449 --> 01:14:42,319
As expected, the children...

1961
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:44,479
Children are the same everywhere.

1962
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:47,520
At that age,
playing like that is the most fun.

1963
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:50,060
They must have been so excited
to meet an outsider.

1964
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:51,760
That was probably
why the kids didn't leave you alone.

1965
01:14:52,890 --> 01:14:54,760
Do you want to play a game?

1966
01:14:54,760 --> 01:14:56,000
I'll play with you.

1967
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:57,800
Do you want to get on an airplane?

1968
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:59,770
- An airplane.
- Yes.

1969
01:14:59,770 --> 01:15:00,869
(They gather around at the mention
of an airplane.)

1970
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,369
Airplane. Come here one by one.

1971
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:06,739
(Goodness)

1972
01:15:06,739 --> 01:15:07,810
(Shrieking)

1973
01:15:07,909 --> 01:15:09,479
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

1974
01:15:09,479 --> 01:15:11,779
- Oh, my gosh.
- The kids are...

1975
01:15:12,050 --> 01:15:13,949
Goodness, it's okay.

1976
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:15,420
It's okay. You hit your head.

1977
01:15:15,949 --> 01:15:17,220
Who pushed you?

1978
01:15:18,520 --> 01:15:19,520
Are you okay?

1979
01:15:19,750 --> 01:15:20,819
Gosh.

1980
01:15:21,289 --> 01:15:22,460
Apologize.

1981
01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:23,890
Who was it? Who pushed him?

1982
01:15:24,260 --> 01:15:27,460
It was difficult for me
to remember this name,

1983
01:15:27,529 --> 01:15:29,859
so I called him "Crying Monk"
to put a name to his face.

1984
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,529
- "Crying Monk."
- Like Crybaby Monk?

1985
01:15:31,529 --> 01:15:35,399
Yes. He cried often.

1986
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,600
(I want to get on an airplane.)

1987
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:40,039
All right, you go first.
I'll get you on an airplane.

1988
01:15:40,310 --> 01:15:41,640
Let's go. Come.

1989
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,939
I'm playing a game.

1990
01:15:43,939 --> 01:15:44,949
Decide.

1991
01:15:45,210 --> 01:15:46,350
(He stopped crying and joined them.)

1992
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:47,579
- Look.
- Yes.

1993
01:15:47,649 --> 01:15:49,720
Tokyo, Paris,

1994
01:15:49,720 --> 01:15:52,220
New York, Hong Kong. How there?

1995
01:15:52,220 --> 01:15:53,750
- "How there" again?
- "How there?"

1996
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:55,520
- How dare you?
- How dare you?

1997
01:15:55,819 --> 01:15:57,289
How dare you go to Hong Kong...

1998
01:15:57,289 --> 01:15:58,829
- and Tokyo?
- I should have said, "Where is?"

1999
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:01,090
He's the one who asked,
but then he goes, "How dare?"

2000
01:16:01,630 --> 01:16:03,729
Tokyo, Paris,

2001
01:16:03,729 --> 01:16:06,029
New York, Hong Kong. How there?

2002
01:16:06,029 --> 01:16:07,600
- "How dare?"
- Hong Kong.

2003
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:09,039
- All right. Let's go to Hong Kong.
- Hong Kong.

2004
01:16:09,039 --> 01:16:10,170
Hong Kong.

2005
01:16:10,170 --> 01:16:12,039
(He safely made it
on the airplane to Hong Kong.)

2006
01:16:13,239 --> 01:16:14,239
(Drooling)

2007
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:16,109
Gosh, his saliva got into my mouth.

2008
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:17,779
His saliva came out.

2009
01:16:18,380 --> 01:16:19,479
It dripped straight down.

2010
01:16:19,479 --> 01:16:20,510
(Laughing)

2011
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:21,720
Amylase?

2012
01:16:22,579 --> 01:16:25,590
A single drop of amylase
dripped right into my mouth.

2013
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:28,659
I have grown closer to them.

2014
01:16:30,060 --> 01:16:33,029
Your amylase.

2015
01:16:34,229 --> 01:16:35,359
Saliva Monk.

2016
01:16:35,359 --> 01:16:37,229
(Starting today, he is named Saliva Monk.)

2017
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:38,569
Using nicknames makes it easier
to remember them.

2018
01:16:38,569 --> 01:16:40,229
That helped me remember.

2019
01:16:40,470 --> 01:16:42,600
Hey.

2020
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,869
(He's embarrassed.)

2021
01:16:43,869 --> 01:16:45,140
(Kian84 is dizzy
from Saliva Monk's saliva attack.)

2022
01:16:45,170 --> 01:16:47,909
It's okay.

2023
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:51,239
Let's take you to Tokyo.

2024
01:16:51,239 --> 01:16:52,649
(Although he's having a hard time
with altitude sickness...)

2025
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:54,149
He gave all of them airplane rides.

2026
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:56,420
- He's so nice.
- Gosh.

2027
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:57,550
He must have been so exhausted.

2028
01:16:57,550 --> 01:16:59,520
Moving is really tough
when you have altitude sickness.

2029
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:00,789
Let's go.

2030
01:17:01,090 --> 01:17:02,289
(The eldest joins in too)

2031
01:17:02,289 --> 01:17:03,689
No, not you.

2032
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:07,560
(They fall apart.)

2033
01:17:07,729 --> 01:17:09,060
(Trudging)

2034
01:17:09,060 --> 01:17:10,500
He's running away.

2035
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:15,100
Where's that monk? I need to talk to him.

2036
01:17:15,539 --> 01:17:20,069
(Monk, meet me immediately.)

2037
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,640
- He's angry.
- He's in trouble.

2038
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:23,039
(It was exhausting.)

2039
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,310
(Panting)

2040
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:31,390
(Ta-da)

2041
01:17:31,590 --> 01:17:33,220
What? Why is there another one?

2042
01:17:33,619 --> 01:17:35,159
Why is there another one?

2043
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:36,460
On top of that, another one came along.

2044
01:17:36,460 --> 01:17:37,720
They must have heard about him.

2045
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,689
Sure, go ahead and laugh.

2046
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:42,000
The baby monks are so cute, right?

2047
01:17:42,529 --> 01:17:43,600
It's a war.

2048
01:17:44,600 --> 01:17:46,930
They keep talking to you
and doing this and that.

2049
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:48,699
It's a war.

2050
01:17:49,970 --> 01:17:51,340
Please don't follow me this time.

2051
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:53,140
I really want to rest this time.

2052
01:17:53,239 --> 01:17:55,039
You're all so cute and nice,

2053
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,680
but I'm in bad shape.

2054
01:17:58,050 --> 01:17:59,449
Let me get some rest, kids.

2055
01:17:59,449 --> 01:18:02,619
(I'll get some rest.)

2056
01:18:02,619 --> 01:18:05,050
He's high in the mountain.
Don't forget that.

2057
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:06,590
You played with them so well.

2058
01:18:08,390 --> 01:18:11,020
Are they sleeping before having dinner?

2059
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,090
(Sending off his brothers
and playing with the boy monks)

2060
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:13,960
This is high in the mountains,

2061
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:16,229
so people have to lie down
for about six hours.

2062
01:18:16,229 --> 01:18:17,430
(He barely had time to breathe today.)

2063
01:18:17,430 --> 01:18:19,329
(The lullaby stopped playing abruptly.)

2064
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:21,670
(After finishing their work for the day,)

2065
01:18:21,670 --> 01:18:23,439
(they return home one by one.)

2066
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,239
(Curious)

2067
01:18:26,239 --> 01:18:29,010
(They gather around him.)

2068
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:30,739
- Oh, no.
- Gosh.

2069
01:18:30,939 --> 01:18:32,810
(They're crowded around him.)

2070
01:18:32,810 --> 01:18:35,180
It's as if I have six siblings...

2071
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,050
No, seven siblings.

2072
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:38,819
Do you like to dance?

2073
01:18:39,220 --> 01:18:40,949
Dance?

2074
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:42,260
Sure, do you want to dance?

2075
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:45,130
I like to dance.

2076
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:47,029
All right. It's dance time.

2077
01:18:47,029 --> 01:18:49,800
All right. Let's go.

2078
01:18:49,829 --> 01:18:51,600
(Dancing around)

2079
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,869
That vibe of his is coming out.

2080
01:18:54,369 --> 01:18:56,300
- That vibe of his is coming out.
- It's like he's at a nightclub.

2081
01:18:56,300 --> 01:18:57,340
Put that music on.

2082
01:18:58,770 --> 01:19:00,510
(To tell you about this dance move,)

2083
01:19:01,939 --> 01:19:04,380
- Bollywood84.
- It's like a nightclub.

2084
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,479
(it's Bollywood84's killer move.)

2085
01:19:08,550 --> 01:19:10,279
(Dancing with the 7 boy monks)

2086
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:11,550
This is...

2087
01:19:12,119 --> 01:19:14,149
the Korzok Club.

2088
01:19:14,890 --> 01:19:17,220
Yes. Gosh.

2089
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,159
Korzok Club.

2090
01:19:21,359 --> 01:19:24,300
(He's exhausted all of a sudden.)

2091
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:26,970
I'm tired.

2092
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:29,800
(Sighing)

2093
01:19:30,939 --> 01:19:32,369
I'm tired because I'm old.

2094
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:34,210
Yes.

2095
01:19:34,739 --> 01:19:36,810
(He's still full of energy.)

2096
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,979
(After finishing a round of dancing...)

2097
01:19:39,680 --> 01:19:41,180
He's handsome.

2098
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:43,579
Hey! You're handsome.

2099
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,020
- Handsome Monk.
- Handsome.

2100
01:19:45,149 --> 01:19:47,149
The kids are all cute and handsome.

2101
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:49,720
Gosh, he has a hip-hop style.

2102
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,529
(He has a hip-hop style.)

2103
01:19:51,789 --> 01:19:53,289
Gosh, the monk has swag.

2104
01:19:53,560 --> 01:19:54,760
- He's cute.
- Handsome Monk.

2105
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,060
Do you like drawing?

2106
01:19:57,430 --> 01:19:59,229
- Drawing?
- Drawing.

2107
01:19:59,229 --> 01:20:01,029
- I like drawing.
- Yes.

2108
01:20:01,100 --> 01:20:02,270
Do you want me to draw you?

2109
01:20:02,670 --> 01:20:05,909
Give me paper and a pencil.

2110
01:20:07,409 --> 01:20:08,680
Who should I draw?

2111
01:20:08,680 --> 01:20:09,710
(It's time for Kian84 to do his main job.)

2112
01:20:09,710 --> 01:20:12,609
- Drawing.
- It's drawing time.

2113
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,380
Kids, give me some paper.

2114
01:20:15,380 --> 01:20:17,050
The children are
going to like this so much.

2115
01:20:17,149 --> 01:20:19,689
Can I use this? Pencil.

2116
01:20:20,149 --> 01:20:21,149
Yes.

2117
01:20:21,619 --> 01:20:23,720
What should I draw to make them happy?

2118
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,390
Usually, when I draw for children,

2119
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:28,659
they focus and watch.

2120
01:20:28,659 --> 01:20:30,460
Don't they like it
when you draw things like dinosaurs?

2121
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,500
Dinosaurs, machines,

2122
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,029
and cars. They like those things.

2123
01:20:34,399 --> 01:20:36,369
(He's working on a custom drawing.)

2124
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,569
(With their heads put together...)

2125
01:20:38,569 --> 01:20:40,010
- They're adorable.
- They're so cute.

2126
01:20:40,010 --> 01:20:41,109
They're so cute.

2127
01:20:41,109 --> 01:20:42,810
They're all drawing.

2128
01:20:42,979 --> 01:20:44,109
It's an art class.

2129
01:20:44,109 --> 01:20:45,149
(Buzzing)

2130
01:20:45,149 --> 01:20:47,750
(Before you know it,
he finished a drawing of a motorcycle.)

2131
01:20:47,779 --> 01:20:49,050
Okay.

2132
01:20:49,149 --> 01:20:51,380
Do you want to see my photos?

2133
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,489
I'll show you my friends.

2134
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:58,020
Who should I show you first? Camera.

2135
01:20:58,359 --> 01:21:01,800
- What do you think? He is my brother.
- Gosh, that's a nice picture.

2136
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:03,100
He's a Korean soldier.

2137
01:21:04,560 --> 01:21:06,229
- He's in good shape, right?
- Gosh.

2138
01:21:06,229 --> 01:21:07,300
Your back is in good shape.

2139
01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,569
I was in good shape back then.

2140
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:11,239
This is...

2141
01:21:12,210 --> 01:21:14,140
- Amritsar.
- Amritsar.

2142
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:16,010
Do you know Amritsar?

2143
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,449
- This is Amritsar.
- Yes.

2144
01:21:19,210 --> 01:21:20,250
My brother.

2145
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:21,949
It's like he's showing
a family photo to them.

2146
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:24,279
This is the Ganges River.

2147
01:21:24,279 --> 01:21:27,189
The Ganges Ganga.

2148
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:30,319
- Do you know the Ganges Ganga?
- Yes.

2149
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,420
(I know.)

2150
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,489
I knew it.

2151
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,930
This is me.

2152
01:21:34,829 --> 01:21:36,500
It's me.

2153
01:21:37,430 --> 01:21:39,300
Baeksang Arts Awards.

2154
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,600
I go to these places sometimes.

2155
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,800
(Goodness)

2156
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:44,800
- A superstar.
- A superstar.

2157
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:46,970
A Korean superstar. That's me.

2158
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,439
That's who I am.

2159
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:50,539
He's...

2160
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,909
He's Lee Si Eon.

2161
01:21:53,909 --> 01:21:56,520
It must be hard to believe, but he's...

2162
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:58,350
"It must be hard to believe."

2163
01:21:58,949 --> 01:22:00,789
He's a Korean movie star.

2164
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:03,319
(He's a Korean actor.)

2165
01:22:03,319 --> 01:22:05,590
It's hard to believe it, right?
He's a Korean actor.

2166
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:08,300
Have you seen the ocean?

2167
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:10,329
I will become the wind.

2168
01:22:10,729 --> 01:22:11,899
It's the Korean Sea.

2169
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:14,000
The sea is nice.

2170
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:15,140
(He's showing the 7 boy monks
Korea's beautiful sea.)

2171
01:22:15,140 --> 01:22:17,340
At the sea, you can fish.

2172
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:19,210
You can swim.

2173
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:20,810
Has anyone been to the sea?

2174
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:23,340
(The sea?)

2175
01:22:23,979 --> 01:22:25,210
No one?

2176
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:26,609
Oh, my.

2177
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,750
You must go to the sea when you're older.

2178
01:22:29,020 --> 01:22:31,750
(Nodding)

2179
01:22:32,119 --> 01:22:34,020
They must want to go so badly.

2180
01:22:34,689 --> 01:22:36,289
- He gave them a dream.
- Yes.

2181
01:22:36,289 --> 01:22:37,460
(He gave the children who haven't
seen a bigger world a little dream.)

2182
01:22:38,260 --> 01:22:41,189
When they see the ocean in person later,

2183
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,630
- Right.
- they will think of Kian84 right away.

2184
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:43,630
That's amazing.

2185
01:22:43,630 --> 01:22:45,569
He met new people
after saying goodbye to the others.

2186
01:22:45,569 --> 01:22:47,729
- Yes. Right away.
- Yes.

2187
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,199
(The last story of the trip to India)

2188
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:53,010
(If you don't watch the episode
next week,)

2189
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,010
(you guys...)

2190
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,510
(will be wasting 9 weeks.)

2191
01:22:57,239 --> 01:23:01,550
(He starts his day in a rush
before those 9 weeks disappear.)

2192
01:23:02,079 --> 01:23:04,619
(With the holy sound
of chanting Buddhist scriptures)

2193
01:23:04,819 --> 01:23:07,550
It's not true, you fool

2194
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:09,720
(He's singing the stress
from babysitting away.)

2195
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:13,390
(It won't be that easy.)

2196
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,760
(Let's play today as well!)

2197
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,600
(The babysitting level...)

2198
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:18,600
(is getting higher.)

2199
01:23:18,869 --> 01:23:20,899
(A child monk cries.)

2200
01:23:21,100 --> 01:23:22,340
(The teacher of the day cries too.)

2201
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,470
(Why am I crying?)

2202
01:23:23,739 --> 01:23:25,170
(Light-headed)

2203
01:23:25,710 --> 01:23:26,970
(As they run around together,)

2204
01:23:26,970 --> 01:23:29,539
(they grow attached to one another.)

2205
01:23:29,539 --> 01:23:30,739
(Do you like me?)

2206
01:23:30,739 --> 01:23:32,180
(I like you.)

2207
01:23:32,609 --> 01:23:34,079
(A series of precious moments...)

2208
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:36,380
(that he wants to cherish for a long time)

2209
01:23:37,220 --> 01:23:39,250
(We will come with you.)

2210
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:40,850
(Touched)

2211
01:23:41,119 --> 01:23:42,689
(Do you want me to become your dad?
Do you want to become my son?)

2212
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,920
(Dad!)

2213
01:23:45,430 --> 01:23:47,829
(Teacher84 and 7 child monks
become a family in no time.)

2214
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:51,699
(And he walks again by himself.)

2215
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,670
(The end of the long journey)

2216
01:23:55,699 --> 01:23:59,170
(What will be the last page
of his trip to India look like?)

2217
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:01,069
(Adventure by Accident 2)
