1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:03,379
(Departing from Amritsar)

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:04,639
(Delhi Airport, Leh Airport)

3
00:00:04,639 --> 00:00:06,849
(Arriving at Leh Airport)

4
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:10,119
(Day 8 of the trip)

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,119
If we go farther,
we won't get any cell reception.

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,760
The Internet doesn't work very well here.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,760
It doesn't, right?

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,589
- I don't think there's any connection.
- Right.

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,500
We have to go to the travel agency...

10
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,559
and get a travel permit first,

11
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,730
but since there's no Internet,
I can't find the place.

12
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:30,000
I just know the name.

13
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,299
I don't know where is the location.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,840
- I only know the name.
- We just...

15
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,810
I can feel the altitude now.

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,380
- Are you starting to feel it?
- Yes.

17
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:42,350
It's a bit hard to breathe.

18
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,750
(Breathing in)

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,890
- Are you getting altitude sickness?
- Not to that degree.

20
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,549
- I'm completely fine.
- There you go again.

21
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,920
- Don't act so tough.
- It is hard...

22
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,759
It is hard to breathe.

23
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,990
But this is nothing.

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:57,399
(Having difficulty breathing
is a symptom of altitude sickness.)

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:59,960
He doesn't have altitude sickness,
but he is having a hard time breathing.

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,400
I was fine when I was standing still,
but it was hard to move.

27
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,269
- That is what altitude sickness is.
- That's altitude sickness.

28
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:08,439
That's altitude sickness.

29
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,340
Would you wait just a moment?

30
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:12,709
Things will turn around soon.

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,209
Watching that is putting me on edge.

32
00:01:14,209 --> 00:01:15,579
- Okay. I see.
- Let's be patient.

33
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:17,250
- I shouldn't be acting like that.
- I get it.

34
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,750
We weren't patient enough.

35
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,519
(Looking over)

36
00:01:22,349 --> 00:01:25,019
(Plopping down)

37
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,489
(Kian84 has to sit down
from the altitude sickness.)

38
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,959
- Okay.
- You got it?

39
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:32,430
- Yes.
- Okay. Perfect.

40
00:01:32,829 --> 00:01:34,400
- Let's go.
- Oh, my.

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,939
- Let's go.
- Is it this car?

42
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,439
Are you starting to feel
the altitude sickness?

43
00:01:40,469 --> 00:01:43,010
I'm not feeling it right now.

44
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,209
Are you okay for now?

45
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:46,909
I just like nature.

46
00:01:46,909 --> 00:01:48,879
I like romantic things.

47
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:50,579
Dex was totally fine.

48
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,620
I can't even call those high mountains.

49
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:55,049
The highest I've been...

50
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:56,650
- What happened here?
- What is this?

51
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,060
- I thought your hair went gray.
- I didn't realize that was Dex.

52
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,230
- That's Dex, right?
- He's wearing a hat.

53
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,500
I live for these interviews.

54
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,930
(Satisfied)

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,500
The highest I've been...

56
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,930
is Halla Mountain.

57
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,969
Then I suddenly came
to this high mountain.

58
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,210
Kian84 and Pani Bottle
were already saying my stomach was weak.

59
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,340
If I get altitude sickness here,

60
00:02:17,479 --> 00:02:19,680
it would make the whole image...

61
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,009
I've built up until now meaningless.

62
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:25,479
(The image he has built up until now)

63
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:27,189
I was nervous at first,

64
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,990
but the moment we arrived in Leh,

65
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,460
I felt it wasn't as bad as I expected.

66
00:02:33,189 --> 00:02:36,530
- If we walk, you'll start to get winded.
- I see.

67
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:38,759
Is it this car?

68
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,900
- What a pretty car.
- Is this it?

69
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,069
It's a cute minivan.

70
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:42,530
- Very nice car.
- It's kind of like a Damas.

71
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,639
Bag. Give me your bag.

72
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,939
How do we load everything?

73
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:46,400
(Taking Dex's large bag)

74
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,080
There's something special
about high-altitude areas.

75
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,509
- It's romantic.
- They load stuff on top of the car. Yes.

76
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,250
One moment.

77
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,919
Everyone seems nice here.

78
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:58,949
Right.

79
00:02:58,949 --> 00:03:01,289
- People look so warm.
- Good.

80
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,250
Gosh. He seems nice.

81
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,030
The air freshener has a nice scent.

82
00:03:07,289 --> 00:03:09,789
I really like the feel of this town.

83
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:11,460
It's totally my style.

84
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:13,330
It's amazing.

85
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,770
(Right away,
he's completely satisfied with Leh.)

86
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,039
Coming here made me feel so calm.

87
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:19,539
Gosh. How cool.

88
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,370
Wait. So...

89
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,340
So where are we going right now?

90
00:03:24,509 --> 00:03:26,740
- We need to go to the travel agency...
- Okay.

91
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,550
and get a permit.

92
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,180
- The city is fine.
- Okay.

93
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,180
But to go out of the city,
we need a special permit.

94
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:36,219
- Okay.
- It's something related to the military.

95
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:37,719
- That's why we need permits.
- Okay.

96
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:39,719
- You can see many military vehicles here.
- Yes.

97
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,689
Let's go to the travel agency
and get our permits first.

98
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:45,430
- After that, the hotel is close.
- Okay.

99
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,370
- I booked a pretty nice quality hotel.
- Nice.

100
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,300
I don't know
whether it's really nice or not.

101
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,599
This is also my first time here.

102
00:03:53,169 --> 00:03:55,509
For now, I don't hear any honking.

103
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,409
People really don't honk their horns here.

104
00:03:57,409 --> 00:03:59,509
Overall, the town was very easygoing.

105
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,949
- There was almost no honking.
- You're right.

106
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,349
Seriously. I'm not lying.

107
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:07,050
I really like the feel of this town.

108
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,289
Dex really likes nature.

109
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,689
It feels extremely refreshing.

110
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:18,600
(Dex's bucket list,
a trip to the Himalayas)

111
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,230
- The nature.
- Nothing is blocking the view.

112
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:22,370
How nice.

113
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:25,899
Coming here made me feel so peaceful.

114
00:04:25,899 --> 00:04:27,709
- It's so romantic and cool.
- Nice.

115
00:04:27,709 --> 00:04:28,810
(Exactly what Dex dreamt of)

116
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,410
I'm so happy.

117
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,439
Also, compared to all of the cities
we've visited so far,

118
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,579
the architecture is different here.

119
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,980
It's as if we came to another country.

120
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,750
- What a cool building.
- Oh, my.

121
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,050
(Different from Varanasi...)

122
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,689
(and Amritsar)

123
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,920
Ladakh used to be part of Tibet,

124
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,230
so there is a lot of Tibetan culture left.

125
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,730
- I see.
- The style of architecture is different.

126
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:52,529
You're right.

127
00:04:53,899 --> 00:04:56,000
If you look closely,
the letters aren't Hindi.

128
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,370
They're Tibetan.

129
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,139
- Oh, Tibetan letters.
- Yes. Tibetan.

130
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,170
(Hindi, Tibetan)

131
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:02,069
Oh, there are motorcycles here.

132
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:04,910
- I want to ride a motorcycle.
- Many people go on motorcycle trips here.

133
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:06,379
Can we ride motorcycles?

134
00:05:06,379 --> 00:05:08,050
- Motorcycle? Okay.
- Oh, nice.

135
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:10,420
- They paved the roads not long ago.
- It's so clean.

136
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,449
I enjoy riding motorcycles.

137
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:13,519
There were...

138
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,319
- so many motorcyclists here. Seriously.
- I see.

139
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,189
- It's almost like a sanctuary.
- It's a sanctuary for motorcyclists.

140
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,490
There is a road that opens
only in the summer.

141
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,860
A lot of people come
from Manali to the city of Leh.

142
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:25,160
It's one of the most famous courses.

143
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,269
- He’s loving it.
- Gosh. This is crazy.

144
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:28,529
Look at this.

145
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,069
(Dex is going crazy
over the motorcycle rental shops.)

146
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,500
These are all motorcycle rental shops.

147
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,240
Do you know what I like
about the motorcycle designs?

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,709
These are all classic motorcycles
in terms of the design.

149
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,779
Oh, my. A motorcycle.

150
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,139
Awesome.

151
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:42,250
I want to buy some clothes in this town.

152
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,579
It's totally my style.

153
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,319
This place sort of has a classic vibe.

154
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:47,290
I think the food will taste good too.

155
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,850
(Chattering on like an excited child)

156
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,860
He seems to like it so much.

157
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,560
I liked it so much.

158
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,990
From that point on, I was so happy.

159
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,500
The scenery was beautiful.

160
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,269
There wasn't much fine dust.
There were no honking sounds.

161
00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:02,329
(Laughing)

162
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:04,839
I fell in love with the city of Leh.

163
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:07,410
I liked the whole vibe.

164
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:09,410
(Heading into the center of Leh
feeling very excited)

165
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,240
- Look at the atmosphere of the city.
- Oh, my. A motorcycle.

166
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,079
(They're all getting excited
at seeing the new city.)

167
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:16,279
It's so beautiful. This is crazy.

168
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:19,149
There's a lot more to see than I expected.

169
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:22,220
Is this it? Here?

170
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,689
The agency is there.

171
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,319
- Thank you.
- Okay.

172
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,959
You need to grab your bag.

173
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:30,660
(Unloading the bag
that romantically rode in with them)

174
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:31,899
Thank you.

175
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,670
(Walking out to the city streets)

176
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,939
This is my favorite city.

177
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,209
This is seriously my favorite city.

178
00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,540
Out of all the places we went to,
this place felt the most foreign.

179
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:47,180
The India Brothers have arrived...

180
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,379
in a city called Leh.

181
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:51,019
It's the largest city in Ladakh.

182
00:06:52,379 --> 00:06:55,889
It's at a high-altitude location,
3,500m above sea level.

183
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:59,120
Because of the snow, the road is closed
for more than half of the year.

184
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,629
It's also called the mystical land
because people can only enter...

185
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,589
when the weather and roads allow it.

186
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,699
- Really?
- I see.

187
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:08,769
(Cold and barren land that only opens
for 3 months in 1 year)

188
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,000
(Because it was isolated for a long time,)

189
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:17,509
(the people here
could live their lives...)

190
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:23,350
(while keeping
their unique culture intact.)

191
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,350
(Leh, Ladakh,
the city where time has stopped)

192
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,889
- It's so peaceful. It's very relaxed.
- Yes.

193
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:29,449
Gentle store.

194
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:31,420
"General store."

195
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,889
A store for daily necessities.

196
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:36,930
This must be it.

197
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:37,959
(Spotting the travel agency)

198
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,259
This is it.

199
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,769
The smell from that moment
is coming back to me.

200
00:07:40,769 --> 00:07:42,430
You can feel the molecules of the oxygen.

201
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,069
Yes. You're exactly right.

202
00:07:44,069 --> 00:07:46,470
You can smell it in Yongsan
through the screen?

203
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,410
Dex definitely has a strong nose.

204
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,680
- I'm sensitive to smell.
- Your nose is sensitive.

205
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,980
- He's very sensitive to smell.
- Yes. My nose is sensitive.

206
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,850
- You have a pretty nose.
- Thank you.

207
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,250
- So random. "You have a pretty nose."
- "You have a pretty nose."

208
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,610
"Thank you."

209
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:59,180
I was looking at him from the side,
and his nose was pretty.

210
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:00,589
The design is also nice.

211
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,750
- The design and performance...
- That's the conclusion?

212
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,160
- are both top level.
- "The design and performance..."

213
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,189
His nose.

214
00:08:05,189 --> 00:08:07,529
You sound like you're buying an IT gadget.

215
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,490
- The design is nice.
- I agree.

216
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,430
- Dex has a very nice nose.
- Seriously.

217
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,529
(They all agree Dex has a nice nose.)

218
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,500
- Hello. Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

219
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,170
We want to get the permit to Leh.

220
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,370
I like the face of Buddha.

221
00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,410
Buddhism must be prevalent here.

222
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,509
This permit is for going outside, right?

223
00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:28,550
Yes. Everywhere you go,
you need permission.

224
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,750
- Okay. Every area.
- Every...

225
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:33,220
You can pay later when the permit is done.

226
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,350
You don't need to pay now.

227
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,149
- Okay.
- Yes, I'll return. Okay.

228
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,889
How much do we each need to pay?

229
00:08:38,889 --> 00:08:40,289
- We're not paying now.
- Okay.

230
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:42,590
- We'll pay later.
- They just want our passports first.

231
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:45,059
- I misunderstood as usual.
- This is simple.

232
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,399
I thought they were asking
for money and our passports.

233
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,100
- That's all we need.
- I see.

234
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,240
What was the name of this town?

235
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,340
- Leh.
- Leh.

236
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,740
In Leh.

237
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:59,539
- Very famous food.
- Restaurant.

238
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,480
How? Name?

239
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,019
He almost said "How there" again.

240
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,179
Very famous...

241
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,250
(Kian84 had a habit
of saying "How there.")

242
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:12,820
(How dare, right side-view mirror?)

243
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,230
(How dare you drive
without a side-view mirror?)

244
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:18,029
(They now suspect
that he's an Indian gangster.)

245
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,899
He said "How name"
because he couldn't say "How there."

246
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,600
"How name." How is the name?

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,830
(Saying "How name" instead of "How there")

248
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,669
- What?
- Thukpa and momo.

249
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,769
- Thukpamo?
- Local food?

250
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,169
- Thukpa and momo.
- Thukpa and momo?

251
00:09:28,169 --> 00:09:29,909
- It looks nice.
- It kind of looks like Korean food.

252
00:09:29,909 --> 00:09:31,210
- It's like Korean food.
- Right.

253
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:34,509
If so, does it have chicken?

254
00:09:34,809 --> 00:09:36,379
- Yes.
- Okay.

255
00:09:36,549 --> 00:09:37,580
I'm happy as long as there is meat.

256
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,480
- They all understand...
- He can communicate.

257
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,289
- his English.
- Of course.

258
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,120
Do you also like chai?

259
00:09:43,419 --> 00:09:44,519
- Chai?
- Tea.

260
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,519
- Tea?
- Tea.

261
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,690
- Okay.
- Okay.

262
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:48,029
You haven't had chai before, right?

263
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:49,090
- Chai?
- Yes.

264
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,360
- She was talking about chai?
- Chai.

265
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,460
- I want to drink green tea.
- Green tea.

266
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,970
- So chai actually means tea.
- I see.

267
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,230
- Please have chai.
- Oh, my.

268
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,740
When they say masala chai,
masala is the seasoning.

269
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:01,470
- Chai is the milk tea.
- Thank you.

270
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,409
It's like coffee.

271
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,840
(The color is similar to coffee.)

272
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:07,610
- It's similar.
- It's pretty nice.

273
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,779
Is the tea good?

274
00:10:11,649 --> 00:10:13,620
- I can kind of smell cinnamon.
- Definitely.

275
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,620
You're right.

276
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,820
It's tea made with something
that has a cinnamon scent.

277
00:10:18,019 --> 00:10:19,389
- Is it okay?
- Is it tasty?

278
00:10:19,389 --> 00:10:20,830
- Is it okay?
- It's good.

279
00:10:21,059 --> 00:10:22,129
Are you okay with cinnamon?

280
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:24,230
It's okay. This is a good amount.

281
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,559
- It was nice.
- I see.

282
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:27,200
I think this place suits me.

283
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,029
- Right.
- Isn't this totally a local-style tea?

284
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:31,799
They sell this in Delhi too.

285
00:10:31,799 --> 00:10:33,799
(They sell this in Delhi too.)

286
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:34,840
They sell this a lot.

287
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,409
(Even in the alleys of Varanasi)

288
00:10:37,409 --> 00:10:39,210
- How did they find that?
- Oh, it said chai there.

289
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:41,580
(Even on the train to Delhi)

290
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
(Chai)

291
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,809
- Right.
- Right.

292
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,980
- It's generally tasty.
- I was biased.

293
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:47,789
(Sipping the tea)

294
00:10:48,289 --> 00:10:49,389
(Sipping)

295
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,190
Bottoms up.

296
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,730
I became more open-minded
when I was in Leh.

297
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,230
- You liked everything about Leh.
- Yes.

298
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,259
I see.

299
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,830
I'm happy to see Dex enjoy that.

300
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,100
- Seriously.
- I think that was the first thing...

301
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,100
I finished in India.

302
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:04,639
So you can come after 5 p.m.

303
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,639
Today?

304
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,340
- The permit...
- Can you not get the permits right away?

305
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,669
- Yes.
- Let's go for now.

306
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,009
- See you.
- See you.

307
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,279
- Bye.
- Okay, see you.

308
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,409
- Come back today.
- Okay.

309
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,580
- What is that?
- Was that lynx what we call a "sirasoni?"

310
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,480
- Is that the name of the animal?
- It looks like a snow leopard.

311
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,620
A lynx is a type of tiger, right?

312
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,320
- A relative.
- In the cat family.

313
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,519
- An ugly cat.
- I just thought it was a person's name.

314
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,690
- Sirasoni?
- From "The Wild Days?"

315
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,720
Did you think it was a person's name?

316
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,659
- I am...
- Sirasoni.

317
00:11:27,889 --> 00:11:29,629
(I am a snow leopard.)

318
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:33,330
Seeing a shopping mall right away
makes me want to buy things.

319
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,629
- Let's take a quick look.
- I absolutely loved...

320
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:37,600
the wool jacket I saw earlier.

321
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,139
I don't like things like this.

322
00:11:39,139 --> 00:11:41,169
I like this. Isn't it so pretty?

323
00:11:41,169 --> 00:11:42,639
- Oh, my. Pani Bottle!
- Something like this.

324
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,580
That suits you so well.

325
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,539
Seriously. I liked it as soon as I saw it.

326
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,649
Oh, my goodness.

327
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,409
- I'm going to buy this.
- This really suits you.

328
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,120
- It's like they put it here for me.
- Right.

329
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:54,419
This feels like a vintage store in Korea.

330
00:11:54,419 --> 00:11:56,419
- Seriously.
- I'm going crazy here. What do I do?

331
00:11:56,419 --> 00:11:57,889
I can't help it.
I need to buy some clothes.

332
00:11:58,159 --> 00:11:59,860
Gosh. My desire for fashion...

333
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,429
- is coming back to life.
- Look at this one.

334
00:12:02,429 --> 00:12:03,429
- Oh, "Fashion King."
- "Fashion King."

335
00:12:03,429 --> 00:12:05,159
I quit fashion for a while.

336
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:06,860
What about this one?

337
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:09,500
(Putting his bag to the side)

338
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,139
Let's go in.

339
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,500
(Entering the clothing store)

340
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:16,110
Why is my jacket hanging here?

341
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,340
I'll buy it right away.

342
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:20,009
Hello.

343
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:23,809
How can I say hello here?

344
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,350
Tashi delek.

345
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,049
- Tashi delek. Like Bhutan.
- Tashi delek.

346
00:12:28,049 --> 00:12:29,690
- What's your name?
- Denzin.

347
00:12:29,889 --> 00:12:30,990
- Denzin?
- Denzin.

348
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,460
What's your name?

349
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,919
- My name is Pani.
- Pani?

350
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,059
- Yes, Pani.
- Pani.

351
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,789
- Bugs Bunny?
- Pani Bottle.

352
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,259
- Pani Bottle?
- Yes.

353
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,029
(Glancing over)

354
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:43,029
He's famous, right?

355
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,970
- What?
- He's similar to someone on Netflix.

356
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,139
- Are you?
- Oh, you...

357
00:12:48,139 --> 00:12:49,870
Is someone living in a place
3,500m above sea level...

358
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,210
- recognizing you right now?
- Yes.

359
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,309
I was surprised.

360
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:54,149
Are you on Netflix?

361
00:12:54,309 --> 00:12:56,750
What TV show did you watch?

362
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,679
There are many girls and boys.

363
00:12:59,919 --> 00:13:01,350
- Yes!
- That is insane.

364
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,549
- That's him. Yes!
- Oh, my.

365
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,389
(This is the last time
we'll use this clip.)

366
00:13:04,389 --> 00:13:05,690
Let's stop watching that. Please!

367
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,159
Please play something else.

368
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,289
- Something else.
- How many times...

369
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,289
are you grabbing that flag?

370
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,629
I'm so sick of that.

371
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,700
How many times are we watching
that and the slow motion part?

372
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,330
(We watched it 6 times.)

373
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,929
Yes! Correct!

374
00:13:16,269 --> 00:13:17,269
Okay!

375
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:20,470
- You even blew up in the Himalayas.
- That's him.

376
00:13:20,669 --> 00:13:22,139
What was the English title?

377
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,269
- Hell...
- "Single's Inferno."

378
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,039
- "Single's Inferno."
- Yes.

379
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:28,409
Oh, the title wasn't "Solo Hell?"

380
00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:30,110
- "Solo Hell."
- I thought that was it too.

381
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,750
Even if it's a bit thin,

382
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,919
I can't give up on style.

383
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,720
- This is cute.
- Why is my jacket hanging here?

384
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:41,629
I like this navy color.

385
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,460
(Trying it on without hesitation)

386
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:46,429
This is exactly my style.

387
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,070
- It suits you.
- It does.

388
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,269
Something like this. I like navy.
It's a bit dandy.

389
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:51,870
I served as a police officer
during my military service.

390
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,970
- I see.
- That's why I like colors like this.

391
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,139
- What is that?
- Me from 20 years ago.

392
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,879
All of the clothes here are my style.

393
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,779
- That place is a gold mine.
- Oh, my.

394
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,909
I want this shirt as well.

395
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,179
- It's a bit like Dongmyo.
- Right.

396
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:05,350
(Kian84 showed off his love for corduroy
during his South America trip.)

397
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,820
(If you wear it,
it's a piece of clothing.)

398
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,519
(if you lie down, it's a blanket.)

399
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,620
(Sometimes, it can become a towel.)

400
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,460
(Wiping)

401
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:18,100
(Sometimes, it's a camera lens cleaner.)

402
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:20,460
That jacket is so worn out.

403
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,600
(Kian84's favorite jacket)

404
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,200
Okay. This is my style.

405
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,769
- Is that corduroy?
- Yes.

406
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,200
Right. I should try this on.

407
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,309
Wait. This is too big.

408
00:14:30,539 --> 00:14:31,980
That's very good.

409
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:34,879
Jacket. A classic jacket.

410
00:14:35,649 --> 00:14:37,049
What do you think? It's too big, right?

411
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,679
- This? It's nice.
- This is...

412
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,919
- It's just right.
- exactly my style.

413
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,590
- Even though it's big, it works, right?
- Yes.

414
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,220
- A boxy fit.
- Right.

415
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,590
It's warm.

416
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,860
This. I picked something.

417
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,860
Me too.

418
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,129
- Right.
- That's it.

419
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,860
- That was it.
- That's it.

420
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,559
- Our interview outfit.
- I'm getting these two.

421
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,600
Two?

422
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,629
You're having so much fun shopping.

423
00:14:54,629 --> 00:14:56,230
At night, it becomes very cold.

424
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:58,269
- It gets cold?
- Where we will be going will be cold.

425
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,940
(Mr. Himalayan Catfish
is still trying things on.)

426
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,509
Everything looks good.

427
00:15:03,509 --> 00:15:04,610
- What do you think?
- Yes.

428
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,779
How about this style?

429
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:10,149
Why are you playing it in slow motion?
What is this?

430
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,379
Very good.

431
00:15:12,019 --> 00:15:13,850
We should go with matching jackets, then.

432
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,149
Mine is kind of like this.

433
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,789
- Okay. I'll choose this.
- Okay.

434
00:15:16,789 --> 00:15:17,820
- Thank you.
- Okay.

435
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,059
- That's all.
- Good.

436
00:15:19,059 --> 00:15:21,159
One, two, three, four items.

437
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,190
Okay. Here.

438
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:23,389
- How much is it?
- We need to get started, right?

439
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:25,330
- Yes. It's time to haggle.
- This is the main game.

440
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,330
- The main game.
- I say...

441
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,000
it's 2,600 per item.

442
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'll make it 2,000. Good?

443
00:15:30,169 --> 00:15:31,399
- It's 2,000?
- Big discount.

444
00:15:31,669 --> 00:15:34,070
How about 1,800?

445
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,970
- It's very low.
- We bought a lot.

446
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,679
It's very low, my friend.

447
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,840
Local people pay more than this.

448
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:42,450
Okay. Let's do 1,900.

449
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:45,149
It's only 100 rupees. Two.

450
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,549
- Two?
- Should we just go with it?

451
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,120
I think that's pretty good.
Let's go with it.

452
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,620
- Okay?
- Let's end with a smile.

453
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,019
- Okay.
- Two is okay.

454
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:52,490
- Okay.
- Ending it while everyone is smiling.

455
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,519
- Of course.
- Right.

456
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,759
See you. I hope for your happy luck.

457
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:58,100
That was an impressive sentence.

458
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,700
Nice meeting you all.

459
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,629
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you so much.

460
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:03,700
Selfie time?

461
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:06,139
He offered to take a picture together.

462
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,539
- Yes.
- He's kind to his fans.

463
00:16:07,539 --> 00:16:08,539
Thank you so much.

464
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:09,940
- Come closer.
- More?

465
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,039
(Putting his arm around Dex)

466
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,610
- That's very nice.
- Oh, my.

467
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,879
That was nice to do for your fan.

468
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:15,179
He looks so proud.

469
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:17,009
Thank you so much. Bye.

470
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:18,250
- See you again.
- Take care.

471
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:19,350
See you again.

472
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,190
- Where did Kian84 go?
- He disappeared.

473
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,159
Where did he go?

474
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:28,659
(Shopping for hats in the store next door)

475
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:30,789
- He went to the store right below.
- There was another store below.

476
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,799
Yes.

477
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,860
It's small.

478
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,629
CEO? I have a big head.

479
00:16:35,629 --> 00:16:36,629
CEO.

480
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,200
- CEO?
- Oh, CEO.

481
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,870
This is big.

482
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,169
(Trying on the big hat
that was recommended to him)

483
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,809
This is also small.

484
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,279
(Pulling it off)

485
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:49,409
Did I put it on backward?

486
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,179
Even if I put it on the other way...

487
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,019
(Let's see.)

488
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,120
Excuse me? It's small.

489
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,159
Yes. I'm very big.

490
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,759
(How about this one?)

491
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,960
- They have something like this?
- Big size.

492
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,200
Oh, thank you.

493
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,500
Oh, very nice.

494
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,529
Gosh. Why is my head so big?

495
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,240
(The pressing cheers
telling him to buy it quickly)

496
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Wait.

497
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,569
(It's nice, but this one is also small.)

498
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,410
How much is the total?

499
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,410
The total?

500
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,980
You didn't pick the hats
based on the design.

501
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,210
You're buying
whatever hat is in your size.

502
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,910
Since the size wasn't right,
I had no options.

503
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:24,279
- It's 250.
- It's 250?

504
00:17:24,549 --> 00:17:26,180
This is 550.

505
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,319
(The hat is 250 rupees.
The gloves are 550 rupees.)

506
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,420
(It's a bit expensive.)

507
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,789
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse me."

508
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:32,819
"Excuse me."

509
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:34,220
(What are you going to do?)

510
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:36,660
Discount?

511
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,529
This is your first attempt at haggling.

512
00:17:39,529 --> 00:17:41,599
(If the taxi driver doesn't have change,)

513
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,130
(Kian84 leaves it as a tip.)

514
00:17:43,769 --> 00:17:45,039
(Whatever price they ask for,)

515
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,369
(Kian84 pays it.)

516
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,240
(He opened his wallet for peace.)

517
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,309
(The open-minded buyer)

518
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,539
Discount?

519
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:54,509
(His first haggling attempt?)

520
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,150
- It's a good price.
- Okay.

521
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,519
- Is it over?
- Haggling is over.

522
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:01,720
(It was a nice try,
but he failed at haggling.)

523
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,490
- Here.
- It's important that you tried.

524
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,619
Thank you. I hope you sell a lot.

525
00:18:08,289 --> 00:18:11,299
Where did he go without his bag again?
There you are.

526
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:14,200
I bought gloves and a hat.

527
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,630
- It will be cold.
- You need gloves and a hat.

528
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:19,700
And I can use these back in Korea.

529
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,039
Gosh, I hate having to
carry so much stuff.

530
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,210
(He stuffs the gear in his bag.)

531
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:27,849
Gosh, it won't even close.

532
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:28,849
(Grunting)

533
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,079
- That suits you.
- What?

534
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,720
- Of course.
- You can really pull off anything.

535
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,990
I know
how I'm going to match everything...

536
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:38,960
- in my head.
- I guess you do.

537
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,160
He's the fashion king.

538
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,160
- If only you could wash them regularly...
- Sure.

539
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,329
Then it would be...

540
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,900
I do wash them regularly.

541
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,759
It's just that
I wait to do them all at once.

542
00:18:48,529 --> 00:18:50,099
- The cycle takes too long.
- It's not like...

543
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:53,069
I don't wear rotten clothes.

544
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,670
The clothes you had on
when we did the dishes did rot.

545
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,339
That did rot.

546
00:18:57,339 --> 00:18:58,509
(I agree.)

547
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,180
How is this?

548
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:02,579
It's cute.

549
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:05,680
I was going to get that,
but it didn't fit my head.

550
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,579
(I was going to get that,
but it didn't fit my head.)

551
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:11,160
- The color of the fur is crisp.
- Yes.

552
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,819
Let's go with that,
it's really cute and nice.

553
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:13,990
- Yes.
- Really? Okay.

554
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,259
Don't you need gloves?

555
00:19:16,259 --> 00:19:17,460
- Gloves.
- Gloves?

556
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,859
- You don't have gloves.
- I can go like this.

557
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:20,559
That's...

558
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,200
I was acting so cheeky.

559
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,470
(In his sleeves)

560
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,000
- Okay, then.
- I will buy some later if I need to.

561
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,799
- Okay.
- I spent too much.

562
00:19:28,269 --> 00:19:29,740
(What is that?)

563
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,839
Hey, that...

564
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,539
The shuttle bus of Lehdakh students.

565
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:35,079
(Beep)

566
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,710
Bye. Hello.

567
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,250
(Bye)

568
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:42,019
The future of Lehdakh.
The children of Lehdakh.

569
00:19:42,589 --> 00:19:45,319
He combined Leh and Ladakh
and called it Lehdakh.

570
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,490
It's fun to go shopping.

571
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:51,160
- And I like the clothes.
- Yes.

572
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,529
It's fun since the clothes are nice.

573
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:55,299
I'm not just buying anything
because of the cold weather.

574
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:56,630
I really like them.

575
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:58,799
They are happy there.

576
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,910
"I love Leh."

577
00:20:04,210 --> 00:20:05,339
Lehdakh.

578
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:08,710
- It's Leh in Ladakh.
- Leh, Ladakh.

579
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,779
Leh inside Ladakh.

580
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,019
Oh, Ladakh inside Leh?

581
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,619
No, the other way around.

582
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:15,950
Leh inside Ladakh.

583
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,650
It must be due to altitude sickness.

584
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,119
You only need to remember Leh.

585
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,990
But you said the city was Leh.

586
00:20:21,089 --> 00:20:22,559
Do you think this suits me?

587
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,660
- In the midst of that.
- I wasn't done shopping.

588
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,559
(How do I look?)

589
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,900
I don't know.

590
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:31,230
That's a mismatch.

591
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,299
- Right?
- It kills the color.

592
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:34,809
- Good job.
- He's so cold.

593
00:20:34,809 --> 00:20:37,769
Dex is weak with colors
when it comes to fashion.

594
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:38,910
(A cutting remark)

595
00:20:39,609 --> 00:20:42,410
I should style his clothes for him.

596
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:43,710
He's the fashion king.

597
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:47,049
- Good-looking guys don't know.
- Yes.

598
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:48,819
- They just wear anything.
- It's okay for them.

599
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:51,019
- What are you saying?
- Because...

600
00:20:51,019 --> 00:20:53,019
Hey! What are you saying?

601
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:54,960
- Go ahead and pick.
- I can hear you.

602
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:58,359
Dex has gotten into shopping.

603
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,329
(How is this?)

604
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,430
That's good.

605
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,529
- This is better.
- This?

606
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,400
They contrast each other. It stands out.

607
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:07,000
- Is this the best one? Okay.
- Yes.

608
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,609
I trust Kian84 when it comes to fashion.

609
00:21:09,609 --> 00:21:11,170
He has good taste.

610
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,650
The fact that I was styling...

611
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,309
Dex and Pani Bottle...

612
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,750
The fact that they were listening to me
made me feel bad.

613
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,650
I had no right to give them advice.

614
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,819
- You were like Stylist Jung Yoon Ki.
- Yes.

615
00:21:24,819 --> 00:21:26,890
- Like a master of fashion.
- Yes.

616
00:21:26,890 --> 00:21:29,589
(The master of fashion, Kian84)

617
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Dex is too into military fashion,

618
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,430
so he doesn't know how to wear
casual clothes.

619
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:38,769
What would handsome guys know?

620
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,569
You should have gotten some advice too.

621
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,039
What's wrong with me?

622
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,009
Your clothes are making my eyes hurt.

623
00:21:45,009 --> 00:21:46,940
There are three patterns in your outfit.

624
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,980
It hurts.

625
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:51,980
Since I styled his clothes,

626
00:21:52,349 --> 00:21:54,019
he's going to be even more popular.

627
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,890
(He is already popular.)

628
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,650
- They are going crazy.
- Even inside there?

629
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,220
The word got around quickly.

630
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,430
- They like Dex.
- Yes.

631
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:02,529
(I want a picture too.)

632
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:03,829
Thank you.

633
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,329
Thank you.

634
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:07,259
Okay, I'm done.

635
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,500
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

636
00:22:10,029 --> 00:22:11,940
I have more...

637
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,700
Dex has more stuff now.

638
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,940
Yes, I didn't have any more room
in my backpack,

639
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:17,410
so I had to carry it in my hand.

640
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,609
(Carrying so many things)

641
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,410
Gosh, the scenery is so amazing.

642
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,680
The city and the snow.

643
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,849
It's unbelievable.

644
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,789
It's like Switzerland.

645
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:31,190
Yes, it's like Switzerland.

646
00:22:32,119 --> 00:22:34,289
The mountains and sky are like paintings.

647
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:35,589
- Yes.
- It's nice.

648
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:37,460
It's so nice here.

649
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,960
(They arrived at their hotel.)

650
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,700
The hotel has a traditional style.

651
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

652
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:47,539
(They each get a white cloth.)

653
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,569
I feel like an honored guest.

654
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,539
- Thank you.
- Namaste.

655
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,579
Hello.

656
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,750
That is a khatag.

657
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,279
It's a white scarf Tibetans give
to welcome you.

658
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,420
Hello, we have a reservation today.

659
00:23:02,619 --> 00:23:07,359
But our passport is with
our travel company.

660
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:11,259
They're keeping passports to make permits.

661
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,869
And later, we will give you our passports.

662
00:23:15,869 --> 00:23:18,769
(Unable to say anything)

663
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,269
Actually, we don't have a triple room.

664
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,509
- Yes, three beds.
- We will just give you...

665
00:23:22,509 --> 00:23:23,970
We will give you a double room,

666
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:27,009
and for one person,
we will put an extra bed.

667
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:29,109
Okay, no problem.

668
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,309
Thank you.

669
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:31,309
(They express their gratitude well.)

670
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,650
- Let's eat a lot.
- Okay.

671
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:34,990
It's here.

672
00:23:34,990 --> 00:23:37,589
(It opens with a card key.)

673
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:40,559
Oh, it has the latest card system.

674
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:41,990
(How is the room condition?)

675
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:44,059
- How will it be?
- Let's see.

676
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:48,059
- Why is it so nice?
- What?

677
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,200
What?

678
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,700
- Gosh, it's nice.
- Yes.

679
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,039
(They see the living room
with the extra bed first.)

680
00:23:52,369 --> 00:23:54,039
It's so nice.

681
00:23:55,369 --> 00:23:56,940
There's more inside.

682
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,009
- What?
- Gosh, it's nice.

683
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:02,549
There are two rooms.

684
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:05,450
It's a suite room.

685
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,819
Gosh, this is crazy.

686
00:24:07,819 --> 00:24:10,519
- Hey, Kian84! Look at the view.
- Yes?

687
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,019
- The view?
- It's crazy.

688
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,930
Do you see the castle?

689
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:17,529
- The castle.
- Is that a castle?

690
00:24:17,529 --> 00:24:18,730
(The old castle and the mountains
surrounding the city)

691
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:20,829
- Isn't that an observatory?
- Over there.

692
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,069
"An observatory?"

693
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,130
The one on top is the Buddhist...

694
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,369
It's the Buddhist Gompa.

695
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:29,609
It's a temple and monastery.

696
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:32,539
The one on top is a palace.

697
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,009
Then does the king live there?

698
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,849
Probably in the past.
I'm not sure about it now.

699
00:24:36,849 --> 00:24:38,880
(The old Ladakh palace is known
for its great view.)

700
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,920
Isn't the view amazing?

701
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,420
Isn't the king's place too high up?

702
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,420
The snowy mountain.

703
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,190
It's too far for him to get to
a convenience store.

704
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,759
He can't live in a semi-basement, though.

705
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,430
- Yes, but...
- I don't know if there is a king now.

706
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:54,200
This is my favorite hotel.

707
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,630
You two sleep here.

708
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,400
- There's one there.
- I like those beds.

709
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,769
They're being...

710
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:01,470
- considerate again.
- Yes.

711
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:02,609
- Over there?
- Yes.

712
00:25:02,609 --> 00:25:04,009
That separate room there?

713
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:05,579
I actually also like having my own room.

714
00:25:05,779 --> 00:25:06,779
What?

715
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,779
I really like being alone.

716
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:12,720
I actually wanted that separate room.

717
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,490
(The cot in the separate room
versus the comfy bed in the twin room)

718
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,690
- You two figure it out.
- Yes.

719
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,460
But I have something to say.

720
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,630
When you two sleep...

721
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,890
(When we sleep?)

722
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:26,200
You both talk in your sleep,
so it's a bit scary.

723
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,930
Really?

724
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:29,769
Please, let me sleep on my own.

725
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,099
Dex also talks in his sleep?

726
00:25:31,099 --> 00:25:33,000
I scream when I sleep.

727
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,910
Dex did talk in his sleep.

728
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,839
He said, "You're out of discipline."

729
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,809
- In his sleep?
- Yes, he really did.

730
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,410
He talked in his sleep twice,
and that's what he said once.

731
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,480
The other one was "At ease."

732
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,710
- Really?
- Yes.

733
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:43,880
I was so scared.

734
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,519
It's horrible to dream of going back
to the military whenever you sleep.

735
00:25:46,519 --> 00:25:47,779
Even his soul is in the UDT.

736
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:49,819
I must have been so tired
that it reminded me of those days.

737
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:50,890
The trip was so hard.

738
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:51,890
(The trip was so exhausting
that it reminded him of the UDT.)

739
00:25:52,059 --> 00:25:54,289
You both talk in your sleep,
so it's a bit scary.

740
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,960
Really? Okay, then. You can go there.

741
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,400
- Okay, you can go.
- Please, let me sleep on my own.

742
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,000
- Okay.
- Then I will go there.

743
00:26:03,569 --> 00:26:04,730
Does the Wi-Fi work?

744
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,339
- Over there.
- It's 2472.

745
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:07,400
(He understands right away.)

746
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,710
Password.

747
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,339
The Internet was working,

748
00:26:10,339 --> 00:26:12,109
but our cell service provider didn't work.

749
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,279
Each city was different.

750
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:16,650
My plan is...

751
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,180
We have some things to do,

752
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,480
but we can't do everything together.

753
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,819
- It will take too long.
- It takes too long.

754
00:26:21,819 --> 00:26:22,849
Yes.

755
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,789
You two should get the camping gear
and sleeping bags,

756
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:26,420
since we will have to camp soon.

757
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,190
- And I will get the permit...
- Okay.

758
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:29,359
and search for car rentals.

759
00:26:29,359 --> 00:26:31,160
- Are you dividing the tasks?
- Yes.

760
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,430
They have a plan,
so everything is working out.

761
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,829
- Yes.
- We were at a high altitude,

762
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:38,269
and we couldn't waste time,
so we separated our tasks.

763
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,740
Pani Bottle looks like
he's in the best shape.

764
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,309
- Until now?
- Yes.

765
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:46,009
I'm okay up to 3,000m.

766
00:26:46,009 --> 00:26:47,480
- Is it okay?
- I can take it.

767
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,279
How should we eat dinner?

768
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,380
We can't contact each other.

769
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,750
Should we choose a place to meet up?

770
00:26:53,349 --> 00:26:56,690
Did you see the "I love Delhi" sign?

771
00:26:56,690 --> 00:26:58,589
(I love Leh)

772
00:26:58,589 --> 00:27:00,059
Let's meet up at 7:10 p.m.

773
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,930
- In front of the sign.
- Okay.

774
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,099
Like those times
before we had smartphones...

775
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,660
- Yes, we met in front of landmarks.
- At a certain time.

776
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:07,759
Yes.

777
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:10,930
Something like,
"I will wait there with an umbrella."

778
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:13,170
- That's so loving.
- How romantic.

779
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,910
- I will be wearing this.
- Yes.

780
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,440
It felt different.

781
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,440
(Distant, reminded of the romantic days)

782
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,539
I will go to that place...

783
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,509
and get...

784
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,420
our permits,

785
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,079
rent a car,

786
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,549
and what else was there?

787
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,150
Anyway.

788
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,460
On my way here...

789
00:27:34,289 --> 00:27:35,359
(Breathing heavily)

790
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:36,460
Goodness.

791
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,529
Oh, no.

792
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,130
Gosh, I'm out of breath.

793
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,500
(Panting)

794
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,200
(Panting)

795
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,900
(He has a hard time breathing.)

796
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,500
(Panting)

797
00:27:49,509 --> 00:27:52,109
I don't get altitude sickness,

798
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,210
but I do feel out of breath.

799
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,049
- It's hard.
- That's what altitude sickness is.

800
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,319
What is he saying?

801
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,980
(Panting)

802
00:28:01,849 --> 00:28:04,019
Gosh, my throat hurts.

803
00:28:04,019 --> 00:28:07,119
(The tough battle against
altitude sickness begins.)

804
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,329
(Kian84 and Dex leave the hotel.)

805
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,859
- We don't have much time right now.
- Okay.

806
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:15,200
(They are wearing the same clothes.)

807
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,200
We're going to meet up with Pani Bottle...

808
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,769
by the "I love Leh" statue...

809
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:22,339
- The statue.
- by 7:10 p.m.

810
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:26,410
- Okay.
- So I looked up the route.

811
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,009
We should go to
the camping gear store first,

812
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,279
- and then move up...
- Okay.

813
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,920
- to do the other things we can.
- Okay. By 7:10 p.m.

814
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:38,049
I'm not much of a planner,

815
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:41,059
but we are both spontaneous,
so we needed someone to plan.

816
00:28:41,059 --> 00:28:43,490
- That's why.
- I was comfortable with that.

817
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,930
I think that's why older people
go on guided tours.

818
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,029
- Package tours?
- Yes, package tours.

819
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:49,069
(Paying for comfort)

820
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:51,839
(Amazed)

821
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,000
Gosh, the scenery.

822
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,240
- It looks like CGI.
- Yes.

823
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,309
- Gosh.
- It's amazing.

824
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,380
I didn't know
such a place existed in India.

825
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,480
Yes.

826
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,180
It looks like the Alps.

827
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:09,720
I think it's my first time
to call something beautiful here.

828
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,920
Varanasi and New Delhi...

829
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,490
was a bit different and unique,

830
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,289
but this is just nice.

831
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:19,960
This is traveling.

832
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,559
We were training back there.

833
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:25,200
Will there also be penance?

834
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,339
- There will.
- The rhyme is nice.

835
00:29:27,339 --> 00:29:28,539
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

836
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:30,910
- Hello.
- Tashi delek.

837
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,680
(He came to get the permits.)

838
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,740
So...

839
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,180
Our permits are ready, right?

840
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:37,950
Yes, this is your permit.

841
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:39,079
Okay.

842
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:42,319
We made enough copies. Three copies.

843
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,160
So you can go with this permit.

844
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,920
Wherever you want to go, you can go.

845
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,029
So will they confirm this paper?

846
00:29:49,029 --> 00:29:50,089
- Yes.
- When we go there?

847
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,000
There are checkpoints everywhere.

848
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:53,859
They check for them.

849
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:56,269
We could feel that
it's a military zone because of this.

850
00:29:56,269 --> 00:29:57,299
Yes.

851
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:58,670
So, how much is it?

852
00:29:58,670 --> 00:30:00,200
It's 600 per person.

853
00:30:01,339 --> 00:30:03,440
(Travel permits, 600 rupees per person,
total 1,800 rupees)

854
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,710
- Thank you.
- Okay.

855
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,140
And...

856
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,150
I want to rent a car.

857
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,750
You will rent a car there?

858
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,450
Ladakh is a really big
and mountainous area,

859
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,549
so they don't have
good public transportation...

860
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,319
or a convenient bus system.

861
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:20,460
We need to rent a car.

862
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,529
- Okay.
- Maybe 1 or 2 days.

863
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:24,930
Okay, which car do you want?

864
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:26,730
Not the newest one.

865
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,529
We need something that is not bad.

866
00:30:29,529 --> 00:30:33,569
And do all cars have four-wheel...

867
00:30:33,569 --> 00:30:34,700
What do I call that?

868
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,509
The roads can be unpaved,

869
00:30:37,809 --> 00:30:39,880
so we needed a four-wheel-drive car.

870
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,539
I couldn't remember what to call it.

871
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,019
Four wheels or only two wheels?

872
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:48,250
I don't understand.

873
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,650
Okay.

874
00:30:50,089 --> 00:30:51,220
Wheels.

875
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,789
Like this or...

876
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:55,160
Are you playing charades?

877
00:30:55,789 --> 00:30:57,529
I got it! Orangutan.

878
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,799
- Is this "Family Entertainment?"
- I know.

879
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:04,400
(He plays "Family Entertainment"
since he can't talk.)

880
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,470
Like this?

881
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,500
Yes, it's like this.

882
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:11,210
- Four.
- A four-wheel?

883
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:12,440
Okay.

884
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,880
I'm tired.

885
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,450
(He succeeds in communicating
with his body.)

886
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,720
Why am I so tired?

887
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,150
Can I stay here...

888
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,519
for maybe 20 minutes?

889
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,789
Yes, please.

890
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:27,519
You're resting for 20 minutes for that?

891
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,859
- Hey, just go to a hospital.
- No, I...

892
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,529
I was so tired.

893
00:31:32,529 --> 00:31:34,000
(Darned mountains...)

894
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,099
- Okay.
- Let's go.

895
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
- Now...
- If we go up here,

896
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,769
- we'll see the camping gear shop.
- Camping gear shop.

897
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,809
This is it.

898
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:46,440
It looks so fun.

899
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,849
- Hello.
- This is Dex's...

900
00:31:48,849 --> 00:31:49,849
Yes.

901
00:31:49,849 --> 00:31:51,109
- This was on my bucket list.
- Bucket.

902
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,619
Camping in front of the Himalayas.

903
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:56,390
Dex looked really excited.

904
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,690
He must have had a dream...

905
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:00,789
about camping in the wild.

906
00:32:00,789 --> 00:32:02,289
(He wanted to camp in the snow.)

907
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,359
That's amazing.

908
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,759
I wanted to go along with
what the other guys wanted to do.

909
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:08,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

910
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:09,930
Okay.

911
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,799
We need... Tomorrow,

912
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:16,039
we will go up a high-level mountain.
Maybe 4,000m?

913
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,009
- Okay.
- We need a very warm tent.

914
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:21,509
- Please show me.
- Will it be cold?

915
00:32:22,109 --> 00:32:23,509
- Is it one-touch?
- "One-touch?"

916
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:25,210
Don't you have a one-touch tent?

917
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,079
- Easy tent?
- No, that will break.

918
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,150
That will break.

919
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:30,819
(Easy is the best.)

920
00:32:31,589 --> 00:32:33,490
Putting up the tent takes a lot of energy.

921
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,490
You're right.

922
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,930
That isn't for camping in these regions.

923
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,890
Really? Okay.

924
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

925
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,599
- This is a four-season tent.
- Four-seasons? Okay.

926
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:44,029
This tent goes up to 6,000m.

927
00:32:44,029 --> 00:32:46,170
Okay, 6,000?

928
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,339
- Up to 6,000m.
- Okay.

929
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:51,509
Are those dogs sleeping there?

930
00:32:51,509 --> 00:32:53,009
- They were dogs?
- That surprised me.

931
00:32:53,009 --> 00:32:54,279
- There are dogs.
- Yes.

932
00:32:54,279 --> 00:32:55,809
- On the sofa.
- They are alive, right?

933
00:32:55,809 --> 00:32:57,279
How cute. And in the same position.

934
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,279
Okay.

935
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:59,750
Are they brothers?

936
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:01,049
(Sleeping well)

937
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,990
How cute.

938
00:33:04,789 --> 00:33:06,690
Look at the feet.

939
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:09,160
- Aren't the dogs so gentle?
- Very.

940
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:12,299
You need to shed your coat, buddy.

941
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,960
You should ask your owner
to give you a brushing.

942
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:19,769
They live in the cold,

943
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:22,109
so they have a double coat.

944
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:24,240
(The dogs in Varanasi had short hair.)

945
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,039
- You're right.
- You're right.

946
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,240
They have a short haircut.

947
00:33:28,849 --> 00:33:30,210
They have long hair.

948
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,279
And we want...

949
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,519
(Slipping)

950
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,960
- Sleeping bag?
- Sleeping bag.

951
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,589
- Yes.
- Yes, I'll give it to you.

952
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,990
Warm style.

953
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:43,990
- Warm ones?
- Yes.

954
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:45,359
This sleeping bag.

955
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,500
He recommended gear that can be used...

956
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,200
up to 6,000m above sea level.

957
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,369
We would have frozen to death
without that.

958
00:33:50,369 --> 00:33:51,900
You really need that.

959
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:55,410
Which month's temperature is that like,
compared to Korea?

960
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:57,309
It's like December in Korea.

961
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,740
But it's much colder than that
during the night.

962
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,279
It's just like...

963
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,950
- cold weather training.
- Yes.

964
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:06,819
Double layers?

965
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:08,420
(Double layers in case of cold weather)

966
00:34:09,019 --> 00:34:10,789
- Do you like this?
- It must be hot.

967
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,190
Okay, three mats.

968
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,789
- Okay, three.
- If you put it this way...

969
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,090
- Chair.
- Chair.

970
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,190
Three chairs.

971
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,059
And this too.

972
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,500
(Chairs and a doubled-ended
pickax and shovel)

973
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,659
You can't help but buy these things.

974
00:34:22,329 --> 00:34:24,530
He knows how to check the gear...

975
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,300
since he likes camping.

976
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,239
I was taking them
to tick off my own bucket list,

977
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:31,510
so I tried my best to minimize...

978
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,539
the inconveniences for them.

979
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:35,110
- Okay.
- I like that.

980
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,210
(Loving it)

981
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,750
Dex is excited here.

982
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,489
Okay, master. I have one question.

983
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:46,159
What is the best camping site here?

984
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,190
- We didn't decide where to camp yet,
- The camping area...

985
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,530
- so I asked the expert to recommend.
- There is a pretty...

986
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,030
Just nearby.

987
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,429
Chumathang

988
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:56,469
- "Chumathang?"
- There is Puga.

989
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,329
- "Puga?"
- Puga.

990
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,139
- Puga.
- Puga is a good place.

991
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:02,070
- Puga?
- Puga is a good place.

992
00:35:02,070 --> 00:35:03,769
- He recommends Puga.
- It's a small town.

993
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:05,309
- Puga is nice?
- It's very nice.

994
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,380
- Puga is nice.
- Puga is good.

995
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,579
- Puga is like...
- Very quiet.

996
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:11,010
Normal people are staying there.

997
00:35:11,349 --> 00:35:13,250
Let's go to Puga.

998
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,550
Puga is a good place.

999
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,949
Okay. Thank you, sir.

1000
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,650
Okay, master.

1001
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,820
(They chose their camp site.)

1002
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,260
Gosh.

1003
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:22,289
So we will pack everything.

1004
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,260
- Okay.
- We will deliver it to your hotel.

1005
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,329
- Okay.
- The service is amazing.

1006
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:28,460
Okay, thank you so much.

1007
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,730
Take care.

1008
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,000
- Thank you, sir.
- They were so kind.

1009
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,130
Good luck with camping.

1010
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:34,900
Pani Bottle said to meet him
at 7:30 p.m...

1011
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,440
- or 7:10 p.m.
- It was 7:10 p.m.

1012
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,639
Where did he say it was?

1013
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,380
By the...

1014
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:41,480
- "I love Leh."
- We have to be on time.

1015
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,650
It's the old method.

1016
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:43,849
- Yes, like our dads' generation.
- That's right.

1017
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,980
It's getting colder.

1018
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:50,820
It must be really cold at night,
seeing how they gave us...

1019
00:35:51,389 --> 00:35:53,690
- two-layer sleeping bags.
- It must be really cold.

1020
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,719
Yes.

1021
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,159
We're here.

1022
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:57,760
(They arrived at the statue.)

1023
00:35:59,059 --> 00:36:00,730
- It looks like Anyang First Avenue.
- It's nice.

1024
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:01,829
Goodness.

1025
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:04,670
(Somewhat familiar)

1026
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,670
My lips are already chapped.

1027
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,110
(Did Pani Bottle arrive?)

1028
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:11,510
It's the store owner.

1029
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:13,340
- It's the clothing store owner.
- The store owner.

1030
00:36:13,679 --> 00:36:15,110
He must have told him.

1031
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,380
- She likes Dex.
- That Dex is here.

1032
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,179
His little sister is a fan.

1033
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:19,949
You know?

1034
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:21,849
Yes, Kim Jin Young.

1035
00:36:21,849 --> 00:36:23,590
- She knows your real name?
- Your real name.

1036
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,719
(So thankful)

1037
00:36:24,719 --> 00:36:25,920
- Can I take a photo now?
- She wants to take a picture.

1038
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,260
Thank you so much.

1039
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,360
(He met a fan in a faraway country.)

1040
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,760
Gosh...

1041
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,989
There are more.

1042
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,929
(Crowded)

1043
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,599
- You're so cool.
- Thank you.

1044
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,000
(He looks lost, as people treat him
like an invisible man.)

1045
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,940
You're...

1046
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:39,940
so cool.

1047
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,440
Thank you.

1048
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:43,840
It was so cool for this to happen in Leh.

1049
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,010
Both sides think it's cool.

1050
00:36:45,010 --> 00:36:46,840
I was in the show business for ten years.

1051
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,380
(Alone)

1052
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:49,679
He's jealous again.

1053
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,920
In Siberia...

1054
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,519
- "Siberia?"
- "Siberia?"

1055
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,889
Don't you mean the Himalayas?

1056
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:59,090
- He said that twice.
- Siberia...

1057
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:01,590
- I meant the Himalayas.
- He's so angry.

1058
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,429
- Did you just want to curse?
- It's the Himalayas.

1059
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,159
Siberia.

1060
00:37:05,159 --> 00:37:06,860
- That sounded like cursing.
- Gosh.

1061
00:37:06,929 --> 00:37:09,070
He is melting Siberia.

1062
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,099
(He is melting the Himalayas.)

1063
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,099
(He can feel the psychological distance.)

1064
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:13,139
I'm jealous.

1065
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,039
(Another fan is already here.)

1066
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:18,070
(He can't look away because of jealousy.)

1067
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,079
Kian84.

1068
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:23,349
Stop mumbling and get away from there.

1069
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,679
Come over here.

1070
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,079
- I was jealous at first,
- Yes.

1071
00:37:27,349 --> 00:37:29,250
but that's practically diplomacy.

1072
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:31,789
He's melting the hearts of
the Siberian ladies.

1073
00:37:31,789 --> 00:37:33,289
- "Siberia?"
- "Siberia?"

1074
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,219
- Let's congratulate him.
- I mean...

1075
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:36,590
- Look at the line.
- They kept coming.

1076
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,730
- It's like a fan meet-and-greet.
- I respect him.

1077
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,900
- I was able to embrace it.
- Great.

1078
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:42,530
- Thank you.
- I became self-conscious.

1079
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:43,530
Yes.

1080
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,429
- Don't come. Take more pictures.
- No.

1081
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,869
- No, it's all right.
- No.

1082
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:49,210
- No.
- Pani Bottle. I missed you.

1083
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,570
Gosh. What are you doing?

1084
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:52,710
Dex.

1085
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,309
- This is what's annoying.
- I had to.

1086
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,909
- This is what's annoying.
- What's with his reaction?

1087
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:59,050
- What's with his reaction?
- Then how should he act?

1088
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,449
- What would you rather like?
- He's really angry.

1089
00:38:00,449 --> 00:38:01,719
- I'd rather he say...
- How?

1090
00:38:01,719 --> 00:38:03,889
"I can't help it."

1091
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,489
"I'm sorry." Like this.

1092
00:38:06,489 --> 00:38:08,059
Don't act modest?

1093
00:38:08,059 --> 00:38:09,260
I was embarrassed.

1094
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:11,230
- "Come on, Pani Bottle."
- That was sudden.

1095
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:13,159
- That's funny.
- That's hilarious.

1096
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,500
Come on, don't be like that.

1097
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,070
(The youngest acts cute
to appease the older ones.)

1098
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,070
Gosh. What are you doing?

1099
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,039
(Hugging)

1100
00:38:22,039 --> 00:38:25,340
When will you have the chance
to meet your fans here?

1101
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,179
I'm grateful.

1102
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,480
But we have to get some things done.
So we should...

1103
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,880
- I rented a car.
- Okay.

1104
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,719
- Then let's go grocery shopping.
- We did everything we needed to do.

1105
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:33,849
Let's go and buy food.

1106
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,380
Should we eat first
and then go grocery shopping?

1107
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,389
Or should we go grocery shopping first
and then eat?

1108
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,590
Here's the best option.

1109
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,389
- It's better to eat first.
- Okay.

1110
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:40,860
We won't overspend when we buy groceries.

1111
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,019
- If you shop when you're hungry,
- We do that when we're hungry.

1112
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,230
- you want to eat everything.
- Right. You'll buy everything.

1113
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,559
- Right.
- That's a rule when buying groceries.

1114
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,400
- Right. That's convincing.
- You were wise.

1115
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:49,329
- Where's the restaurant?
- We should get going first.

1116
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,369
- Okay.
- Yes.

1117
00:38:51,130 --> 00:38:54,369
Gosh. This is the street for travelers.

1118
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,469
(The main street in Leh)

1119
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:59,639
- The night view looks amazing.
- It's so beautiful.

1120
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,440
Look at the setting sun in the sky.

1121
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:03,579
Gosh. This place looks great.

1122
00:39:03,579 --> 00:39:04,610
It looks different.

1123
00:39:04,909 --> 00:39:06,820
That's the main street in Leh.

1124
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:07,949
- Gosh.
- It's nice.

1125
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,090
Gosh, they look mystical.

1126
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,849
- Right?
- The Tibetan influence.

1127
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,590
I love the vibe there.

1128
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:17,159
(The main street in Leh
is known as the heart of Ladakh.)

1129
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,829
This street has a nice vibe.

1130
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:20,929
Totally.

1131
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:22,429
"Tandoor."

1132
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,530
(Where should we eat?)

1133
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:28,369
Sorry. Excuse me.
Where can we eat some meat?

1134
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,840
Like mutton and... What's that? Kitchen?
I mean, chicken.

1135
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,179
- Barbecue...
- Otherwise, you can go there.

1136
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:38,380
- Chef's Kitchen. Yes.
- Chef's Kitchen? Okay.

1137
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:39,880
Then you'll get Tibetan food.

1138
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,750
Okay. Thank you very much.

1139
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:43,690
Pani Bottle!

1140
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,219
Okay.

1141
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,460
- Kian84.
- Pani Bottle.

1142
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,730
- Okay.
- I found one.

1143
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:51,989
Right there. They sell meat there.

1144
00:39:52,329 --> 00:39:54,659
- Dex loved chicken in Amritsar.
- Yes.

1145
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,500
- I thought we should have chicken.
- Okay. Let's go right away.

1146
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,000
- You guys need meat.
- Yes.

1147
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,500
- Okay.
- Okay.

1148
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,969
These kind local guys told me
that we could eat here.

1149
00:40:02,969 --> 00:40:05,210
- Really? Right. This place...
- I see.

1150
00:40:05,309 --> 00:40:06,780
- Look at the interior design.
- Definitely.

1151
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,579
- Everything is going well now.
- Even the design looks great.

1152
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:10,780
It's like all the puzzles pieces
coming together.

1153
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,849
I'm tired.

1154
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,679
Gosh.

1155
00:40:15,949 --> 00:40:18,090
- We only climbed three flights of stairs.
- It was brief.

1156
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,920
- But it's still exhausting. Yes.
- That felt like ten flights of stairs.

1157
00:40:20,389 --> 00:40:22,590
Hello.

1158
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,130
Should we sit here?

1159
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,559
- Gosh. I'm tired.
- Gosh, we can see the view from here.

1160
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,099
- This is nice.
- Nice.

1161
00:40:29,199 --> 00:40:31,670
- Gosh. That's nice.
- Goodness, look at the view.

1162
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:33,440
- Gosh.
- If the food is tasty too,

1163
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,840
- everything will be perfect.
- Right.

1164
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,369
Gosh.

1165
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,610
Gosh, I'm feeling the altitude sickness.

1166
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,010
- We only climbed up three floors.
- What?

1167
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:43,949
- Gosh.
- It's killing me.

1168
00:40:43,949 --> 00:40:45,010
(Climbing up 3 floors is tough
when the altitude is at 3,500m.)

1169
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:47,780
I feel the altitude sickness
when the altitude is at 5,000m.

1170
00:40:48,449 --> 00:40:51,349
- He's so annoying when he says that.
- What on earth is wrong with you?

1171
00:40:51,349 --> 00:40:53,289
- Just like the bandana too.
- Right.

1172
00:40:53,289 --> 00:40:55,659
He'll learn his lesson
when his ears and eyes bleed.

1173
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:57,760
(Feeling dizzy)

1174
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,099
- What are you talking about?
- Stop acting tough.

1175
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,960
I'm serious.

1176
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:03,900
Your ears will bleed too now.

1177
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:06,239
If I get a nosebleed again,
I'll give you 1,000 dollars.

1178
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,739
- Really?
- For real?

1179
00:41:07,739 --> 00:41:08,900
But you can't punch me.

1180
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,010
You can't punch me to get 1,000 dollars.
That's not allowed.

1181
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,469
- This.
- Don't do that.

1182
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:14,480
(A few days later
on their way back to Korea)

1183
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,539
- What?
- What is it?

1184
00:41:18,849 --> 00:41:22,820
- One thousand dollars!
- One thousand dollars!

1185
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,550
Give me your bank account number.

1186
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,489
Gosh. This is like a cartoon, right?

1187
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:29,329
Besides, that was my third nosebleed.

1188
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,360
(His 1st nosebleed)

1189
00:41:32,559 --> 00:41:34,530
(His 2nd nosebleed)

1190
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,630
(His 3rd nosebleed)

1191
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,929
- He bled a lot too.
- Yes.

1192
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,440
- That's hilarious.
- Actually, I was next to him.

1193
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,110
His nose suddenly started to bleed.

1194
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,239
- Really?
- Gosh.

1195
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:46,739
- Yes. The blood started to drip down.
- What?

1196
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,409
He left India, bleeding.

1197
00:41:48,409 --> 00:41:51,050
No, listen.
I rarely got nosebleeds in my life.

1198
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,519
I always get a nosebleed
whenever I film this show.

1199
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,619
- Right.
- Really?

1200
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,889
Give me your bank account number.
I'll wire the money.

1201
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:57,119
- That's funny.
- I should keep my promise.

1202
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:59,090
- That's so funny.
- It's hilarious.

1203
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,989
(There's no altitude sickness,
but he gets a nosebleed.)

1204
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,030
By the way, your hands feel numb
when you get the altitude sickness.

1205
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,389
- Numb?
- Yes.

1206
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:06,630
- Really?
- Your hands feel numb?

1207
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,800
That's because you didn't eat yet.

1208
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,099
- Is it because you're hungry?
- Really?

1209
00:42:09,099 --> 00:42:10,170
- I've never heard of that.
- I found out later that...

1210
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,929
it was one of the symptoms
of the altitude sickness.

1211
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:12,969
- Really?
- Gosh.

1212
00:42:13,369 --> 00:42:15,869
- Your jawline is not V-shaped.
- There's tingling in my hands.

1213
00:42:15,869 --> 00:42:18,469
- You look skeletal. Right.
- The V is getting slimmer now.

1214
00:42:18,469 --> 00:42:20,409
- Your cheeks are sunken.
- My cheeks are sunken.

1215
00:42:20,409 --> 00:42:21,579
You need to eat.

1216
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,909
- Gosh. Oh, no.
- That's true.

1217
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,309
- I look like a different guy.
- He lost a lot of weight.

1218
00:42:25,309 --> 00:42:26,949
- He looks so skinny.
- His cheeks are sunken.

1219
00:42:27,619 --> 00:42:29,019
- But I gained weight in India.
- Right.

1220
00:42:29,019 --> 00:42:30,250
- I enjoyed the food too much.
- Oh, my.

1221
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,119
People must think
I'm hogging all the food...

1222
00:42:33,219 --> 00:42:34,659
and I'm not sharing it with you.

1223
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:36,760
Well, it's me. I just couldn't eat that.

1224
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,960
Let's order a lot of dishes today.

1225
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,500
- I'm looking forward to the food here.
- Let's order tandoori chicken.

1226
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,099
I hope they like the food.

1227
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,530
Steamed momos.
One vegetable and one chicken, please.

1228
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,900
And thenthuk, please.

1229
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,099
- That's like sujebi.
- Thenthuk is sujebi? Okay.

1230
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:51,409
- One black paper chicken.
- Chicken.

1231
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:52,940
Spicy wings. One.

1232
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,940
- And beer?
- Beer?

1233
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,079
- I have beer.
- They get to drink.

1234
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:58,610
- Nice.
- Yes.

1235
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,880
- Okay.
- Okay.

1236
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:03,349
- Not yet.
- Okay.

1237
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,519
I want to try lamb too.

1238
00:43:05,519 --> 00:43:06,820
Great.

1239
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:10,030
Is there a dish with mutton?

1240
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,460
Everything sounds good.

1241
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:13,829
Is there a dish...

1242
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:15,329
- with mutton?
- I think we're ordering too much food.

1243
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:16,929
Let's eat everything we ordered first.

1244
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,730
- If we need more food, let's order more.
- Lamb.

1245
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,769
- Dex couldn't eat well for three days.
- You can find lamb here.

1246
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:24,210
- I'll go over the order.
- Okay.

1247
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,710
- One vegetable momos, one chicken momos,
- Okay.

1248
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:28,079
- two chicken thenthuk,
- Okay.

1249
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,139
- one black pepper chicken,
- Okay.

1250
00:43:29,139 --> 00:43:30,679
- one order of spicy wings,
- Okay.

1251
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,980
one barbecued lamb chop,

1252
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:33,380
one Diet Coke, and three beers.

1253
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,679
- I can't wait to see the food.
- I'm glad you ordered a lot.

1254
00:43:34,679 --> 00:43:35,949
I can't wait to see the food.

1255
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:38,150
- Dex needs to eat a lot.
- This is the front.

1256
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,889
- Are you hungry?
- I'm hungry.

1257
00:43:39,889 --> 00:43:41,159
- I'm hungry.
- Isn't this our first meal?

1258
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,460
Should we order one more curry then?

1259
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,530
- Sounds good. We should order curry.
- Sure.

1260
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:46,500
- Excuse me.
- I'll go and order.

1261
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:47,530
I'll add that to our order.

1262
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,630
We can all feel it.

1263
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,929
- "This is it."
- I want to order more.

1264
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:53,469
- Butter roti. Okay.
- Butter roti.

1265
00:43:53,869 --> 00:43:54,869
Okay.

1266
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,039
(The day with voracious appetites)

1267
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,369
(Beer is served first.)

1268
00:43:58,369 --> 00:43:59,539
- Is that beer? Gosh.
- Gosh.

1269
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:00,909
(Approving)

1270
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:03,179
Should we pour our own?

1271
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,309
- Yes.
- Yes.

1272
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:07,380
(They pour their own beer into the glass.)

1273
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,550
- Gosh.
- This is nice.

1274
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:10,349
The beer... What happened?

1275
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:13,590
Isn't that how IU drinks beer?

1276
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,829
It looks like the beer from "My Mister."

1277
00:44:16,829 --> 00:44:18,260
"Even for my enemy."

1278
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,960
(I wouldn't pour it like that
even for my enemy.)

1279
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:24,130
(Filling up the glass with foam
as if it's for his enemy)

1280
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:25,829
Let's clink our glasses.

1281
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:29,340
- For our last destination.
- Cheers.

1282
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,409
For our last destination.

1283
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,280
(Having a sip...)

1284
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,440
(of the cool, foamy beer)

1285
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,880
(Hitting the spot)

1286
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,679
Gosh,
it looks like he's really enjoying it.

1287
00:44:41,679 --> 00:44:42,719
(Ecstatic)

1288
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,519
There's a saying like this.

1289
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,889
"People go camping
for the barbecue and drinks."

1290
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,329
Who said that?

1291
00:44:50,659 --> 00:44:51,659
MINO.

1292
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,099
(MINO said it.)

1293
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:55,460
- MINO.
- You can't generalize that.

1294
00:44:55,530 --> 00:44:57,429
Shouldn't you say that's what MINO said?

1295
00:44:58,599 --> 00:45:01,000
- Our food is here.
- Food comes out fast here.

1296
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:02,170
- Yes.
- Momos.

1297
00:45:02,170 --> 00:45:04,210
Gosh. They give us soy sauce too.

1298
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:05,469
- Vegetable momos?
- Yes.

1299
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:06,639
This one is chicken.

1300
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:07,980
- Chicken momos.
- Chicken.

1301
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,349
- Gosh, look at them.
- They look like dumplings.

1302
00:45:11,349 --> 00:45:13,019
Even the sauce looks similar.

1303
00:45:13,019 --> 00:45:14,650
Right. It looks like the frozen dumplings
we're used to.

1304
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,219
- They look good.
- Gosh, this looks good.

1305
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:19,090
(Eating that in one bite)

1306
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,519
(Humming in approval)

1307
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,590
(Surprised)

1308
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,190
(A thumbs up)

1309
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,059
They were Tibetan dumplings.

1310
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,900
Is the filling similar to the one
we're used to?

1311
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:30,599
They add cheese and potatoes too.

1312
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,300
You can never go wrong with them.

1313
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,900
- Right.
- Just look at them.

1314
00:45:34,099 --> 00:45:36,239
Let's split open the chicken momo.

1315
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:39,480
(It looks just like a meat dumpling.)

1316
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,639
A meat dumpling.

1317
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:44,050
(Relieved by the look of the dish,
the youngest has a big bite.)

1318
00:45:44,579 --> 00:45:45,750
(He closes his eyes
and savors the flavor.)

1319
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:47,679
- He's using his nose.
- He's smelling it.

1320
00:45:47,679 --> 00:45:50,820
I smelled some spices,
but I could tolerate them.

1321
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:53,460
They were necessary spices
that enhanced the flavors.

1322
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:55,090
- You just liked Leh.
- I loved it.

1323
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:56,659
You're getting too excited.

1324
00:45:56,659 --> 00:45:57,829
I love Leh.

1325
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:02,360
It's spicy.

1326
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,429
With the sauce,
it reminds me of kimchi dumplings.

1327
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:07,340
But the wrapper is slightly thicker.

1328
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:09,239
Right. In other words, I like this.

1329
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,340
Right. It's so good.

1330
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,309
- The air. Everything is perfect.
- Gosh.

1331
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:15,679
- Gosh. The barbecued lamb.
- What's this.

1332
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:16,780
It's lamb.

1333
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:18,550
- Gosh, it looks so appetizing.
- It looks great.

1334
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,519
I heard that Ladakh was famous for lamb.

1335
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,389
- I love lamb.
- They look like braised lambs.

1336
00:46:23,949 --> 00:46:24,949
Gosh.

1337
00:46:25,389 --> 00:46:27,420
(The food continues to come out.)

1338
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,460
Thank you.

1339
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:30,329
- What's this? It looks good.
- It's crazy.

1340
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,929
(Butter roti and curry)

1341
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,460
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

1342
00:46:34,559 --> 00:46:36,170
Thenthuk. Here, please.

1343
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,329
That's thenthuk

1344
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:39,570
They all look great. Goodness.

1345
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:40,869
Nice.

1346
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,739
I'm looking forward to this dish.

1347
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:46,179
Thenthuk is the most famous dish.

1348
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,210
(The most representative dish
of Leh, thenthuk)

1349
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:48,809
- Sujebi.
- It does look like sujebi.

1350
00:46:50,250 --> 00:46:51,280
Try it.

1351
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,519
(He tries the hot broth first.)

1352
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,619
- Soju will go well with this.
- Right.

1353
00:46:56,619 --> 00:46:57,949
- The broth was deep.
- My goodness.

1354
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,920
- No way.
- I'll finish with that.

1355
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,019
The broth must be refreshing.

1356
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:05,489
Hey, this is samgyetang.

1357
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:07,130
It tastes like chicken soup.

1358
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,070
- It tasted much like Korean food.
- Right. Totally.

1359
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,829
- Do Yeon.
- Yes.

1360
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:15,239
How come Tibetan food taste similar
to Korean food?

1361
00:47:15,239 --> 00:47:17,769
- Okay. There is a reason behind that.
- Really?

1362
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:21,210
Since Leh is a cold region
where the temperature drops below zero,

1363
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,380
to overcome the extreme cold weather,

1364
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:25,480
the locals utilized barley and wheat...

1365
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:28,480
and developed a lot of noodles and soup.

1366
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:31,090
That's why tt's similar to the stew
we see often...

1367
00:47:31,090 --> 00:47:32,349
in our cuisine.

1368
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,989
- Thank you.
- That's fascinating.

1369
00:47:34,659 --> 00:47:36,630
(In a foreign city,)

1370
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:38,960
(he tasted familiar flavors of home.)

1371
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,659
Gosh. Look at him gnawing the rib.

1372
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:42,900
Goodness. Little Dex is eating a lot.

1373
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,730
- Right.
- I can eat a lot too.

1374
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:48,570
Everything tasted great.
I liked everything there.

1375
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,539
To be honest, out of all the food I had
and the restaurants...

1376
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:53,809
I had been to in India, that was the best.

1377
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:58,010
- Oh, no.
- Right.

1378
00:47:58,010 --> 00:47:59,079
- He didn't eat a lot.
- Look at my frown.

1379
00:47:59,079 --> 00:48:01,219
(He frowned a lot
because the food didn't agree with him.)

1380
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,320
I was at ease.

1381
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,019
(His long fast...)

1382
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,019
- Right.
- Yes.
The days flashed by before his eyes.

1383
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,059
(is no more now.)

1384
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:13,659
Let me taste this.

1385
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,500
- It's huge.
- What's that?

1386
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,829
- Curry.
- Curry.

1387
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,099
- That's a block of cheese.
- Try the big one.

1388
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,639
Gosh, that looks good.

1389
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,869
(He had been eating curry
ever since he came to India.)

1390
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,480
(Surprised)

1391
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,579
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

1392
00:48:28,710 --> 00:48:31,010
(He has so many dishes to choose from.)

1393
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,980
I think he loves curry.

1394
00:48:34,519 --> 00:48:37,320
Can I ask you
if there was a dish you didn't like?

1395
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:40,219
- None, I bet.
- It was really weird.

1396
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:42,389
- It's...
- It's nice to see him eat with gusto.

1397
00:48:43,460 --> 00:48:44,789
I guess I was born to live in India.

1398
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:46,800
Even I can live here.

1399
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:49,599
Hey, you should gain some weight.
At least 1kg.

1400
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,539
(And right here,)

1401
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,340
(a man is deboning it
with the utmost attention.)

1402
00:48:57,940 --> 00:49:00,679
(This guy can eat up anything
that's in front of him.)

1403
00:49:00,679 --> 00:49:02,010
Why is there a narrator?

1404
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:05,179
As he is an omnivore,
he will eat anything he can find.

1405
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:08,179
- "He feeds on all kinds of food."
- "Eats-Everything-84."

1406
00:49:08,780 --> 00:49:10,789
It was the best meal I had in India.

1407
00:49:11,389 --> 00:49:13,619
- Seriously. We crushed it.
- That looks good.

1408
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:14,920
(Even Eats-Everything-84
acknowledged as the best meal.)

1409
00:49:15,559 --> 00:49:17,489
It makes me full watching you two eat.

1410
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,460
- After you ate that much food?
- He ate a lot.

1411
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,960
- I think he had his fill.
- Right.

1412
00:49:23,469 --> 00:49:24,530
That was nice.

1413
00:49:24,530 --> 00:49:26,030
(Everyone was satisfied with the meal.)

1414
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,940
- I do want to visit Leh.
- Yes.

1415
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:29,300
I'm curious about the food too.

1416
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,110
After eating that much food,
we only paid 60 dollars.

1417
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,409
- Including the beer.
- That's a good price.

1418
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:38,780
Actually, that was the last supper
the three of us had.

1419
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,820
- Right. It was a great supper.
- It was the last supper.

1420
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,050
This trip...

1421
00:49:43,889 --> 00:49:47,360
(Only the first and last destinations
were set for this trip.)

1422
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:49,860
(Kian84 must start...)

1423
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:51,590
(and end the trip on his own.)

1424
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:53,059
(You want me to go there alone?)

1425
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,599
(He was worried and excited
about his last alone trip.)

1426
00:49:57,500 --> 00:50:01,099
(The village
where the purest people in India live)

1427
00:50:02,170 --> 00:50:06,510
(As the civilization was kept away,
time stands still there.)

1428
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:10,010
(I'm curious, though.)

1429
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:12,579
Dex and I left after...

1430
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:14,179
- camping.
- You left?

1431
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,449
With the nosebleed?

1432
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:16,820
- Right.
- When it was dripping?

1433
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,119
That's when I left.

1434
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:19,650
- I see. Then...
- With the nosebleed.

1435
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,289
you two don't know
what Kian84 did after you left...

1436
00:50:21,289 --> 00:50:22,559
- just like us.
- We don't know.

1437
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,730
- You guys don't know.
- I don't know either.

1438
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,030
Gosh, that was the highlight.

1439
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:28,329
- Hey. The highlight...
- Really?

1440
00:50:28,329 --> 00:50:30,000
We're going through this
to watch that highlight.

1441
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,599
- Really? This is all a buildup?
- To watch you fail?

1442
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,739
- I'm serious.
- He should be called Trailer84.

1443
00:50:33,739 --> 00:50:35,000
- Right.
- Trailer84.

1444
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,769
How many trailers did you film?

1445
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,840
(They come out after the meal.)

1446
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,579
There's a huge supermarket here.

1447
00:50:43,309 --> 00:50:45,349
- This is a supermarket?
- Yes. It's huge.

1448
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,250
Gosh, the supermarket looks...

1449
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,550
It's on a different scale.

1450
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:52,489
When we go camping tomorrow,
we won't have any food.

1451
00:50:52,489 --> 00:50:55,489
We went there to get some food
for our camping trip.

1452
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:57,260
Gosh. What's this?

1453
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,000
- It's so organized here.
- Gosh.

1454
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,500
- It's just like Korea.
- It's so clean and organized.

1455
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,769
That's similar to Emart in Ladakh.

1456
00:51:04,769 --> 00:51:06,800
- Yes. That looks like a huge supermarket.
- I see.

1457
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,670
- This place is amazing.
- Hey. Look at the ceiling.

1458
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,639
The concrete ceiling is open.

1459
00:51:10,969 --> 00:51:12,369
Just like trendy cafes nowadays.

1460
00:51:12,369 --> 00:51:14,440
Right. We see a lot of lights
like that nowadays.

1461
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:17,550
Seeing how similar things are abroad
fascinates me.

1462
00:51:17,679 --> 00:51:19,179
- It's the same in other countries.
- Yes.

1463
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,750
- What? I see all kinds of Korean ramyeon.
- What?

1464
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,489
This whole section
is just for Korean ramyeon.

1465
00:51:24,920 --> 00:51:26,760
- There's a wide variety of brands too.
- I didn't know it was popular here.

1466
00:51:26,989 --> 00:51:29,659
A few years ago, you couldn't find
Korean ramyeon in India.

1467
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,760
It's been a few years
since I was in India. This is shocking.

1468
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,230
- Actually, in India,
- Yes.

1469
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,130
there's a brand named Maggi.
The ramyeon from Maggi was popular.

1470
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:38,170
- Maggi?
- Maggi.

1471
00:51:38,170 --> 00:51:39,500
- Isn't Dex Maggi?
- Maggi.

1472
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,300
I'm not talking about the show
you were in.

1473
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:43,769
Right here.

1474
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:45,070
This is the most popular one?

1475
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,980
This is the most famous ramyeon brand
in India.

1476
00:51:47,539 --> 00:51:49,139
But it's all the way on the bottom.

1477
00:51:49,139 --> 00:51:50,949
The Korean ramyeon brands
took over the market.

1478
00:51:52,210 --> 00:51:53,820
That's the power of Korean videos.

1479
00:51:54,150 --> 00:51:56,519
- Korean videos.
- It's the power of Korean videos.

1480
00:51:56,519 --> 00:51:57,920
Should we buy Korean ramyeon?

1481
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,949
- Sure.
- Yes.

1482
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,760
- We're going there to enjoy ourselves.
- Okay.

1483
00:52:02,019 --> 00:52:03,019
Oreo.

1484
00:52:03,429 --> 00:52:04,429
Coffee.

1485
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:05,829
Right here.

1486
00:52:06,230 --> 00:52:07,599
- It was like going on a retreat.
- Yes.

1487
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,500
You must be excited to be shopping
like that before the trip.

1488
00:52:10,900 --> 00:52:13,269
Right here. I'll buy one of this.

1489
00:52:13,269 --> 00:52:16,170
Chicken... Kitchen towel.

1490
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:17,969
The wet wipes are here.

1491
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:20,179
Look at this.

1492
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,679
It's bloated
because the altitude is high here.

1493
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,280
- Really?
- Yes.

1494
00:52:24,650 --> 00:52:26,579
The bags were assembled
at low-altitude places.

1495
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:28,849
- The pressure is too strong here.
- The atmospheric pressure.

1496
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:30,150
So the bags get puffy.

1497
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:32,590
(Bloated)

1498
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,989
The bags all got bloated.

1499
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,320
(His face is bloated too.)

1500
00:52:36,289 --> 00:52:37,730
Why is your face so round?

1501
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,900
Pani Bottle is bloated too.

1502
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,699
- It's the altitude sickness.
- The altitude sickness.

1503
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:43,599
- The altitude sickness was pretty bad.
- Right.

1504
00:52:44,769 --> 00:52:46,869
It's bloated
because the altitude is high here.

1505
00:52:47,769 --> 00:52:48,940
(The produce section is empty.)

1506
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,170
- Really?
- What?

1507
00:52:50,469 --> 00:52:53,139
Usually,
the goods are transported by land.

1508
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,139
Once the roads are blocked,
they can't move the goods for a long time.

1509
00:52:56,340 --> 00:52:57,909
I noticed the expiration dates passed.

1510
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:58,909
Right.

1511
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,079
That's why the prices in Leh
were slightly higher than other cities.

1512
00:53:02,619 --> 00:53:04,690
It's similar to how things are
more expensive on islands in Korea.

1513
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:06,449
- Right.
- That's true.

1514
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:08,789
Hey, we need to buy meat.

1515
00:53:08,789 --> 00:53:11,230
We must buy meat.
The highlight of camping is the meat.

1516
00:53:12,059 --> 00:53:13,730
What's this? Chicken.

1517
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,530
- It's already seasoned.
- Yes, let's grilled that.

1518
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:17,969
Yes. This will be good.

1519
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,699
And there are sausages.
Let's buy sausages.

1520
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:23,070
Grilled sausages sound good.

1521
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:26,780
- We're throwing a festival there.
- Already.

1522
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:29,079
Are we going there to live?

1523
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,550
Do we have a secret guest there?

1524
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,320
The amount of food we have...

1525
00:53:33,519 --> 00:53:35,550
"People go camping
for the barbecue and drinks."

1526
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:36,989
(Could it be this guy who said
camping was about barbecues and drinks?)

1527
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,219
Is there a small bottle of cooking oil?

1528
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,119
Isn't this the smallest one?
The olive oil.

1529
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,059
- Right.
- Water.

1530
00:53:44,389 --> 00:53:45,389
- The cooking oil.
- What?
Water.

1531
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,429
- The cooking oil.
- What?

1532
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:48,699
- What...
- Dex.

1533
00:53:49,030 --> 00:53:50,469
I don't think we need that much water.

1534
00:53:50,699 --> 00:53:52,670
You were shopping for two days, right?

1535
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:55,440
I get why he brought a big backpack.

1536
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,670
- He tends to buy things impulsively.
- Or...

1537
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:01,380
If we buy them individually,
it will be hard to carry them.

1538
00:54:02,179 --> 00:54:04,050
I could tell
Dex wouldn't save up a lot of money.

1539
00:54:04,250 --> 00:54:05,449
Look at how he shops.

1540
00:54:05,610 --> 00:54:07,519
- He can just make a lot of money then.
- Right.

1541
00:54:07,650 --> 00:54:09,019
- He doesn't spend that much money.
- Look at the water.

1542
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,550
It was just a box of water.

1543
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:11,989
- You're being too harsh.
- Listen.

1544
00:54:11,989 --> 00:54:14,019
- He needs to save up money.
- I must.

1545
00:54:14,019 --> 00:54:16,389
I know that
I like to buy things impulsively.

1546
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:18,929
- Or... What do you think, Kian84?
- What?

1547
00:54:18,929 --> 00:54:20,429
- The majority will rule.
- I can respect that.

1548
00:54:20,429 --> 00:54:21,829
But... The water?

1549
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:24,300
- Then let's take some of it out.
- No.

1550
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:26,940
- Whenever I go to remote areas,
- Yes.

1551
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:28,340
water is very important to me...

1552
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:29,800
- because...
- I get that. But this is...

1553
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:32,739
I was speaking from experience.

1554
00:54:32,739 --> 00:54:34,280
- Right. He's firm. Then he must buy it.
- Let me explain.

1555
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,380
We don't have to bring a lot of food,
but we must have water.

1556
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:38,679
- That way, we can survive.
- Fine. Let's get it then.

1557
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,780
We need to drink water
and make ramyeon with this.

1558
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,090
- Right. Okay. That's right.
- Yes.

1559
00:54:44,090 --> 00:54:45,320
What about cooking oil?

1560
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:46,889
Can't we buy this?

1561
00:54:46,889 --> 00:54:47,920
- It's the smallest one.
- That's great.

1562
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:50,289
- This is olive oil.
- I love it.

1563
00:54:50,289 --> 00:54:51,730
And did we get salt or not?

1564
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:52,889
- Salt and pepper.
- No.

1565
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,900
- Salt. It's seasoning. We can dip in it.
- Okay.

1566
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:55,960
- Should we get this one?
- Okay.

1567
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:56,969
Okay. Let's get this.

1568
00:54:56,969 --> 00:54:57,969
- We're done.
- We're done.

1569
00:54:57,969 --> 00:54:59,469
- That's enough.
- Okay. Let's go.

1570
00:54:59,469 --> 00:55:01,570
- Gosh. We filled up the cart.
- Let's go.

1571
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:02,639
We did.

1572
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:05,110
(The cart is full.)

1573
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,170
When we go to a remote area,

1574
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,739
- there aren't any convenience stores.
- Right.

1575
00:55:07,739 --> 00:55:09,409
To make sure we had everything we needed.

1576
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:10,550
- Good job.
- That's better than not having enough.

1577
00:55:10,550 --> 00:55:11,880
Having leftover is better than that.

1578
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,679
- Good job. Yes.
- You'll drive there anyway.

1579
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,650
Gosh.

1580
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:19,119
It's like we're going to Daeseong-ri.

1581
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,559
- Daeseong-ri.
- Daeseong-ri.

1582
00:55:21,590 --> 00:55:22,659
(Camping necessities, 105 dollars)

1583
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:25,059
- Gosh. They spent 100 dollars there.
- Gosh.

1584
00:55:25,059 --> 00:55:26,800
- The price point was similar...
- Right.

1585
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:27,860
for supermarket products.

1586
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:29,900
Check the receipt.

1587
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:30,929
Thank you.

1588
00:55:31,969 --> 00:55:34,300
It's quite long.

1589
00:55:34,840 --> 00:55:36,639
I thought it would stop there.
But this is a long receipt.

1590
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:37,739
We did buy a lot.

1591
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:39,909
I was excited because
it was our first camping trip.

1592
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,840
Let's carry that together.

1593
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,280
I'll carry it.

1594
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,449
You have a lot of stuff to carry.

1595
00:55:45,449 --> 00:55:46,980
Let me get my stuff then.

1596
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:48,949
- Great.
- This is like going on a retreat.

1597
00:55:48,949 --> 00:55:50,989
(They finish shopping groceries
on a good note.)

1598
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,119
It's warm here.

1599
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,219
(The India Brothers return
to the lodging.)

1600
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:57,659
(Exhausted)

1601
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:58,730
It's killing me.

1602
00:55:59,630 --> 00:56:00,829
It doesn't look like much.

1603
00:56:00,829 --> 00:56:02,630
But going back and forth is exhausting.

1604
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,070
- That's the problem.
- Yes.

1605
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,800
- Totally.
- The road is steep. It's hard to breathe.

1606
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,570
I'll wash up first. Kian84.

1607
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:09,300
I already washed up earlier. I'm good.

1608
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:11,510
(Knocked-out-84 goes to sleep
after leaving a famous saying.)

1609
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,739
- "Knocked-out-84."
- Of course, he's exhausted.

1610
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:16,039
(Squeaky Bottle gets ready to sleep
after taking a shower.)

1611
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,380
"Squeaky Bottle."

1612
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:19,150
"Squeaky Bottle."

1613
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,920
- Goodnight.
- Okay.

1614
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:25,320
(Their eventful day comes to an end.)

1615
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,989
(The morning in Leh breaks again.)

1616
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:31,030
Gosh, it's beautiful.

1617
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:32,460
- Leh is beautiful.
- Yes.

1618
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,869
(Wriggling)

1619
00:56:38,070 --> 00:56:40,599
(Stretching)

1620
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,070
(Stopping)

1621
00:56:45,739 --> 00:56:47,710
Gosh, Dex.

1622
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,179
- Where did Dex go?
- What?

1623
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,150
All right. Good morning, everyone.

1624
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:56,789
Let me tell you where I'm going
at this early hour.

1625
00:56:57,119 --> 00:56:58,590
I'll get on the motorcycle...

1626
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,460
and drive around Leh.

1627
00:57:02,789 --> 00:57:05,590
(On their way to the lodging
the day before)

1628
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,530
(The mecca of bikers, Leh)

1629
00:57:07,530 --> 00:57:10,670
It was one of the activities
on my bucket list.

1630
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,070
I asked Pani Bottle to help me.

1631
00:57:12,070 --> 00:57:14,269
He had rented the motorcycle for me
in advance.

1632
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:18,170
We talked about going with him
in the morning.

1633
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:20,179
- But we couldn't get up.
- Right. You should get some sleep.

1634
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:22,880
You guys already did that
in South America.

1635
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,849
- In South America.
- Yes.

1636
00:57:25,550 --> 00:57:28,820
I'll be riding this baby
for the morning ride.

1637
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:31,989
I'll go and check out
this beautiful place, Leh.

1638
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:33,320
Let's go.

1639
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,420
(Actually,
he enjoys riding the motorcycle.)

1640
00:57:35,420 --> 00:57:36,519
- What is this?
- Who is this?

1641
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,789
- Is that you?
- That's me.

1642
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:39,929
(Dex the Rider)

1643
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:42,460
- He has the same hobby as Kian84.
- Right.

1644
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:44,900
Everyone on the show
can ride the motorcycle.

1645
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:45,929
That's true.

1646
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,539
(The essential requirement
to be on the show)

1647
00:57:48,539 --> 00:57:50,769
(Being able to ride a motorcycle)

1648
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:54,409
(The youngest can't pass up
this opportunity.)

1649
00:57:55,239 --> 00:57:57,949
(Dex goes on a ride alone.)

1650
00:57:58,710 --> 00:58:01,750
(Once he puts on the cool gloves,)

1651
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:03,349
He looks cool.

1652
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:04,389
(he's ready to go.)

1653
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,889
(Close)

1654
00:58:06,889 --> 00:58:09,190
- "Close."
- He's doing something cool again.

1655
00:58:09,190 --> 00:58:10,860
(He's doing something cool again.)

1656
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,730
- Jealous84.
- "Jealous84."

1657
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:14,730
(Burning with jealousy)

1658
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:18,000
He's got long legs.

1659
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,840
They touch the ground.

1660
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:23,869
(With the others' jealousy,)

1661
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:24,909
He's off.

1662
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:27,010
(Dex leaves to ride around Leh.)

1663
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:29,340
(Cheering)

1664
00:58:31,050 --> 00:58:33,449
(Once he passes the narrow alleys...)

1665
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:35,849
- My gosh.
- Goodness.

1666
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:38,719
- That's amazing.
- I'm jealous. Why didn't I go on a ride?

1667
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:40,260
I'm seriously jealous.

1668
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:42,960
(Riding on the empty road,)

1669
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,260
(he's enjoying the freedom.)

1670
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,630
This truly is extraordinary nature.

1671
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,570
- Goodness.
- I can understand...

1672
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,170
- why bikers love Leh.
- Me too.

1673
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:55,039
Riding a car on that road compared
to a motorcycle must feel different.

1674
00:58:55,039 --> 00:58:57,739
It was totally different.
I rode against the natural wind.

1675
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:00,239
But...

1676
00:59:00,510 --> 00:59:03,110
it's hard to spot any trees here.

1677
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:05,909
There aren't any trees on the mountain.

1678
00:59:07,150 --> 00:59:08,420
(Due to its cold desert nature)

1679
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:10,349
- Isn't that amazing?
- Yes, it is.

1680
00:59:10,349 --> 00:59:11,619
There's not a single car...

1681
00:59:11,619 --> 00:59:13,449
- or traffic lights.
- Yes.

1682
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:17,630
The weather here is incredibly nice.

1683
00:59:17,630 --> 00:59:19,090
It's seriously nice.

1684
00:59:19,190 --> 00:59:22,199
I left my sunglasses behind on purpose...

1685
00:59:22,199 --> 00:59:26,969
because I wanted to enjoy this nature
with my two eyes as it was.

1686
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:28,769
You said the same thing as Kian84.

1687
00:59:28,969 --> 00:59:30,639
I kept the shield open...

1688
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,139
- to smell the air.
- Yes. You're a pro.

1689
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:34,909
- I have a good nose.
- You do.

1690
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:37,380
I had to see it with my eyes,
smell it with my nose,

1691
00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:38,579
and feel it with my skin.

1692
00:59:39,579 --> 00:59:43,619
(If only I could ride across the dry sky)

1693
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:49,860
(And fall into your arms, I wouldn't care)

1694
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,800
(Drunk with nature, he hums...)

1695
00:59:55,630 --> 00:59:59,130
(and rides across the sky!)

1696
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:04,909
(In no time,
a unique tree-lined road appears.)

1697
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,510
(Dex the Rider rides
to his heart's content.)

1698
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:08,539
(Cheering)

1699
01:00:08,539 --> 01:00:10,710
(Dex the Rider rides
to his heart's content.)

1700
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:14,679
- Goodness.
- My gosh.

1701
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:16,519
- How far is he going?
- It's like a painting.

1702
01:00:16,519 --> 01:00:18,349
We need to go camping, Dex.

1703
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:19,420
(He can't hear a thing.)

1704
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:22,389
Whatever. Let's just go.

1705
01:00:22,389 --> 01:00:23,559
(Captivated by nature,
he keeps riding for 15 minutes.)

1706
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,599
That. What's that statue of Buddha?

1707
01:00:27,730 --> 01:00:29,760
Gosh, in front of me...

1708
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,800
is a big shiny statue of Buddha.

1709
01:00:32,929 --> 01:00:34,739
- What's that?
- There was a statue of Buddha.

1710
01:00:34,739 --> 01:00:36,900
I knew I had to go see that statue.

1711
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:39,070
Let me ride all the way over there.

1712
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,480
That's the best thing.

1713
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,679
When you stumble upon a place...

1714
01:00:42,679 --> 01:00:43,710
- that isn't your destination.
- Right.

1715
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:45,409
- It's like a gift.
- Yes.

1716
01:00:46,179 --> 01:00:47,619
- What?
- What's wrong?

1717
01:00:47,619 --> 01:00:49,380
- Hang in there, motorcycle.
- What?

1718
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,849
Stop rattling.

1719
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:53,550
Giddy-up!

1720
01:00:54,389 --> 01:00:55,920
(Let's go, horse.)

1721
01:00:56,159 --> 01:00:57,690
That's it.

1722
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,590
Let's keep going.

1723
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,599
(The more he goes uphill)

1724
01:01:02,599 --> 01:01:04,570
The motorcycle is weak.

1725
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,670
You can do it!

1726
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,500
You can do it, baby!

1727
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:09,900
- Please!
- Let's go.

1728
01:01:10,469 --> 01:01:12,469
- You can do it!
- Keep going!

1729
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,809
Your legs look sad.

1730
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:16,710
Don't stop!

1731
01:01:17,650 --> 01:01:18,909
Let's go!

1732
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,980
Here I am. I'm almost there.

1733
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,179
(He arrived using threats
and conciliation.)

1734
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:26,250
Gosh. First, let's park here.

1735
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:29,420
It was about 20 minutes away
from our hotel.

1736
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,360
Right in front of me...

1737
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,860
is the statue of Buddha I saw earlier.

1738
01:01:34,860 --> 01:01:37,400
It's showing off its magnificence.

1739
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:38,630
Can you see it?

1740
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:40,170
- Goodness.
- It's huge.

1741
01:01:40,170 --> 01:01:41,469
- Just look at its graceful figure.
- Gosh.

1742
01:01:41,469 --> 01:01:42,599
- My gosh.
- It's amazing.

1743
01:01:42,599 --> 01:01:45,139
It's big enough to hide the sun.

1744
01:01:45,139 --> 01:01:47,380
(The big Buddha is sitting
in the lotus position in nature.)

1745
01:01:47,840 --> 01:01:50,210
I will show you the landscape...

1746
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,510
that Buddha is looking at, just as it is.

1747
01:01:53,849 --> 01:01:55,079
Here it is.

1748
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,190
- My gosh.
- That's no joke.

1749
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:00,519
I feel like if you pray there,
any wish will come true.

1750
01:02:04,059 --> 01:02:06,530
This landscape is unbelievable.

1751
01:02:08,929 --> 01:02:11,199
Words couldn't express it.

1752
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,630
I was overwhelmed.

1753
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:17,309
Up there, I could see not only Leh...

1754
01:02:17,309 --> 01:02:21,039
but also the village next to it.

1755
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:25,150
The open feeling was beyond great.

1756
01:02:25,150 --> 01:02:26,179
(As if his whole body is opening up)

1757
01:02:26,579 --> 01:02:28,550
Personally, it felt so therapeutic
back then.

1758
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:31,690
But really, a motorcycle and Buddha?

1759
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:33,289
That's unbelievable.

1760
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:34,420
Here's Jealous84.

1761
01:02:34,420 --> 01:02:35,760
This is me.

1762
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:37,889
- That's yours, right?
- He's Regret84.

1763
01:02:37,889 --> 01:02:40,659
- No. I'm grateful he did what I couldn't.
- Is that so?

1764
01:02:40,829 --> 01:02:42,360
- Gosh, Considerate84.
- Jealousy...

1765
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,530
"Considerate84?"

1766
01:02:44,099 --> 01:02:45,469
Why does "84" sound like a bad word?

1767
01:02:46,570 --> 01:02:47,739
It's just your imagination.

1768
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:49,400
- Misunderstanding84.
- Misunderstanding84.

1769
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:51,510
(It's a misunderstanding,
Misunderstanding84.)

1770
01:02:52,110 --> 01:02:54,440
(After enjoying the landscape
for as long as he wanted,)

1771
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:57,610
(he returns to his brothers.)

1772
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:01,849
Good morning.

1773
01:03:01,849 --> 01:03:04,219
- Oh, gosh.
- Your butt...

1774
01:03:04,349 --> 01:03:06,190
He's Bare Bottle.

1775
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,619
"Bare Bottle?"

1776
01:03:08,190 --> 01:03:09,420
Is he awake?

1777
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:10,829
Good morning, Kian84.

1778
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:12,190
Was it nice?

1779
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,199
- It was amazing.
- Really?

1780
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:16,429
Yes. Don't you like motorcycles?

1781
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:17,630
I do.

1782
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:19,269
Then you should've joined me.

1783
01:03:19,269 --> 01:03:22,400
But I like sleeping more than motorcycles.

1784
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:25,969
You're amazing to leave
so early in the morning.

1785
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:28,309
Leh was perfect for Dex.

1786
01:03:28,309 --> 01:03:30,309
- Totally.
- It was the best.

1787
01:03:32,849 --> 01:03:33,949
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1788
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,280
The camping site wasn't close,

1789
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:38,690
so we left early at 8 a.m.

1790
01:03:39,719 --> 01:03:40,789
- Hello.
- Hello.

1791
01:03:40,789 --> 01:03:42,289
- Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

1792
01:03:42,289 --> 01:03:44,559
The road was too rough for us to drive.

1793
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,329
- We couldn't drive up there.
- I see.

1794
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:48,199
So the driver came with the car?

1795
01:03:48,199 --> 01:03:49,630
Yes. The cost included everything.

1796
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,070
Can everything fit in there?

1797
01:03:51,530 --> 01:03:53,530
Look at Dex's luggage.

1798
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:56,469
(Loading the bundle he carried first)

1799
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:58,469
(Yesterday's groceries)

1800
01:03:58,469 --> 01:03:59,809
How can that fit in there?

1801
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,440
(Push it in, and everything will fit.)

1802
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,110
It does fit in there.

1803
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,679
(After loading their things)

1804
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:07,719
(Bump)

1805
01:04:07,820 --> 01:04:08,980
His head touches the door.

1806
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:11,690
(Jealous Bottle again)

1807
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,519
(Glancing)

1808
01:04:13,519 --> 01:04:14,590
- The bag...
- I don't think it'll fit.

1809
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,420
That gear looks cool.

1810
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,960
That looks cool.

1811
01:04:17,960 --> 01:04:18,989
(Jealous84 is jealous again.)

1812
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,559
I packed it for this day.

1813
01:04:21,460 --> 01:04:23,730
- This is tactical equipment.
- What's that?

1814
01:04:24,269 --> 01:04:26,630
(The secret item that Dex packed
before the departure)

1815
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:29,139
(Chest rig)

1816
01:04:29,400 --> 01:04:32,869
(Tactical equipment for easy storage
of ammunition, grenades, and such)

1817
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,380
Is it actually used?

1818
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:35,679
Yes, it's actually used.

1819
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:38,349
But I set it up just for Leh.

1820
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:39,349
(A special set up just for Leh)

1821
01:04:40,179 --> 01:04:41,619
Isn't our equipment too different?

1822
01:04:41,619 --> 01:04:43,849
He's got a knife, but I've got a camera.

1823
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,989
I doubt he'll use...

1824
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:48,989
No. That knife will be handy.

1825
01:04:48,989 --> 01:04:51,260
- When we eat fruit.
- Where's our watermelon?

1826
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,590
- In there.
- Did you pack it? Great.

1827
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,159
(This is "Hanabasi" watermelon.)

1828
01:04:56,159 --> 01:04:57,929
The watermelon you brought...

1829
01:04:57,929 --> 01:04:59,230
- from Amritsar?
- Yes.

1830
01:04:59,269 --> 01:05:00,699
It's one of our members now.

1831
01:05:00,869 --> 01:05:02,369
- Oh, the fourth member.
- Yes.

1832
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:03,800
Get in.

1833
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,869
(After packing
their youngest member, Hanabasi,)

1834
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,210
Nice.

1835
01:05:07,210 --> 01:05:09,409
(the 4 India Brothers are ready to leave.)

1836
01:05:09,409 --> 01:05:11,449
- This is really nice.
- Let's go.

1837
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:12,679
Let's go.

1838
01:05:12,679 --> 01:05:13,710
(Let's go to Puga Hot Springs.)

1839
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,619
(From Leh to Puga Hot Springs)

1840
01:05:15,619 --> 01:05:17,550
- Finally?
- Yes, we're leaving.

1841
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:19,690
- They're off to Puga Hot Springs.
- I'm really curious.

1842
01:05:19,690 --> 01:05:20,789
(Going through the Himalayas)

1843
01:05:21,389 --> 01:05:24,789
Pani Bottle, this place...
I heard something.

1844
01:05:24,929 --> 01:05:27,659
That there was a road...

1845
01:05:27,659 --> 01:05:30,730
that could only be used
when the ice melted.

1846
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:32,829
- Was it called "Rambada?"
- That...

1847
01:05:32,969 --> 01:05:35,500
- There's a village called Manali.
- Yes?

1848
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:38,010
- Manali.
- I had planned to go to Manali...

1849
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:39,710
- by land in the past.
- Right.

1850
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:41,710
- But this area is filled with snow.
- Right.

1851
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:43,679
So the road is open...

1852
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,780
- only for 2 to 3 months.
- I see.

1853
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,849
So getting there by land is hard.

1854
01:05:47,849 --> 01:05:50,219
Is the road currently open or closed?

1855
01:05:50,449 --> 01:05:52,619
I wonder if it's open right now.

1856
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:54,389
- Excuse me?
- Yes.

1857
01:05:54,389 --> 01:05:56,090
- What's your name?
- Lobzang.

1858
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,630
- "Lobsang?"
- Lobzang.

1859
01:05:57,630 --> 01:05:59,429
- Lobsang. Lobzang.
- Lobzang.

1860
01:05:59,429 --> 01:06:02,000
We're now going to Puga.

1861
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,300
Is the road open?

1862
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:04,429
The road is open.

1863
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:06,230
- That's a relief.
- Totally.

1864
01:06:06,230 --> 01:06:08,340
- When did it open?
- Today.

1865
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:10,340
- "Today?" It opened today?
- Is it open?

1866
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,769
- Really?
- It's usually closed.

1867
01:06:12,769 --> 01:06:15,139
Today, the road is open.

1868
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,239
- You're lucky.
- Lucky.

1869
01:06:18,010 --> 01:06:19,750
You've got good energy.

1870
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:23,219
This is when the road usually opens.

1871
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:26,349
It opens around May,
but there's no exact date.

1872
01:06:26,619 --> 01:06:29,159
So drivers find out on the day.

1873
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,360
The weather is getting warmer.

1874
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,699
Must you take that road?

1875
01:06:34,699 --> 01:06:37,099
- There's a different route you can take.
- Yes?

1876
01:06:37,099 --> 01:06:38,969
- But that's a shortcut.
- It's faster.

1877
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,000
(Taking the fastest route possible)

1878
01:06:40,099 --> 01:06:42,139
There's zero fine dust here.

1879
01:06:42,139 --> 01:06:43,570
(Leh's morning is more magical
with the clear weather.)

1880
01:06:43,570 --> 01:06:45,309
How is the atmosphere this different?

1881
01:06:45,309 --> 01:06:47,170
- And it's still India.
- This is crazy.

1882
01:06:47,269 --> 01:06:48,610
The scenery here is great, too.

1883
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,539
Gosh, I'm touched.

1884
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,880
Landscapes don't touch me when I travel,
but this place is different.

1885
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:56,079
If Pani Bottle is touched,

1886
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,750
it means it's the real deal.

1887
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:01,289
Gosh, look at those mountains.

1888
01:07:02,289 --> 01:07:03,659
(They can see huge snowy mountains
as they get out of the center of Leh.)

1889
01:07:03,659 --> 01:07:07,130
It'd be at least 6,000m above sea level.

1890
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,230
How high are we going today?

1891
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,260
About 5,000m?

1892
01:07:10,260 --> 01:07:11,469
(No way)

1893
01:07:11,469 --> 01:07:13,769
How high is this road?

1894
01:07:14,440 --> 01:07:15,599
Taglang La?

1895
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:18,139
It's 5,300m.

1896
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:20,110
(It's 5,300m.)

1897
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,610
- It's 5,000m?
- It's 5,000m?

1898
01:07:21,940 --> 01:07:23,539
It's 5,000m above sea level?

1899
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:25,650
And 300m.

1900
01:07:26,110 --> 01:07:27,150
It's 5,000m?

1901
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:29,780
I'll have altitude sickness
at 5,000m high.

1902
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:30,789
If it's 5,000m...

1903
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,619
Is it the highest in the world?

1904
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:33,849
No, it's the second.

1905
01:07:33,849 --> 01:07:35,559
- It's the second.
- It's the second.

1906
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:38,090
- Will they be okay?
- I've never experienced it.

1907
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:39,360
It made me a little worried.

1908
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:42,500
- Of course, you would be worried.
- It's really high.

1909
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:43,800
(Taglang La used to be
the second-highest road in the world.)

1910
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:47,300
Can you guys sleep at 5,300m high?

1911
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,469
(They need to cross
the rough alpine region.)

1912
01:07:49,840 --> 01:07:50,840
(He checks the altitude in a rush.)

1913
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:53,210
It's currently 3,200m.

1914
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:54,940
How can we go 5,000m?

1915
01:07:55,610 --> 01:07:57,079
- Let's try it.
- I'm scared.

1916
01:07:57,079 --> 01:07:58,880
I want to know how it feels.

1917
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,320
I think I'm going to faint.

1918
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:05,119
I've never seen Pani Bottle
showing his weakness in India.

1919
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,619
- You were always strong.
- No. He's weak.

1920
01:08:09,019 --> 01:08:10,619
(Weak Bottle)

1921
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:12,559
This is nice.

1922
01:08:12,559 --> 01:08:14,500
Just riding in the car feels therapeutic.

1923
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:15,659
(They can see different scenery
outside Leh.)

1924
01:08:15,659 --> 01:08:17,100
- It's beautiful wherever I look.
- It's all picturesque.

1925
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,100
What's this? A cemetery?

1926
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:22,500
I think it has a religious meaning.

1927
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:23,869
It must be Gompa.

1928
01:08:24,310 --> 01:08:25,869
I think things like that are very cool.

1929
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:27,739
Buildings on the mountain.

1930
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:29,180
It's cool. What is it?

1931
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:31,350
- On the left side is Thiksey Monastery.
- Left side?

1932
01:08:31,350 --> 01:08:32,479
- Monastery?
- Thiksey Monastery.

1933
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,380
Monastery. It's a place for monks.

1934
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:35,479
This one?

1935
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,119
(Thiksey Gompa,
a Tibetan Buddhist monastery)

1936
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,890
Buddhist monks live there.

1937
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:41,460
- They do?
- Yes.

1938
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:47,090
The country itself is a religion.

1939
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:50,460
- Look at that.
- The right side is crazy.

1940
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:52,899
I guess it's melted permanent snow.

1941
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,770
Is that a hot spring?

1942
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:59,109
I think the water is that color
because it's from melted glaciers.

1943
01:08:59,739 --> 01:09:01,239
(The emerald river
flowing from the Himalayas)

1944
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:02,739
The emerald color.

1945
01:09:02,739 --> 01:09:03,939
How can the color look like that?

1946
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,149
It feels like we're going
into Mother Nature.

1947
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,020
All I can do is exclaim in awe.

1948
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:12,149
(The unrealistic scenery
makes them exclaim.)

1949
01:09:12,149 --> 01:09:13,189
This is insane.

1950
01:09:14,359 --> 01:09:15,590
The snowy mountains over there.

1951
01:09:15,590 --> 01:09:17,960
(You can clearly see the snowy mountains
even from afar.)

1952
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:20,489
The magnificent...

1953
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,699
(The India Brothers are excited
in front of Mother Nature.)

1954
01:09:23,399 --> 01:09:25,470
- Gosh.
- The mountains are cool.

1955
01:09:25,470 --> 01:09:26,699
Look at this.

1956
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:28,600
Did they put cooking oil on them?

1957
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:30,199
- They look so shiny.
- Right.

1958
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:33,609
It was very exotic scenery.

1959
01:09:33,939 --> 01:09:35,109
It looks like a movie.

1960
01:09:35,109 --> 01:09:36,439
(Three adventurers crossing between them)

1961
01:09:36,439 --> 01:09:38,010
This is crazy.

1962
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,380
(Impressed)

1963
01:09:40,949 --> 01:09:42,680
- Look at the road.
- Look at the snowy peaks.

1964
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,319
It's amazing
that they built the road here.

1965
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,789
- Yes.
- How did they do that?

1966
01:09:45,789 --> 01:09:48,590
It feels like we're far
from civilization now.

1967
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:49,689
(A place shut off from civilization
where time stopped)

1968
01:09:50,260 --> 01:09:51,689
There's no trace of people.

1969
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:53,859
It feels like it's completely shut off
from civilization.

1970
01:09:54,399 --> 01:09:57,930
(Into the deeper spectrums
of Mother Nature)

1971
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,199
There might be leopards and stuff here.

1972
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:04,409
Can we find some leopards here?

1973
01:10:04,569 --> 01:10:06,010
- Leopards?
- Leopards. Yes.

1974
01:10:06,010 --> 01:10:08,180
Snow leopards. Yes. Really big.

1975
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:09,279
- Snow leopards.
- Big?

1976
01:10:10,010 --> 01:10:12,149
(Snow leopards are called
the spirit of the Himalayas.)

1977
01:10:12,149 --> 01:10:13,579
They're so cool.

1978
01:10:13,579 --> 01:10:15,220
(Snow leopards that are called
the Spirit of the Himalayas)

1979
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:16,680
- Oh, my.
- "Marmot?"

1980
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,550
(Marmots that are often seen
in mountainous areas)

1981
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,220
- They're cute.
- They're cute.

1982
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:21,560
There were marmots too?

1983
01:10:21,890 --> 01:10:23,489
(Mountain goats)

1984
01:10:23,489 --> 01:10:25,689
(Goats)

1985
01:10:25,689 --> 01:10:27,390
(Camels)

1986
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,630
(Yaks)

1987
01:10:29,100 --> 01:10:31,800
Even the animals look mysterious.

1988
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,100
They look different.

1989
01:10:33,100 --> 01:10:34,470
- Leopards?
- Leopards. Yes.

1990
01:10:34,470 --> 01:10:35,699
- Snow leopards. Yes.
- Leopards?

1991
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:36,970
Really big.

1992
01:10:36,970 --> 01:10:38,539
- Leopards...
- Yes. Leopards.

1993
01:10:38,539 --> 01:10:39,810
attack humans?

1994
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:40,810
No.

1995
01:10:40,810 --> 01:10:42,880
- They attack animals only.
- Okay.

1996
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:46,010
(Staring)

1997
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:48,619
This side is... How should I put it?

1998
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,720
- It's purple.
- You mean the soil?

1999
01:10:50,720 --> 01:10:53,619
- Yes. It has a hint of purple.
- You're right. It has a hint of purple.

2000
01:10:54,090 --> 01:10:55,590
If one of us majored in science,

2001
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:57,590
- he would've explained the substances...
- Right?

2002
01:10:57,590 --> 01:10:58,789
- that make the rocks purple.
- It's probably...

2003
01:10:58,789 --> 01:11:00,329
I majored in science.

2004
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:01,630
Why are the rocks purple?

2005
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:02,800
I have no idea.

2006
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,300
(Confident)

2007
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,369
- It's nice that he's confident.
- Right.

2008
01:11:06,699 --> 01:11:08,100
It's all purple.

2009
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:09,640
- As if there's a filter.
- Why is it...

2010
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:10,739
- that color?
- The colors.

2011
01:11:10,770 --> 01:11:12,840
Let me explain
as someone who majored in liberal arts.

2012
01:11:12,840 --> 01:11:16,340
The mountains
are in a mysterious purple color...

2013
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,979
because of iron, cobalt, and copper.

2014
01:11:21,779 --> 01:11:25,020
- The river is purple.
- The river is purple.

2015
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:27,050
(Even the river is purple.)

2016
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,960
- A pink river.
- Yes. A pink river.

2017
01:11:29,590 --> 01:11:31,760
I've never seen a purple river
in my whole life.

2018
01:11:32,289 --> 01:11:34,189
- It's like I'm wearing colored lenses.
- Right?

2019
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:36,560
It really looks like that in real life.

2020
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,630
That's so cool.

2021
01:11:38,470 --> 01:11:41,239
With this kind of scenery,
when I open the tent...

2022
01:11:41,239 --> 01:11:44,140
after waking up in the morning and see
a world like this, it'll feel amazing.

2023
01:11:44,140 --> 01:11:45,140
Yes.

2024
01:11:45,140 --> 01:11:46,840
I could camp if it's a place like this.

2025
01:11:47,739 --> 01:11:49,180
If we camp today,

2026
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:51,750
it'd be our first time sleeping outside
during this trip.

2027
01:11:52,050 --> 01:11:53,779
- You're right.
- To sleep outside,

2028
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:57,380
you need to prepare so many things.

2029
01:11:57,920 --> 01:11:59,550
The romance doesn't last long.

2030
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:00,649
Right.

2031
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:03,390
"When will I ever get to do it
if not today?"

2032
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:04,689
We should think like that.

2033
01:12:05,329 --> 01:12:07,390
(Excited)

2034
01:12:07,390 --> 01:12:09,100
I'm so sleepy, but I can't sleep.

2035
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,460
I need to look at the scenery more.

2036
01:12:12,399 --> 01:12:13,500
Oh, no.

2037
01:12:13,899 --> 01:12:15,069
He's sleeping right away.

2038
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:17,670
Apparently, drowsiness is one
of the symptoms of altitude sickness.

2039
01:12:17,909 --> 01:12:19,569
(Laughing)

2040
01:12:20,170 --> 01:12:22,279
(While Altitude Bottle is sleeping...)

2041
01:12:22,279 --> 01:12:23,710
What did you do in high school?

2042
01:12:24,109 --> 01:12:26,409
What were you like in high school?

2043
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,149
I did nothing.

2044
01:12:28,779 --> 01:12:29,779
For real.

2045
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:31,420
I was very mischievous.

2046
01:12:31,619 --> 01:12:33,750
I was mischievous and skinny.

2047
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:35,020
Were you skinny back then?

2048
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:36,890
I was very skinny.

2049
01:12:37,689 --> 01:12:38,689
(He was a skinny anchovy, not a catfish.)

2050
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:39,960
He was very skinny.

2051
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,000
I always watched animations.

2052
01:12:42,600 --> 01:12:43,829
I always stayed at home.

2053
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:46,270
When I was a student, my mom told me...

2054
01:12:46,270 --> 01:12:47,800
- to go out with her...
- Yes.

2055
01:12:48,199 --> 01:12:49,470
to buy clothes for me.

2056
01:12:49,470 --> 01:12:51,840
I was like, "I don't want to.
I'll stay at home."

2057
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,010
(When he was Little Dex)

2058
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:54,909
- But as I got to know about UDT,
- Yes.

2059
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:57,909
I worked out 2 or 3 times a day.

2060
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:02,380
Thanks to that, I get to travel with you.

2061
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:03,750
The same goes for me.

2062
01:13:03,750 --> 01:13:05,789
- With Pani Bottle.
- Meeting you and Pani Bottle...

2063
01:13:05,789 --> 01:13:09,060
is one of the luckiest things
that happened in my life.

2064
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,159
I'm happy about it.

2065
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,800
It was so nice to talk about life
with Kian84 like this.

2066
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:16,430
We spent five hours in the car.

2067
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:17,899
We obviously didn't have any cell service.

2068
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:19,300
So we started talking naturally.

2069
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,770
You had a heart-to-heart.

2070
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:21,869
(The India Brothers strengthened
their bond, thanks to the long travel.)

2071
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:23,640
What? It's a village.

2072
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,069
There's a village
this deep in the mountains.

2073
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:29,380
I can't believe that there was a village
like that in Mother Nature.

2074
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:31,609
I didn't sleep a wink for five hours.

2075
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:33,409
- Did you keep looking at the scenery?
- Yes. The scenery was interesting.

2076
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,619
He made sure to look.

2077
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:37,890
I didn't feel so excited about looking
outside the window for a long time.

2078
01:13:37,890 --> 01:13:39,720
Because it has different backgrounds.

2079
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:42,060
(When he's immersed in the scenery)

2080
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:43,590
Hey, we're 4,400m high.

2081
01:13:46,229 --> 01:13:48,159
- Were you okay?
- They couldn't answer.

2082
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:51,229
You were the winner.

2083
01:13:51,229 --> 01:13:53,300
So that's how I slept.
I slept with my mouth open.

2084
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,399
You really didn't sleep.

2085
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:56,300
It was fun for me.

2086
01:13:57,810 --> 01:13:59,010
Can you see that?

2087
01:13:59,569 --> 01:14:02,039
I could see the snow...

2088
01:14:02,039 --> 01:14:04,710
from far down the road earlier.

2089
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,010
India is a mix of every season.

2090
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,079
You can feel all 4 seasons in 1 season.

2091
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:12,289
Cold, dry, and hot.

2092
01:14:12,449 --> 01:14:14,920
It's a mix of everything.

2093
01:14:15,260 --> 01:14:19,130
Every city feels different.

2094
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:20,630
Now,

2095
01:14:22,159 --> 01:14:25,699
the altitude is 4,828m.

2096
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,800
- Gosh.
- The sky is getting closer.

2097
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,600
(It's getting higher and higher.)

2098
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,539
I've been to the highest place in Peru.

2099
01:14:33,739 --> 01:14:35,210
I think we'll go even higher than that.

2100
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,779
(Surpassing the 4,700m point,
the highest altitude in Season 1!)

2101
01:14:38,779 --> 01:14:41,149
I thought
I adapted to the high altitude...

2102
01:14:41,149 --> 01:14:44,119
more easily than when I was in Peru.

2103
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:47,189
But it's a little hard to breathe.

2104
01:14:48,619 --> 01:14:52,189
Because of the blinding sunlight,
I was frowning as well.

2105
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:53,289
You should've worn sunglasses.

2106
01:14:54,489 --> 01:14:57,560
But I took medicine
for altitude sickness...

2107
01:14:57,930 --> 01:15:00,729
yesterday and this morning.
So I think I feel a little better.

2108
01:15:00,729 --> 01:15:02,340
(He took medicine for altitude sickness
in advance.)

2109
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,470
The scenery...

2110
01:15:04,470 --> 01:15:05,970
(While he's enjoying the alpine area,
the snowy mountains are getting closer.)

2111
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,470
is out of this world.

2112
01:15:07,470 --> 01:15:08,979
(While he's enjoying the alpine area,
the snowy mountains are getting closer.)

2113
01:15:09,539 --> 01:15:10,680
We surpassed the 5,000m point.

2114
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:13,810
- It's 5,000m.
- It's 5,000m.

2115
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:15,180
(They already surpassed
an altitude of 5,000m.)

2116
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:16,449
Look at the scenery.

2117
01:15:19,949 --> 01:15:21,119
(It's been a desolate mountainous road.)

2118
01:15:21,119 --> 01:15:22,460
It's so pretty.

2119
01:15:23,390 --> 01:15:24,829
(It slowly turned into a snowy road.)

2120
01:15:24,829 --> 01:15:26,189
The season has changed.

2121
01:15:26,529 --> 01:15:28,029
- It's winter.
- It was just...

2122
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:29,130
(The snowy mountains
finally showed themselves.)

2123
01:15:29,659 --> 01:15:31,329
Pani Bottle, you should look at this side.

2124
01:15:32,100 --> 01:15:33,670
(The eldest's words woke him up.)

2125
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:35,140
I can't believe we came up that road.

2126
01:15:35,140 --> 01:15:36,800
(The younger ones who opened their eyes
are impressed by the snowy mountains.)

2127
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:40,170
(We should enjoy
the beautiful scenery together.)

2128
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:43,979
(Driving on the rough road,)

2129
01:15:43,979 --> 01:15:45,279
Isn't it crazy?

2130
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,250
- It's like magic.
- It's insane.

2131
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,250
(they finally face the snowy mountains.)

2132
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,750
(They're running out of breath.)

2133
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:53,720
They need to camp as well.
Will they be all right?

2134
01:15:54,090 --> 01:15:56,289
After reaching an altitude
of about 5,000m...

2135
01:15:56,460 --> 01:15:58,159
It was a bit hard to breathe.

2136
01:15:58,159 --> 01:15:59,430
(The two older ones are relying
on oxygen canisters.)

2137
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:00,590
I'm out of breath.

2138
01:16:00,789 --> 01:16:03,100
(Groaning excitedly)

2139
01:16:03,699 --> 01:16:07,569
For me, the higher the altitude,
the more energetic I got.

2140
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,739
- Like you were on top of the world.
- Yes.

2141
01:16:10,439 --> 01:16:12,310
(How adorable.)

2142
01:16:13,170 --> 01:16:15,939
(Coughing)

2143
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:17,810
I don't get headaches.

2144
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,779
What is a headache? I don't know.

2145
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,619
You're strong.

2146
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:24,020
You're resistant to alpine areas.

2147
01:16:24,020 --> 01:16:25,920
When else would I get to see
something like this?

2148
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:27,220
(The view has become as vast
as the height of the altitude.)

2149
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:29,020
This is paradise.

2150
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,220
(The view has become as vast
as the height of the altitude.)

2151
01:16:30,359 --> 01:16:32,890
We just surpassed 5,200m.

2152
01:16:33,029 --> 01:16:34,460
We just surpassed 5,200m.

2153
01:16:36,460 --> 01:16:37,970
Hey, look.

2154
01:16:38,029 --> 01:16:39,430
- Can we make it through?
- Hey.

2155
01:16:39,430 --> 01:16:41,270
- We can't.
- We can't.

2156
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:42,500
(The road narrowed sharply.)

2157
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,510
I found out here
what opening the road means.

2158
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,210
This part had to open up.

2159
01:16:47,439 --> 01:16:50,109
- If we fall, we'll... Slow.
- Gosh, slowly.

2160
01:16:50,109 --> 01:16:51,350
- Slow.
- Slow.

2161
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:54,279
- Thanks to the veteran driver...
- Right.

2162
01:16:54,279 --> 01:16:56,220
- The road is extremely tough.
- Yes.

2163
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,789
Seeing this confirms that this place is...

2164
01:16:59,789 --> 01:17:01,420
only open for two months.

2165
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:05,189
I'm so curious as to who cleared
this path, why and for what.

2166
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:07,529
How did they clear this path?

2167
01:17:09,399 --> 01:17:10,899
Gosh, there's a snowstorm.

2168
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:13,300
What? Snow's coming in.

2169
01:17:13,770 --> 01:17:15,699
Snow's coming in. Look.

2170
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:17,800
("Frozen" in India)

2171
01:17:17,869 --> 01:17:19,039
Look.

2172
01:17:19,039 --> 01:17:20,239
(Excited)

2173
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:23,340
- Snow's coming in.
- Gosh, it's cold.

2174
01:17:23,479 --> 01:17:24,880
Gosh, it's snow.

2175
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,180
(Pure)

2176
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,479
- Be careful.
- Did snow get inside?

2177
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:29,649
(They can reach out and touch the snow.)

2178
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:30,779
Gosh, that's cold.

2179
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:32,619
It's so cold.

2180
01:17:34,119 --> 01:17:36,619
(He's cleaning his face
with the snow on his hand.)

2181
01:17:37,359 --> 01:17:39,189
Permanent snow.

2182
01:17:39,659 --> 01:17:42,829
Permanent snow. A bit of permanent snow.

2183
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:45,399
(Taking a bite)

2184
01:17:45,699 --> 01:17:48,039
(They can't believe
he just ate permanent snow.)

2185
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:50,699
Gosh, he ate that.

2186
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:53,140
(Delicious)

2187
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:56,340
So this is 10,000-year-old snow.

2188
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,180
Kian84 is eating snow.

2189
01:17:59,350 --> 01:18:00,510
Hey, you guys should try it too.

2190
01:18:00,510 --> 01:18:02,149
When else would we have
the chance to eat 10,000-year-old snow?

2191
01:18:02,149 --> 01:18:03,220
- Is it edible?
- Yes.

2192
01:18:03,479 --> 01:18:04,750
The snow isn't 10,000 years old.

2193
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,619
It just doesn't melt all year long.

2194
01:18:06,619 --> 01:18:07,689
- Really?
- Yes.

2195
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,260
The snow just...

2196
01:18:09,659 --> 01:18:11,220
- Tastes the same, right?
- tastes the same.

2197
01:18:11,829 --> 01:18:14,329
Whether it's 10,000-year-old snow,
or we go to a shaved ice place.

2198
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,659
- Look at the snow.
- It's all snow from here.

2199
01:18:18,699 --> 01:18:21,800
There's no shadow on the white snow.

2200
01:18:21,800 --> 01:18:23,239
Right, I don't see any shadows.

2201
01:18:23,439 --> 01:18:25,539
I think it's because the sun is too close.

2202
01:18:25,539 --> 01:18:27,539
It's too bright that my eyes hurt.

2203
01:18:27,539 --> 01:18:28,880
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2204
01:18:29,409 --> 01:18:30,680
- This could be...
- Gosh.

2205
01:18:30,680 --> 01:18:32,149
This is hurting my eyes like crazy.

2206
01:18:32,279 --> 01:18:33,380
You have to train your eyes.

2207
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:34,880
I can't any longer.

2208
01:18:35,079 --> 01:18:36,479
This is my limit.

2209
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,590
He finally declared his defeat.

2210
01:18:38,750 --> 01:18:41,350
I'm feeling altitude sickness too.
I admit it.

2211
01:18:41,350 --> 01:18:43,090
- You admit it too, right?
- Admit it now.

2212
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,659
- Put your sunglasses on.
- Yes.

2213
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,659
I'll end my eye training here.

2214
01:18:49,329 --> 01:18:50,729
I think 4,000m is my limit.

2215
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:54,770
To be exact, it's not that
I don't get altitude sickness.

2216
01:18:54,770 --> 01:18:56,569
I don't get it up until about 4,000m.

2217
01:18:56,869 --> 01:18:58,869
But if I go any higher, I get it.

2218
01:18:59,010 --> 01:19:01,340
Right now, I have altitude sickness.

2219
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:04,310
- He finally admitted it.
- It took him a while, but he admitted it.

2220
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:07,109
There's construction going on over there.

2221
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:09,920
At that altitude?

2222
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:11,420
They're removing snow.

2223
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:12,689
They are.

2224
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:14,390
He must have cleared the road.

2225
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:16,619
- Goodness. His hard work.
- Gosh.

2226
01:19:17,090 --> 01:19:18,659
He's eating by himself.

2227
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,329
It must be very dangerous for him.

2228
01:19:21,329 --> 01:19:22,899
He's working here all by himself.

2229
01:19:22,899 --> 01:19:24,630
- He looks so lonely.
- Right.

2230
01:19:24,630 --> 01:19:26,829
So he removed the snow
yesterday and today.

2231
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:28,399
Gosh, that's amazing.

2232
01:19:28,399 --> 01:19:30,170
Thanks to him, we get to look around here.

2233
01:19:33,569 --> 01:19:34,739
We're at 5,300m.

2234
01:19:34,979 --> 01:19:37,539
- We surpassed 5,300m.
- We surpassed 5,300m.

2235
01:19:38,609 --> 01:19:40,550
How high are you going up?

2236
01:19:40,579 --> 01:19:42,649
I wasn't even sure anymore at that point.

2237
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:44,279
- You keep going up.
- You're about to reach the sky.

2238
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:49,390
- I'm breathing but it feels insufficient.
- Yes.

2239
01:19:50,520 --> 01:19:52,430
I keep sighing.

2240
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,329
Right. I keep sighing.

2241
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:55,699
(Sighing)

2242
01:19:56,699 --> 01:19:58,060
I see a tent out there.

2243
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:01,569
Is that the summit?

2244
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:06,210
(They find a new place
and make a stop for the first time.)

2245
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:10,479
(Taglang La, 5,328m)

2246
01:20:10,479 --> 01:20:14,310
The driver drove up the narrow road
all tensed up.

2247
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:16,279
Once the road was cleared enough,

2248
01:20:16,279 --> 01:20:18,520
- we decided to take a break.
- Good.

2249
01:20:20,189 --> 01:20:22,619
(He's in a rush.)

2250
01:20:22,989 --> 01:20:24,659
(Gosh)

2251
01:20:25,189 --> 01:20:27,289
Gosh, it's cold. Goodness.

2252
01:20:27,659 --> 01:20:28,859
It's so hot.

2253
01:20:28,899 --> 01:20:31,199
Right. It was midsummer weather before.

2254
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:33,529
(Current temperature, minus 12°C)

2255
01:20:33,529 --> 01:20:35,640
That's like polar opposites.

2256
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:38,140
Wait, this is insane.

2257
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:40,010
- It's cold, isn't it?
- I could freeze to death.

2258
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:42,609
(The vast scenery is worthy
of the high altitude and cold.)

2259
01:20:42,609 --> 01:20:44,479
It's totally different
from how it was in the car.

2260
01:20:44,479 --> 01:20:45,550
Right.

2261
01:20:45,550 --> 01:20:47,050
(The vast scenery is worthy
of the high altitude and cold.)

2262
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:49,850
Breathing is very comfortable for me.

2263
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:51,149
(It's not comfortable at all
for the two older ones.)

2264
01:20:51,149 --> 01:20:53,649
It kind of feels like you're walking
around with a gas mask on.

2265
01:20:53,649 --> 01:20:55,890
It feels like you're breathing with
a piece of paper in front of your mouth.

2266
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:56,989
Right.

2267
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:00,930
What's that building?

2268
01:21:01,659 --> 01:21:03,560
It must be symbolic of the summit.

2269
01:21:03,560 --> 01:21:05,100
I think so too. In Korea,

2270
01:21:05,100 --> 01:21:07,470
we have stone monuments at summits.

2271
01:21:08,340 --> 01:21:11,710
Taglang La is 5,328m above sea level,

2272
01:21:11,710 --> 01:21:15,279
and it is located at the highest point
of the Leh Manali Highway.

2273
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,810
Depending on the snow situation,
the road must be cleared to get there.

2274
01:21:18,810 --> 01:21:20,149
Because of the picturesque mountain range

2275
01:21:20,149 --> 01:21:22,949
and the vast landscape of Ladakh,

2276
01:21:22,949 --> 01:21:24,750
Taglang La is where
travelers wish to visit...

2277
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,350
at least once when the road is open.

2278
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,989
(Travelers wish to visit
Taglang La at least once.)

2279
01:21:30,460 --> 01:21:31,630
Does anyone live there?

2280
01:21:33,060 --> 01:21:35,300
Is this like a base camp?

2281
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:37,060
Or it could be a shelter.

2282
01:21:38,029 --> 01:21:39,229
Excuse me?

2283
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:41,800
(Knocking)

2284
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,039
Excuse me?

2285
01:21:43,569 --> 01:21:44,640
What is this?

2286
01:21:45,239 --> 01:21:46,270
What?

2287
01:21:46,539 --> 01:21:47,970
- The door opens?
- The door opens.

2288
01:21:47,970 --> 01:21:48,979
Yes.

2289
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,039
What's inside?

2290
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,239
(The inside of the building is lined with
various religious symbols.)

2291
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,979
Some kind of religious objects.

2292
01:21:54,250 --> 01:21:56,619
- It's a shrine?
- It's a shrine.

2293
01:21:56,619 --> 01:21:58,020
Let's pray and go.

2294
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,920
That's a Hindu temple.

2295
01:21:59,920 --> 01:22:01,319
That's Sikhism.

2296
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,689
All the deities are here.

2297
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:04,460
- All the religions are here.
- Yes.

2298
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:06,489
It's like "Olympus Guardian."

2299
01:22:07,229 --> 01:22:09,100
- It is.
- "Olympus Guardian" of India.

2300
01:22:09,460 --> 01:22:11,130
- All right. Let's pray.
- Save me.

2301
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:12,470
Let's pray.

2302
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:15,270
To the deities of Hinduism, Buddhism,
Christianity, and Islam...

2303
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,800
Please help us travel safe and sound...

2304
01:22:18,470 --> 01:22:20,340
until the very end.

2305
01:22:20,810 --> 01:22:22,939
Someone must have stopped by.

2306
01:22:22,939 --> 01:22:24,779
- This candle is still lit.
- You're right.

2307
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:26,979
Gosh, I feel warmth somehow
from seeing that.

2308
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:31,180
Dear deities, we'll get going now.

2309
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,989
Hey.

2310
01:22:35,260 --> 01:22:37,289
Kian84, stand over here and look that way.

2311
01:22:38,460 --> 01:22:40,359
The flags and the view behind them
are so amazing.

2312
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:41,630
Do you want to take pictures before we go?

2313
01:22:41,630 --> 01:22:44,399
- Pictures? Dex.
- Polaroid. I'll go bring it.

2314
01:22:45,399 --> 01:22:47,430
(Photo Bottle brought a camera
to make good memories with.)

2315
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,670
I'll take individual pictures
of each of you.

2316
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:51,600
- Dex first.
- Dex first.

2317
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:52,640
Me?

2318
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:56,210
(The two older ones are being sweet
by taking care of the youngest first.)

2319
01:22:57,109 --> 01:23:00,250
(Thanks to them,
Dex got a great picture taken of him.)

2320
01:23:00,250 --> 01:23:02,920
At first, we began driving from Leh.

2321
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:05,949
We asked the driver
if the road was open today,

2322
01:23:05,949 --> 01:23:09,220
and he said it opened this morning.

2323
01:23:09,220 --> 01:23:10,920
It's like the deities helped us.

2324
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,789
I think this was a good start.

2325
01:23:14,590 --> 01:23:16,300
Kian84, take a picture of me here, please.

2326
01:23:16,460 --> 01:23:17,829
- With this?
- Yes.

2327
01:23:18,029 --> 01:23:20,069
(He's posing in front of
the Taglang La sign.)

2328
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:22,270
One, two, three.

2329
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:27,409
The sun was bright
so the pictures turned out nice.

2330
01:23:27,569 --> 01:23:30,340
Taking pictures together
and sharing them...

2331
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:32,949
is the best gift ever when you travel.

2332
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:35,050
I feel very proud.

2333
01:23:38,750 --> 01:23:40,390
I've done a lot of the things
I wanted to do so far.

2334
01:23:41,090 --> 01:23:42,989
So I said,
"You do whatever you want to do,"

2335
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:47,460
and I decided to follow the guys around
as they do what they wanted to do.

2336
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,460
I like it.

2337
01:23:49,460 --> 01:23:51,000
(The trip has become more satisfying.)

2338
01:23:51,770 --> 01:23:54,000
(That's how we made memories
brighter than the snow mountains.)

2339
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:56,869
- That's great.
- That's great.

2340
01:23:56,869 --> 01:23:58,340
(A close-up of India without any plans,
Adventure by Accident 2)

2341
01:23:58,340 --> 01:23:59,869
That's the poster.

2342
01:23:59,869 --> 01:24:01,539
- Gosh.
- That's the poster.

2343
01:24:01,539 --> 01:24:02,779
That's this one.

2344
01:24:03,180 --> 01:24:04,909
That's the story behind the poster.

2345
01:24:05,779 --> 01:24:09,180
(A moment the India Brothers
will never forget)

2346
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:15,859
(It's saved in its entirety
at Pani Bottle's home too.)

2347
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:19,189
(Driving below
the blinding snow mountains)

2348
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:23,329
(From the ice wall region
to the desert region)

2349

(Puga Hot Springs)

2351
01:24:29,170 --> 01:24:31,439
(But from making chopsticks
out in the wild...)

2352
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,869
(to starting a fire
with natural materials?)

2353
01:24:34,210 --> 01:24:36,180
(Why does this feel like a survival show
all of a sudden?)

2354
01:24:36,710 --> 01:24:39,149
(Still, let's do everything
we want to do here before we leave!)

2355
01:24:39,449 --> 01:24:41,250
(This is my favorite moment
since we came camping.)

2356
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:44,250
(They're huddled together,
sharing warmth.)

2357
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:49,590
(They wanted to be right next
to each other on their last night.)

2358
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:54,390
(But now it's time for
the India Brothers to say goodbye.)

2359
01:24:54,659 --> 01:24:57,329
(I suddenly feel very alone.)

2360
01:24:57,800 --> 01:25:01,199
(They don't want to leave.)

2361
01:25:02,399 --> 01:25:06,810
(It's sad, but goodbye, India Brothers.)

2362
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:11,479
(And now, his solo journey begins again.)

2363
01:25:13,109 --> 01:25:15,250
(I feel very lonely.)

2364
01:25:15,250 --> 01:25:17,550
(I feel their absence.)

2365
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:22,220
(After driving a lonesome road, he arrived
at the village closest to the sky.)

2366
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:25,119
(He's making new local friends
on his trip...)

2367
01:25:26,029 --> 01:25:28,390
(to fill the void left
by the two India Brothers.)
