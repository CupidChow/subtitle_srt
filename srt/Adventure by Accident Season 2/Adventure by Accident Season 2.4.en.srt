1
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:12,309
(An endless, wild dance party)

2
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,210
(Will they be able to meet
the groom today?)

3
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,480
(It's still fun on stage.)

4
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,150
(He manages to end it with hugs.)

5
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,320
- Thank you!
- Okay!

6
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,420
- Just watching this makes me tired.
- Thank you.

7
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,689
- Gosh.
- It's tiring.

8
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,589
Okay.

9
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:28,920
(He finally escapes the endless loop
of dancing.)

10
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,029
(Breathing roughly)

11
00:01:31,029 --> 00:01:32,560
(Exhausted)

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,700
That was intense.

13
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:36,729
- It was so tiring.
- Kian84!

14
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,270
- Oh, my.
- Yes.

15
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,569
Lohit is looking for him.

16
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,869
- Are you okay?
- They're taking him again.

17
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,969
(Get up.)

18
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:46,039
- He's being arrested.
- Please let him go.

19
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,880
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

20
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,579
Okay.

21
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:51,709
I'm okay. Thank you.

22
00:01:51,709 --> 00:01:53,219
(Escorted to the front of a strong fan)

23
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,980
Thank you.

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,789
- You...
- Kian84! What's going on?

25
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,490
- Sit down.
- What?

26
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,060
Are you feeling okay?

27
00:02:00,289 --> 00:02:01,959
Very happy.

28
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,529
- Okay.
- Very good time.

29
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,329
- You're the best dancer.
- Give him a drink.

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,100
I'm okay.

31
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,399
- No. You sit.
- Okay.

32
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,800
(I'll get going.)

33
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,199
(Sit down.)

34
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,770
Okay. Thank you.

35
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,740
Oh, my.
You're taking such good care of me.

36
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,610
They did everything for him.

37
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:21,880
Only the location has changed,
but it's just like the massage.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,449
(Focused care)

39
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:24,709
(What is Dex doing
while Kian84 is getting attention?)

40
00:02:24,709 --> 00:02:25,919
Where is Dex?

41
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:29,250
Dex is watching from over there.

42
00:02:29,589 --> 00:02:30,850
I wanted to go to him,

43
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,089
but there were so many people around him.

44
00:02:33,089 --> 00:02:34,319
It was hard to go to him.

45
00:02:34,419 --> 00:02:36,059
Let's go and have you take your seat.

46
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:39,089
- Okay. Let's go, Lohit.
- Let's go.

47
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,600
You're very funny.

48
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,030
Very funny?

49
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,729
(The India lover takes his seat.)

50
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:48,140
Gosh. They're taking such good care of me.

51
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,740
(Touched)

52
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,839
They're taking better care of me
than they did at the Baeksang Arts Awards.

53
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,209
I feel like a superstar.

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,250
Is this what BTS feels like?

55
00:02:59,419 --> 00:03:00,780
Okay. Excuse me.

56
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,419
(The super introvert
finally squeezes through.)

57
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:05,119
It's okay. You should sit.

58
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:07,089
- No! Sit here.
- Okay.

59
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:10,429
She's a shy boy.

60
00:03:10,429 --> 00:03:11,890
- Shy boy.
- She?

61
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:13,259
- You're a shy boy.
- Oh, my.

62
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:15,500
- Sorry.
- Shy boy.

63
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:18,769
His sweat.

64
00:03:19,069 --> 00:03:21,639
I think I'm losing more weight
than I did while wrestling.

65
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,539
Is it harder than wrestling?

66
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:25,239
It's almost as hard.

67
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,739
Oh, good.

68
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,079
Do you need water?

69
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:31,650
Lohit. I'm okay. I'm fine.

70
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:34,120
- I'll take care of you.
- Okay.

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,449
Yes, boss.

72
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:37,289
You're so kind.

73
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:41,259
- Because I was having fun at the wedding,
- Right.

74
00:03:41,259 --> 00:03:44,359
- he wanted to thank me. I could feel it.
- Right.

75
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:46,900
- He must be so thankful.
- Yes. You were the best wedding guest.

76
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,299
- Yes.
- Bye.

77
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,699
Yes. Study hard.

78
00:03:52,669 --> 00:03:53,840
(The groom is nowhere to be seen.)

79
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,900
- The groom still hasn't arrived.
- He still hadn't arrived.

80
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,910
(Current time 10 p.m.,
Waiting for 2 hours)

81
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,139
(Sound of a drum)

82
00:04:00,139 --> 00:04:01,739
What is that sound?
It sounds like someone is beating a drum.

83
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:04,109
He's coming.

84
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,979
He's coming.

85
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,690
Oh, finally!

86
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,289
(The groom's procession appears.)

87
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,720
But seriously, look at that.

88
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,590
If you see it,
you'll understand why they were late.

89
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,030
That must be it. Right there.

90
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:20,100
The carriage?

91
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,660
They're just standing there.

92
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:23,370
No, they're coming at that speed.

93
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,630
They're moving at a very slow speed.

94
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,569
The groom rides
an elephant, horse, or carriage.

95
00:04:28,569 --> 00:04:31,739
- They move with friends who are dancing.
- Right.

96
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,539
- Right.
- It's part of the ceremony.

97
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:35,940
- That's why it takes a long time.
- They were moving very slowly.

98
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,979
Is it okay to be loud on the street?

99
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,949
This area is surrounded by wedding venues.

100
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,049
There are several parties like that
going on in the area.

101
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,289
- Right.
- I see.

102
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:48,090
Right. And this is Indian culture,

103
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,460
- Right.
- so people don't file complaints.

104
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,530
I think it's just a part of their lives.

105
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:53,759
That's interesting.

106
00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:55,829
Should we go and look?

107
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,930
Let's go.

108
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,329
(Excitedly going to greet the groom)

109
00:04:59,329 --> 00:05:00,370
(Sound of an explosion)

110
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,269
(Even fireworks at a wedding)

111
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:03,810
Oh, they have fireworks.

112
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:06,840
(The groom has arrived.)

113
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,039
- How wild. The scale is crazy.
- How impressive.

114
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:12,509
Gosh. This is insane.

115
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:14,449
They're dancing.

116
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,590
It's a club over there.

117
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,419
- They came like that?
- Yes. The whole time.

118
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm curious about how the groom looks.

119
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,390
Yes. Let's get a look.

120
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,929
(Waiting for the procession to arrive)

121
00:05:27,929 --> 00:05:29,629
They are coming this way, right?

122
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,030
(Even after 5 minutes...)

123
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:34,900
(Even after 10 minutes,
they're almost in the same spot.)

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,470
The car is moving right now.

125
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,080
(They're barely moving
because they're busy dancing.)

126
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,450
They're going 5m per minute.

127
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,580
I guess they don't get tired.

128
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,720
Seeing that,
I'm surprised they've come all this way.

129
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:50,650
(After waiting for a long time)

130
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:52,619
Gosh. Even after speeding up the video...

131
00:05:55,189 --> 00:05:58,460
Gosh. It's insane how energetic they are.

132
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:02,869
(Oh, yes!)

133
00:06:02,869 --> 00:06:04,799
Lohit is over there.

134
00:06:06,869 --> 00:06:08,340
Lohit.

135
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,640
Lohit is excited.

136
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,669
(Thrusting his hips)

137
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:12,979
Lohit's happy right now.

138
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,010
- His stamina is insane.
- Right. His sister is getting married.

139
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,710
(Laughing)

140
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,549
Gosh. Lohit is so funny.

141
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,619
- It's here.
- It's finally here.

142
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,090
- He came in a carriage.
- Yes, a carriage.

143
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:27,419
(Groom)

144
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,660
Why is the groom's face like that?

145
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,989
He looks tired.

146
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,359
He must be tired.

147
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:36,999
Will the wedding begin
now that the groom has arrived?

148
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:38,729
Oh, well...

149
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:41,669
(The groom's procession has arrived.)

150
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,140
(But the groom isn't coming down
from the carriage.)

151
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,510
(Lohit, who was dancing,
is suddenly fighting?)

152
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,739
Are they fighting?

153
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:49,850
- Are they fighting?
- Really?

154
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,150
Why are they fighting?

155
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,249
Are they really fighting?

156
00:06:55,379 --> 00:06:56,950
- Because of money.
- Oh, money?

157
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:00,059
From what I was told, for the groom...

158
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:02,960
to get off of the carriage
and enter the wedding venue,

159
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,600
he has to make a deal
with the carriage owner.

160
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,859
It's just like the culture of delivering
a box of wedding gifts in Korea.

161
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:10,570
- We do have something similar.
- That's interesting.

162
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:14,340
They're having some trouble...

163
00:07:14,869 --> 00:07:16,439
with the payment.

164
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,570
Lohit's role is big.

165
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,640
So, here...

166
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,640
(The groom couldn't get off
even after arriving due to the quarrel.)

167
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,979
Lohit looks cool for taking care of that.

168
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,119
(In the meantime,
they put something on his face.)

169
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:30,249
(Pressing)

170
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,689
What did they put on his forehead?

171
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:37,129
(Tika, a mark put on the forehead
to ask for blessings)

172
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:38,229
A sticker?

173
00:07:38,489 --> 00:07:39,960
What is that?

174
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,429
- Blessing.
- Oh, a blessing.

175
00:07:42,429 --> 00:07:44,330
Oh, it's a blessing?

176
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,939
Do each of his relatives
take turns doing that?

177
00:07:46,939 --> 00:07:49,470
Starting with his mother,
all of his aunts come...

178
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,309
- to give him a blessing.
- That's right.

179
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:54,080
- And they have big families.
- Yes.

180
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,309
(Anyway, when will the groom get off?)

181
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,119
It's now three hours past...

182
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,390
the time that the wedding
was supposed to start.

183
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,489
(It is 3 hours past the time
the wedding was expected to begin.)

184
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:08,859
I think the opening ceremony
of the Olympics is shorter than this.

185
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,989
- Kian84.
- Yes?

186
00:08:11,989 --> 00:08:13,229
- Let's go to my sister.
- Yes.

187
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:14,830
- Yes. Your sister?
- Yes.

188
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,830
- Me?
- I'll go with you.

189
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,970
- Okay.
- The bride?

190
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:17,999
- The bride.
- Thank you.

191
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,770
- The groom still hasn't gotten off.
- He hasn't.

192
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:21,070
(The Ganges Brothers
go to meet the bride first.)

193
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,039
- This is it.
- Okay.

194
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,309
- Marriage hall.
- Oh, marriage hall.

195
00:08:26,679 --> 00:08:29,679
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

196
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,350
Namaste.

197
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,510
It was so fancy.

198
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,020
Oh, my. That's so fancy.

199
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,679
- It's so fancy and beautiful.
- Oh, my.

200
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:39,020
Those are
traditional wedding clothes, right?

201
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,359
Like a wedding dress?

202
00:08:40,359 --> 00:08:41,720
The clothes are so fancy.

203
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,260
This is Kian84.

204
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,489
My friend.

205
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,929
My friend.

206
00:08:46,929 --> 00:08:49,499
- He's also a friend.
- Oh, nice.

207
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:51,429
- I'm his friend's friend.
- Friends.

208
00:08:51,429 --> 00:08:52,700
- What?
- Happy?

209
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,739
- Yes. I'm very happy.
- Very happy?

210
00:08:54,739 --> 00:08:55,840
She's a little...

211
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,910
- Are you a little tired?
- Earlier...

212
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,539
- A little tired?
- Oh, no.

213
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,710
A little tired?

214
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:03,450
- A little tired?
- No sleep?

215
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,419
Yes. Sometimes, I feel...

216
00:09:06,419 --> 00:09:07,419
Sometimes?

217
00:09:07,419 --> 00:09:09,350
- You're happy.
- She's fasting right now.

218
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,520
- Really?
- She's fasting.

219
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:13,359
- Oh, she's fasting.
- She hasn't eaten anything.

220
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:15,390
- Why?
- Why?

221
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,160
You can eat anything after a wedding,

222
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,960
- but you can't eat before.
- I see.

223
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,160
- No water?
- Because we have to worship the deities.

224
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,330
To cleanse your body for the deities,

225
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,929
some people fast
on the day of their wedding.

226
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,100
- Okay. Have fun.
- Congratulations.

227
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

228
00:09:31,039 --> 00:09:32,169
- Namaste.
- Kian84.

229
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,309
Good luck with your life and love.

230
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:36,910
(Leaving after a short meeting
with the bride)

231
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,609
Get her husband.

232
00:09:38,609 --> 00:09:40,249
- Get her husband.
- Your brother.

233
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:42,779
He still hasn't gotten off.

234
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:43,790
(He still hasn't gotten off. Oh, my.)

235
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:45,320
- Still?
- He still hasn't gotten off.

236
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,619
They're still blessing him.

237
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,019
(His eyes have gotten bloodshot.)

238
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,229
(There are no signs
that the groom will get off anytime soon.)

239
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,800
(They're slowly starting to lose focus.)

240
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,330
I was so exhausted.

241
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,899
(Hesitating)

242
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,399
- Lohit.
- What happened?

243
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,300
I have to go to my hotel.

244
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,470
But why?

245
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,810
- Very... Tomorrow...
- Tomorrow, we...

246
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,979
- Schedule.
- have plans for work.

247
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:08,239
- Yes.
- Okay, Kian84.

248
00:10:08,239 --> 00:10:09,609
- Are you happy?
- Happy.

249
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,009
- Happy.
- Happy.

250
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,950
Lohit will understand.

251
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:15,649
Since Lohit invited us,

252
00:10:15,649 --> 00:10:17,389
- he kept taking care of us.
- Right.

253
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,519
We were grateful for the care,

254
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,790
but since we're strangers,

255
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:23,389
we thought we should be polite...

256
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,460
- and go after the formalities were done.
- Right.

257
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,989
- Right.
- It was good timing.

258
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:27,330
You saw the groom and the bride.

259
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,399
- Right.
- Yes.

260
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,670
Let's go.

261
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,830
If we want to see this,

262
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:35,499
I think we'll have to stay
two more days...

263
00:10:35,499 --> 00:10:37,009
after Pani Bottle gets here.

264
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:41,779
That was my first time
at a wedding like that.

265
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,109
It was very fun...

266
00:10:44,109 --> 00:10:47,080
because unless you're invited,

267
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,519
you can't even pay to experience that.

268
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,850
What a special experience.

269
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:56,159
An Indian wedding
was such a unique experience.

270
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,129
It was short, but it stayed in my memory.

271
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:02,129
I'm thankful to Lohit for inviting me...

272
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,729
and giving me that opportunity.

273
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,340
That's such a special experience.

274
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,470
(They leave the wedding
feeling bittersweet.)

275
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,409
(Right then...)

276
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,479
- Is he getting off? What?
- He's getting off.

277
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,810
As soon as you left.

278
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,350
- Oh, my.
- What? We're leaving like that.

279
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,420
- Oh, you didn't know.
- No, we didn't. What is this?

280
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:22,320
- What?
- We really didn't know.

281
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,420
What is this?

282
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,720
(His brain stopped working.)

283
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,590
He doesn't just get off normally.

284
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,560
It's as if they were waiting
for you to leave.

285
00:11:31,029 --> 00:11:33,060
(Proceeding in a saddle stance)

286
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:36,259
This is how the wedding goes
once the groom arrives.

287
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,629
The groom and bride greet everyone.

288
00:11:38,629 --> 00:11:40,269
They eat together.

289
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,700
They make seven vows
in front of their family.

290
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,269
That's new to me.

291
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:49,040
(After a night of waiting...)

292
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,950
(Day 4 of the trip,
the last day in Varanasi)

293
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,560
Gosh. You must be tired.

294
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,859
I was so tired that day.

295
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,389
- Right.
- You must've slept so well.

296
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:06,290
(Tossing and turning)

297
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:08,499
I'm so tired.

298
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:11,499
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

299
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,399
(Getting up)

300
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,909
- Dex.
- Yes?

301
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,210
It feels like my body is breaking.

302
00:12:20,909 --> 00:12:22,379
I'm sure your body was breaking.

303
00:12:22,379 --> 00:12:24,279
- You were dancing so hard.
- Gosh.

304
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:28,420
Oh, my.

305
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,450
(Scrunching up his face)

306
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,019
(Out of it)

307
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,720
(Last night's dance party was intense.)

308
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,889
- Dancing machine.
- Oh, yes!

309
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,420
- It's understandable that he was sore.
- Yes.

310
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,460
(He showed off his wild arms and legs.)

311
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:42,600
(Varanasi's superstar partied hard.)

312
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,330
You did all you could.

313
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:45,830
(He seems to be feeling
the aftereffects of dancing.)

314
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:48,040
Your muscles look so pumped right now.

315
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,040
(Feeling sore)

316
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,210
Oh, my neck hurts.

317
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,210
(Swiftly turning around)

318
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,879
(Stretching his muscles
that are tense from dancing)

319
00:12:55,879 --> 00:12:58,050
- Oh, his back muscles.
- Oh, my.

320
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,310
You have a great body.

321
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
My back is pretty nice.

322
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:05,050
Do you have everything?

323
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:06,090
Yes.

324
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,420
Gosh.

325
00:13:07,859 --> 00:13:09,420
Packing is a chore.

326
00:13:10,359 --> 00:13:12,190
We have some time
until we get on the train.

327
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,330
That's right.
Today, we'll get on the train...

328
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,460
and head to New Delhi.
It's a very important day.

329
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,930
- I see.
- We'll meet Pani Bottle there.

330
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,999
- Oh, finally.
- Yes.

331
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,070
Nice.

332
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:21,440
Is there something you want to do?

333
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:22,940
- Me?
- Yes.

334
00:13:23,239 --> 00:13:24,470
Actually, since we had some time,

335
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,580
I was thinking
of going back to the wedding.

336
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,409
- But I thought that'd be a bit hard.
- Oh, my.

337
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:30,749
(Sniffing)

338
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,619
They washed our clothes so nicely.

339
00:13:33,619 --> 00:13:34,979
- Did they?
- Yes.

340
00:13:35,249 --> 00:13:36,320
Okay. Check, please.

341
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
(They dropped off their laundry
the night before.)

342
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,019
The owner is checking for us.

343
00:13:39,749 --> 00:13:41,159
It was very clean and dry.

344
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,590
I don't think they washed this
in the Ganges.

345
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,430
They have a laundry place,
and they have a laundry machine.

346
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,859
- I see.
- There's a laundry place?

347
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,170
Yes. There's a laundry place.

348
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,800
I did want to visit
an Indian laundry place.

349
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,369
An Indian laundry place?

350
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,070
Because I saw it in a documentary.

351
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,609
This is a laundry village.
This is my workplace.

352
00:13:59,609 --> 00:14:01,139
It's a family business my ancestors
started hundreds of years ago.

353
00:14:01,139 --> 00:14:03,409
- They specialize in doing laundry.
- Right.

354
00:14:03,409 --> 00:14:05,149
(The Indian laundry place
stole Kian84's heart.)

355
00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:07,420
I saw in documentaries...

356
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,220
that Indian laundry places were famous.

357
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,489
Let's go and see.

358
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:13,290
Are you going to do laundry there?

359
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,420
- Me?
- Yes.

360
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,619
No. I'll see and...

361
00:14:16,159 --> 00:14:18,159
We're just going to visit
since we have a lot of time.

362
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,190
Of course.

363
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:20,399
- A laundry place?
- Yes.

364
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,359
I am curious. Okay. Let's go.

365
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:23,729
(Shall we head to the laundry place?)

366
00:14:25,269 --> 00:14:27,440
- Good morning! Namaste.
- Good morning.

367
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,840
- Namaste.
- Good morning. Namaste.

368
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,940
How are you?

369
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,009
- Fine.
- I'm fine. Thank you.

370
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,340
- Thank you. And you?
- Yes.

371
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,779
- Yesterday,
- Yes.

372
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:35,509
we didn't pay you.

373
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:36,879
- Yes.
- Right? So...

374
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:38,479
You need to pay 80 rupees.

375
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,220
- Okay.
- That's very cheap. It's 80 rupees?

376
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,220
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

377
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,590
Eight. Zero.

378
00:14:45,249 --> 00:14:46,619
He has it. Okay.

379
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,259
- Yesterday, you...
- Also,

380
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,830
- Do we have to pay again?
- Wait.

381
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
Here?

382
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,399
You still have the food bill left.

383
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,629
Villain?

384
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,129
Villain.

385
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,700
For the food bill.

386
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,999
- Food?
- Food?

387
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,269
Oh, food bill? Okay.

388
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:02,800
- How much is the food?
- The total?

389
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,909
It's 1... Oh, 15...

390
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,340
(Plus 100 rupees)

391
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,879
- It keeps going up.
- So, 15...

392
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,850
- What?
- Wait. Why is there so much?

393
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,409
Did we eat so much?

394
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:15,519
Oh, from the first day.

395
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,389
To be honest, we ate a lot at night
because we were hungry.

396
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:22,560
- Oh, this is a lot. We're in trouble.
- It's 2,600.

397
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,759
We ate a lot.

398
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,859
- You...
- It's 1,300.

399
00:15:25,859 --> 00:15:27,430
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

400
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,460
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

401
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,499
- We want to visit a hand wash place.
- Yes.

402
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:31,529
- Well...
- Okay.

403
00:15:31,529 --> 00:15:32,999
- It's like this.
- Yes.

404
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,769
Not like this.

405
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:37,269
- Yes. Like this.
- Yes.

406
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,869
- Where is that?
- Give me your phone.

407
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:40,409
- I'll search the address for you.
- Address? Yes.

408
00:15:40,409 --> 00:15:42,779
That's right.
There's a laundry place in Varanasi.

409
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,180
- Yes.
- I guess he knows about it.

410
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,749
This address.

411
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,149
- Okay.
- This is the place you have to go to.

412
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,720
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay. Thank you.

413
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,790
- Thank you.
- He's so kind.

414
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,989
- That owner was very kind.
- Namaste.

415
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:53,989
Let's go.

416
00:15:53,989 --> 00:15:56,290
(They head to the laundry place
feeling excited.)

417
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,229
We're continuing our India trip today.

418
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:01,359
One, two, three.

419
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:02,399
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

420
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,399
That's nice.

421
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,170
How should we go there?
Should we ride a tuk-tuk?

422
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,070
Should we ride a tuk-tuk?
What do you want to do?

423
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:09,840
For now, let's go as fast as possible.

424
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,409
- Because we have to catch the train.
- Right.

425
00:16:12,409 --> 00:16:14,479
I think it's at 3:20 p.m.

426
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:15,779
- At 3:20 p.m.?
- Yes.

427
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,779
Let's get there by 3 p.m., just in case.

428
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:18,779
Okay.

429
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,050
Gosh. This place...

430
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,249
(Even in the morning,
Varanasi is crowded.)

431
00:16:21,249 --> 00:16:22,820
is crowded around the clock.

432
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,019
A magician has appeared.

433
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,960
- Should we say hello?
- Should we meet him?

434
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,629
- Should we say hello?
- Let's go.

435
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,759
- Namaste.
- Hello.

436
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,029
- Oh, my!
- Oh, no.

437
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,700
There were a lot of people
with body paint like that.

438
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,999
In India, they are called sadhu.

439
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,909
- Sadhu.
- Yes. That's what I was told.

440
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:47,509
Do they have white powder
all over their bodies?

441
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,379
- Are you familiar with that, Do Yeon?
- Yes.

442
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,409
Of course.

443
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:51,580
- One moment.
- Okay.

444
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,609
(Laughing)

445
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:54,350
- I always have to know.
- I'm also very curious.

446
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,420
- I was curious.
- Okay.

447
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,950
Sadhu means a person doing penance...

448
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,320
- to find enlightenment.
- I see.

449
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,720
They give up all worldly things,

450
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,529
such as family, pleasure,
and material desires.

451
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,430
They pursue spirituality
their whole lives.

452
00:17:08,259 --> 00:17:11,369
They normally go around
with powder all over their bodies.

453
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,769
This powder is ash left over...

454
00:17:13,769 --> 00:17:15,800
- from crematoriums.
- Oh, my.

455
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,540
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

456
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,639
It means we should not obsess over life...

457
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:23,979
or be greedy
because we all just turn into ash.

458
00:17:23,979 --> 00:17:25,509
- That's the lesson behind it.
- Oh, my.

459
00:17:25,509 --> 00:17:26,920
- It wasn't flour.
- Right.

460
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,550
In India,

461
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:30,019
- there are 400 to 500 sadhus.
- Oh, really?

462
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,220
They all practice in different ways.

463
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:35,720
Not all sadhus ask for money.

464
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,759
- Yes.
- I see.

465
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:39,659
- Have a seat.
- A seat?

466
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:42,629
- Are you Japanese?
- What?

467
00:17:42,629 --> 00:17:43,899
- No.
- Korean.

468
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:45,170
- Korea.
- Korea?

469
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:46,369
- Yes.
- Yes.

470
00:17:47,269 --> 00:17:49,639
- How... What is this?
- What is this?

471
00:17:49,639 --> 00:17:50,909
What is it?

472
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,879
This is the ash that followers of Shiva
put on their bodies.

473
00:17:53,879 --> 00:17:55,139
- Shiva?
- Shiva.

474
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,139
- Shiva.
- Shiva, the deity?

475
00:17:56,180 --> 00:17:57,850
- Bhasma.
- "Bhasma?"

476
00:17:57,850 --> 00:17:59,710
- "Shiva bhasma?"
- What does that mean?

477
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,850
(You rub it on like this.)

478
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,119
(Come here.)

479
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:06,190
(Standing afar)

480
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,859
- On him.
- Bless me.

481
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,560
(He gives the blessing.)

482
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,759
Blessing.

483
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,530
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

484
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:16,260
- Welcome to Varanasi.
- Thank you.

485
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:18,230
You will have a happy life.

486
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,439
- You have a happy life too.
- Okay.

487
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,869
Namaste.

488
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:22,869
(Laughing)

489
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:25,209
(I understand.)

490
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,010
(Wait!)

491
00:18:29,379 --> 00:18:31,909
You did not give me money.

492
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,109
You want money?

493
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,080
- Money?
- The blessing fee.

494
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,679
Come here.

495
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:39,949
No, thank you. I'm good.

496
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,159
- No, thank you.
- You're good at refusing now.

497
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,359
Yesterday, I already got blessed.

498
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,659
Just give him about 200 rupees.

499
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,199
Seeing us getting blessed,

500
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:52,969
other monks are gathering around.

501
00:18:52,969 --> 00:18:55,000
- The word has spread.
- Okay, thank you.

502
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,169
- No.
- What?

503
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,570
One thousand.

504
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:00,209
- "One thousand?"
- What?

505
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,439
(Goodness...)

506
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,280
No.

507
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:06,310
One thousand rupees is nonsense.

508
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,580
(Give that to him.)

509
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,580
No.

510
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,750
What?

511
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,219
- Here.
- No.

512
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:12,790
It's getting serious.

513
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,820
- No. Enough.
- Here.

514
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:17,189
- Enough.
- You have to be firm.

515
00:19:17,189 --> 00:19:19,830
- Put that here. It's enough.
- No. Enough.

516
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,659
Yes, it's enough.

517
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:22,699
No. Enough.

518
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,600
He's intervening.

519
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,669
(The local resident understands
Dex's situation.)

520
00:19:25,669 --> 00:19:26,830
No. Enough.

521
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,340
(What do I do?)

522
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:31,209
(Thinking)

523
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,179
(What do I do?)

524
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,780
Okay.

525
00:19:37,879 --> 00:19:39,209
- What a relief.
- Good.

526
00:19:39,209 --> 00:19:40,619
- He won.
- Finish.

527
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:42,320
- Finish.
- Enough.

528
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
(Here is 200 rupees.)

529
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,189
(Snatch)

530
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:48,859
(The sadhu snatches the money.)

531
00:19:48,859 --> 00:19:50,859
Goodness.

532
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:53,290
- That startled me.
- Who is he?

533
00:19:53,530 --> 00:19:54,600
No.

534
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,330
Don't do that.

535
00:19:59,169 --> 00:20:00,240
He has charisma.

536
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,469
Dex's face is great.

537
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:03,000
You have to be like that when you talk.

538
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,909
- "Don't do that."
- He's stern.

539
00:20:04,909 --> 00:20:06,040
Okay.

540
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,080
(Let's just go...)

541
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,879
I shouldn't have,
but I put on a serious face.

542
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:13,510
I will never be forced to pay
for something I don't want.

543
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,550
No. Enough.

544
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,719
- Gosh.
- "Enough."

545
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:21,560
As I get older...

546
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:23,090
Gosh, the background...

547
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,159
Where did you go?

548
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,000
It's like an interview on a dating show.

549
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,159
- Like "I am Solo."
- Yes.

550
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:29,359
("Solo by Accident")

551
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,469
You look like a Young Chul.

552
00:20:31,469 --> 00:20:32,899
- His body is a Young Chul.
- Yes.

553
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,240
(I am Young Chul84.)

554
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,169
- It does make it seem different.
- Okay.

555
00:20:36,169 --> 00:20:38,969
- He's doing the interview as Young Chul.
- Yes.

556
00:20:39,469 --> 00:20:40,780
Where is he?

557
00:20:41,409 --> 00:20:42,780
What I think is...

558
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:45,179
He knows what's right and wrong.

559
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,909
He is straightforward.

560
00:20:46,909 --> 00:20:48,480
As I get older,

561
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,490
I just let things slide.

562
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,060
If I was about his age, 29,

563
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,560
- I think I'd bargain and argue too.
- You have to be firm.

564
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:59,459
Their hands, like the massage...

565
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:02,530
and the blessing,

566
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:04,830
- keep coming in from nowhere.
- Yes.

567
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:06,530
(The hands keep coming in to bless him...)

568
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:07,540
(while he is walking.)

569
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,639
- He's just passing by.
- Why do...

570
00:21:09,639 --> 00:21:11,669
- You have to pay attention.
- Yes.

571
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:15,679
Indians like to bless people.

572
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,510
- And it helped me.
- Yes.

573
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,250
Think positively.

574
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,980
Dex got his blessing,

575
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,619
- so let's see how it helps.
- Yes.

576
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,359
- Let's see.
- Yes, let's see.

577
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,389
Let's go.

578
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,760
(Crowded)

579
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,500
(The parade comes again.)

580
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,669
What is that?

581
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,830
(It flows in like a wave.)

582
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,300
There must be an event.

583
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,600
Maybe there's a festival.

584
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,810
Gosh.

585
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,270
- Lohit might be there.
- What if he's dancing in there?

586
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,409
(Kian84, come back.)

587
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:50,850
(A carriage goes by.)

588
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:52,949
Is this another wedding?

589
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,419
Is it?

590
00:21:54,719 --> 00:21:57,619
The weather is about 36℃.

591
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,290
It feels like it's about 40℃,

592
00:22:00,459 --> 00:22:01,760
but no one is tired.

593
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,730
- It was really hot. It was about 40℃.
- It looks like it.

594
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:07,560
but there were so many people.

595
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,060
(The festive heat is hotter
than the weather.)

596
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,159
Go.

597
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,740
(Beep)

598
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,969
(Motorcycles and passers-by everywhere)

599
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:19,209
(Feeling stifled)

600
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,840
This way.

601
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,840
(The street is all blocked.)

602
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:25,280
(Dizzy)

603
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,949
(They barely got out.)

604
00:22:26,949 --> 00:22:28,820
There is another characteristic.

605
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,790
As I walk,

606
00:22:31,119 --> 00:22:33,919
people stick behind me...

607
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:35,320
like a wedding procession.

608
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,359
- Someone is interviewing you.
- What?

609
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:39,859
- Is that the Indian Pani Bottle?
- The Indian Pani Bottle.

610
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:41,300
(Hello)

611
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,560
- Where are you from?
- The cars...

612
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:44,399
Korea.

613
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,369
- Korea?
- Yes.

614
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,540
- The cars...
- What's your channel name?

615
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,840
- He's asking...
- MBC's Adventure by Accident.

616
00:22:54,310 --> 00:23:00,179
(He kept asking people,
"Do you know MBC?")

617
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,480
(He is the spokesperson of MBC.)

618
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,050
Yes, do you know?
Your hairstyle is very...

619
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:07,159
(Flip)

620
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:08,459
- He's cool.
- He has wind-swept hair.

621
00:23:08,459 --> 00:23:09,990
- Your hairstyle is very...
- It's cool.

622
00:23:09,990 --> 00:23:12,459
- Yes.
- It was popular in the old days.

623
00:23:12,459 --> 00:23:14,230
- Do you have a shop?
- Yes.

624
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:16,000
- Your shop?
- His shop?

625
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,469
He has a lot of hair.

626
00:23:17,469 --> 00:23:18,600
(Envious)

627
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,639
Good luck. See you.

628
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,969
- Guy with nice hair.
- Yes.

629
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,369
Thank you.

630
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:30,709
(They get to the rickshaw station.)

631
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,580
Namaste.

632
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:37,189
We are going there.

633
00:23:37,189 --> 00:23:40,520
Do you know?
This is where you wash clothes.

634
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,459
- The laundry area?
- I wanted to explain that.

635
00:23:43,459 --> 00:23:44,590
Okay, no problem?

636
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,889
- No problem? Okay.
- How much?

637
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:48,959
- It's 300?
- It's 300?

638
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,669
Okay? Deal?

639
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,429
- Okay.
- That's great.

640
00:23:52,429 --> 00:23:55,270
We had enough data,

641
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,869
so we could set the price
before getting around.

642
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:58,270
Great. Stern Dex.

643
00:23:58,709 --> 00:24:00,010
- It's 11 minutes.
- Okay.

644
00:24:00,679 --> 00:24:03,409
But I think it will take about 15 minutes.

645
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:06,209
- About 15?
- Yes, since there's traffic.

646
00:24:06,909 --> 00:24:09,219
- Okay, gosh.
- Oh, a U-turn.

647
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:11,550
(Beep)

648
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,990
- That was a tough one.
- They just go.

649
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,320
(Their minds jolt awake
as soon as they get on.)

650
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,359
(He takes a selfie
even on the rough roads.)

651
00:24:18,429 --> 00:24:19,560
Kian84.

652
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,030
- Just with the picture, it looks so fun.
- Right?

653
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,699
- That's the problem with social media.
- Yes.

654
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,040
Everyone looks happy.

655
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,939
On social media...

656
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:33,340
We look like pioneers.

657
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,179
- "You're going to India?"
- Yes.

658
00:24:35,639 --> 00:24:37,080
But the truth is,

659
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:38,909
- we're getting ripped off here.
- We're getting ripped off.

660
00:24:38,909 --> 00:24:41,250
(The truth is they keep losing in India.)

661
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,119
(Passion)

662
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:45,389
- I wanted to catch it on tape.
- Yes.

663
00:24:45,949 --> 00:24:48,490
- That's nice.
- You're good.

664
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,189
- Everyone is open toward cameras.
- Yes.

665
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:52,189
(Filming the locals, who like cameras)

666
00:24:52,290 --> 00:24:54,100
(They are almost at the destination.)

667
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,760
- Okay.
- Hey.

668
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:58,730
- Okay, stop, please.
- Okay. Thank you.

669
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,199
Thank you.

670
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,639
It's the laundry place.

671
00:25:01,639 --> 00:25:03,240
(Moaning)

672
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,770
- What is that?
- Look at that bag.

673
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,580
My bag was so heavy that
my body bounced off of it.

674
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:10,980
Money?

675
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,980
(We need to pay.)

676
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,250
Do you have some?

677
00:25:14,219 --> 00:25:16,080
- It's hard for me to take it out.
- I'll pay.

678
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,179
- Could you pay?
- Yes.

679
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:19,389
That bag was helpful.

680
00:25:19,389 --> 00:25:20,449
(He pays 500 rupees.)

681
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,990
Give us 200, please.

682
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,389
You don't have change?

683
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,090
I knew this would happen, so...

684
00:25:26,659 --> 00:25:29,030
(When he first rode the taxi
on the first day...)

685
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:30,500
(I don't have change.)

686
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,230
It happened to him before.

687
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,429
(Oh, you don't...)

688
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,139
(He was ripped off
because he did not have change.)

689
00:25:36,469 --> 00:25:38,709
- Wait.
- They say they don't have change.

690
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,540
- Thank you.
- Okay.

691
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:42,010
Good job.

692
00:25:42,409 --> 00:25:44,780
Okay, thank you. Bye.

693
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,810
(Bye)

694
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,080
The best you can do...

695
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,780
is to ask them to wait
while you get change at the store.

696
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,149
(I see.)

697
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:54,560
(They head to the laundry place.)

698
00:25:54,790 --> 00:25:56,290
Wait, is this possible?

699
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,530
Be careful.

700
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,159
- What is that?
- What?

701
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,030
What's that goat doing there?

702
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:05,030
(The goat is standing
as if it's doing a stunt.)

703
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:07,570
- It's standing on the window ledge.
- That's cute.

704
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,869
That's cute.

705
00:26:12,469 --> 00:26:13,540
Hello.

706
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,040
- That's so funny.
- There's so much variety.

707
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,609
- There's always something new.
- Yes.

708
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:20,209
(Thump)

709
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,350
(They hear sounds
of people doing laundry.)

710
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,750
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

711
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,820
(Amazed)

712
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,990
Namaste.

713
00:26:29,419 --> 00:26:31,260
(What made them exclaim?)

714
00:26:31,689 --> 00:26:32,790
Namaste.

715
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,830
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

716
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,899
- Hello? Namaste.
- Namaste.

717
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:41,139
It does smell like a laundry place.

718
00:26:41,139 --> 00:26:42,439
(It is a traditional laundry place,
where people still hand-wash laundry.)

719
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,570
It smells like chlorine.

720
00:26:44,969 --> 00:26:46,969
It smells like the pool.

721
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:49,310
The smell made it feel pleasant.

722
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,810
Hi. Namaste.

723
00:26:52,449 --> 00:26:53,550
Excuse me.

724
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,750
(Excuse me.)

725
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,980
Who is the master?

726
00:26:57,889 --> 00:26:58,949
The master.

727
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:01,389
The master.

728
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:02,719
Who is the master?

729
00:27:02,919 --> 00:27:05,659
(Drawing attention)

730
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,290
Who is the master?

731
00:27:08,399 --> 00:27:11,030
Why do you keep asking for the master?

732
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:13,770
(Since he arrived,)

733
00:27:14,439 --> 00:27:16,199
(Dex kept looking for the master.)

734
00:27:16,199 --> 00:27:18,340
- Who is the master?
- Once you find the master,

735
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,709
the master kindly explains
everything to you.

736
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,609
I had the experience,

737
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:24,550
- so I kept asking that.
- Who is the master?

738
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,850
He's coming.

739
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,879
Today, I want to experience this place.

740
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,050
So...

741
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,149
Can I do my laundry here?

742
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,290
(What should we do?)

743
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,590
(Let him.)

744
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,730
- Here?
- Yes.

745
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,100
- No problem?
- Can we go in?

746
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,459
Yes, no problem.

747
00:27:43,459 --> 00:27:44,469
Really?

748
00:27:44,469 --> 00:27:46,830
The people here are...

749
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:48,699
- really welcoming to outsiders.
- Yes.

750
00:27:48,699 --> 00:27:50,199
- Yes, you're right.
- They're nice.

751
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:53,510
Where does the water come from?

752
00:27:53,869 --> 00:27:54,980
- The Ganges?
- The Ganges?

753
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,980
No.

754
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,050
It's coming from the water corporation.

755
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,780
It's purified water.

756
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,419
They use clean water?

757
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:06,149
(One person comes up)

758
00:28:06,149 --> 00:28:07,250
Is he the master?

759
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,290
He seemed to be the most experienced.

760
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:10,359
- Yes.
- Yes.

761
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,300
Do you see? It's where you wash.

762
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,600
- Wash?
- It's clean.

763
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:17,330
- Come.
- Okay, come.

764
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,669
(While Dex follows the laundry senior,)

765
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,570
(Kian84 puts down his things.)

766
00:28:23,199 --> 00:28:27,540
We came to the laundry place...

767
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,879
where we asked to have our clothes washed.

768
00:28:29,879 --> 00:28:31,149
Since we're here,

769
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,980
we asked if we could experience it,
and they said it was okay.

770
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:37,050
We don't know if we'll be of much help,

771
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,820
but we'll try.

772
00:28:40,959 --> 00:28:42,060
Let's try it.

773
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:45,060
- Here?
- Come.

774
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,230
- Here?
- Yes.

775
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:47,600
- Okay, thank you.
- I wonder what it's like.

776
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,730
Be careful.

777
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,300
(Big steps)

778
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:54,800
(Dip)

779
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:57,869
(He carefully enters the water.)

780
00:28:58,969 --> 00:28:59,969
(Groaning)

781
00:28:59,969 --> 00:29:00,980
Here.

782
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:02,010
- Here.
- Okay.

783
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,010
What is this mushy feeling?

784
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,949
- Here?
- Here.

785
00:29:05,949 --> 00:29:07,250
(Without any time
to feel beneath his feet...)

786
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:09,919
This?

787
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:11,320
(Rubbing)

788
00:29:11,449 --> 00:29:12,919
(Soap)

789
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,020
Okay.

790
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:15,990
I did this a lot in the military.

791
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:17,359
(Proud of his laundry skills)

792
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:20,159
Okay, where is my area?

793
00:29:20,629 --> 00:29:22,300
- Where am I going?
- Just here.

794
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,760
Over there?

795
00:29:24,369 --> 00:29:25,369
(Slap)

796
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,540
(Smiling)

797
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,300
Come in.

798
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:31,040
- Okay.
- Okay.

799
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,070
Okay.

800
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,540
(Watch carefully)

801
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,609
- See?
- See?

802
00:29:34,609 --> 00:29:36,310
(He teaches Dex how to wash the clothes.)

803
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:39,679
(Rub the soap...)

804
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,750
(and pound it on the washboard.)

805
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:42,280
- Like this?
- Yes.

806
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,050
(Making noise)

807
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,919
(He beats up the clothes.)

808
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,060
You're good.

809
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,189
- Gosh, so fast.
- Good.

810
00:29:51,189 --> 00:29:52,330
(Good)

811
00:29:52,389 --> 00:29:54,330
(Full-power swing)

812
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,260
He's going to kill the clothes.

813
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:58,199
He's different since he's from the UDT.

814
00:29:59,129 --> 00:30:00,369
(It is time to rinse.)

815
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,399
- Wash?
- Wash.

816
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:03,439
(Peeking)

817
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:04,540
How long...

818
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,540
(He tries to copy Dex, the top student.)

819
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,570
does it take?

820
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:10,439
Okay. Wash it once,

821
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,879
slam it, and...

822
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,050
(He keeps teaching the top student.)

823
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,119
- Do I flip...
- Finished?

824
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:16,649
- Finished.
- Finished?

825
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,520
This is easy.

826
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,490
It's easy.

827
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,260
- It was simpler than I thought.
- Yes.

828
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,689
Didn't we also wash clothes like this
in the past?

829
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:26,730
- At the laundry place.
- Yes, we did.

830
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,260
- We would pound it with a bat.
- Yes

831
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,600
It's not that different.

832
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:32,929
(The Indian laundry place
isn't much different.)

833
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,240
(The two Koreans naturally fit in.)

834
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,570
This reminds me of
when I was in the military.

835
00:30:38,209 --> 00:30:40,240
(Rubbing)

836
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:42,780
How...

837
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,250
(Shouting)

838
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,179
What are you saying?

839
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:47,820
- "Earnings."
- You want earnings?

840
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,379
- "Earnings."
- "Earnings."

841
00:30:49,649 --> 00:30:51,449
(Earnings)

842
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,219
(What's he doing?)

843
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,159
(Shouting)

844
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,090
The people behind us...

845
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,859
are getting competitive and shouting...

846
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:01,959
since we started.

847
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,199
Okay.

848
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,800
The people behind you
are getting competitive.

849
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,040
(Earnings)

850
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,869
(His chants set the disciplinary mood.)

851
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,010
This really suits me.

852
00:31:13,469 --> 00:31:14,740
- This suits me.
- Hey.

853
00:31:15,209 --> 00:31:17,209
- Do you like it?
- Yes, it's fun.

854
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:18,280
(So much fun)

855
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,909
- You finally found your calling.
- I did.

856
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,050
(The top laundry student
found his calling in India.)

857
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,619
He's so good.

858
00:31:26,619 --> 00:31:28,260
He looks so happy.

859
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:30,619
You look so cheerful.

860
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,959
I was so happy.

861
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,600
(The top student is in his element.)

862
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,969
(A gift)

863
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay, it's a big size.

864
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,740
The size kept growing.

865
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,540
- They approve of you.
- Okay.

866
00:31:44,939 --> 00:31:45,969
(Shouting)

867
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,780
(This is easy for the top student.)

868
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:49,780
(Babbling)

869
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,949
- What is that?
- What was that sound?

870
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,949
Gosh, you're good.

871
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:56,679
(I like him...)

872
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,689
(Everyone wants the new talent.)

873
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,290
What is that?

874
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,490
- Is that a parachute?
- What is that?

875
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,730
What is this?

876
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,230
- You go ahead.
- Is that a parachute?

877
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,300
It's so big.

878
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:12,300
(He loves his new junior.)

879
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,869
(Watch close.)

880
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,600
- What?
- Gosh.

881
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,740
That was the higher-level technique.

882
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,209
I think you will be good at it.

883
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,209
(Watching)

884
00:32:22,379 --> 00:32:23,510
His snap is...

885
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:25,850
similar to wrestling.

886
00:32:26,709 --> 00:32:29,050
I think Indians like that snap.

887
00:32:29,050 --> 00:32:30,149
These...

888
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:31,320
(Whoo)

889
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,389
This snap.

890
00:32:32,389 --> 00:32:33,550
(They saw the snap at the gym as well.)

891
00:32:33,550 --> 00:32:34,659
Like...

892
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:36,820
The snap in G-DRAGON and Taeyang's...

893
00:32:36,859 --> 00:32:39,189
<i>I am a good boy</i>

894
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:40,189
(The fancy swinging of
the shoulders and hands)

895
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:41,199
(Swag)

896
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,300
(He goes into rhythm with the laundry.)

897
00:32:43,929 --> 00:32:45,570
He sure is a dancing machine.

898
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:47,129
"G-DRAGON and Taeyang?"

899
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:49,969
(Next to the Laundry G-DRAGON
who is showing high level techniques,)

900
00:32:51,109 --> 00:32:53,570
(the Laundry Place Taeyang
is getting tired.)

901
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,609
Gosh...

902
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:56,639
- Finished?
- Yes.

903
00:32:58,609 --> 00:32:59,709
Is it break time?

904
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,010
(Giving more work)

905
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:02,719
- We need to keep going.
- No way.

906
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,750
(There is still a whole pile left.)

907
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,619
They had so much work.

908
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,159
(Slamming...)

909
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,590
(and slamming)

910
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:13,490
(They can't escape
the endless loop of laundry.)

911
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:14,859
There's no end.

912
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,260
(Clenched teeth)

913
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:17,730
(Tired)

914
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:18,830
Oh, no.

915
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:20,969
(There's still more.)

916
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:23,469
- Isn't he just giving you his work?
- Yes.

917
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,770
He must have been so happy.

918
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:27,469
- Yes.
- "What great luck today."

919
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:28,639
(Happy)

920
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:29,840
For sure.

921
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:31,580
(Slamming)

922
00:33:32,550 --> 00:33:33,879
(Tired)

923
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,520
Goodness, he's tired.

924
00:33:36,219 --> 00:33:39,649
Do it well, like it's your own laundry.
Be thorough.

925
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,459
(He gathers his strength and rubs.)

926
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,490
Here, I'm done.

927
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,800
Okay.

928
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

929
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,800
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

930
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,169
We have to work hard...

931
00:33:52,169 --> 00:33:53,600
- since we're here.
- Yes, we do.

932
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,100
(He comes out and takes a rest.)

933
00:34:00,469 --> 00:34:01,510
(The senior jumps in.)

934
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:03,109
- Is he swimming?
- What?

935
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,109
Come.

936
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,020
- They can wash up there.
- They don't use it just for laundry.

937
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:11,290
They take a shower here
before getting off of work.

938
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,520
(They take a shower
after doing hard work.)

939
00:34:13,689 --> 00:34:15,419
(What?)

940
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,290
Inside?

941
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,590
- Yes.
- Yes.

942
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,859
Is it okay?

943
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:22,030
(The top student listens
to his seniors well.)

944
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,429
(Carefully)

945
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:28,070
(He enters the bath.)

946
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,139
It's deep.

947
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,000
It's cool.

948
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,740
(Dip)

949
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,840
(Holding hands)

950
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,580
Together?

951
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:40,109
On 1, 2...

952
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:43,350
(They go underwater together.)

953
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,590
- Yes.
- Nice.

954
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,619
Nice.

955
00:34:45,619 --> 00:34:46,619
My body?

956
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:48,990
(He shows off his muscles.)

957
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,859
(They touch each other's muscles.)

958
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:55,129
They became close
after doing laundry together.

959
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:56,429
I...

960
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:58,030
He's wearing a padded jacket now.

961
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,800
This is a bit of a spoiler.

962
00:35:00,699 --> 00:35:03,340
The master who taught us laundry...

963
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,669
was such a nice person.

964
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:07,909
He did not want to take anything...

965
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,740
or ask anything of me,

966
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,609
and he just sincerely wanted to teach me.

967
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:13,909
It was really fun.

968
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,580
Come in.

969
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:19,819
(He also follows them in the water.)

970
00:35:19,819 --> 00:35:22,190
- Slow.
- Slow.

971
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:25,089
(Come on in, Kian84.)

972
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,960
I will wash away your sins.

973
00:35:32,929 --> 00:35:34,600
(He starts to repent of his sins.)

974
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,670
I bless you.

975
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,270
(As if he's in his mother's arms...)

976
00:35:37,270 --> 00:35:38,400
He's praying again.

977
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,270
- Yes.
- He has to.

978
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:42,440
- To show respect.
- We had to go in.

979
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,670
We had to wash away our sins.

980
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,310
(He goes all the way in, in a holy way.)

981
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,650
Why are you acting holy
when it's just the laundry place?

982
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:53,119
I wanted a last blessing...

983
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,650
before leaving Varanasi.

984
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,020
At the wash place?

985
00:35:57,290 --> 00:36:00,259
(After the time of blessings...)

986
00:36:03,259 --> 00:36:04,799
(Namaste)

987
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,170
Kian84's body looks better than it did
on the first day.

988
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,270
My body really gets better
towards the end.

989
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,969
I smell strongly of soap.

990
00:36:14,469 --> 00:36:15,469
Namaste.

991
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:20,139
(Putting on his clothes)

992
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,020
(They put on the dirty laundry
that they took off.)

993
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,719
That was a new experience.

994
00:36:27,949 --> 00:36:30,719
I had more fun here than
I did in the Ganges.

995
00:36:30,719 --> 00:36:32,920
I used to work as a swimming instructor.

996
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,929
- You were a swimming instructor? Really?
- I was.

997
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:37,560
So I'm used to this smell of chlorine.

998
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,029
- Really?
- Yes.

999
00:36:39,029 --> 00:36:41,429
In a way,
this place is like another home to you.

1000
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:43,429
- Right. That's why I liked it here.
- I see.

1001
00:36:43,429 --> 00:36:44,540
Let's go.

1002
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,639
(He puts on his bag.)

1003
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:50,069
(It's time to get on the train.)

1004
00:36:50,069 --> 00:36:51,639
We had to hurry and get on the train now.

1005
00:36:51,639 --> 00:36:52,980
- Right. You should go to Delhi.
- Yes.

1006
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,549
But you can't take a shower
before going there.

1007
00:36:54,549 --> 00:36:56,179
- You'll go wet like that?
- That was our shower.

1008
00:36:56,179 --> 00:36:57,949
- We washed up there.
- Okay.

1009
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,650
We were the cleanest then.

1010
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,489
(They are in their cleanest state.)

1011
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:04,719
Okay. Let's go.

1012
00:37:07,489 --> 00:37:08,989
What do you think? Are you feeling it?

1013
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm feeling it.

1014
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,460
There are so many people here.

1015
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,799
- They're at the train station.
- We should get going now.

1016
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,130
- It's like they're waiting for the train.
- What?

1017
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,739
That's how it feels.

1018
00:37:19,299 --> 00:37:21,670
(The two of them did laundry.)

1019
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,239
(But only one of them changed clothes.)

1020
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:24,940
- Goodness.
- That's how it feels.

1021
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:27,210
To be honest,
I don't know where to go right now.

1022
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:28,380
(Spot the same picture.)

1023
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:30,480
He's got my respect. Seriously.

1024
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,679
I folded it nicely.

1025
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:35,020
- Seriously.
- Do you know how far we're going?

1026
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,520
- What's the distance?
- It's 792km.

1027
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:40,790
The distance between Seoul and Busan
is 400km.

1028
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:43,529
- The distance is longer than that.
- It's much longer.

1029
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,029
- We can't compare India to Korea.
- If this were KTX...

1030
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:47,670
- It's a big country.
- Gosh, it's huge.

1031
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,170
It will take about 12 hours.

1032
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,670
- Twelve hours.
- Okay.

1033
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,199
I see. It's over there. Wait.

1034
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,739
It feels like a national holiday.

1035
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:58,739
It's been a while
since we've seen lots of people.

1036
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:00,110
(Like a national holiday,
it's packed with people.)

1037
00:38:02,049 --> 00:38:04,279
- Varanasi.
- Gosh, this place is...

1038
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,850
As India is a huge country,

1039
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:08,850
the train routes are well-developed.

1040
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:10,619
The railways are installed densely
around the country.

1041
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:13,159
The trains connect
all the cities and villages together.

1042
00:38:13,159 --> 00:38:15,630
The locals take this mode
of transportation very frequently.

1043
00:38:15,759 --> 00:38:18,400
As for the route
from Varanasi to New Delhi,

1044
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,500
it's a popular route.
So it's always packed with people.

1045
00:38:21,830 --> 00:38:24,900
Trains are memorable
and give you a sense of nostalgia.

1046
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:26,569
That's romantic, in a way.

1047
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,839
When you go to India,

1048
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:30,909
you must get on their train at least once.

1049
00:38:30,909 --> 00:38:32,810
- Right.
- It's one of the must-try experiences.

1050
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,679
When you arrive in New Delhi on the train,

1051
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,179
- Pani Bottle will be waiting for you.
- Yes.

1052
00:38:36,179 --> 00:38:37,509
- That's right.
- Yes.

1053
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,380
It takes about 12 hours.

1054
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:42,819
By the time we arrive,
it will be about 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.

1055
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:44,520
I was waiting for them
with their arrival time in mind.

1056
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,489
- The trio will be together then.
- Yes.

1057
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,489
(The three brothers
will be together soon.)

1058
00:38:47,489 --> 00:38:49,960
- Right.
- When we first get on it,

1059
00:38:50,159 --> 00:38:53,029
I want to see if people really stand
on the top of the train.

1060
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:54,230
Let's check that first.

1061
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,630
- Until we arrive at the next station,
- Yes.

1062
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,839
let's go with the open-train option.

1063
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,040
- Sure. Sounds good.
- Okay.

1064
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,139
We can get a tan too.

1065
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,409
- Right.
- A tan?

1066
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,540
The number of the train.

1067
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,210
- It's 12391.
- It's 12391?

1068
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,549
"Shramjeevi Exp."

1069
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:11,880
Each train has a number.

1070
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,520
- With the name and the number,
- Do you know how far we're going?

1071
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,790
- it's easier to find the train.
- It's 792km.

1072
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:18,889
It's over there.

1073
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:21,830
- I see 12391.
- Really? Let's go.

1074
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:25,830
We checked what it said about the trains
on the screen.

1075
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,500
We used that to find our train.

1076
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,900
It departs at 3:02 p.m.

1077
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,670
Number 12391. At 3:02 p.m.

1078
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,299
- I think this is real-time.
- You think so?

1079
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:36,369
- So we can trust that. At 3 p.m.
- It's like...

1080
00:39:36,369 --> 00:39:38,940
- Let's go. Yes. Go.
- Shall we?

1081
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,080
Luckily,
we arrived at the train station early.

1082
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,909
So we weren't late.

1083
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:47,080
What was that? He grabbed my attention.

1084
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:49,520
(They enter while getting a big welcome
from the local.)

1085
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,589
By the way, this train looks pretty new.

1086
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:53,589
- Hey. That looks new.
- It looks nice.

1087
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:56,630
- That looks like a nice train.
- It's like KTX.

1088
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:59,730
We're taking Train 12391.

1089
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:02,400
- It's a different train?
- The number is different.

1090
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,500
- Then let's go up.
- Okay.

1091
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,670
(They go up to find their train.)

1092
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:08,009
Gosh. I love this atmosphere.

1093
00:40:08,369 --> 00:40:09,509
It's a train station in India.

1094
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:11,940
It's similar to the train station in Korea
and different at the same time.

1095
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,509
I love this atmosphere.

1096
00:40:14,549 --> 00:40:17,449
Gosh. This is like Noryangjin Station.

1097
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:20,949
- It does look like Noryangjin Station.
- Yes.

1098
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:23,150
(Korea)

1099
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,150
(India)

1100
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,460
- It does look like Noryangjin Station.
- They look similar.

1101
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:28,060
- They look similar but different.
- Right.

1102
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:29,929
- That was odd.
- It looks just like Noryangjin Station.

1103
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:33,860
Before they redeveloped train stations,
our stations looked exactly like this.

1104
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,600
It feels like we went back 30 years.

1105
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,799
(He can feel a sense of nostalgia
from this similar train station.)

1106
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,270
- Life is pretty similar around the world.
- Yes.

1107
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:41,839
It does look similar to our station.

1108
00:40:42,569 --> 00:40:43,670
(As Kian84 gets nostalgic...)

1109
00:40:43,670 --> 00:40:45,509
There's 12391.

1110
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,210
The departure time got moved up again.

1111
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:48,250
It was 3:02 p.m. earlier.

1112
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,779
- Yes. It does change in real-time.
- But it's 3 p.m. now.

1113
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,819
- It kept changing like stock prices.
- It was in real-time.

1114
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,389
Like stock prices?

1115
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:59,589
I think 19168 wants
to come into the train station.

1116
00:40:59,589 --> 00:41:01,889
- But we have a lot of time left.
- We do.

1117
00:41:01,889 --> 00:41:03,389
I think it will change later.

1118
00:41:03,389 --> 00:41:05,600
Anyway, we have an hour left. Right?

1119
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,969
- Yes.
- We have an hour left.

1120
00:41:07,969 --> 00:41:10,170
Should we go somewhere quiet...

1121
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,969
- and have some snacks?
- Shall we? Let's go over there.

1122
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,170
- Should we have some snacks?
- Yes.

1123
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:15,569
- Let's go. Okay.
- There are too many people here.

1124
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:18,940
I'm very happy.

1125
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,549
I've wanted to take the legendary
Indian trains that I've only heard about.

1126
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:25,920
- It was on his bucket list.
- On his bucket list. Yes.

1127
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,949
Once I get on the train,

1128
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:30,350
- I've done everything I wanted in India.
- Right.

1129
00:41:30,350 --> 00:41:32,560
You did laundry
and went to the cremation ghat.

1130
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,560
(After doing laundry
and visiting the cremation ghat...)

1131
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,230
It's one of the activities
on my bucket list.

1132
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:39,199
I want to stand
on top of the moving train.

1133
00:41:40,029 --> 00:41:41,330
Wait, this train... Hold on.

1134
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:43,069
- I think we'll get on a train like that.
- Right?

1135
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:44,199
- That's what I feel.
- What?

1136
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:46,739
Hey, what if we ride the train and get
electrocuted from the high-tension wire?

1137
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,040
Gosh. That's dangerous.

1138
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:50,069
You can't stand there. It's too dangerous.

1139
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,710
- Gosh. We can't. Right?
- The train...

1140
00:41:54,710 --> 00:41:56,310
Maybe, people used to stand...

1141
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:58,049
- on top of the train a long time ago.
- Right.

1142
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:02,319
It was completely different from the train
we were expecting.

1143
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:05,420
Actually, people didn't stand
on top of the moving train.

1144
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,389
People used to do that a long time ago.

1145
00:42:08,389 --> 00:42:10,130
After seeing the train,
we gave up right away.

1146
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,299
Good.

1147
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,500
I wonder what kind of snacks there are.

1148
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:17,000
Indian snacks.

1149
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,170
(Browsing Indian snacks
to fill his empty heart)

1150
00:42:18,639 --> 00:42:21,000
Trying different snacks abroad...

1151
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,869
- They are fun.
- is fun.

1152
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,639
- Which one do you want?
- Lemon?

1153
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,409
Is there anything you like, Dex?

1154
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,650
Right. This looks good.
It looks like Cheetos.

1155
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,909
- Cheetos?
- Yes.

1156
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,549
What about drinks?

1157
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,750
(Checking the temperature)

1158
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,819
It's very lukewarm.

1159
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:43,029
- Gosh. Look at him sweating.
- It must have been hot there.

1160
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:44,529
- Walking there...
- I remember that.

1161
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:47,360
Soda?

1162
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,869
How much?

1163
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,600
- Eighty.
- Eighty?

1164
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,699
- It's 80 rupees in total?
- Yes.

1165
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:55,569
- They are cheap.
- Yes, they were cheap.

1166
00:42:55,569 --> 00:42:56,610
That's nice.

1167
00:42:56,810 --> 00:42:58,639
Let's try it.
I'm curious about how it tastes.

1168
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:01,040
"Original Maaza."

1169
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:05,049
- It says 126 percent.
- It looked like a mango. So I chose it.

1170
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,219
Right, color-wise.

1171
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,049
(Gulping down)

1172
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:10,650
(Eyes opening wide)

1173
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:12,089
- It must be good.
- I bet it's good.

1174
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:17,230
Gosh. This is mango juice.

1175
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:19,630
Gosh. Korea should import this.

1176
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:21,799
- It was really good.
- It was really nice.

1177
00:43:22,069 --> 00:43:24,000
Food products from India are really good.

1178
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:26,639
- To satisfy all the people there,
- Right.

1179
00:43:26,639 --> 00:43:28,739
they must put out the best products.

1180
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:29,869
Gosh, it's good.

1181
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:30,909
(Satisfied)

1182
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,710
(Satisfied...)

1183
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,179
(with the snack too)

1184
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:35,949
(Glancing)

1185
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:39,049
By the way, they put too much air
in the snacks here too.

1186
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,119
- What?
- The nitrogen?

1187
00:43:40,119 --> 00:43:42,819
- Nitrogen.
- Come on.

1188
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:45,659
This bag does come with a lot of nitrogen.

1189
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,130
- Korea puts a lot of air in the bags too.
- Let's check yours. Nitrogen?

1190
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:50,529
- Gosh. It's the same here.
- That's about...

1191
00:43:50,529 --> 00:43:52,799
- one-third of the bag.
- Goodness. That won't be enough.

1192
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,699
Inhale the nitrogen.

1193
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,869
- Nitrogen is an ingredient too?
- Yes.

1194
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,270
(He sure is hilarious.)

1195
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,369
(Inhaling the nitrogen
as if he's been starving for days)

1196
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,440
(Dex has the snack, not the nitrogen.)

1197
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,580
This is ridiculous.

1198
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:13,380
I think someone
opened the bag and closed it again.

1199
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,889
Why is this so soggy?

1200
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:16,989
It should be crispy.

1201
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:18,790
You're so sensitive to humidity.

1202
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,219
- Right?
- Yes.

1203
00:44:20,589 --> 00:44:21,830
You really hate...

1204
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,330
anything humid.

1205
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,230
- You're Little Lee Si Eon.
- What?

1206
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,299
- You're Little Lee Si Eon.
- What?

1207
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:30,670
You're Little Lee Si Eon.

1208
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:33,170
Did he complain a lot too?

1209
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,440
- He was just like you.
- Really?

1210
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:37,909
(Si Eon's metropolitan palate...)

1211
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:40,610
(stood out even more while traveling.)

1212
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,009
- I miss him.
- Why am I so happy to see him?

1213
00:44:43,549 --> 00:44:46,619
(He whined when he didn't like the food.)

1214
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,850
- Gosh. That's...
- The alligator.

1215
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,989
(He has a picky palate.)

1216
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:51,460
(He also has a picky palate.)

1217
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:54,290
You know your backpack?
He brought a backpack about that size.

1218
00:44:54,790 --> 00:44:57,730
I see.
He likes to pack a lot of things too.

1219
00:44:57,730 --> 00:44:59,529
- Right.
- He came prepared.

1220
00:44:59,529 --> 00:45:00,630
Right.

1221
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:02,130
But they look a bit different.

1222
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:03,130
(Brutally honest)

1223
00:45:03,699 --> 00:45:06,639
Dex is an urbanite.

1224
00:45:06,699 --> 00:45:08,639
He hates humidity.

1225
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,239
So he has to spread out the sleeping bag.

1226
00:45:10,869 --> 00:45:12,679
(You're crazy!)

1227
00:45:13,239 --> 00:45:15,810
(To avoid humidity,
he came fully prepared.)

1228
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:19,779
He needs shampoo, conditioner,
and body wash.

1229
00:45:19,949 --> 00:45:22,190
(Unlike Kian84 who used to take a shower
with just water...)

1230
00:45:22,290 --> 00:45:24,889
He knows how to take care of himself.

1231
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,319
It's an urbanite.

1232
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,790
He's a city boy.

1233
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:29,989
I should check the time.

1234
00:45:30,690 --> 00:45:31,799
Okay.

1235
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:32,799
(He's also sensitive to time.)

1236
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,960
It's 2:47 p.m.

1237
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,299
- Already?
- Yes.

1238
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,929
The screen said
the train would arrive at 3 p.m.

1239
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:38,170
Okay.

1240
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:40,839
- Let's go.
- We had to get going.

1241
00:45:42,110 --> 00:45:43,369
Gosh, your backpack.

1242
00:45:43,739 --> 00:45:45,710
(His backpack hit him.)

1243
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:49,210
Gosh. Your backpack will weigh about 50kg
by the time we go back.

1244
00:45:49,549 --> 00:45:51,619
- But I really like this.
- What?

1245
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,949
- This one. It suits me nicely.
- Do you like it?

1246
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,920
(It's the bag
Kian84 fell in love with right away.)

1247
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,460
(He was drawn to it
after seeing it on the owner.)

1248
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:03,489
(He paid 200 rupees
without bargaining the price.)

1249
00:46:03,889 --> 00:46:05,400
(But in another alley,)

1250
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:07,360
(it was 100 rupees.)

1251
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,429
(Gosh. He ripped me off.)

1252
00:46:10,730 --> 00:46:12,670
(He tries to sell it back.)

1253
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,299
(Do you want to buy it?)

1254
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:16,509
(Embarrassed)

1255
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:18,909
(Dex showed interest in the bag
he failed to sell back.)

1256
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,909
(It's a present. I bought it for you.)

1257
00:46:20,909 --> 00:46:21,949
(You're lying.)

1258
00:46:21,949 --> 00:46:23,810
(Ripped off)

1259
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:27,980
(Dex loved the bag,
thinking it was a present from him.)

1260
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:29,650
I just found out about that.

1261
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:30,889
I'm sorry.

1262
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:32,790
I really thought that he bought the bag...

1263
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,159
just for me. I thought he was serious.

1264
00:46:35,159 --> 00:46:37,130
So I treasured the bag.

1265
00:46:37,130 --> 00:46:38,860
- I even brought it today.
- My gosh. No way.

1266
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,100
- Look at this.
- Hey, Dex.

1267
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,369
- I even brought it today.
- My gosh. No way.

1268
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,100
(He plops down as he's touched.)

1269
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,799
- Look at this.
- Hey, Dex. Give it back to me later.

1270
00:46:46,799 --> 00:46:48,270
- No. Forget it!
- After this...

1271
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,940
- Gosh.
- You took advantage of my love for you!

1272
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,080
Let's go to Shinsegae Department Store.
I'll buy you a bag.

1273
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,880
Let's go to a department store.

1274
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,310
- That's cool.
- It's breaking my heart. I must do it.

1275
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,480
- What? This is nice.
- Why?

1276
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,049
- It's cute.
- Look at this.

1277
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,819
- The strap came off too.
- Gosh.

1278
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,750
- So I fixed it.
- You must've worn it a lot.

1279
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,960
When the strap came off, he kept...

1280
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,119
- tying them again and again.
- My goodness.

1281
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:07,159
- Right.
- Oh, no.

1282
00:47:07,159 --> 00:47:08,560
The strap got shorter.

1283
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:11,089
- The strap was pretty long.
- Yes.

1284
00:47:11,089 --> 00:47:13,259
But now, it's hard to breathe.

1285
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,130
- I was really awful.
- Seriously.

1286
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,069
- I didn't think he would wear it a lot.
- If you made him pay for it,

1287
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:19,639
- you would've been really awful.
- Right.

1288
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,869
(Is that so?)

1289
00:47:21,869 --> 00:47:22,940
To make him feel sorry,

1290
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:25,210
- I'll wear it until we finish today.
- It looks good on you.

1291
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,009
- It's cute.
- It's cute.

1292
00:47:27,139 --> 00:47:28,250
But I like this.

1293
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,179
Right.
It's fine as long as you're happy with it.

1294
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,219
- It's 12...
- Wait. It's 123...

1295
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:37,119
- From what I observed,
- Yes.

1296
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:38,719
I think it's coming out in order.

1297
00:47:38,719 --> 00:47:40,360
It's 1239?

1298
00:47:40,819 --> 00:47:41,860
It's 12391?

1299
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,889
(This is the train they booked.)

1300
00:47:42,889 --> 00:47:44,630
- It's 3 p.m.
- Look at the screen.

1301
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:45,900
- There's a name.
- Yes.

1302
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,000
I think the train that's coming in...

1303
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,069
is the first train that's on the list now.

1304
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:52,540
- The one after this might be our train.
- Right.

1305
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,699
- After this. Five.
- Five.

1306
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,110
Shramjeevi SF Express.

1307
00:47:58,110 --> 00:47:59,779
- It's the same name.
- Okay.

1308
00:48:00,639 --> 00:48:01,779
Wait. Check this.

1309
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,949
(Mr. Checker never does things
half-heartedly.)

1310
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,949
Gosh. Dex is really good
about being thorough.

1311
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:11,089
Even if the time and the platform are set,

1312
00:48:11,319 --> 00:48:12,659
they change often.

1313
00:48:12,659 --> 00:48:15,060
Just like what he did,
you have to keep checking.

1314
00:48:15,060 --> 00:48:17,190
- Dex...
- It kept changing.

1315
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:19,630
You can't lower your guard.
You have to keep checking.

1316
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,869
If Kian84 went there alone,
he would've been in big trouble.

1317
00:48:21,869 --> 00:48:23,799
I bet he got on a different train.

1318
00:48:23,799 --> 00:48:25,900
Then I probably would've had to
live in Varanasi.

1319
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:30,139
(But he has to leave Varanasi.)

1320
00:48:30,139 --> 00:48:32,009
What is it? You can't find it?

1321
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:34,639
No. I want to check this.

1322
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,009
- This is Train 537.
- Train 537?

1323
00:48:38,110 --> 00:48:39,179
(Dex is checking.
And Kian84 just goes on his way.)

1324
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:40,619
- Gosh, Kian84.
- He's thorough.

1325
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:41,650
He's just going.

1326
00:48:41,989 --> 00:48:43,889
Dex, there's Platform Five!

1327
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:45,560
- Dex, I found it.
- Is it right?

1328
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,659
You found it?

1329
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:47,889
- The unplanner.
- Yes.

1330
00:48:48,190 --> 00:48:49,929
(He was right.)

1331
00:48:49,929 --> 00:48:50,989
It's going.

1332
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,130
(The train leaves at that moment.)

1333
00:48:54,460 --> 00:48:56,429
Gosh. He's sitting on the window.

1334
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
(Jumping in)

1335
00:48:59,299 --> 00:49:00,299
(Me too.)

1336
00:49:01,369 --> 00:49:04,239
Gosh. The train left
when everyone hadn't boarded.

1337
00:49:04,239 --> 00:49:05,440
- Hello.
- Yes.

1338
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,779
Well, everyone is getting on the train.

1339
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:14,049
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1340
00:49:14,049 --> 00:49:15,319
(He runs as if he's going to fly.)

1341
00:49:15,319 --> 00:49:16,350
Did he pick up something?

1342
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:17,489
(Getting on)

1343
00:49:17,750 --> 00:49:19,520
- Everyone has a lot of joy.
- Yes.

1344
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:20,560
That's romantic.

1345
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:22,560
- Jumping onto the moving train.
- The romantic train.

1346
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,659
(They know how to enjoy life
on this romantic train.)

1347
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:26,130
(Bye.)

1348
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:27,659
Bye.

1349
00:49:29,770 --> 00:49:31,569
- Bye.
- You could even shake hands.

1350
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:32,739
Bye. Good luck.

1351
00:49:34,170 --> 00:49:35,710
I thought I was pretty cool.

1352
00:49:37,909 --> 00:49:39,080
Look at his proud face.

1353
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,310
(This is the romance of life.)

1354
00:49:40,739 --> 00:49:43,549
It's like I'm a drill sergeant,
sending off my recruits.

1355
00:49:43,549 --> 00:49:45,980
- What am I doing?
- Sending off his recruits.

1356
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:47,819
(Returning with a sense of romance
from the military service)

1357
00:49:48,049 --> 00:49:50,719
- Let's go this way to get on the train.
- Okay.

1358
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,460
I thought it was supposed
to come at 3 p.m.

1359
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,429
I thought the timetable was in real-time.
I guess we were wrong.

1360
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,429
In India, buses and trains...

1361
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:01,969
- usually don't arrive on time.
- That's rare.

1362
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,199
Let's check... Wait. Is that it?

1363
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,469
It must be the train
that's approaching the station now.

1364
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:07,500
I see.

1365
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,839
(The train is approaching
the station now.)

1366
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:13,210
- It's over there. It's still not here.
- Right.

1367
00:50:13,710 --> 00:50:15,409
- It's slow.
- It's slow.

1368
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:16,610
Very slow.

1369
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:19,350
(Plopping down)

1370
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,920
It's taking so long.
We spotted the train a long time ago.

1371
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:26,719
It's coming in.

1372
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:29,929
(I'm still on my way.)

1373
00:50:34,029 --> 00:50:36,199
Gosh. This place...

1374
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,469
- is always trying to feel us out.
- It's feeling us out?

1375
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:41,069
Take the groom and the train, for example.

1376
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,810
We spotted the train,
so it should be here by now.

1377
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,239
This is the Groom Incident Two.

1378
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,409
(The groom didn't seem like
he was going to show up.)

1379
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,420
- Just like the groom.
- Right.

1380
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:58,489
How come the train isn't coming here?
It's going somewhere else?

1381
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,219
What?

1382
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:02,360
- The tracks are different.
- Yes. It went to another one.

1383
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,259
Is it what I saw earlier?

1384
00:51:04,989 --> 00:51:06,100
He's tired.

1385
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,630
It's because
everything is fast in our country.

1386
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,469
- Right.
- We're so used to that.

1387
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:12,569
(Looking around)

1388
00:51:13,969 --> 00:51:17,009
Right. They are the only two people
who seem nervous.

1389
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:18,409
Wait.

1390
00:51:18,409 --> 00:51:19,540
No. It's just one person.

1391
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:23,580
Excuse me.

1392
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,650
- Can you speak English?
- Yes.

1393
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:27,980
Okay. I have one question.

1394
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:30,319
Over there. What does "BSB" mean?

1395
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:32,520
- Shramjeevi is coming now, right?
- Yes.

1396
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:33,560
Yes.

1397
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,690
He's checking everything.

1398
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,830
When I'm curious about something,
I must get the answers.

1399
00:51:38,029 --> 00:51:39,960
But he's going
to just roll with the punches.

1400
00:51:40,830 --> 00:51:42,929
Gosh, this is nice.

1401
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,040
(Peaceful)

1402
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:47,569
Where's the platform number?

1403
00:51:47,869 --> 00:51:49,310
What does NR mean?

1404
00:51:49,310 --> 00:51:51,540
Yes. It's the platform number.

1405
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,239
- I was asking questions.
- "Proud."

1406
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:55,880
- Thank you so much.
- What's up with his sweet gaze?

1407
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,250
(His thoroughness makes
everyone around him proud.)

1408
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:58,250
Kian84.

1409
00:51:58,779 --> 00:52:01,080
I can't stand not having answers
to my questions. So I went and asked.

1410
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:03,989
- Let me explain what BSB means.
- Okay.

1411
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:05,489
That's like Hongik University Station.

1412
00:52:05,690 --> 00:52:07,360
- That's the name of the station.
- The name of the station.

1413
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:08,589
- That's BSB.
- Yes.

1414
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:10,630
So that's like Hongik University Station.

1415
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,330
- We're at BSB Station.
- Okay.

1416
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:14,029
Did you find out the platform
we should be at?

1417
00:52:14,029 --> 00:52:15,429
I think this is the right platform.

1418
00:52:15,429 --> 00:52:18,199
- We had to be at Platform Five.
- Yes.

1419
00:52:18,199 --> 00:52:19,540
I think we came to the right platform.

1420
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:22,170
PF5 means Platform 5.

1421
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:23,310
Platform Five.

1422
00:52:24,110 --> 00:52:25,839
- Platform Five.
- Gosh, look at his eyes.

1423
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:28,139
So we're at Platform Five.

1424
00:52:28,139 --> 00:52:29,610
- Then...
- Platform Five.

1425
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,610
You know what?
Let's ask again once the train comes in.

1426
00:52:32,850 --> 00:52:34,350
(He's not worried at all
like the locals in India.)

1427
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:36,819
I get the feeling
that it will come very late.

1428
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:39,989
(Yawning)

1429
00:52:39,989 --> 00:52:41,089
He's so laid back.

1430
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:44,159
(On the other hand,
the younger one is nervous.)

1431
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,190
Not yet?

1432
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:46,929
Not yet?

1433
00:52:47,299 --> 00:52:49,130
Shramjeevi isn't here yet?

1434
00:52:49,130 --> 00:52:51,000
- No.
- Is it coming now?

1435
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,369
- Yes. It's coming now.
- Okay.

1436
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:54,400
She was using an app.

1437
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:55,440
(Using an app)

1438
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,839
Ten minutes left.

1439
00:52:56,839 --> 00:52:58,210
I see. Ten minutes.

1440
00:52:58,469 --> 00:52:59,580
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1441
00:52:59,580 --> 00:53:01,210
- We have ten minutes left.
- Okay.

1442
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,850
Get some rest. Get some hot.

1443
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:05,179
"Get some hot."

1444
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,779
- You wanted him to get some sun?
- It was a nice spot for photosynthesis.

1445
00:53:07,779 --> 00:53:09,389
I see. Get some sun.

1446
00:53:09,949 --> 00:53:11,650
Gosh. I should take a nap.

1447
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,429
It's time for a nap.

1448
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,460
(He looks like a local
when he takes a nap.)

1449
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,369
He's localized perfectly.

1450
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,670
What time is it?

1451
00:53:27,369 --> 00:53:28,639
It's 3:16 p.m.

1452
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:32,710
(The train has been delayed
by 16 minutes.)

1453
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,139
What's your name?

1454
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:36,549
My name is Maya.

1455
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:38,719
Maya? My name is Kim.

1456
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:39,779
Nice to meet you.

1457
00:53:39,779 --> 00:53:40,819
(Kim...)

1458
00:53:42,049 --> 00:53:43,089
- That guy.
- What is this?

1459
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,119
What was that?

1460
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:46,659
- Why does he keep staring at you?
- What's he doing there?

1461
00:53:46,659 --> 00:53:48,830
- What's up with his sweet gaze?
- Dex.

1462
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:51,259
There's so much love in his gaze.

1463
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:55,199
Goodness. He's looking at Dex so sweetly.

1464
00:53:55,969 --> 00:53:57,500
Your husband?

1465
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:59,400
(He keeps checking things.)

1466
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:00,440
No.

1467
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,069
I thought the guy standing next to her
was her husband.

1468
00:54:03,069 --> 00:54:04,369
- No.
- Not my husband.

1469
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:05,739
- Sorry.
- Not my husband.

1470
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:08,949
Namaste. Sorry.

1471
00:54:08,949 --> 00:54:10,210
I repented right away.

1472
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:11,710
(Maya and the man in a yellow shirt
aren't married.)

1473
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:14,449
(He returns after checking everything.)

1474
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,659
(Chuckling)

1475
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:19,860
(Looking utterly comfortable)

1476
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,190
He's made himself at home there.

1477
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:23,190
Kian84, you always accept nature's way.

1478
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,159
Lie down. It's comfortable.

1479
00:54:25,330 --> 00:54:26,360
Gosh.

1480
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:28,869
I mean, there are crumbs on the ground.

1481
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:30,299
I see snack crumbs.

1482
00:54:30,299 --> 00:54:31,869
There were a lot of crumbs from snacks.

1483
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:33,170
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

1484
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:34,400
That's Mother Ground.

1485
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,170
- Right. Mother.
- I knew it. India84.

1486
00:54:36,509 --> 00:54:38,679
- My shirt will get dirty again anyway.
- It will get dirty again anyway.

1487
00:54:39,679 --> 00:54:42,009
You know what? That's just a number.

1488
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:44,449
The train might arrive at 4 p.m.

1489
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:46,279
(Relaxed)

1490
00:54:46,279 --> 00:54:48,049
Dex, get some rest.

1491
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:49,650
He's relaxed.

1492
00:54:49,989 --> 00:54:51,690
He's the best traveler for India.

1493
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:53,119
- Seriously.
- Yes.

1494
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:55,759
(But...)

1495
00:54:55,759 --> 00:54:57,159
I'm thirsty. Darn it.

1496
00:54:57,429 --> 00:54:59,199
It's way too sunny here.

1497
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,860
I should lie down that way.

1498
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:04,069
Kian84.

1499
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:05,330
(His shirt picked up a lot of crumbs
in the meantime.)

1500
00:55:05,770 --> 00:55:07,639
Thanks to him, that spot must be clean.

1501
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:09,969
Dex, I'll rest up here.

1502
00:55:11,909 --> 00:55:13,009
Gosh, he's so funny.

1503
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,210
(Swiping)

1504
00:55:16,049 --> 00:55:17,580
(He pushes away some big chunks
out of courtesy.)

1505
00:55:17,580 --> 00:55:19,179
Gosh. He lay down on the ground.

1506
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,080
Kian84 is something else.

1507
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:22,420
- Not everyone can do that.
- Seriously.

1508
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:25,119
Even locals put something down
before they lie down.

1509
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:26,790
- Right.
- A lot of them were lying down.

1510
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,219
A Korean guy over there...

1511
00:55:29,830 --> 00:55:30,929
(On the other hand,
Mr. Korean Checker is anxious.)

1512
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:31,929
(Groaning)

1513
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,699
They must be building a train now.

1514
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:38,569
(As they wait for the train
that doesn't come...)

1515
00:55:39,569 --> 00:55:41,799
Dex is really anxious.

1516
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:45,369
(Kian84 is waiting for the train at ease.)

1517
00:55:45,940 --> 00:55:47,080
(In the same place,
but different attitudes)

1518
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:48,639
They are the two extremes.

1519
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,380
Gosh. When will it come?

1520
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,810
It was supposed to come at 3 p.m.

1521
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:54,250
- It didn't arrive at 3:25 p.m.
- Right.

1522
00:55:54,619 --> 00:55:55,619
(Whistling)

1523
00:55:57,549 --> 00:55:59,489
- Is it here?
- At last?

1524
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,489
- It's here.
- I think that's it.

1525
00:56:01,489 --> 00:56:03,089
- It's coming.
- How precious.

1526
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:06,500
(Finally!)

1527
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,159
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1528
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:09,199
The train is here.

1529
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,299
- It's here?
- Yes.

1530
00:56:10,299 --> 00:56:11,799
We have to go.

1531
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,699
(Excited)

1532
00:56:15,369 --> 00:56:16,810
(Gathering his things)

1533
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,610
(The train is finally here.)

1534
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,250
(Dusting off)

1535
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:24,350
Look at this.
He's taking his time to dust it off.

1536
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,980
- Right.
- Yes.

1537
00:56:26,279 --> 00:56:28,449
Gosh. Waiting for the train
was exhausting.

1538
00:56:29,690 --> 00:56:30,790
(They finally see the train.)

1539
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,259
Gosh, the Indian train.

1540
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:34,319
It's better than I thought.

1541
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:36,429
- The facility looks nice.
- It isn't bad.

1542
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:39,960
Why are there people at the windows?

1543
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:41,699
- That's...
- Gosh.

1544
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:43,069
(Peeking out)

1545
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,100
- What is it?
- It scared me.

1546
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,100
- They must be getting off.
- Right.

1547
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:48,440
They must've been anxious
because the train...

1548
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,710
- ran late.
- Totally.

1549
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:50,739
(The people were desperate to get off.)

1550
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:52,980
The condition isn't all that great.

1551
00:56:54,279 --> 00:56:55,440
(They're half-excited and half-worried
at the sight.)

1552
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:58,449
- When I saw it in person, I felt...
- Right.

1553
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,549
- It doesn't look easy.
- No, it didn't.

1554
00:57:00,549 --> 00:57:01,650
They came sitting down like that?

1555
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,949
(As the train continues to come in)

1556
00:57:03,949 --> 00:57:04,949
(Smelling)

1557
00:57:04,949 --> 00:57:06,159
Okay.

1558
00:57:06,159 --> 00:57:07,420
(Smelling)

1559
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:10,190
The train has this familiar smell.

1560
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,130
(A familiar smell from afar)

1561
00:57:12,130 --> 00:57:13,600
- Gosh.
- It came with...

1562
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:15,000
that familiar smell.

1563
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,299
(The train slowly stops.)

1564
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,940
(The passengers get on and off freely.)

1565
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,810
(The Ganges Brothers try to board.)

1566
00:57:25,139 --> 00:57:27,310
What's that?
That must be the standing class.

1567
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:28,509
Yes, the standing class.

1568
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:29,750
- A man is hanging from the door.
- Yes.

1569
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:32,480
There must be a hole.
He must've used that to get on.

1570
00:57:32,619 --> 00:57:34,750
It's the standing class.
People are hanging from the door.

1571
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:38,420
People can easily ride the train for free
in the standing class.

1572
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,619
You should get on the train
before it leaves.

1573
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,529
- Shall we get on?
- Okay.

1574
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:46,529
We weren't aware
of where the sleeper class...

1575
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,100
was back then.

1576
00:57:48,100 --> 00:57:51,100
Despite checking multiple times,
I couldn't locate it.

1577
00:57:51,100 --> 00:57:53,170
But we never knew
when it was going to leave again.

1578
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,299
So we decided to get on the train first,

1579
00:57:55,299 --> 00:57:57,270
and we did.

1580
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:58,909
I don't know. Let's go.

1581
00:57:58,909 --> 00:57:59,940
(They don't know if it's the right car.)

1582
00:58:00,580 --> 00:58:01,940
- Gosh.
- Man, an Indian train.

1583
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:02,949
(Getting on the train by accident)

1584
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:04,110
Everything looks so interesting.

1585
00:58:04,110 --> 00:58:06,380
- What? The AC is on.
- It's a lot cooler than I expected.

1586
00:58:07,049 --> 00:58:09,219
- Hey. This is...
- How nice.

1587
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:10,719
- the high-class car.
- What?

1588
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,790
- There's a hallway.
- It was really nice.

1589
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:13,960
- I can tell.
- Gosh.

1590
00:58:13,960 --> 00:58:15,790
If it has AC,

1591
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:17,790
it must be a first-class car.

1592
00:58:17,790 --> 00:58:20,600
- He's right. That was the so-called...
- You got in the right car.

1593
00:58:20,659 --> 00:58:21,799
It's nice.

1594
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:23,600
This feels a lot like the S class.

1595
00:58:23,730 --> 00:58:25,170
The AC is air conditioning.

1596
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:26,440
- It had private rooms...
- A secretive...

1597
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,639
- like that.
- A secret room.

1598
00:58:27,639 --> 00:58:29,440
- Flight-wise, it's first class.
- Yes.

1599
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,940
To stay in that car,

1600
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,409
you had to book it
two months prior, right?

1601
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:34,710
- That's right.
- Yes.

1602
00:58:35,210 --> 00:58:36,310
We can see the inside.

1603
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:37,779
Nice.

1604
00:58:38,009 --> 00:58:40,449
- Four people can stay in one room.
- It looks nice.

1605
00:58:40,449 --> 00:58:43,190
The first class was 50 dollars.

1606
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,020
I should've booked that room
two months prior.

1607
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:49,130
How would you have done it two months ago?

1608
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:51,259
You didn't even decide
what to do the next day.

1609
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:53,860
It's at times like those
I dislike my disposition.

1610
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:54,900
(His spontaneity upsets him.)

1611
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,299
After seeing it, staying in that room...

1612
00:58:57,299 --> 00:58:58,730
- became my bucket list.
- Bucket list?

1613
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:02,170
He's updating his bucket list
in real-time.

1614
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:04,409
(Planning to update it continuously)

1615
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:07,210
- So you left after looking around?
- Yes.

1616
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,909
- They know that it exists now.
- Sooner or later...

1617
00:59:08,909 --> 00:59:10,710
The S class is over.

1618
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,920
This car isn't bad, either.

1619
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,819
That's plenty good. It's more than enough.

1620
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:17,290
- It's nice.
- The business class.

1621
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,460
- Is that the business class?
- Yes, the business class.

1622
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:20,860
- That isn't bad at all.
- Gosh.

1623
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,159
It smells refreshing and nice here.

1624
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,730
Because there's an AC,

1625
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:27,159
the inside is separated from the outside.

1626
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:29,529
So no dust or smell comes into the car.

1627
00:59:29,529 --> 00:59:31,799
That car was about 25 dollars.

1628
00:59:31,799 --> 00:59:33,699
- If it's 25 dollars, it's half the price.
- Yes.

1629
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,440
This is good enough.

1630
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:37,909
Sorry.

1631
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:39,509
Sorry.

1632
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,080
Okay, sorry.

1633
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,279
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

1634
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:44,310
(Pausing)

1635
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,350
Sorry.

1636
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,350
You can't go through.

1637
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,049
That was so inconvenient.

1638
00:59:49,049 --> 00:59:51,589
Next time, I won't take a bag like that.

1639
00:59:51,750 --> 00:59:54,020
- Why did you take such a big bag?
- I regretted it.

1640
00:59:54,020 --> 00:59:55,460
It taught me a big lesson.

1641
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,190
- Is it a backpack?
- So you do realize things.

1642
00:59:57,190 --> 00:59:59,259
I really regretted the fact that...

1643
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:00,730
I didn't reserve the first class...

1644
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:02,000
- two months before.
- Gosh.

1645
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:03,900
That's how you learn.

1646
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,170
You just get ahead of yourself.

1647
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:07,469
(The lookalike brothers
regret things together.)

1648
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,839
(Moving forth with regrets on his back)

1649
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:14,739
Gosh. What's this? Hey.

1650
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:15,980
What's with the color?

1651
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,980
The class has gone down.

1652
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,179
There are no curtains here.

1653
01:00:21,179 --> 01:00:23,520
No. There was no privacy.

1654
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,949
- It's quite open.
- Is this the place?

1655
01:00:25,819 --> 01:00:27,719
The AC is running in here.

1656
01:00:27,719 --> 01:00:28,819
So far, yes.

1657
01:00:28,819 --> 01:00:30,589
The class right below business class.

1658
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:31,929
Economy class?

1659
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,860
Is it called a guest house?

1660
01:00:33,860 --> 01:00:35,159
- A dormitory?
- A dormitory.

1661
01:00:35,159 --> 01:00:37,400
It feels like a dormitory.
You can easily make friends.

1662
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,199
- It'd be easy to talk to your neighbors.
- Yes.

1663
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,270
(Hold on. But...)

1664
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:42,810
Where are we right now?

1665
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:45,509
Where did we get on the train?

1666
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:48,480
(Opening the door)

1667
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,779
- The train was super long.
- Gosh.

1668
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:51,909
There's no end.

1669
01:00:52,009 --> 01:00:53,179
Sorry.

1670
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,119
How many compartments must we pass?

1671
01:00:57,819 --> 01:01:00,159
Dex. Don't tell me we have to go
all the way to the end.

1672
01:01:00,259 --> 01:01:01,819
I think our seats are near the end.

1673
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,900
We got on from the first compartment,
so the first class.

1674
01:01:06,060 --> 01:01:08,000
We're currently walking all the way down.

1675
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,730
There are about five classes.

1676
01:01:10,869 --> 01:01:12,900
It's 1AC, 2AC, 3AC,

1677
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:14,299
and the sleeper class.

1678
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:15,770
The general class...

1679
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:18,239
has no AC or beds. There are only chairs.

1680
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:21,139
It's what we saw earlier
with all the luggage and people.

1681
01:01:21,139 --> 01:01:22,449
That was...

1682
01:01:22,610 --> 01:01:23,610
- The general class?
- Yes.

1683
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,549
At least we rode the second to last class.

1684
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,380
- The sleeper class.
- Nice.

1685
01:01:28,779 --> 01:01:29,790
(Current location)

1686
01:01:29,790 --> 01:01:32,049
I wonder what the sleeper class is like.

1687
01:01:32,819 --> 01:01:33,819
(Smelling)

1688
01:01:34,759 --> 01:01:37,029
- What? Is this the restaurant?
- It seems like it.

1689
01:01:37,389 --> 01:01:38,429
Smell.

1690
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:40,029
- This was nice.
- Gosh.

1691
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,130
- It was really long.
- Doesn't it look dreamy?

1692
01:01:42,670 --> 01:01:43,770
Namaste.

1693
01:01:43,770 --> 01:01:44,869
It's nice.

1694
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:47,839
- It's like the Mugunghwa train.
- My gosh.

1695
01:01:48,339 --> 01:01:50,009
It's the same as our old trains.

1696
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:52,779
That's what old Korean trains looked like.

1697
01:01:52,779 --> 01:01:53,909
(Bringing back memories
of the restaurant car)

1698
01:01:54,239 --> 01:01:56,380
- While you're on the train,
- Yes?

1699
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:58,750
people come and go
with lunch boxes and meals.

1700
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:00,350
That must be where those are made.

1701
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:02,549
- You're right.
- It's my first time seeing one.

1702
01:02:02,989 --> 01:02:04,690
Gosh, it smells amazing.

1703
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:07,159
Seriously.

1704
01:02:07,719 --> 01:02:09,130
(Amazed)

1705
01:02:09,130 --> 01:02:10,259
(Amazed)

1706
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,429
(Amazed)

1707
01:02:11,529 --> 01:02:13,000
Namaste.

1708
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,500
(Dex is amazed by the restaurant.)

1709
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:16,770
Because you got on
a different compartment,

1710
01:02:16,770 --> 01:02:18,799
- we get to see the whole train.
- Right?

1711
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:19,869
It was fun.

1712
01:02:19,869 --> 01:02:21,040
We're just heading straight.

1713
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:22,670
- It's a trip, after all.
- Now then...

1714
01:02:22,909 --> 01:02:25,139
(After getting refreshed,
they keep heading straight.)

1715
01:02:25,469 --> 01:02:27,339
Now then.

1716
01:02:27,339 --> 01:02:28,610
Hold on. Something...

1717
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,509
The atmosphere has changed.

1718
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:32,920
The air has changed.

1719
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:34,920
I feel like the air will change.

1720
01:02:34,920 --> 01:02:38,049
- Dex, there's no AC.
- This is the car.

1721
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:39,819
Gosh, we're dead.

1722
01:02:39,819 --> 01:02:41,690
- Did the air feel different?
- Yes.

1723
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,659
- It was suddenly humid.
- Right.

1724
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,060
We have arrived.

1725
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,860
- So this is the place.
- This is the sleeper class.

1726
01:02:49,929 --> 01:02:51,369
(The bare feet
are giving off strange vibes.)

1727
01:02:51,369 --> 01:02:52,500
His feet.

1728
01:02:52,869 --> 01:02:54,500
The class we rode was eight dollars.

1729
01:02:54,500 --> 01:02:56,139
(Sleeper class, about 8 dollars)

1730
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,770
(No AC, 6 people per sector,
3 beds on each wall)

1731
01:02:57,770 --> 01:02:58,969
- Gosh.
- Sorry.

1732
01:02:58,969 --> 01:03:01,080
Goodness. Sorry.

1733
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:02,750
- Dex.
- Yes?

1734
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:04,279
There's no AC.

1735
01:03:04,279 --> 01:03:06,150
- So there are fans instead.
- Yes.

1736
01:03:06,819 --> 01:03:08,679
The structure is similar to 3AC,

1737
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:10,449
- but there's no AC.
- I see.

1738
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:12,250
- Backpackers usually use...
- Yes?

1739
01:03:12,250 --> 01:03:13,860
the sleeper class because it's cheap.

1740
01:03:13,989 --> 01:03:15,489
They choose 3AC or the sleeper class.

1741
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:16,659
(It's popular among backpackers.)

1742
01:03:16,889 --> 01:03:20,199
Goodness. This is quite despairing.

1743
01:03:20,529 --> 01:03:22,670
What makes it worse is that
you two saw the higher classes.

1744
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:23,799
I know, right?

1745
01:03:24,130 --> 01:03:25,270
I'm sweating already.

1746
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:28,569
I started sweating
the moment I stepped foot inside here.

1747
01:03:28,569 --> 01:03:30,040
(It's hot starting from the entrance.)

1748
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:31,310
It's like a sauna.

1749
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,380
- The journey finally begins.
- So that's where you'll ride.

1750
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,739
Gosh.

1751
01:03:35,239 --> 01:03:37,810
Who would've thought the classes
would be this different?

1752
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,279
Goodness, how interesting.

1753
01:03:39,779 --> 01:03:42,819
I heard there was no AC,
but the AC was running.

1754
01:03:42,949 --> 01:03:44,350
This was the luxurious class.

1755
01:03:44,350 --> 01:03:47,119
The classes became lower
the more we went in.

1756
01:03:47,889 --> 01:03:50,060
The more we walked, the more...

1757
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,230
How should I put it?

1758
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,199
It was like "Snowpiercer."

1759
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:55,799
Yes. It was like the real version
of "Snowpiercer."

1760
01:03:56,429 --> 01:03:59,000
- Gosh.
- It's the same as a plane.

1761
01:04:01,400 --> 01:04:03,310
(His nose gets to work.)

1762
01:04:03,509 --> 01:04:06,239
I can smell various scents.

1763
01:04:08,239 --> 01:04:10,880
But, well, it feels nice.

1764
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:12,449
Like these vintage fans.

1765
01:04:12,449 --> 01:04:13,549
(He has a classic taste.)

1766
01:04:13,549 --> 01:04:16,150
You can surely experience
more things there.

1767
01:04:16,150 --> 01:04:17,949
Right. You're very optimistic.

1768
01:04:18,449 --> 01:04:19,619
This is our compartment.

1769
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:23,460
We walked through the hallway
for about ten minutes.

1770
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:25,190
The train was really long.

1771
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,960
(Looking around)

1772
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,100
What? Is this 58?

1773
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:32,400
Where are our seats?

1774
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,670
(This is the right compartment.)

1775
01:04:36,969 --> 01:04:38,770
Was somebody already sitting in your seat?

1776
01:04:38,770 --> 01:04:41,339
Yes. It really took me by surprise.

1777
01:04:41,639 --> 01:04:43,909
Wait. Why is our seat...

1778
01:04:45,049 --> 01:04:47,279
We came to our seats right now.

1779
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:48,650
But they won't budge.

1780
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:50,690
Where is your ticket?

1781
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:53,219
Two over here. There's no problem.

1782
01:04:53,219 --> 01:04:55,319
They say... Come sit here.

1783
01:04:55,319 --> 01:04:57,060
They won't move from my seat.

1784
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:58,130
Really?

1785
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:01,029
I'm starting to feel anxious.

1786
01:05:01,029 --> 01:05:02,500
The ticket? The number.

1787
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,069
It's 60...

1788
01:05:04,069 --> 01:05:05,230
(Let me see.)

1789
01:05:05,230 --> 01:05:06,839
Seat number 58 is this middle seat.

1790
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:08,270
- The middle seat?
- Yes.

1791
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,909
Seat number 60 is downstairs.

1792
01:05:09,909 --> 01:05:10,940
- Okay.
- Number 60.

1793
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:12,009
Thank you.

1794
01:05:12,009 --> 01:05:13,440
Why is he not getting up?

1795
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:14,810
Why isn't he getting up?

1796
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:16,610
Why are you not standing?

1797
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,750
You get up.

1798
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,279
(Should I?)

1799
01:05:21,679 --> 01:05:23,850
My number is 60.

1800
01:05:23,850 --> 01:05:24,920
Okay.

1801
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,759
(Dex could take a seat
as they reached an agreement.)

1802
01:05:26,759 --> 01:05:27,819
Hey.

1803
01:05:28,060 --> 01:05:29,730
My...

1804
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,730
- Why?
- I got it, but...

1805
01:05:30,730 --> 01:05:33,529
(Both his seat and the ability to speak
were taken away from him.)

1806
01:05:33,529 --> 01:05:35,130
Where's my seat then?

1807
01:05:35,130 --> 01:05:36,270
Yours? In the middle.

1808
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:37,299
- You should unfold this.
- Right in the middle here?

1809
01:05:37,299 --> 01:05:38,699
She's lying down on it.

1810
01:05:38,699 --> 01:05:41,040
- Excuse me.
- Can you wake up?

1811
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,170
You might not know,

1812
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,679
but I was having a silent battle...

1813
01:05:46,679 --> 01:05:48,210
with the lady.

1814
01:05:48,210 --> 01:05:49,409
- You were?
- Yes.

1815
01:05:49,409 --> 01:05:51,049
She looked at me.

1816
01:05:51,049 --> 01:05:52,779
She was looking at him
with the glasses on.

1817
01:05:52,779 --> 01:05:55,279
I told her. I gave her the look.

1818
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:57,219
"This is my seat."

1819
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:58,589
But she didn't get up.

1820
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:00,690
The battle continued.

1821
01:06:02,489 --> 01:06:04,730
(A silent battle was going on in secret.)

1822
01:06:04,730 --> 01:06:06,600
- The middle.
- The middle.

1823
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,199
Yes. Sorry.

1824
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:10,230
- She got up.
- She got up now.

1825
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:11,600
She got up and sat.

1826
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:14,069
Thanks. Thank you.

1827
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:17,710
(He finally took a seat.)

1828
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:19,639
- I was sorry for no reason.
- Yes.

1829
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:21,239
I just took the seat I paid for.

1830
01:06:21,239 --> 01:06:22,880
Because it felt like you took her seat?

1831
01:06:22,880 --> 01:06:24,110
You're a nice guy.

1832
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:30,150
It departed an hour late?

1833
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,920
It departed about an hour late.

1834
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,960
(The train departs about 1 hour late
at 4 p.m.)

1835
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,429
(Sitting close)

1836
01:06:36,429 --> 01:06:38,290
- Did you have to sit close like that?
- Yes.

1837
01:06:38,860 --> 01:06:41,299
(Looking around)

1838
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,869
Does the guy next to you
not have a ticket?

1839
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:47,299
What...

1840
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,000
What's your number?

1841
01:06:49,710 --> 01:06:51,040
I don't have any.

1842
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,980
I'm going to get off
an hour and a half later.

1843
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:56,409
No ticket?

1844
01:06:56,580 --> 01:06:58,310
I don't need a ticket.

1845
01:06:58,310 --> 01:06:59,949
- You don't need a ticket.
- Yes.

1846
01:07:00,350 --> 01:07:02,850
(He probably doesn't have a ticket
because he paid for standing class.)

1847
01:07:02,850 --> 01:07:04,190
No problem.

1848
01:07:04,190 --> 01:07:06,319
- No problem?
- After eight o'clock,

1849
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,290
- they will get up.
- Eight o'clock?

1850
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:11,360
So we can sleep starting from 9 p.m.

1851
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:12,489
Yes.

1852
01:07:12,489 --> 01:07:14,299
Each wall is supposed...

1853
01:07:14,299 --> 01:07:15,860
- to have three beds.
- Yes.

1854
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:19,069
But for the seats in the middle,
we could unfold it...

1855
01:07:19,069 --> 01:07:20,369
to lie down after 8 p.m.

1856
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,500
- That's why you were sitting with others?
- Yes.

1857
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:24,670
So it's okay as long as you leave
at night.

1858
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:27,710
I guess that's how they use trains
in India.

1859
01:07:28,279 --> 01:07:30,179
I'm kind of jealous of those
on the top seat.

1860
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:32,110
(They have enough room on the top seat.)

1861
01:07:32,110 --> 01:07:33,420
It looks really comfortable on the top.

1862
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:37,089
It's hot, though.

1863
01:07:38,489 --> 01:07:41,219
It was 33℃ outside.

1864
01:07:41,819 --> 01:07:43,929
(The vintage fans aren't enough...)

1865
01:07:44,889 --> 01:07:45,929
Gosh, it's hot.

1866
01:07:45,929 --> 01:07:47,830
(to beat the heat.)

1867
01:07:48,699 --> 01:07:51,029
(The warmth of the other people
is added as well.)

1868
01:07:51,029 --> 01:07:52,569
It's driving me crazy.

1869
01:07:52,569 --> 01:07:53,699
- It looks suffocating.
- It...

1870
01:07:53,699 --> 01:07:55,000
It was steaming hot.

1871
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,270
- Seriously.
- And it was very human.

1872
01:07:57,270 --> 01:07:59,339
There was this human smell.

1873
01:07:59,339 --> 01:08:01,409
- Right.
- Various kinds of smells.

1874
01:08:01,409 --> 01:08:02,440
Really?

1875
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,179
I feel hot.

1876
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:05,750
- I feel so hot.
- Just by watching the video.

1877
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,779
It's hot and suffocating
just by watching the video.

1878
01:08:07,779 --> 01:08:10,319
Did you travel like that for 13 hours?

1879
01:08:10,319 --> 01:08:11,920
- Yes.
- I can't imagine.

1880
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:18,589
I'll take back what I said earlier.

1881
01:08:18,589 --> 01:08:19,600
Why?

1882
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:21,130
I said I liked vintage things.
I take it back.

1883
01:08:21,699 --> 01:08:22,699
Vintage things.

1884
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,100
This is already tiring.

1885
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,799
But I said I would go on the roof.

1886
01:08:27,299 --> 01:08:28,869
I was out of my mind.

1887
01:08:29,909 --> 01:08:31,139
I did everything I wanted.

1888
01:08:31,369 --> 01:08:33,409
- You did?
- I could get off at the next station.

1889
01:08:34,810 --> 01:08:37,679
(Goodbye, my bucket list.)

1890
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,020
This is what I think about a bucket list.

1891
01:08:40,219 --> 01:08:42,080
It could change right before you do it.

1892
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:45,250
When I see it in person,
and it's different from what I thought,

1893
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:47,290
I boldly remove it from my bucket list.

1894
01:08:47,489 --> 01:08:48,860
I don't try it.

1895
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:52,860
(Throwing away the bucket list,
they're going to New Delhi.)

1896
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,830
The train is really slow.

1897
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,330
- Because it was moving at this speed.
- Right.

1898
01:08:57,330 --> 01:08:58,600
It was moving like this.

1899
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:00,839
When you take a train,
it has a unique vibe.

1900
01:09:00,839 --> 01:09:01,969
Looking at the view.

1901
01:09:01,969 --> 01:09:03,639
Right. Looking outside.

1902
01:09:04,909 --> 01:09:06,009
(What?)

1903
01:09:06,009 --> 01:09:07,040
Hello.

1904
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:08,610
- Hello.
- Hello.

1905
01:09:08,610 --> 01:09:10,710
- She got on just now.
- Right. You could make friends.

1906
01:09:10,710 --> 01:09:12,810
You should at least do stuff like that
since it's a 13-hour journey.

1907
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:14,380
Where are you going?

1908
01:09:14,380 --> 01:09:15,420
New Delhi.

1909
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:16,489
- New Delhi?
- New Delhi?

1910
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:17,750
Us too.

1911
01:09:18,589 --> 01:09:21,920
Why are you going to New Delhi?

1912
01:09:22,219 --> 01:09:23,759
Why are you going to New Delhi?

1913
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:26,360
It's for my job.

1914
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,160
What's your job?

1915
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:30,700
- Automobiles.
- Automobile?

1916
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:32,299
What's that? Driving?

1917
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:33,839
- No.
- No.

1918
01:09:33,839 --> 01:09:35,400
- Sales and purchase.
- I see.

1919
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:37,070
Sales? You?

1920
01:09:37,070 --> 01:09:38,839
- Saleswoman?
- Saleswoman.

1921
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:40,310
(The new friend is a car salesperson.)

1922
01:09:40,310 --> 01:09:43,209
Do you sell many cars?

1923
01:09:44,249 --> 01:09:45,280
Yes.

1924
01:09:45,749 --> 01:09:47,480
Are you the best salesperson?

1925
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,919
- He said that in Korean.
- He said that in Korean.

1926
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,089
(In the morning,)

1927
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:55,320
(he was confident about his English.)

1928
01:09:56,120 --> 01:09:58,690
(But there's a big language barrier
in reality.)

1929
01:09:59,530 --> 01:10:01,060
I want to have a conversation too.

1930
01:10:03,230 --> 01:10:06,230
Is your country Delhi?

1931
01:10:06,669 --> 01:10:08,100
Is your country Delhi?

1932
01:10:08,100 --> 01:10:10,440
- India.
- India. Your country?

1933
01:10:11,669 --> 01:10:13,379
Your country city.

1934
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:14,679
What?

1935
01:10:14,679 --> 01:10:16,209
Where is your hometown?

1936
01:10:16,209 --> 01:10:18,209
(Where is your hometown?)

1937
01:10:18,209 --> 01:10:19,679
Where were you born?

1938
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,320
- Bihar.
- Bihar.

1939
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:22,350
Bihar.

1940
01:10:22,549 --> 01:10:24,320
He's a YouTuber.

1941
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,320
I'm a YouTuber in Korea.

1942
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:29,629
(Tell me what it is.)

1943
01:10:29,629 --> 01:10:31,030
My YouTube?

1944
01:10:31,389 --> 01:10:32,860
He's popular.

1945
01:10:33,459 --> 01:10:35,129
Okay. This is my YouTube channel.

1946
01:10:35,200 --> 01:10:37,030
(Looking)

1947
01:10:37,629 --> 01:10:39,370
(Interested)

1948
01:10:40,299 --> 01:10:42,339
She's interested too.

1949
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:45,410
- It's crazy.
- They want to know.

1950
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:46,839
Even the one on the top.

1951
01:10:46,839 --> 01:10:47,980
It's crazy.

1952
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,410
(He welcomes new subscribers.)

1953
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,410
It's...

1954
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:52,850
You?

1955
01:10:52,850 --> 01:10:54,520
Okay.

1956
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:56,419
This is my YouTube channel.

1957
01:10:56,419 --> 01:10:57,549
Okay.

1958
01:10:57,850 --> 01:10:59,759
The reactions to Dex are good.

1959
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:01,759
- You should've told them yours too.
- I know.

1960
01:11:01,759 --> 01:11:03,929
- You should've shown them too.
- No. There's no need to.

1961
01:11:03,929 --> 01:11:07,860
He wants others to recognize him.

1962
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,100
But he doesn't say it himself.

1963
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,370
- Right.
- He's shy.

1964
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,700
Then he gets sulky later.

1965
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:14,700
I'm a grown-up. How can I do it myself?

1966
01:11:14,700 --> 01:11:15,700
Come on.

1967
01:11:17,570 --> 01:11:20,940
(A grown-up who easily gets sulky
is on board.)

1968
01:11:21,079 --> 01:11:22,280
- There's a new passenger.
- Again.

1969
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,850
Yes. There's a new passenger.

1970
01:11:24,009 --> 01:11:27,379
Whenever the train stopped,
there was a rotation of passengers.

1971
01:11:27,379 --> 01:11:30,150
- I see.
- Some passengers disappeared.

1972
01:11:30,150 --> 01:11:32,249
And we got to meet new people.

1973
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,120
- "Nung loc."
- "Nung loc?"

1974
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:38,490
Pani bottle.

1975
01:11:39,259 --> 01:11:40,400
Pani Bottle?

1976
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,400
Didn't he say Pani Bottle just now?

1977
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:44,969
(It is pani.)

1978
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:47,139
Pani bottle.

1979
01:11:47,139 --> 01:11:48,940
Pani Bottle?

1980
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,370
Pani Bottle is my friend.

1981
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:52,070
Okay. One water, please.

1982
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:54,410
Pani Bottle is actually a Hindi word.

1983
01:11:54,679 --> 01:11:55,709
I see.

1984
01:11:55,940 --> 01:11:58,009
(The reason why he's Pani Bottle.)

1985
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:00,249
(It means "water bottle" in Hindi.)

1986
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:02,980
(I heard the word for the first time
on the train.)

1987
01:12:02,980 --> 01:12:05,120
(The guy who was selling water
shouted "pani bottle" so loudly.)

1988
01:12:05,419 --> 01:12:07,320
(It stuck in his ears
and it became his nickname.)

1989
01:12:07,520 --> 01:12:08,560
Pani bottle.

1990
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:10,060
The same thing happened.

1991
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:11,329
"Pani bottle."

1992
01:12:12,759 --> 01:12:15,160
Pani Bottle is actually a Hindi word.

1993
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,299
- It is?
- Yes.

1994
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,600
It's the cap.

1995
01:12:17,799 --> 01:12:18,870
It's the bottle.

1996
01:12:18,969 --> 01:12:20,370
- A bottle has a cap.
- The cap?

1997
01:12:20,370 --> 01:12:21,539
I thought it was a bottle cap.

1998
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:26,610
(He's not perfect,
but he has a warm heart.)

1999
01:12:27,139 --> 01:12:29,009
- Are you a student?
- Yes.

2000
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,919
A person who treats sick people.

2001
01:12:33,919 --> 01:12:36,020
- Sick...
- Like a surgeon or a doctor.

2002
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:38,749
- A doctor?
- Yes.

2003
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:40,990
She's going to become a doctor.

2004
01:12:40,990 --> 01:12:42,160
A doctor?

2005
01:12:42,759 --> 01:12:43,959
Very clever.

2006
01:12:44,889 --> 01:12:46,700
Not that much.

2007
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:48,360
She's humble.

2008
01:12:48,499 --> 01:12:49,560
(Clearing his throat)

2009
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:50,870
I think she likes you.

2010
01:12:51,370 --> 01:12:52,530
Do you like me?

2011
01:12:52,530 --> 01:12:53,669
(He instinctively wants to check.)

2012
01:12:54,669 --> 01:12:56,400
I saw you for the first time.

2013
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,910
First time. Okay.

2014
01:12:58,910 --> 01:13:00,780
I think she kind of likes you.

2015
01:13:01,110 --> 01:13:03,410
When I get off, I'll travel with Pani.

2016
01:13:03,410 --> 01:13:05,009
You travel with her.

2017
01:13:05,310 --> 01:13:06,620
(He couldn't hear him.)

2018
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,780
This punk doesn't even answer.

2019
01:13:08,780 --> 01:13:10,589
(This punk doesn't even answer.)

2020
01:13:11,049 --> 01:13:13,190
(He got upset.)

2021
01:13:13,190 --> 01:13:14,589
When did he say that?

2022
01:13:15,219 --> 01:13:17,389
- Why did you get upset?
- He got upset.

2023
01:13:17,389 --> 01:13:19,060
- Why?
- Why did I do that?

2024
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:20,759
Why did you get upset?

2025
01:13:20,999 --> 01:13:23,770
(Excluding the grown-up who is very upset)

2026
01:13:23,770 --> 01:13:25,230
He's pouty.

2027
01:13:25,230 --> 01:13:27,499
All of them were surprised.

2028
01:13:27,969 --> 01:13:29,169
"No. Why?"

2029
01:13:29,169 --> 01:13:30,209
(They're already in their own world.)

2030
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,740
I guess
Dex has a universally likable face.

2031
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,410
He's young and fit.

2032
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:38,679
- Eight years?
- I'm going there.

2033
01:13:38,679 --> 01:13:40,419
- If they want...
- But...

2034
01:13:40,419 --> 01:13:42,320
they didn't...

2035
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:45,049
- His look is...
- He looks depressed and lonely.

2036
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:50,589
I think good looks work in any country.

2037
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:53,060
It was like that in Varanasi too.

2038
01:13:55,860 --> 01:13:59,429
It was like that on the train.
Random women came and said hi.

2039
01:13:59,629 --> 01:14:01,499
They sat next to him and talked.

2040
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:02,999
Okay.

2041
01:14:03,370 --> 01:14:05,039
Do you know the other reason?

2042
01:14:05,310 --> 01:14:06,370
(He saw him.)

2043
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,410
He...

2044
01:14:07,410 --> 01:14:09,810
maybe wants to talk...

2045
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,480
- He takes care of his friend.
- with you.

2046
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,520
- Hey.
- But he's a shy guy.

2047
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,749
Don't say something stupid.

2048
01:14:16,280 --> 01:14:18,020
Please stop.

2049
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,860
Maybe eight years...

2050
01:14:19,860 --> 01:14:21,589
- It's a phone call.
- It's my mother.

2051
01:14:22,660 --> 01:14:23,889
Hi, Mom.

2052
01:14:24,389 --> 01:14:25,929
You even said hi to her parents?

2053
01:14:25,929 --> 01:14:26,929
(Impressed)

2054
01:14:27,459 --> 01:14:28,759
I'm a friend.

2055
01:14:29,530 --> 01:14:31,600
(Pleased)

2056
01:14:32,169 --> 01:14:34,370
Dex is very friendly.

2057
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:35,900
Yes. He's an amiable guy.

2058
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,669
- I think Dex...
- I came from South Korea.

2059
01:14:38,669 --> 01:14:40,610
thinks it's a dating show,

2060
01:14:40,610 --> 01:14:42,610
not a travel show.

2061
01:14:43,009 --> 01:14:45,450
He's shooting "Single's Inferno" here.

2062
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,249
Your mom smiles a lot.

2063
01:14:51,219 --> 01:14:53,120
(I'm not going to watch.)

2064
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:54,190
It's a hermit crab.

2065
01:14:55,419 --> 01:14:56,560
It's a hermit crab.

2066
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,459
- It's a hermit crab.
- I didn't want to watch.

2067
01:14:58,459 --> 01:15:01,660
I didn't hate it that much.
It was because I was tired.

2068
01:15:01,999 --> 01:15:03,129
(I am...)

2069
01:15:03,129 --> 01:15:04,200
A hermit crab.

2070
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,070
(an exhausted hermit crab.)

2071
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:08,039
Do you want to take a picture?

2072
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:10,070
Okay. Together.

2073
01:15:10,839 --> 01:15:12,169
(Kian84 is fidgeting.)

2074
01:15:12,169 --> 01:15:14,940
He's moving his cap up and down
to draw attention to himself.

2075
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,110
How sweet.

2076
01:15:17,650 --> 01:15:18,950
How sweet.

2077
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,280
And he's making comments.

2078
01:15:20,379 --> 01:15:22,450
Take a picture together?

2079
01:15:22,450 --> 01:15:24,049
No.

2080
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:26,919
- Okay.
- No. Gosh.

2081
01:15:26,919 --> 01:15:30,160
Gosh, I was just trying to be funny.

2082
01:15:30,690 --> 01:15:32,289
As he's moving for the picture.

2083
01:15:32,289 --> 01:15:33,759
- He's like, "If you insist."
- Right.

2084
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:35,629
Hold on. What's wrong with my hair?

2085
01:15:37,270 --> 01:15:39,499
Are you an influencer?

2086
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:42,539
- No. Not an influencer.
- Not influencer.

2087
01:15:42,539 --> 01:15:44,870
- I'm just a normal...
- Normal person?

2088
01:15:44,870 --> 01:15:46,039
- Normal person.
- I see.

2089
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:48,139
Your smile is very beautiful.

2090
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,150
- Gosh.
- Gosh. He's complimenting her.

2091
01:15:50,150 --> 01:15:52,179
Are you flirting all the way in India?

2092
01:15:52,179 --> 01:15:54,079
- Gosh.
- It's natural for him.

2093
01:15:54,820 --> 01:15:55,919
(Kian84 wants to add something to that.)

2094
01:15:55,919 --> 01:15:58,419
And your head is very small.

2095
01:15:59,049 --> 01:16:00,620
Small face.

2096
01:16:00,860 --> 01:16:03,329
"Small face" is a good thing in Korea.

2097
01:16:03,329 --> 01:16:04,829
- Goodness.
- Yes.

2098
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,259
(Kian84 scooches over a bit.)

2099
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:08,860
(The two are talking.)

2100
01:16:08,860 --> 01:16:10,669
- Again?
- Again, he's...

2101
01:16:10,669 --> 01:16:12,200
Where you were sitting wasn't important.

2102
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,600
- Where I was sitting wasn't important.
- No.

2103
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,139
Sitting across from each other is...

2104
01:16:16,139 --> 01:16:18,839
- He moved across from her on purpose.
- To meet her eyes.

2105
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:21,839
Yes.

2106
01:16:21,839 --> 01:16:24,610
I've had a family member say,
"You are not..."

2107
01:16:24,610 --> 01:16:26,509
"You don't look Indian."

2108
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:27,879
How old are you?

2109
01:16:29,049 --> 01:16:30,490
He's a star in Korea.

2110
01:16:30,490 --> 01:16:31,520
(He gets up and leave.)

2111
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:34,520
Gosh. He's leaving.

2112
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:36,459
Why is he leaving like that?

2113
01:16:36,459 --> 01:16:38,030
I guess he must have felt awkward.

2114
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:40,160
He left because I talked to him.

2115
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:43,600
I wanted to have a chat with someone too,

2116
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:46,230
but the kid just left
when I tried to talk to him.

2117
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:47,839
But...

2118
01:16:49,169 --> 01:16:51,709
I did behave a bit unseemly,

2119
01:16:52,410 --> 01:16:54,310
now that I think about it.

2120
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:58,610
The fact that I was a bit jealous
about a young man and woman...

2121
01:16:59,009 --> 01:17:01,749
having fun is too...

2122
01:17:02,650 --> 01:17:05,120
- I should have gone with you.
- Gosh.

2123
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:07,320
- Kian84 is good at talking too.
- You're here right now.

2124
01:17:07,320 --> 01:17:08,719
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2125
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:13,160
- Pani bottle.
- Pani bottle.

2126
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:15,530
- Gosh. I miss Pani Bottle.
- Pani bottle.

2127
01:17:15,530 --> 01:17:17,070
He must have missed him a lot.

2128
01:17:17,070 --> 01:17:18,700
(Pani Bottle,
whom Kian84 desperately missed...)

2129
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:21,139
Hey. Pani Bottle.

2130
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:23,339
I don't think I would've been excited
if I was going somewhere else.

2131
01:17:23,810 --> 01:17:25,709
(He doesn't get altitude sickness,)

2132
01:17:25,709 --> 01:17:29,509
(but he still gets nosebleeds.)

2133
01:17:29,839 --> 01:17:32,950
(He was the travel brains
of Adventure by Accident Season 1.)

2134
01:17:33,110 --> 01:17:36,049
(He actually quickly rose to popularity
due to his trips to India.)

2135
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:40,520
(He's a superstar from Korea
who rose to fame through India.)

2136
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,120
I've been to India three times, right?

2137
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:44,990
I rose to fame through my India trips,

2138
01:17:44,990 --> 01:17:47,860
but I was too short-tempered toward
the Indians while I was traveling.

2139
01:17:48,429 --> 01:17:51,799
(So I feel like I owe them.)

2140
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:55,440
I got my nickname,
"Pani Bottle," in India.

2141
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:57,009
My career as a YouTuber,

2142
01:17:57,009 --> 01:17:59,169
going on TV, and filming commercials...

2143
01:17:59,169 --> 01:18:02,339
India is the foundation that
made everything possible.

2144
01:18:02,339 --> 01:18:03,780
(He is off to India,
a country he is grateful for.)

2145
01:18:04,549 --> 01:18:06,610
- You can take a picture.
- Really?

2146
01:18:06,950 --> 01:18:08,450
(He's having a fan meetup,
all of a sudden.)

2147
01:18:08,450 --> 01:18:10,350
- Gosh, you're popular.
- "You can take a picture."

2148
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:12,850
- Nice to meet you. I loved your show.
- Nice to meet you.

2149
01:18:13,459 --> 01:18:14,990
Kian84 seemed like he was suffering.

2150
01:18:15,320 --> 01:18:17,129
- He's suffering right now.
- He's still suffering?

2151
01:18:17,329 --> 01:18:18,860
I love Kian84.

2152
01:18:19,230 --> 01:18:21,799
- Gosh.
- He's world-class.

2153
01:18:21,799 --> 01:18:23,829
Ma'am, do you know his name?

2154
01:18:24,169 --> 01:18:27,469
His name. I don't know.
I don't even remember.

2155
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:29,839
(She just knows him as Kian84's friend.)

2156
01:18:30,539 --> 01:18:32,509
I'm going to India
for the first time in three years.

2157
01:18:32,509 --> 01:18:34,940
If there's anything
Kian84 and Dex want to do,

2158
01:18:35,509 --> 01:18:36,850
I'll help them with it.

2159
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:37,950
He's highly qualified in India.

2160
01:18:39,150 --> 01:18:40,520
(Laughing)

2161
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:42,679
My brain isn't functioning right now.

2162
01:18:42,679 --> 01:18:44,719
- Are you...
- Yes, I am.

2163
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:46,860
- Are you entering a competition?
- Yes.

2164
01:18:47,719 --> 01:18:50,289
(The number 1 star of e-sports, Faker)

2165
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:53,160
- Gosh!
- Faker?

2166
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:54,829
- Gosh!
- Oh, my gosh!

2167
01:18:54,829 --> 01:18:56,759
- That's amazing.
- That's amazing.

2168
01:18:56,759 --> 01:18:58,700
He gets lucky in everything he does.

2169
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:00,270
- Right.
- He really does.

2170
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:01,639
- Gosh.
- Hello.

2171
01:19:01,639 --> 01:19:04,410
How likely is it
to run into Faker at the airport?

2172
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:06,240
He's so lucky.

2173
01:19:06,240 --> 01:19:07,910
Could I take a selfie with you?

2174
01:19:08,079 --> 01:19:09,410
One, two, three.

2175
01:19:09,410 --> 01:19:10,679
(Faker)

2176
01:19:10,679 --> 01:19:12,549
Some people have all the luck.

2177
01:19:12,549 --> 01:19:14,419
- I wish you all the best.
- Thank you.

2178
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:17,520
(He's leaving the country
in a good mood after meeting Faker.)

2179
01:19:18,089 --> 01:19:19,120
It's so hot.

2180
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,690
(He arrived in Delhi.)

2181
01:19:24,629 --> 01:19:25,829
The weather is so nice.

2182
01:19:27,259 --> 01:19:28,759
It's been so long.

2183
01:19:28,929 --> 01:19:30,770
- It's like he's returning in glory.
- Right.

2184
01:19:30,969 --> 01:19:32,600
It's a relief that
the weather is less hot.

2185
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:34,870
(He arrived at the lodging.)

2186
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:36,070
We're here.

2187
01:19:36,440 --> 01:19:39,610
When I traveled to India, I used to stay
at hostels because I was broke.

2188
01:19:39,770 --> 01:19:42,110
I think this is my first time
staying at a hotel like this.

2189
01:19:42,539 --> 01:19:45,150
Since we were arriving in the middle of
the night, Pani Bottle got there early...

2190
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:47,079
and arranged the lodging for us.

2191
01:19:47,079 --> 01:19:48,650
- Gosh.
- It looks nice.

2192
01:19:49,219 --> 01:19:51,150
At 4 a.m. tonight,

2193
01:19:51,150 --> 01:19:53,789
Dex and Kian84 will be
arriving at Delhi Station.

2194
01:19:53,919 --> 01:19:56,320
I'm going to relax a bit
and go pick them up.

2195
01:19:58,389 --> 01:19:59,530
(Current time 6:05 p.m.
Kian84 and Dex are heading to Delhi.)

2196
01:19:59,530 --> 01:20:01,060
It's been two hours here?

2197
01:20:01,060 --> 01:20:02,259
Yes.

2198
01:20:02,259 --> 01:20:04,299
I want to give you something.

2199
01:20:04,469 --> 01:20:07,440
Korean coffee.

2200
01:20:07,900 --> 01:20:09,539
- He's giving them out.
- That's delicious.

2201
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:12,270
- Korean coffee is famous.
- Right.

2202
01:20:12,270 --> 01:20:13,509
- Make me a cup.
- Okay.

2203
01:20:14,139 --> 01:20:15,780
I'm going to drink coffee and go to sleep.

2204
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,579
What color do you like?

2205
01:20:18,579 --> 01:20:20,320
I like the color yellow.

2206
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:21,820
(He's considerate enough
to ask about what she likes.)

2207
01:20:21,820 --> 01:20:22,950
Okay.

2208
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:25,219
Okay. I'll go and make the coffee.

2209
01:20:25,219 --> 01:20:27,389
(The Korean fox leaves
to make Korean coffee.)

2210
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:30,259
Excuse me. Can I use some hot water?

2211
01:20:31,629 --> 01:20:36,030
I paid ten rupees per cup and made coffee.

2212
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:37,270
Gosh.

2213
01:20:37,929 --> 01:20:40,240
(He hurries back.)

2214
01:20:41,370 --> 01:20:43,270
What? Where did she go?

2215
01:20:43,270 --> 01:20:45,440
Her mom called her.

2216
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:47,679
- What? Her mom called her?
- Her mom called her.

2217
01:20:48,839 --> 01:20:50,810
(She kept staring at...)

2218
01:20:50,810 --> 01:20:53,079
- Right. I was wondering why she left.
- Goodness.

2219
01:20:53,079 --> 01:20:54,419
(the direction Dex went off to.)

2220
01:20:56,650 --> 01:20:59,919
- My mom keeps calling me. I have to go.
- Yes. Go.

2221
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:03,959
(That's how she left and went to her mom.)

2222
01:21:04,829 --> 01:21:06,690
Let's just enjoy the coffee by ourselves.

2223
01:21:06,690 --> 01:21:08,259
All right. Cheers.

2224
01:21:08,700 --> 01:21:10,270
There's nothing we can do. She left.

2225
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:11,400
(It's disappointing
but the two enjoy their coffee.)

2226
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:12,929
That must taste so good.

2227
01:21:13,999 --> 01:21:15,139
Gosh, this is nice.

2228
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,440
I was actually low on blood sugar.

2229
01:21:19,770 --> 01:21:22,379
Right. I didn't have any coffee
since we came to India.

2230
01:21:22,379 --> 01:21:23,610
Really?

2231
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:25,780
It was so good.

2232
01:21:26,379 --> 01:21:29,820
(All eyes are on them.)

2233
01:21:32,249 --> 01:21:33,789
I want coffee.

2234
01:21:35,789 --> 01:21:38,789
You want coffee? Korean coffee?

2235
01:21:38,789 --> 01:21:40,759
- Korean coffee.
- Korean coffee?

2236
01:21:40,759 --> 01:21:42,259
- Okay.
- You know?

2237
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,799
Wait a second. Okay.

2238
01:21:44,799 --> 01:21:48,469
I made the coffee in the pantry car,

2239
01:21:48,469 --> 01:21:50,200
- and he followed me back.
- Gosh.

2240
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,969
He asked if he could try the coffee.

2241
01:21:51,969 --> 01:21:54,240
- Right. Korean coffee.
- Yes. So I offered to make him coffee.

2242
01:21:54,240 --> 01:21:56,879
- Of course. He's a friend.
- Right.

2243
01:21:57,749 --> 01:21:59,879
(While Dex went to make coffee)

2244
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,419
Do you want something?

2245
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:05,389
- Kian84 patted that boy’s head earlier.
- He did.

2246
01:22:05,620 --> 01:22:06,749
(Suddenly,
he's sitting right next to Kian84.)

2247
01:22:06,749 --> 01:22:07,789
This?

2248
01:22:08,959 --> 01:22:10,120
Thank you.

2249
01:22:10,219 --> 01:22:12,429
- Gosh.
- He bought that for him.

2250
01:22:13,999 --> 01:22:15,200
Finally.

2251
01:22:15,200 --> 01:22:17,499
- You're back.
- Okay.

2252
01:22:17,730 --> 01:22:20,799
- Why do you have so many snacks?
- I bought them for him.

2253
01:22:21,669 --> 01:22:23,270
You trust me?

2254
01:22:23,709 --> 01:22:25,810
This is very famous in Korea.

2255
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:27,139
Okay. Will you try it?

2256
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:30,709
I was a little worried
that he might not like it.

2257
01:22:31,480 --> 01:22:34,079
(He cautiously takes a sip.)

2258
01:22:34,879 --> 01:22:35,919
Good.

2259
01:22:35,919 --> 01:22:37,219
- He said it was good.
- You like it?

2260
01:22:38,419 --> 01:22:40,560
- Very sweet coffee.
- Very sweet coffee?

2261
01:22:40,560 --> 01:22:42,990
- Kind of creamy.
- Creamy.

2262
01:22:43,589 --> 01:22:46,129
- Delicious things are universal.
- Right.

2263
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:51,200
Take... You want coffee?

2264
01:22:51,900 --> 01:22:52,900
Do you like it?

2265
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:53,900
(I like it.)

2266
01:22:53,999 --> 01:22:55,870
It's a gift. You're a friend.

2267
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:57,610
- Gosh.
- How many are they giving him?

2268
01:22:57,610 --> 01:22:59,110
We were being generous.

2269
01:22:59,339 --> 01:23:01,339
- Don't give him more. That's too much.
- Okay.

2270
01:23:01,339 --> 01:23:03,410
- We need to drink coffee too.
- Okay.

2271
01:23:03,579 --> 01:23:05,749
We later handed out coffee...

2272
01:23:05,749 --> 01:23:07,980
to the people who were sitting next to us.

2273
01:23:08,879 --> 01:23:09,879
(He's tapping at Dex.)

2274
01:23:09,879 --> 01:23:11,289
- It's good.
- He wanted to share with you.

2275
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:14,259
- Thank you.
- I bought it for him. Why is Dex...

2276
01:23:14,419 --> 01:23:15,990
I bought it for him. Why is Dex...

2277
01:23:16,620 --> 01:23:17,889
He's a mean kid.

2278
01:23:18,259 --> 01:23:19,289
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

2279
01:23:19,289 --> 01:23:21,400
(Kian84 is whining.)

2280
01:23:21,759 --> 01:23:22,959
Thank you.

2281
01:23:22,959 --> 01:23:24,070
Open up.

2282
01:23:27,139 --> 01:23:30,039
- It's like a show just for him.
- He likes it.

2283
01:23:30,039 --> 01:23:31,740
(The airplane show is
every Korean child's favorite.)

2284
01:23:33,740 --> 01:23:35,209
(He's tapping at Kian84.)

2285
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,110
- Look.
- Gosh.

2286
01:23:37,780 --> 01:23:39,780
I'm okay. You eat.

2287
01:23:40,620 --> 01:23:42,480
That's cool.

2288
01:23:42,480 --> 01:23:44,190
(One more time)

2289
01:23:44,190 --> 01:23:46,289
He kept feeding me.

2290
01:23:46,490 --> 01:23:49,020
He kept giving me chips.

2291
01:23:49,020 --> 01:23:51,160
In a way, he gave his everything to me.

2292
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,230
He gave me the chips he liked.

2293
01:23:53,690 --> 01:23:55,459
When the kid first saw me,

2294
01:23:55,459 --> 01:23:57,570
he was very shy.

2295
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,929
- Right.
- Yes.

2296
01:23:59,370 --> 01:24:01,539
(Even when Kian84 carefully
tried to talk to him,)

2297
01:24:01,539 --> 01:24:03,839
(he left his seat.)

2298
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:05,940
What's your dream?

2299
01:24:06,339 --> 01:24:08,410
- Army.
- Army?

2300
01:24:08,410 --> 01:24:10,810
- Army. I see.
- Army.

2301
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:12,709
He used to be in the Korean military.

2302
01:24:12,709 --> 01:24:14,480
I used to be in the Korean military.

2303
01:24:14,480 --> 01:24:16,749
- I feel emotional, for some reason.
- Yes, this is nice.

2304
01:24:16,749 --> 01:24:18,320
There was a point...

2305
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:21,219
when he leaned his head against me.

2306
01:24:21,219 --> 01:24:26,060
That's when I could physically feel
that he had opened up to me.

2307
01:24:26,429 --> 01:24:29,730
I showed him videos on my tablet PC.

2308
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,370
And there are these headphones
that I treasure a lot.

2309
01:24:31,370 --> 01:24:34,169
I put them on someone else's head
for the first time ever.

2310
01:24:34,169 --> 01:24:35,969
Gosh. That's not an easy thing to do.

2311
01:24:36,169 --> 01:24:37,770
No. You try.

2312
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:40,240
A friendship blossomed...

2313
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,709
in such a small space.

2314
01:24:43,709 --> 01:24:45,150
(Laughing)

2315
01:24:46,579 --> 01:24:49,620
I feel like, thanks to Dex,

2316
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:52,850
we were able to communicate
with people smoothly.

2317
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:55,089
If I were by myself,
I would have been too shy.

2318
01:24:55,089 --> 01:24:56,259
Right.

2319
01:24:56,259 --> 01:24:57,959
If I act indifferently,
people think I'm inattentive.

2320
01:24:57,959 --> 01:24:59,889
I should be sweeter like you...

2321
01:24:59,889 --> 01:25:01,829
- when I'm in foreign countries.
- You learned something.

2322
01:25:01,829 --> 01:25:03,759
- This is the tip of the day.
- You got a tip.

2323
01:25:03,759 --> 01:25:04,969
People who are traveling
to India should...

2324
01:25:04,969 --> 01:25:07,270
- Gosh, this is...
- Yes. You should be kind no matter what.

2325
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,499
- Be friendly.
- Yes.

2326
01:25:09,969 --> 01:25:11,310
- Bye.
- Okay.

2327
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:12,639
Hasan.

2328
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:15,039
Good luck.

2329
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:16,910
(The coffee friend goes back to his seat.)

2330
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:17,910
Bye.

2331
01:25:17,910 --> 01:25:19,610
We met many people.

2332
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:21,650
Every time they left, I was a little sad.

2333
01:25:21,650 --> 01:25:22,820
- Of course.
- Yes.

2334
01:25:22,820 --> 01:25:24,020
I guess you grew attached to them.

2335
01:25:24,690 --> 01:25:27,719
(In an unfamiliar place)

2336
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,560
Those who were not kind at first...

2337
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:34,259
started to lighten up as time went by.

2338
01:25:34,759 --> 01:25:37,230
The process of building a relationship...

2339
01:25:37,469 --> 01:25:40,030
made me proud in many ways.

2340
01:25:40,030 --> 01:25:41,600
It left a strong impression.

2341
01:25:41,600 --> 01:25:42,669
It's so nice.

2342
01:25:43,469 --> 01:25:44,940
(Leaving behind their local friends
with warm hearts)

2343
01:25:44,940 --> 01:25:47,209
The sun is setting.

2344
01:25:47,679 --> 01:25:51,509
(They're going to New Delhi
to meet Pani Bottle!)

2345
01:25:52,879 --> 01:25:54,620
(The man...)

2346
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,320
(we wanted to meet so badly)

2347
01:25:57,589 --> 01:25:58,950
(Pani)

2348
01:25:59,549 --> 01:26:01,219
(They have arrived.)

2349
01:26:01,520 --> 01:26:04,190
(The three brothers
finally gathered in India.)

2350
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:06,929
(Into the unexpected...)

2351
01:26:06,929 --> 01:26:09,400
(New Delhi)

2352
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:10,499
(It's so different.)

2353
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:11,499
(Surprised)

2354
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,539
(They suddenly see a striking contrast.)

2355
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:17,740
(New Delhi is completely different
from Varanasi?)

2356
01:26:18,370 --> 01:26:19,469
(Impressed)

2357
01:26:20,469 --> 01:26:22,839
(They see a real diamond.)

2358
01:26:23,740 --> 01:26:25,049
(Diving)

2359
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:28,780
(I can't resist a swimming pool.)

2360
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:30,450
(Laughing)

2361
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:33,089
(A trip to India full of laughter)

2362
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:36,520
(The happiness didn't last long.)

2363
01:26:36,520 --> 01:26:38,660
(Something is wrong.)

2364
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,900
(It felt like
my stomach was going to rip apart.)

2365
01:26:42,959 --> 01:26:45,200
(Everyone is worried...)

2366
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,900
(about Dex's condition.)

2367
01:26:48,669 --> 01:26:50,440
(Despite everyone's concern,
his condition gets worse.)

2368
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,969
(It's killing me.)

2369
01:26:52,610 --> 01:26:54,379
(The India Brothers finally meet.)

2370
01:26:54,379 --> 01:26:56,579
(But do they have
to say goodbye like this?)

2371
01:26:56,839 --> 01:26:57,850
(Adventure by Accident 2)
