when I see you.)

- Stop acting tough.)

22
00:01:57,379 --> 00:01:59,539

23
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,080

24
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,080

(Simon Dominic)

42
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:48,959
That's amazing.

- Everyone.

Yes, well...

- Great.

Yes.

He is so popular these days.

59

60

- The newcomer.
- Hello.

61

- Hello.
- Actually...

62
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,969
He is popular these days in Korea.

63
00:03:26,969 --> 00:03:28,600
- No way.
- Because...

64
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,040
Kian84 used to be the son of MBC,

65
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,899

they are moving towards him.

66
00:03:33,469 --> 00:03:34,469
Gosh.

(After starring in Game of Blood

(His popularity skyrocketed
and he was even on national TV.)

70
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:45,679

with his masculinity.)

(The popular foxy guy, Dex)

72
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,920
I am actually trying to steal the place
as MBC's son.

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,290
Please keep watching
and see if I can take the place...

74
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,700
- and follow in Kian84's footsteps.
- First of all,

75
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,929
- I am a fan of Dex.
- Really?

76
00:03:58,929 --> 00:04:00,330
He's his type.

77
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:04,300
He seems to be a bit full of himself.

78
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,300
I caught it right away.
He's my little brother.

79
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,839
(You are my little brother from now on.)

80

81

We had our first meeting here.

82
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:12,980
- Really?
- Here.

83
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:15,750
- Was it two months ago?
- That's interesting.

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,479
- Pani was also with us.
- Yes.

85
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:18,479
Oh, Pani?

86
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:19,750
This is Pani's house.

87
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,690
- Yes, you might be surprised.
- I know.

88
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,359
- This is Pani's house without Pani.
- Yes.

89
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:28,330
Is Pani traveling?

90
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:30,430
Pani is in Indonesia right now.

91
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:31,599
Really?

92
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:33,599
He is the busiest one.

93
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:35,700
I felt bad, so I brought him like this.

94
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,000
What is that?

95
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,200
What?

96
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,370
(Ta-da)

97
00:04:39,669 --> 00:04:41,539
(Spot the difference)

98
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,209
(Two months ago here...)

99
00:04:44,209 --> 00:04:45,810
Are you coming with us?

100
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,479
(They swore to be a team for India.)

101
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:50,549
India is a must-visit place...

102
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:52,479
- for people who like traveling.
- Yes.

103
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,490
- That's right.
- It's like a shrine.

104
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,250
- Yes.
- Really.

105
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,760
How was it compared to South America?

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,219
It was so hard, to be honest.

107
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:00,560
- It was so hard.
- How much harder?

108
00:05:00,729 --> 00:05:02,229
Exactly three times harder.

109
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,729
I'm a bit worried...

110
00:05:04,729 --> 00:05:07,399
because I showed my weak side too much.

111
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:09,000
- Your weak side?
- Yes.

112
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,839
What happened?

113
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,909
(2023 March, the main PD's house)

114
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,339
But if you...

115
00:05:16,339 --> 00:05:17,709
- Gosh.
- They're at it again.

116
00:05:17,709 --> 00:05:18,839
- Look at them.
- What?

117
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,950
Is that deja vu? I've seen this before.

118
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,409
- Look at them.
- How funny.

119
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:25,549
(They are drinking on the floor again
as if it's a spot-the-difference game.)

120
00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:30,190
(Chugging)

121
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:35,390
It's been six months since you came back.

122
00:05:36,330 --> 00:05:38,159
- Time goes by so fast.
- I know.

123
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,430
It's like a bullet.

124
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,440
- Gosh, South America was great.
- Yes.

125
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,140
- I had a good time.
- It was fun.

126
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,070
It was so pretty.

127
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,409
(He started from the Amazon
and finished off with the Uyuni Desert.)

128
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,450
- Porfi Junior.
- Yes.

129
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,680
Was he in the first grade?

130
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
Yes, he was seven.

131
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,580
- He must be in the second grade now.
- Yes.

132
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,549
- It's a new year now.
- Yes.

133
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,950
Should we try video calling?

134
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,120
(They video call Porfi,
who is across the globe.)

135
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,690
- Give it.
- Hello?

136
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:07,729
Porfi.

137
00:06:08,589 --> 00:06:10,799
(His friend across the globe, Porfi.)

138
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,099
Porfi. Hello.

139
00:06:13,969 --> 00:06:15,099
Kian84.

140
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,200
How are you, Kian84?

141
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,169
(Laughing)

142
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,140
Porfi, how are your kids doing?

143
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,880
The kids are at home.

144
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,339
He said they are at home.

145
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:27,380
(Porfi sent them pictures of the kids.)

146
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,409
The youngest.

147
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,180
- Gosh, how cute.
- The baby.

148
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,549
(The newborn grew a lot.)

149
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,719
(Porfi Junior became more mature.)

150
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:34,820
He looks just like him.

151
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,289
(Pleased)

152
00:06:37,289 --> 00:06:38,789
- Porfi.
- Kian84.

153
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:39,789
(And...)

154
00:06:39,789 --> 00:06:44,130
(Porfi starts to chatter.)

155
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,630
What is he saying?

156
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:51,940
(Kian could not understand,
and Porfi talked a lot.)

157
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:55,339
(They are still the same.)

158
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,380
Porfi, you...

159
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,880
You must not be busy today.

160
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,250
- Yes.
- "Yes."

161
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,680
I'm glad you like to talk.

162
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:07,419
Porfi, I miss you.

163
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:10,219
See you again.

164
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,459
(They say a sad goodbye
due to the language barrier.)

165
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,159
(Porfi does not care.)

166
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,760
- You already said goodbye.
- Yes.

167
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:21,770
(Laughing)

168
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,799
Hey.

169
00:07:23,169 --> 00:07:24,200
Okay.

170
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:28,070
(Kian84, you are an adventurer.)

171
00:07:28,339 --> 00:07:31,680
(That is what you like
and the reason you were born.)

172
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,080
- That's what he said.
- Is that what he said?

173
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:36,010
It's a relief.

174
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,849
I can tell you are doing well
since you are still talking a lot.

175
00:07:37,849 --> 00:07:40,990
I will put together what I want to say...

176
00:07:40,990 --> 00:07:43,289
and send it to you in Spanish.

177
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,560
Take care and stay well.

178
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:46,560
Porfi.

179
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,560
(Goodbye)

180
00:07:48,789 --> 00:07:50,200
- Is that it?
- Yes.

181
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,930
It's really...

182
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,299
I remember you felt bad.

183
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:57,740
You wanted to stay longer.

184
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:00,469
- One night was too short.
- Yes.

185
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:02,940
It should have been at least three nights.

186
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,109
You need to live there.

187
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,310
Yes.

188
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,779
Just like last time,

189
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,149
we will only decide the beginning
and the ending,

190
00:08:12,149 --> 00:08:14,950
and the rest will be up to you.

191
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,390
So where are we going?

192
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:18,719
We are going...

193
00:08:18,719 --> 00:08:19,760
(Slightly nervous)

194
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,690
What country did you want to go the most?

195
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,899
(The country Kian84 wanted to go to
the most?)

196
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,370
India.

197
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,729
Steve Jobs...

198
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:33,909
went backpacking to India
with his friend...

199
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:34,909
when he was in college,

200
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:37,679
and he said it was so different
from what he saw in the media.

201
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,210
What kind of people live there?

202
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,909
That's what I'm most curious about.

203
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:45,380
The gap between the rich and the poor
is so severe.

204
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,419
I really want to see.

205
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:49,649
So we...

206
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:51,720
(So we...)

207
00:08:52,919 --> 00:08:54,130
are going to India.

208
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,130
Really?

209
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:58,000
(Why is this real?)

210
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,130
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

211
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,370
(Sighing)

212
00:09:01,370 --> 00:09:03,000
You look a bit taken aback.

213
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,539
- Now that I'm actually hearing it,
- Yes.

214
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,710
I'm a bit worried that it might be hard.

215
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,740
Why did you want to go to India so much?

216
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,980
I heard that...

217
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,549
Na Hoon A went to India,

218
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:19,049
- and he said that in the Ganges,
- Yes.

219
00:09:19,049 --> 00:09:20,250
people are washing on one end...

220
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,120
- and are cremating bodies on the other.
- Yes.

221
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,260
- No matter what position you were,
- Yes.

222
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,730
- your ashes are sent there after death.
- Yes.

223
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,159
He said that he cried so much
after seeing that.

224
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,230
- I felt something then.
- Okay.

225
00:09:34,669 --> 00:09:37,569
That might be life in the end.

226
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
- Okay.
- Yes.

227
00:09:39,569 --> 00:09:42,110
- That's why I wanted to see it.
- Okay.

228
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:46,340
So our trip will begin at the place...

229
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:49,649
you're talking about, the Ganges.

230
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:50,819
- Really?
- Yes.

231
00:09:51,949 --> 00:09:53,549
- Gosh, that's the beginning?
- The Ganges is the start.

232
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:54,620
That's the start.

233
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:58,620
(The shrine of Hinduism,
and the sacred mother's river)

234
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,020
- That's so cool.
- Amazing.

235
00:10:01,289 --> 00:10:02,990
(The people who die on the Ganges...)

236
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,799
(and live on the Ganges)

237
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,500
(The river where the essence
of 1.4 billion Indians come together)

238
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,100
The city of life and death.

239
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,840
Life and death really come together here.

240
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:17,380
(Varanasi)

241
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,980
There is the end point though.

242
00:10:20,549 --> 00:10:22,649
The end point of India. Wait.

243
00:10:23,409 --> 00:10:26,990
It's the village where
the most innocent people in India live.

244
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,049
Right.

245
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:36,730
The civilization paused,
and time stands still there.

246
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,899
- Really?
- Yes.

247
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,529
It's at the foot of Mount Himalayas,

248
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:42,370
and the land route is blocked.

249
00:10:42,699 --> 00:10:44,699
The route opens only three months a year.

250
00:10:44,699 --> 00:10:45,840
There's a place like that?

251
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,010
- There's a place like that?
- Yes.

252
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,210
(It's the northernmost area in India
that is mostly uninhabited.)

253
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,120
(People there live their lives
cut off from civilization.)

254
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,520
(It's a record of an adventurer
who permeated their life.)

255
00:11:03,419 --> 00:11:05,390
(It's a journey stretching from
the Ganges to the Himalayas.)

256
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,659
(It begins now.)

257
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,329
(The day of departure)

258
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:18,640
(Looking messy)

259
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,799
Goodness.

260
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
I look...

261
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:24,610
Hello.

262
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,579
I haven't turned this on
in about seven months.

263
00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,480
I am going to India.

264
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:30,919
I am going to India.

265
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,689
My flight is at 12 noon,
and it's 9 a.m. here.

266
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,490
- You've got 3 hours?
- I had 3 hours.

267
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,490
- He has to leave now.
- I know.

268
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,520
(He got up 3 hours before leaving.)

269
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,890
I will take a shower, pack my clothes,

270
00:11:41,189 --> 00:11:42,329
and turn on the camera again.

271
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:48,770
I took a shower.

272
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:50,270
(Spot the Difference Part 2)

273
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,100
- What changed?
- I became cleaner.

274
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,770
- You got paler.
- Your hair just became wet.

275
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,870
(His hair just got wet.)

276
00:11:55,409 --> 00:11:57,039
I need to pack now.

277
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:59,340
Other than that it's hot there,
I know nothing about India.

278
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:03,110
(He walks over to the drying rack.)

279
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,480
A t-shirt.

280
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:06,850
Underwear.

281
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,890
- You still plan, right?
- I do.

282
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,360
Very meticulously.

283
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,860
He considers the local weather.

284
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:14,630
What should I pack?

285
00:12:15,429 --> 00:12:19,029
I will wash one and let it dry.

286
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,600
I can wear them alternatively.

287
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,970
So I will pack one extra underwear.

288
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,069
(He takes 1 extra underwear
for a 2-week trip to India.)

289
00:12:23,069 --> 00:12:24,100
Socks.

290
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,569
I will take three pairs.

291
00:12:26,569 --> 00:12:27,569
(He takes three pairs of socks.)

292
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,169
And I should pack...

293
00:12:30,169 --> 00:12:32,279
something stylish.

294
00:12:33,909 --> 00:12:35,409
You've got a lot of clothes.

295
00:12:35,409 --> 00:12:37,449
- I've got a lot of clothes.
- You've got a lot of clothes.

296
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:39,620
It's just that I always wear
the same ones. I've got a lot.

297
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,120
Where is the floral print shirt?
I want to wear that.

298
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,919
(He goes to find
the stylish floral print shirt.)

299
00:12:48,029 --> 00:12:49,090
There it is.

300
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,899
This is it.

301
00:12:51,299 --> 00:12:53,159
I will take this floral print shirt
as a stylish option.

302
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:55,630
Didn't you put it in there to wash?

303
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:57,539
It's dirty, but I thought
I would wash it in India.

304
00:12:57,539 --> 00:12:59,770
(He's going to wash it in India.)

305
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:02,370
He's a patriot. He's worried
about the water shortage problem.

306
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,610
(He tries to be patriotic
through the laundry.)

307
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,640
I will wash it in India.

308
00:13:07,549 --> 00:13:09,279
I will take one toothbrush
I've been using.

309
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:12,949
Since I am already dressed,

310
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:14,649
I will just leave like this.

311
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,189
This is fine, right?

312
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,659
(2-week India Trip luggage includes
1 Underwear, 3 pairs of socks,)

313
00:13:18,659 --> 00:13:20,220
(2 outfits, 1 floral print shirt,
toothbrush, and toothpaste.)

314
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,990
All right. India.

315
00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:24,360
It's my first time, and I'm excited.

316
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,600
Here I go.

317
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:28,029
(Let's go.)

318
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,799
I packed too much.

319
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,169
It's heavy.

320
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:36,970
(He leaves with his heavy backpack.)

321
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,140
(The flight time is
7 hours and 20 minutes.)

322
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,809
It takes 7 hours and 20 minutes.

323
00:13:40,809 --> 00:13:42,409
(Incheon International Airport to Delhi)

324
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,020
(Delhi International Airport)

325
00:13:46,649 --> 00:13:48,419
Yes, everyone.

326
00:13:49,049 --> 00:13:51,460
Seven and a half hours.

327
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,520
I drove for that long.

328
00:13:53,829 --> 00:13:57,059
I arrived in Delhi,

329
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,429
India.

330
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,270
(Staring)

331
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:05,240
It clearly feels different.

332
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,500
(The locals have lots of luggage.)

333
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,309
(But this Korean is traveling very light.)

334
00:14:09,939 --> 00:14:11,480
Delhi is...

335
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,740
like a satellite city of Korea,

336
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,779
like Gyeonggi Province.

337
00:14:14,949 --> 00:14:17,750
This is not our destination.

338
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,620
The place I wanted to go to the most...

339
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,250
is Varanasi.

340
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,419
(Varanasi is where the Ganges is.)

341
00:14:22,689 --> 00:14:24,860
So I won't go out to Delhi.

342
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,189
I will be taking a domestic flight.

343
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:29,590
So that's Delhi.
Is it different from New Delhi?

344
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,100
You are curious about that?

345
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,799
(Getting her notebook out)

346
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:34,000
- All right.
- Wait. Do Yeon.

347
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,970
By any chance, is the answer
in that notebook?

348
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:38,199
Yes. It's got all the answers.

349
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,240
I forgot about it.

350
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:43,710
(Her notebook that includes
all kinds of travel information...)

351
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:48,850
(has been with Do Yeon since Season 1.)

352
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:50,980
(My curiosity has been satisfied.)

353
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:52,380
- All right.
- I forgot about it.

354
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:53,789
Please pay attention.

355
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:56,449
Delhi's official name is...

356
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:57,720
National Capital Territory of Delhi.

357
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,189
If we were to compare it to Korea,
it's like an area that encompasses...

358
00:15:00,189 --> 00:15:01,529
both Seoul and Gyeonggi Province.

359
00:15:01,789 --> 00:15:03,289
There is a total of 11 divisions,

360
00:15:03,289 --> 00:15:05,960
and one of them is the capital
of India, New Delhi.

361
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,000
New Delhi was newly established...

362
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,299
in the early 1910s by the UK.

363
00:15:10,299 --> 00:15:11,569
It's where the major government offices...

364
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:13,770
and the international airport are located.

365
00:15:14,539 --> 00:15:16,840
So New Delhi is within Delhi.

366
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,340
- Yes.
- Hey.

367
00:15:20,409 --> 00:15:21,880
- Wait.
- Don't ask anything else.

368
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,980
- Don't ask an unexpected question.
- Don't.

369
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:26,380
- I get flustered.
- If Delhi is Seoul and Gyeonggi...

370
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:28,390
Don't ask a question
unless the answer is in here.

371
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:29,850
You know she doesn't know.

372
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,390
You think Do Yeon had been there?

373
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,059
(Do Yeon will continue to share
her notebook-based knowledge.)

374
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,460
- Change?
- Yes. Change.

375
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,500
(He stopped by the money exchange
before transferring to a domestic flight.)

376
00:15:38,429 --> 00:15:40,829
(Before the departure
at Incheon International Airport,)

377
00:15:40,829 --> 00:15:44,039
(he was given the ticket
and money to travel.)

378
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,069
(He sat down and
counted the money right away.)

379
00:15:49,309 --> 00:15:50,710
I got 1,100 dollars.

380
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,079
I got 1,100 dollars.
That's about 1.5 million won.

381
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,610
So the exchange rate.

382
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:59,049
So 10 Indian rupees
are about 0.12 dollars.

383
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,890
I got 33,000 rupees.

384
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,890
I got 33,000 rupees.

385
00:16:09,590 --> 00:16:11,329
Wait. 30,000...

386
00:16:13,059 --> 00:16:14,169
I...

387
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,500
Wait. What went wrong?

388
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,899
Is it wrong?

389
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,340
I exchanged 1,100 dollars.

390
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,480
I got 33,000 rupees. Why...

391
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,880
Goodness.

392
00:16:28,179 --> 00:16:29,949
I gave them 1,100 dollars,

393
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:31,980
and I got 400 dollars.

394
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,020
If they tricked me, I won't let it slide.

395
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:41,390
(He gets out the bundle of money
and checks if he got tricked.)

396
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,789
It's 1, 2, 3, 4.

397
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:45,699
It's 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

398
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,470
- This is 50,000 rupees.
- Okay.

399
00:16:50,939 --> 00:16:54,039
(He was given a bundle
of 50,000 rupees first.)

400
00:16:56,409 --> 00:16:58,010
Then 33,000 rupees.

401
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,779
(He divided it into two bundles.)

402
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:05,379
- There were 2 bundles.
- There were 2 bundles.

403
00:17:05,379 --> 00:17:06,579
(In total, he got 83,000 rupees.)

404
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:09,250
I was mistaken.

405
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,289
It's because I'm in a foreign land.

406
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,930
I suspected those
good people for no reason.

407
00:17:16,629 --> 00:17:17,829
I suspected them.

408
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,760
(Embarrassed)

409
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,029
(He waits for the shuttle bus
to the domestic flight terminal.)

410
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,940
(Passing)

411
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,740
Stop.

412
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,539
I have to get on it. Go.

413
00:17:32,539 --> 00:17:34,410
(The bus tries to leave
even before people got on.)

414
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:36,950
You seem excited.

415
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,220
I was excited.

416
00:17:39,079 --> 00:17:40,650
(Rushing)

417
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,920
That smell.

418
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,190
The engine.

419
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,700
(He somehow takes a seat.)

420
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:52,260
Stop.

421
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:55,069
How can you leave
when not everyone got on?

422
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:57,339
He kept on leaving.

423
00:17:57,339 --> 00:17:59,200
(The shuttle bus leaves
before the passengers get on.)

424
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,410
(You can only get on the bus
if you stay sharp.)

425
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,470
What?

426
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,539
Is that how you really ride it?

427
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:07,950
- The weak ones can't survive.
- It's intense.

428
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:10,450
(Laughing)

429
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,420
It's so exciting.

430
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:18,559
Wait. It's so hot.

431
00:18:20,089 --> 00:18:22,359
Because of the heat from the engine,

432
00:18:22,359 --> 00:18:25,329
the back seats are very hot.

433
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:27,670
They should open the windows.

434
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,099
Look at this fan.

435
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,740
The fans are on.

436
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,210
If you...

437
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:40,109
blow air to your friend...

438
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:43,049
at a sauna, you get hotter.
Do you know that?

439
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:45,319
That's how it feels.

440
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,720
(The air-conditioner doesn't work.)

441
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:49,520
I didn't get to go to the sauna often
because of COVID-19.

442
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,420
I am enjoying the sauna in India.

443
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,730
It's the bus sauna.

444
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm happy.

445
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,000
We are there.

446
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,970
(Dizzy)

447
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,980
(He finishes the sauna bus experience.)

448
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,750
Goodness.

449
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,180
It was my first time to get on...

450
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:21,619
a bus that's as hot as a sauna.

451
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:22,690
(Even transferring isn't easy in India.
It's a thrilling first experience.)

452
00:19:22,819 --> 00:19:24,220
(Delhi to Varanasi)

453
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:26,289
- You have to fly an hour.
- Yes. An hour.

454
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:27,760
It's quite far.

455
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
(Lal Bahadur Shastri
International Airport, Varanasi)

456
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:32,960
(Current time: 9:25 p.m.)

457
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,629
Korea is three and a half hours ahead.

458
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:39,170
(Sniffing)

459
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,240
(He comes out
while savoring the unfamiliar air.)

460
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,639
I came out of the airport in Varanasi.

461
00:19:43,639 --> 00:19:44,639
(He's dressed like someone on a day trip.)

462
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,710
From my understanding, the hotel...

463
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,010
I checked it out on Google,

464
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,879
- and it was a 1-star hotel.
- A 1-star hotel.

465
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:54,619
(He searched for a hotel
at Delhi Airport.)

466
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,859
I found one in this area.

467
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,119
It's right here.

468
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,619
It's got the river view.

469
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,059
It's got a view too.

470
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,629
The view of the Ganges too.

471
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:05,430
This is Varanasi.

472
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,859
From Varanasi,

473
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:09,230
I will go there.

474
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,569
Did you find one ahead of time
because you didn't find a hotel...

475
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:12,639
ahead of time on Season One
and you struggled?

476
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:14,410
Yes. I felt like planning ahead.

477
00:20:15,139 --> 00:20:16,240
You are like a professional traveler.

478
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,270
(He's proud.)

479
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,240
When you go on a trip,
you should book a hotel in advance.

480
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,309
Right.

481
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:22,450
- I book a hotel ahead of time.
- But other people always do that.

482
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:24,379
- You do that, right?
- I always make sure to book ahead.

483
00:20:24,379 --> 00:20:26,819
If there's anyone out there
who doesn't do it in advance,

484
00:20:26,819 --> 00:20:28,319
- you should.
- That's a great tip.

485
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,389
Reserve a hotel first.

486
00:20:29,389 --> 00:20:31,420
You know it's a little cheaper
if you book ahead, right?

487
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,920
- We know.
- You know.

488
00:20:33,589 --> 00:20:35,089
You must book a hotel first.

489
00:20:35,289 --> 00:20:36,930
I heard I need to take a cab.

490
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,430
So I will go get a cab.

491
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,430
(Touting)

492
00:20:40,430 --> 00:20:42,329
There's a motorcycle cab too.

493
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:46,299
I had a bad experience
with a motorcycle cab...

494
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:48,440
in Iquitos.

495
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,869
(He had a dizzying experience in Iquitos.)

496
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:51,339
I was scared.

497
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,710
(The motorcycle cab amused him.)

498
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,779
- There were lots of unpaved roads.
- There were.

499
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:57,010
I will take a cab that has four wheels.

500
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:01,049
(Approaching)

501
00:21:01,849 --> 00:21:03,220
- Hi, sir.
- Taxi?

502
00:21:03,349 --> 00:21:04,819
Yes. I have a taxi.

503
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:07,020
- A car?
- A car.

504
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,629
A car taxi?

505
00:21:08,629 --> 00:21:10,529
Taximeter?

506
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:11,799
- Meter?
- Taximeter?

507
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,859
Meter.

508
00:21:13,859 --> 00:21:15,770
Wait.

509
00:21:16,099 --> 00:21:17,900
- Do you know Dwivedi Hotel?
- I know that.

510
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,970
- You know?
- Yes, I know.

511
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:20,470
How long time?

512
00:21:20,470 --> 00:21:22,039
People are crowding around him.

513
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,069
- It's 1 hour.
- It's 1 hour.

514
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:25,440
It takes one hour.

515
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,539
How much?

516
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,849
It's 1,250 rupees.

517
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:30,150
It's 1,250 rupees.

518
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,779
That's a little more than 15 dollars.
For traveling an hour.

519
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,319
That's reasonable.

520
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:36,990
It's an SUV.

521
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,220
(Get in.)

522
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,529
No. I will sit at the back.

523
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,230
- I like the backseat.
- That's more comfortable.

524
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,329
The backseat.

525
00:21:46,129 --> 00:21:47,970
The passenger seat is on the right side.

526
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:50,129
- Okay, sir?
- Okay.

527
00:21:50,129 --> 00:21:51,799
- Let's move?
- Let's go.

528
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,809
Let's go.

529
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:56,839
(He finally dives into Varanasi.)

530
00:21:58,210 --> 00:22:02,410
(The exotic night scenery
out the window...)

531
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,819
(makes him get excited like a child.)

532
00:22:05,819 --> 00:22:07,180
- He looks happy.
- He looks happy.

533
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,349
He looks very happy.

534
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,760
(Sniffing)

535
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:16,559
I always smell this smoke
when I am on a trip,

536
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,730
and it's nostalgic.

537
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,430
It's nostalgic.

538
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,770
(He gets showered with nostalgia.)

539
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:24,470
(The way to the hotel is
delightful to the eyes and nose.)

540
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,599
It smells like exhaust gas.

541
00:22:27,099 --> 00:22:28,910
(Music playing)

542
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,039
(Music playing)

543
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,480
There is a party.

544
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,349
- A party?
- A wedding.

545
00:22:34,349 --> 00:22:36,750
- A wedding.
- A party.

546
00:22:37,379 --> 00:22:39,150
(Bustling)

547
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,879
It's grand.

548
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,049
Indian weddings are...

549
00:22:43,849 --> 00:22:46,190
- held at night time?
- Night time. Yes.

550
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:48,730
(Because they believe
gods are present at night,)

551
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,559
(they normally hold weddings at night.)

552
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,960
(As it's the biggest event
that brings two families together,)

553
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,000
(many people come
and enjoy it like a festival.)

554
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:57,970
- That's the wedding car.
- The wedding car.

555
00:22:58,339 --> 00:23:00,440
(Clip-clop)

556
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,109
It's like a car you see at a theme park.

557
00:23:02,109 --> 00:23:03,510
Right. During a parade.

558
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,839
(Thud)

559
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,010
Goodness.

560
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,039
(Startled)

561
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,510
(Fireworks are set off.)

562
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,750
(Laughing)

563
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,190
That looks fun. Really fun.

564
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:18,020
- A different wedding.
- A wedding.

565
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:19,960
(Another wedding?)

566
00:23:21,089 --> 00:23:25,359
Half of Varanasi is a wedding venue.

567
00:23:26,629 --> 00:23:28,069
So many people are getting married.

568
00:23:28,069 --> 00:23:29,400
It's very grand.

569
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:33,740
It's like the club street in Hongdae.

570
00:23:34,339 --> 00:23:36,869
(It's like a club party.)

571
00:23:36,869 --> 00:23:38,279
What time was that?

572
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,609
That was past 10 p.m.

573
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:44,520
(Many weddings light the night streets.)

574
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:47,789
(They go past
the exciting wedding parties.)

575
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:50,289
(And they enter
the downtown area of Varanasi.)

576
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,960
It's a city. Now this is the city area.

577
00:23:53,819 --> 00:23:54,859
(Honking)

578
00:23:55,789 --> 00:23:56,859
(Honking)

579
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,500
(Honking)

580
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,000
It's a honking party.

581
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,500
What?

582
00:24:05,369 --> 00:24:06,900
(Driving on the wrong side)

583
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,069
He drove on the wrong side.

584
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:09,369
(He's going in reverse too.)

585
00:24:09,369 --> 00:24:10,569
They go in a reverse direction.

586
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:13,180
There are no traffic lights.

587
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,680
There are no traffic lights.

588
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,150
They just go.

589
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,920
(Laughing)

590
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,920
(Honking)

591
00:24:21,789 --> 00:24:22,789
Please.

592
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:24,690
(That was very close.)

593
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,119
When you play an airplane game,

594
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,059
- missiles fly at you.
- Yes.

595
00:24:28,059 --> 00:24:30,730
It's like avoiding those missiles.

596
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,129
Driving here is crazy.

597
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:33,730
Driving here is crazy.

598
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,529
(I am not laughing.)

599
00:24:36,529 --> 00:24:37,529
Seriously.

600
00:24:38,339 --> 00:24:41,270
(The last star
of this chaotic party is...)

601
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:42,609
- What?
- What is that? An elephant?

602
00:24:42,609 --> 00:24:44,879
Are they lost?

603
00:24:44,879 --> 00:24:47,440
This is what the night time here is like.
So many people.

604
00:24:47,609 --> 00:24:50,450
Millions of people walk on the streets.

605
00:24:50,910 --> 00:24:52,549
The traffic is always bad.

606
00:24:52,549 --> 00:24:54,389
(This is the night street of India.)

607
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:56,789
I will stop the car here.

608
00:24:56,789 --> 00:24:58,619
From here, you will walk.

609
00:24:58,619 --> 00:25:00,990
(From here, you will walk.)

610
00:25:02,089 --> 00:25:03,990
He told me to get off
when we weren't there.

611
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,000
(Wait, Mr. Driver.)

612
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,700
I don't understand.

613
00:25:08,029 --> 00:25:10,029
It's not possible to get past this line.

614
00:25:10,029 --> 00:25:11,029
Right.

615
00:25:11,029 --> 00:25:12,639
So people are walking.

616
00:25:12,639 --> 00:25:13,839
- Walk.
- From here.

617
00:25:13,839 --> 00:25:14,839
Okay.

618
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,210
He thought he would get dropped off
right in front of the hotel,

619
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,609
but he's told to walk.

620
00:25:20,109 --> 00:25:22,250
(He pays first.)

621
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,480
(24.26 dollars)

622
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,119
Here.

623
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,680
- He said 15.16 dollars.
- He said 15.16 dollars.

624
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,650
- He said 15.16 dollars.
- That's 1 thousand.

625
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:33,289
Where's the change?

626
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,289
I don't have change.

627
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,529
You don't have it.

628
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:41,970
The rest will become a tip
if I don't have change.

629
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,129
(Rummaging)

630
00:25:43,529 --> 00:25:45,569
(Looking)

631
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:50,170
You really...

632
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,539
You really don't have any change?

633
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,940
No change.

634
00:25:54,109 --> 00:25:55,879
- Okay. Keep it as a tip.
- Tip. Thank you.

635
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:57,750
(He ends up paying 9.10 dollars as a tip.)

636
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,950
Okay. Thank you.

637
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,920
That's why you need to take small changes.

638
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
Oh, dear.

639
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:06,119
I was flustered that I just did it.

640
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:11,059
To get from the airport to the street
where Kian84 is getting off,

641
00:26:11,059 --> 00:26:13,660
people pay 9.70 dollars on average.

642
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,029
I was supposed to give him 15.16 dollars.

643
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:17,369
(He gets off after paying
the taxi driver a big tip.)

644
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:27,109
(The honking sound hits you
like a surround sound.)

645
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:31,920
He got that as soon as he got off.

646
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,819
Your ears get... Gosh.

647
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:37,020
Welcome to Varanasi.

648
00:26:41,789 --> 00:26:44,029
(Let's go.)

649
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,629
(This is...)

650
00:26:48,629 --> 00:26:51,440
(the city that embraces the Ganges.)

651
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,299
- What is that?
- The Ganges.

652
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:54,369
- What is that?
- What is that?

653
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:56,539
(Varanasi is the shrine of Hinduism.)

654
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,010
It's a religious ceremony.

655
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:02,079
(It's the oldest city in India
that means "the city of sacred light.")

656
00:27:02,079 --> 00:27:03,809
(Embracing the Ganges,
which is like a mother to Indians,)

657
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:05,349
(it's visited by
a million pilgrims every year.)

658
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:06,920
It's visited by
a million people every year.

659
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,619
Pilgrims.

660
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,260
Varanasi is a holy place.

661
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,460
(Varanasi is older than history,
older than tradition,)

662
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,690
That must've been so nice.

663
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:17,730
(older even than legend, and looks twice
as old as all of them put together.)

664
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:19,930
(By Mark Twain)

665
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,960
That's great.

666
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,139
(Varanasi is the starting point
of his second trip.)

667
00:27:26,539 --> 00:27:29,369
I went to many cities in India.

668
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,069
- Right.
- It's the most authentic Indian city.

669
00:27:31,069 --> 00:27:32,879
- It is.
- That's Varanasi.

670
00:27:33,839 --> 00:27:35,779
(Wait.)

671
00:27:36,010 --> 00:27:37,109
He dropped me off...

672
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,220
at a far place.

673
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:42,020
(21 minutes)

674
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,819
(He has to walk 21 minutes to the hotel.)

675
00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,460
I am not trying to be funny here.
There are no sidewalks in India.

676
00:27:48,829 --> 00:27:51,160
- No sidewalks?
- People can't walk on sidewalks.

677
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,029
(He goes straight.)

678
00:27:55,029 --> 00:27:56,299
(Blocking the road)

679
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,940
(Blocking the road)

680
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
It's just...

681
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:01,309
This is...

682
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:03,970
Just...

683
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,980
(Honking)

684
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,910
(He's stuck.)

685
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,710
Everyone.

686
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,020
I don't know if I can make it there alive.

687
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:17,819
(As his safety is threatened,
he speaks his mind honestly.)

688
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:21,089
(You have to avoid the cars somehow.)

689
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,760
Goodness. Hello.

690
00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:25,799
It's so loud, and he's there.

691
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,559
It's a surround sound.

692
00:28:28,270 --> 00:28:29,270
(Yes.)

693
00:28:32,099 --> 00:28:33,170
(Move.)

694
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,170
(Wait.)

695
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,670
(Laughing)

696
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,010
(Madness)

697
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,440
It's amazing that he can still laugh.

698
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,910
I know.

699
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,779
Is that why I am laughing?

700
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,279
(You have to be a little mad
to enjoy the thrill.)

701
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:51,049
Look at the Indian dogs.

702
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,260
There are so many stray dogs.

703
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:54,260
(On guard)

704
00:28:55,990 --> 00:28:56,990
(Passing through)

705
00:28:56,990 --> 00:28:58,299
Look at the dog.

706
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:04,000
(The fearful traveler crosses
after giving a signal.)

707
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,799
(He passes the street
as if he's walking on a tightrope.)

708
00:29:09,339 --> 00:29:11,379
(He finally enters a carless street.)

709
00:29:12,339 --> 00:29:15,650
(But he must walk another 10 minutes.)

710
00:29:16,349 --> 00:29:18,349
- Hello.
- Hi.

711
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,220
(Bikes and horses coexist in the alley.)

712
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,760
Finding the location
seems really difficult.

713
00:29:27,819 --> 00:29:30,029
Were you using Google Maps?

714
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:32,700
Yes. But the map wasn't all that accurate.

715
00:29:33,129 --> 00:29:34,829
- Where are you from?
- Korea.

716
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,299
Is that a real camera?

717
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,369
It's for a TV show.

718
00:29:39,369 --> 00:29:40,539
- "TV show?"
- Yes.

719
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:41,539
(Wiping his face)

720
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:43,139
Wait.

721
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:44,240
(What? Hold on.)

722
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,910
(Is this the wrong way?)

723
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,010
Hey.

724
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,710
Do you know...

725
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:50,809
(In the end, he asks for help.)

726
00:29:50,809 --> 00:29:52,180
Dwivedi Hotel?

727
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,020
This is over there. Follow me.

728
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,889
- Come.
- Okay.

729
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Let's go.

730
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,990
What's your name?

731
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:03,730
My name is Muhammad.

732
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:06,029
- "Muhammad?"
- Yes. I'm a Muslim.

733
00:30:06,029 --> 00:30:07,160
- "Muslim."
- Yes.

734
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,400
- You?
- Yes. Are you Christian?

735
00:30:10,629 --> 00:30:12,000
- Christian?
- "Christian?"

736
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,670
(I'm not a Christian.)

737
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,440
What's Buddhism in English?

738
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,270
- Buddha.
- "Buddha."

739
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,010
(He spoke in Korean,)

740
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,609
(but they caught the gist.)

741
00:30:20,609 --> 00:30:22,049
How did they understand that?

742
00:30:23,049 --> 00:30:24,750
Gosh, you're good at Korean.

743
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:27,049
(Surprisingly,
they have no language barrier.)

744
00:30:27,379 --> 00:30:30,589
Muhammad, who I met by coincidence,

745
00:30:31,089 --> 00:30:33,420
is being a guide. I'm very grateful.

746
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,059
Muhammad.

747
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,260
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

748
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,359
- "Seventeen?"
- Yes.

749
00:30:38,359 --> 00:30:40,400
Right. You looked like a high schooler.

750
00:30:41,329 --> 00:30:43,099
What's your job?

751
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,470
Are you a student?

752
00:30:44,569 --> 00:30:46,270
- No, I'm not.
- You're not a student.

753
00:30:46,569 --> 00:30:47,799
Gosh.

754
00:30:49,109 --> 00:30:50,710
Muhammad is...

755
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:52,180
(Muhammad, 17, is not attending school.)

756
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,279
(Following the duo)

757
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:59,279
This place is like an ant's nest.

758
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,180
Only locals can find the way.

759
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,650
The streets are super narrow.

760
00:31:03,619 --> 00:31:04,960
Hello.

761
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

762
00:31:08,359 --> 00:31:09,389
Oh, gosh.

763
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,730
(There's a dog.)

764
00:31:12,099 --> 00:31:14,230
There are dogs in every town.

765
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,200
(There's even a goat.)

766
00:31:17,369 --> 00:31:19,440
All kinds of animals were there.

767
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:21,400
(Shouting)

768
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,809
(Even in this complex alleyway,)

769
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:29,279
(he easily finds the way with friends.)

770
00:31:30,549 --> 00:31:31,650
We're here.

771
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,750
(That was quite a journey.)

772
00:31:35,990 --> 00:31:37,950
Oh, he knows the way well.

773
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,260
- Duivedi Hotel.
- "Duivedi Hotel."

774
00:31:40,389 --> 00:31:42,660
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye.

775
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:45,359
- No, come here.
- I'm going home.

776
00:31:45,359 --> 00:31:47,599
I'll give you some pocket money.

777
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,829
You're giving them pocket money?

778
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:50,930
No.

779
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,770
- Come on.
- He's refusing it.

780
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:54,069
- I'm okay.
- But still.

781
00:31:54,470 --> 00:31:56,139
Hey. Come here.

782
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,109
I can't give you much.

783
00:31:58,109 --> 00:31:59,109
(He wants to repay them.)

784
00:31:59,109 --> 00:32:01,010
You're seriously kind. You went this far.

785
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:02,609
- No.
- No money.

786
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:04,250
No, come on.

787
00:32:04,309 --> 00:32:05,520
No.

788
00:32:05,579 --> 00:32:08,020
- I'm 40 years old.
- Yes.

789
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,549
Yes, I'm 17.

790
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:10,750
You're 17. I'm 40.

791
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:11,760
(Suddenly revealing his age)

792
00:32:11,889 --> 00:32:13,619
What's uncle in English?

793
00:32:13,819 --> 00:32:15,129
Uncle in English.

794
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,589
No. Come here.

795
00:32:16,589 --> 00:32:17,589
(He's not good at English
but full of affection.)

796
00:32:17,889 --> 00:32:19,260
- Here.
- No.

797
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,069
Then split it between you two.

798
00:32:22,129 --> 00:32:23,430
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

799
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:25,339
(Bidding farewell
after giving them pocket money)

800
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,770
Good luck!

801
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:29,670
- Those kids were kind.
- Right?

802
00:32:29,670 --> 00:32:30,869
It wasn't that close.

803
00:32:30,869 --> 00:32:31,980
You're kind, too.

804
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:37,710
Here it is. Dwivedi Hotel.

805
00:32:38,849 --> 00:32:41,180
Dwivedi Hotel. This is the place.
A one-star hotel.

806
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,520
Shall we go inside?

807
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,520
- Hi.
- Yes.

808
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:50,460
- "Hi?"
- That was so natural.

809
00:32:50,529 --> 00:32:52,160
And he understood.

810
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:53,760
- For two days.
- Yes.

811
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,869
- One person.
- Okay.

812
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:58,400
- How much is it for one day?
- It's 4,000 rupees.

813
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:00,569
- Four thousand?
- Yes.

814
00:33:00,569 --> 00:33:01,710
(4,000 rupees per night)

815
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,869
Okay.

816
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,879
(Taking out)

817
00:33:05,579 --> 00:33:07,809
One, two, three, four,

818
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,450
- five, six, seven, eight.
- Should he take all his money out?

819
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,879
That's really dangerous.

820
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:13,619
I'm anxious.
You did that at the airport, too.

821
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,250
- Right?
- I should...

822
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:17,589
- be careful about that.
- Totally.

823
00:33:18,089 --> 00:33:20,020
- So don't copy this?
- This is not a tip, right?

824
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,460
- No, it's not.
- It's not a tip.

825
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,230
You shouldn't take your money out.

826
00:33:23,789 --> 00:33:24,859
Thank you.

827
00:33:24,859 --> 00:33:26,960
(A room for 2 nights: 8,000 rupees,
about 128 dollars)

828
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:28,700
- Okay. That's your key.
- Room.

829
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:30,670
Hold on. I'll show you your room.

830
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,940
Okay.

831
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:33,869
- Is there AC inside the room?
- Yes.

832
00:33:33,869 --> 00:33:35,139
Okay, thank you.

833
00:33:35,139 --> 00:33:36,839
- And wifi?
- Yes.

834
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:39,279
You only need two things in a room,
AC and wifi.

835
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,539
- Those two are a must.
- Yes.

836
00:33:46,819 --> 00:33:50,020
Gosh, the Ganges.

837
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:51,190
I can remember it.

838
00:33:51,190 --> 00:33:53,420
The Ganges is right ahead.
This place is great.

839
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,059
Goodness, this view.

840
00:33:55,389 --> 00:33:56,690
It was right ahead?

841
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:57,829
How nice.

842
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,129
The view price is reasonable.

843
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,230
"View price."

844
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:04,970
Here's your room.

845
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,799
Here's my room?

846
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:09,909
When I wake up in the morning,
the Ganges...

847
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,480
It's a river view.

848
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,079
(How's the condition of the room
he paid for?)

849
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,079
What's it like?

850
00:34:17,079 --> 00:34:20,679
Gosh. It's great. Good.

851
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:23,090
(AC is installed.)

852
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:25,219
- It's cool in here.
- Water is an amenity.

853
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,320
- Okay.
- There are tea and coffee.

854
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,360
"Coffee."

855
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,090
- That's the toilet.
- Yes.

856
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:34,659
And all the toiletries
are inside the mirror.

857
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:35,969
Okay.

858
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:37,300
The place is nice.

859
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,400
It's clean.

860
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:40,570
- The place looks quite new.
- Right?

861
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,039
Nice. You chose a good place.

862
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:44,270
- Scratch that.
- That place is new?

863
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:46,679
- There's a crack in the wall.
- "Quite new?"

864
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,579
Which part looks new, Seung Hoon?

865
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,349
That was hilarious.
"Which part looks new?"

866
00:34:53,349 --> 00:34:54,380
(Only the necessities are here.)

867
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,820
(Kian84's first accommodation
after a long trip)

868
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,960
(Sighing)

869
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,259
Food and whatnot.

870
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:11,199
It's a relief I got here alive.

871
00:35:12,869 --> 00:35:14,369
The car horns, exhaust fumes,

872
00:35:14,369 --> 00:35:17,909
and uneasiness from an unknown place...

873
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:19,610
disappeared when I got there.

874
00:35:19,610 --> 00:35:21,079
(The room feels cozy.)

875
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,179
What time is it?

876
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,880
It's currently 11:10 p.m.

877
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,449
It's 2:40 a.m. in Korea.

878
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,960
So it took you 17 hours
to get to that hotel.

879
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:39,599
(Let's hurry up and take a shower.)

880
00:35:42,869 --> 00:35:47,270
(Washing off the sweat and exhaust fumes)

881
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,940
(Changing into clean clothes)

882
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,079
(He heads out right away.)

883
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,889
He gave me a lock for the door.

884
00:36:02,889 --> 00:36:04,849
When on a trip,

885
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,789
drinking alone is the top priority for me.

886
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:08,020
- Of course.
- Yes.

887
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,559
Excuse me?

888
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,070
Is there a supermarket here?

889
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,130
For whiskey and food?

890
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,570
Sorry, sir. Food is available.

891
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:23,909
But after 10 p.m.,
the alcohol shops close.

892
00:36:23,909 --> 00:36:27,039
- Closed?
- Ten o'clock. From the Ganges, okay?

893
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,509
Within 200m,

894
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,750
- you're not allowed to drink.
- Okay.

895
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,349
This is a policy.

896
00:36:32,349 --> 00:36:35,820
The government does not give permission...

897
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:37,489
to drink in front of the river.

898
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:39,059
- If you want to drink,
- Yes?

899
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:41,460
you can buy it before 10 p.m.

900
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,690
- It's now closed.
- "Now closed?" Okay.

901
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,699
Only food is possible right now.

902
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:49,630
I will send my staff with you outside
to where you can go.

903
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,070
Okay. I understand.

904
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:53,639
Thank you.

905
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,309
So I can't drink.

906
00:36:56,969 --> 00:36:59,579
(Even in Korea...)

907
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:01,639
(and overseas,)

908
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:06,750
(you were always with me.)

909
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,190
- That was delicious.
- I'm craving it now.

910
00:37:10,889 --> 00:37:12,989
(Heading to eat for now)

911
00:37:12,989 --> 00:37:14,159
- What?
- Why...

912
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,190
Right now, I'm going to a restaurant.

913
00:37:18,559 --> 00:37:20,559
I feel bad.
He could've told me the address,

914
00:37:20,559 --> 00:37:21,759
but he's showing me the way.

915
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:25,869
What shocked me was that many alleyways
weren't on Google Maps...

916
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,400
because there were just so many.

917
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,270
(He follows the staff
through the alleyway.)

918
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,809
Looking at the wall art must be fun.

919
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:38,079
You can tell that
Kian84 can't look at the walls...

920
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,719
because his eyes need to be on the ground.

921
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:42,150
- To avoid stepping on poop?
- Yes.

922
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,420
You can't look at the walls.

923
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,820
If you want to enjoy the wall art,

924
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,320
you must give up on your shoes.

925
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,829
Stepping on poop
and enjoying the trip could be better.

926
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:53,099
Oh, gosh.

927
00:37:54,759 --> 00:37:56,630
- Be careful.
- Yes, cow.

928
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,039
- Okay. Oh, cow.
- Yes, cow.

929
00:38:01,270 --> 00:38:04,110
This is cow poop,
much bigger than human poop.

930
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,409
The dog poop in Iquitos...

931
00:38:07,409 --> 00:38:08,480
(South American dog poop is smaller.)

932
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,250
is on the smaller side.

933
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,880
The cows don't poop cleanly,

934
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,489
like their poop is quite thin.

935
00:38:16,489 --> 00:38:18,150
(Barking)

936
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,190
You guys are noisy.

937
00:38:20,659 --> 00:38:22,059
I'm scared.

938
00:38:22,059 --> 00:38:23,059
(I'm scared.)

939
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:24,590
(Screaming)

940
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,730
Seriously.

941
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:27,300
Come.

942
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,730
I should've...

943
00:38:30,199 --> 00:38:31,770
just gone to bed.

944
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,670
I usually like to walk around.

945
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,309
But I might become a homebody in India.

946
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,280
Go right.

947
00:38:40,739 --> 00:38:44,150
(India's night walk
isn't easy in many ways.)

948
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:46,679
- Is it there?
- No, here.

949
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,849
Oh, here.

950
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:51,389
(Fortunately, he arrives safely.)

951
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,489
Yes. They look clean,

952
00:38:54,489 --> 00:38:55,860
though I don't know what these are.

953
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:58,030
Are we going to see
India's street food now?

954
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:59,429
- It looks good.
- Right?

955
00:38:59,429 --> 00:39:01,030
- They do look good.
- Dumplings.

956
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:02,030
(India's restaurant)

957
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,800
I want to know what you ate
for your first meal.

958
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,340
Second floor? Okay.

959
00:39:07,099 --> 00:39:08,270
Thank you.

960
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:15,909
(The inside of the restaurant is
more ordinary than they thought.)

961
00:39:15,909 --> 00:39:16,949
Yes.

962
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,320
(Let's see.)

963
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:23,920
Gosh, there's a lot on the menu.

964
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,520
That place is like a snack bar in India.

965
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,059
- I see.
- That's why they have a lot on the menu.

966
00:39:27,259 --> 00:39:31,030
The taxi driver gave me
recommendations earlier.

967
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,630
(The local taxi driver recommended dishes
that he should try in Varanasi.)

968
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:40,570
(Puri, sabzi, jalebi)

969
00:39:40,570 --> 00:39:44,139
(Puri is a deep-fried bread. Sabzi is
a vegetable curry. Jalebi is a dessert.)

970
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:46,179
- Curry.
- Gosh, they look delicious.

971
00:39:46,179 --> 00:39:47,579
India is known for its curry.

972
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:50,610
Sabzi? You know sabzi?

973
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,809
Sabzi? This is sabzi.

974
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,280
These are sabzi?

975
00:39:53,949 --> 00:39:54,949
This.

976
00:39:54,949 --> 00:39:56,050
(He chose one based on his feelings.)

977
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:57,119
Yes. This one.

978
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:59,190
(Potato broccoli curry)

979
00:39:59,489 --> 00:40:00,489
Rice?

980
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,159
Rice is separate.

981
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:04,460
- This.
- One?

982
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,960
This one and...

983
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,099
Beer?

984
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,199
(He's desperate for a beer.)

985
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,530
- No.
- No beer?

986
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,739
No alcohol?

987
00:40:13,739 --> 00:40:16,570
(It's hard for him to accept
the absence of alcohol.)

988
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,539
He's pouting.

989
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,739
The owner of the lodging
told me about this,

990
00:40:21,739 --> 00:40:23,150
but I didn't understand him.

991
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:26,320
The Ganges is very sacred.

992
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:28,619
Alcohol can't be sold
within 200m of the river.

993
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:30,020
- It can't.
- People will get into huge trouble.

994
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:32,389
Chicken?

995
00:40:32,389 --> 00:40:33,659
- No.
- No chicken?

996
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,630
It's all vegetarian.

997
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,030
Vegetable.

998
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,300
Vegetable? Only vegetable?

999
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,400
Only vegetable?

1000
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,869
One potato broccoli curry,

1001
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:44,000
- one fried rice.
- Yes.

1002
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:45,940
I guess not even chicken is allowed.

1003
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,639
He likes chicken.

1004
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,509
(He spotted something.)

1005
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,380
(The table behind him got their food.)

1006
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:56,449
(They began to eat with their hands.)

1007
00:40:56,449 --> 00:40:57,780
Right. There are no spoons here.

1008
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,520
Indians believe that their hands,
which they maintain clean,

1009
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,489
are more hygienic than the tableware...

1010
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:05,659
provided by restaurants,

1011
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,759
which could have been used by anyone.

1012
00:41:07,759 --> 00:41:08,789
So that's more hygienic for them.

1013
00:41:08,789 --> 00:41:10,389
"I don't know who ate with that spoon."

1014
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:12,030
"I'd rather eat with my hand."

1015
00:41:20,369 --> 00:41:24,210
(The wedding procession followed Kian84.)

1016
00:41:24,539 --> 00:41:25,909
It's almost like...

1017
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,639
"Mad Max."

1018
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,679
The wedding party is still ongoing.

1019
00:41:29,679 --> 00:41:30,710
Goodness.

1020
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:32,550
("Indian Max: Festival Road")

1021
00:41:32,949 --> 00:41:34,280
It's 12:30 a.m.

1022
00:41:36,489 --> 00:41:40,520
The people here are full of joy.

1023
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,159
(Noticing)

1024
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,530
Thank you.

1025
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:48,730
(His meal that he ordered
based on his feelings is here.)

1026
00:41:48,730 --> 00:41:50,429
- Vegetarian.
- Gosh.

1027
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:51,530
- The curry looks good.
- It looks nice.

1028
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,369
- The rice looks great.
- It looks delicious.

1029
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:54,469
Carbs...

1030
00:41:56,239 --> 00:41:57,340
He's washing his hands.

1031
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,380
(Naturally, he cleans his hands.)

1032
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:02,550
Since it's a part of Indian culture
for people to eat with their hands,

1033
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:04,949
restaurants always have sinks like that.

1034
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,020
(Sniffing)

1035
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:12,059
(He's checking the hygiene
of his hands by smelling them.)

1036
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,789
(Halting)

1037
00:42:15,429 --> 00:42:16,489
Gosh...

1038
00:42:17,289 --> 00:42:19,329
Eating with my hand is...

1039
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:21,300
You could have asked for a spoon.

1040
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:22,969
I wanted to experience it.

1041
00:42:23,130 --> 00:42:25,230
This feels different.

1042
00:42:25,369 --> 00:42:26,699
Because you weren't used to it.

1043
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,099
Touching the food felt...

1044
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:32,239
(He takes a big bite in the Indian way.)

1045
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:33,309
No hesitation.

1046
00:42:33,579 --> 00:42:36,550
I think it's great that he's adjusted
to the local culture right away like that.

1047
00:42:37,449 --> 00:42:39,980
They don't use spoons for a reason.

1048
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,090
It's nice to eat with my hand.

1049
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,020
Gosh, that's hot.

1050
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,929
You can't grab too deep inside.

1051
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,190
Gosh, that's hot.

1052
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,329
(It's nice and quite hot for him
to eat with his hand.)

1053
00:42:52,329 --> 00:42:54,730
Oh, my goodness.

1054
00:42:55,469 --> 00:42:56,530
You must have put your hand
deep inside the curry.

1055
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,770
- Goodness.
- Yes, I did.

1056
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,969
I see that the Indians
have a certain skill...

1057
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:03,270
to eat neatly
without getting their hands messy.

1058
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:05,239
Indians don't eat like that.

1059
00:43:05,239 --> 00:43:07,480
- They're eating very neatly.
- They only use the tips of their fingers.

1060
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,949
They're highly skilled at this.

1061
00:43:09,949 --> 00:43:11,880
(Neat and tidy)

1062
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,880
- He's so neat.
- He's eating so neatly.

1063
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,420
- Gosh.
- I was just...

1064
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:18,650
It looks like your hand is getting
more food than your mouth.

1065
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:21,090
You look so...

1066
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,119
(Laughter)

1067
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:24,329
It's just that I wanted to...

1068
00:43:24,329 --> 00:43:26,259
make a ball.

1069
00:43:26,259 --> 00:43:27,630
- I get what you're trying to say.
- What's the word?

1070
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,329
Like the rice balls that we eat in Korea.

1071
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:31,869
- I see.
- But it didn't work.

1072
00:43:31,869 --> 00:43:34,739
Like how we make
flying fish roe rice balls.

1073
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,869
It was delicious.

1074
00:43:36,869 --> 00:43:38,210
- Gosh, you're digging in.
- You look so...

1075
00:43:38,409 --> 00:43:39,409
(Delicious)

1076
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,579
(He's enjoying his food.)

1077
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,050
As I was eating with my hand,

1078
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:55,159
it hit me that I was in India.

1079
00:43:55,829 --> 00:43:57,090
They didn't have spoons.

1080
00:43:57,389 --> 00:43:59,730
And asking for a spoon felt like...

1081
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,059
I would be disrespecting the culture.

1082
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,230
And I eat with a spoon
because we have spoons in Korea.

1083
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:07,300
I feel like I would probably eat
with my hands if we didn't have spoons.

1084
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:09,369
I pick up and eat things
with my hands even now.

1085
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,739
(He ate with his hand
in South America too.)

1086
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:18,210
(He has a long history
of eating with his hands.)

1087
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:22,179
How should I describe the taste?

1088
00:44:22,789 --> 00:44:25,489
I've never tasted something
like this before in my life.

1089
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,059
I can't think of anything
that tastes similar to this.

1090
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,059
This is delicious.

1091
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:34,800
(He's pouring the rest of the curry
onto the rice.)

1092
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:41,599
(He's never tasted something
like this before in his life.)

1093
00:44:42,369 --> 00:44:45,110
(He's perfectly adjusted.)

1094
00:44:45,539 --> 00:44:47,110
(My goodness.)

1095
00:44:47,610 --> 00:44:53,119
(He even surprised an Indian
with his bold way of eating.)

1096
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,820
How should I put this?

1097
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:56,150
It somehow brought me...

1098
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,860
the pleasure that comes from
doing something I shouldn't be doing.

1099
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:01,860
- Did you feel joy?
- I did.

1100
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,489
Because you can't do that in Korea.

1101
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:05,860
- It would look like you're ill-mannered.
- Right. Ill-mannered.

1102
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:08,429
It was kind of as if...

1103
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,429
- you broke a taboo.
- I broke a taboo.

1104
00:45:10,429 --> 00:45:11,929
I felt joy.

1105
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:13,039
That sounds great.

1106
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:15,000
You use spoons
now that you're back, right?

1107
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,009
Right.

1108
00:45:16,369 --> 00:45:17,409
I'm full.

1109
00:45:22,349 --> 00:45:23,409
(He's sucking off the food
from his fingers.)

1110
00:45:23,409 --> 00:45:24,409
(Yum)

1111
00:45:25,309 --> 00:45:28,349
(He cleans his hand with his mouth first.)

1112
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:32,559
(Then he washes it with water.)

1113
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,920
(He's only washing the hand he used.)

1114
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,030
- Okay.
- Okay.

1115
00:45:37,030 --> 00:45:38,329
Okay.

1116
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:43,829
(His late dinner cost 295 rupees,
which is approximately 4.7 dollars.)

1117
00:45:45,770 --> 00:45:50,239
It's only my first day and I already
understand why Pani Bottle said...

1118
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:51,639
India is the endgame
of travel destinations.

1119
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:56,449
It's very chaotic.

1120
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:00,679
But it feels
as if there's order in the chaos.

1121
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:05,090
(At first, he was taken aback...)

1122
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:07,820
(by the extreme disorder.)

1123
00:46:08,619 --> 00:46:11,489
I guess they have their own way of life.

1124
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,360
(But their own way of life exists in it.)

1125
00:46:15,259 --> 00:46:16,929
I got a small taste of it.

1126
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:19,369
Kind of like getting a sample
from the free-sample stand.

1127
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:22,270
I can't put it into words.

1128
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:26,809
(He got a taste of India
on his first day.)

1129
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:31,409
(He experienced things that aren't
familiar to him in an unfamiliar place.)

1130
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:36,550
Goodness. This is nice.

1131
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:40,320
(What kind of day in India
awaits him tomorrow?)

1132
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,489
We just finished watching
the footage from the first day.

1133
00:46:42,489 --> 00:46:44,929
So Dex, will we be seeing
the footage of you next season?

1134
00:46:45,230 --> 00:46:47,900
- Season Three.
- I'm trying to be on Season Three.

1135
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:48,929
I'm just here to introduce myself
beforehand.

1136
00:46:48,929 --> 00:46:51,900
Also, we seem to forget that
this is Pani Bottle's house.

1137
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:53,400
Wait, this isn't the studio?

1138
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:54,840
- No, it isn't.
- It's Pani Bottle's house.

1139
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,369
We didn't get to see the two.

1140
00:46:56,369 --> 00:46:58,509
If you could wait
just a little bit longer,

1141
00:46:58,509 --> 00:47:00,340
you'll be seeing me very soon.

1142
00:47:07,579 --> 00:47:09,320
(People are busy even before sunrise.)

1143
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:11,520
A day in Varanasi begins early.

1144
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,159
People swim in the Ganges before sunrise.

1145
00:47:14,159 --> 00:47:15,730
Everyone is outside.

1146
00:47:15,730 --> 00:47:17,889
(People start the day in their own way.)

1147
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:21,559
(Mornings in India are full of life.)

1148
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:25,969
(Kian84 finished getting ready
to go out early.)

1149
00:47:27,270 --> 00:47:29,840
(He's gulping down water.)

1150
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,110
What time is it?

1151
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:34,539
That was around 6 a.m.

1152
00:47:34,539 --> 00:47:35,679
You were up early.

1153
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,650
(He's scratching his ear.)

1154
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,820
(He's in awe.)

1155
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,849
(Gosh.)

1156
00:47:46,259 --> 00:47:49,329
(He keeps exclaiming
at the view outside the lodging.)

1157
00:47:49,329 --> 00:47:50,789
(Gosh.)

1158
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:56,969
The view is amazing.

1159
00:47:57,730 --> 00:47:59,469
(The Ganges is wide open.)

1160
00:47:59,469 --> 00:48:00,500
It's mind-blowing.

1161
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:01,840
- Right.
- Gosh.

1162
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,969
- Mind-blowing.
- Yes.

1163
00:48:02,969 --> 00:48:04,270
- It's mind-blowing.
- The Ganges.

1164
00:48:05,409 --> 00:48:07,610
(Namaste, it's Kian TV.)

1165
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:08,639
Hello.

1166
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:10,710
Do you see this?

1167
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:13,520
This is the Ganges River.

1168
00:48:13,619 --> 00:48:14,920
It looks completely different
from nighttime.

1169
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,190
- It does.
- Right.

1170
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:20,559
This is the most sacred river in India.

1171
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,030
(The Ganges is
the most sacred place in India.)

1172
00:48:23,559 --> 00:48:26,860
(This is a microcosm of India,)

1173
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:30,199
(where various forms of life
come together.)

1174
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:32,900
On one side, people clean themselves,

1175
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,440
swim, bathe, and do laundry.

1176
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:37,409
Right. Kian84 would fit in perfectly.

1177
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:41,009
On the other side of the river,
they cremate dead bodies.

1178
00:48:41,009 --> 00:48:44,179
(There's a crematory on the opposite side
of the river, the space of eternity.)

1179
00:48:44,179 --> 00:48:46,780
That's why this river holds
the meaning that...

1180
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,179
life and death are the same.

1181
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,389
- So that's a...
- Funeral.

1182
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:54,159
I'm going to head over there to watch.

1183
00:48:55,190 --> 00:48:57,230
(He's looking around.)

1184
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,829
Do you want to get on a boat?

1185
00:48:59,259 --> 00:49:01,730
- A boat.
- A boat? No.

1186
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:05,500
Boat? How can I get there?

1187
00:49:05,969 --> 00:49:08,440
Where are you going? Assi Ghat?

1188
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,170
You know...

1189
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Wait.

1190
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:14,710
Wait.

1191
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,020
- Manikarnika Ghat. You know?
- There.

1192
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,690
Manikarnika Ghat must be
where the crematory is.

1193
00:49:24,690 --> 00:49:26,259
How... What time?

1194
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:28,860
- How long?
- Fifteen minutes.

1195
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,090
- Fifty?
- Fifteen.

1196
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:32,929
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen.

1197
00:49:33,099 --> 00:49:35,199
- Ten, five.
- Ten, five? Fifteen minutes?

1198
00:49:35,259 --> 00:49:36,469
Ten, five.

1199
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:39,300
How should I describe this?

1200
00:49:39,539 --> 00:49:42,039
Fire, what time?

1201
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,869
- Anytime.
- Anytime, fire?

1202
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,340
- Anytime, fire.
- Yes.

1203
00:49:47,139 --> 00:49:48,610
Okay.

1204
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:53,920
Later. I see. Come here.

1205
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:55,349
They do it all day.

1206
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,650
I asked the boatman.

1207
00:49:58,849 --> 00:50:00,159
The cremations
are done throughout the day.

1208
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:01,789
They don't have a separate schedule.

1209
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:07,630
Hello.

1210
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:09,900
Sir.

1211
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:11,070
(The dog suddenly opened its eyes.)

1212
00:50:11,070 --> 00:50:12,500
- Even the dogs are smiling.
- Right?

1213
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,599
It's smiling.

1214
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:15,000
Sir, you shouldn't be sleeping here.

1215
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,369
- Here.
- It's so cute.

1216
00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:19,610
(He's poking the dog.)

1217
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:22,340
Maybe it's because this is a sacred place,

1218
00:50:22,710 --> 00:50:24,650
but even the dog is smiling.

1219
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,449
It's different from the dogs
at the alley from last night.

1220
00:50:27,449 --> 00:50:29,289
- During the day,
- Yes.

1221
00:50:29,289 --> 00:50:31,420
- it's hot so...
- I see.

1222
00:50:36,690 --> 00:50:39,659
The marks on their foreheads.

1223
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:42,460
Is that like a religious ritual?

1224
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,400
Right.

1225
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:47,139
Even the men have red marks
on their foreheads.

1226
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:48,170
Right.

1227
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,770
("Tika" means "the 3rd eye.")

1228
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:51,539
(It is marked on people's foreheads
to pray for blessings from the deities.)

1229
00:50:55,309 --> 00:50:57,280
Hello. Would you like a blessing?

1230
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,280
A blessing?

1231
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,280
- A blessing
- Yes.

1232
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:03,750
(Take a seat.)

1233
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,889
Hindu?

1234
00:51:05,889 --> 00:51:07,119
(He gestures at his forehead.)

1235
00:51:07,789 --> 00:51:08,920
Should I try it out?

1236
00:51:11,190 --> 00:51:12,559
(Sit here.)

1237
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:13,730
How much?

1238
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,099
- He didn't tell me how much it was.
- He just went right at it.

1239
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,270
I put sunscreen on my forehead.

1240
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:26,679
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

1241
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:32,820
I'm Buddhist. Is this okay for me to do?

1242
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,020
(The great unity of religion
between Hinduism and Buddhism)

1243
00:51:36,020 --> 00:51:38,520
He's doing that as he recites a prayer.

1244
00:51:38,889 --> 00:51:40,190
- Like a ritual.
- I see.

1245
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,759
(The 3rd eye has been created.)

1246
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:45,860
- Your name?
- Kim Hee Min.

1247
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:49,130
- Father's name?
- Father's name, Jun Ho.

1248
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:51,429
- Mother's name?
- Mother's name, Gyeong Mi.

1249
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,070
(He's taking a census all of a sudden.)

1250
00:51:53,070 --> 00:51:54,400
His family's blessing.

1251
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,009
What are your friends' names?

1252
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:57,840
Friend name.

1253
00:51:58,469 --> 00:52:00,179
My friend...

1254
00:52:00,409 --> 00:52:01,679
Park Tae Jun.

1255
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,409
Lee Mal Nyeon. Joo Ho Min.

1256
00:52:05,509 --> 00:52:06,949
Jun Hyun Moo.

1257
00:52:07,579 --> 00:52:09,590
(Stop saying your friends' names.)

1258
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:11,289
- Why didn't you say my name?
- Why didn't you mention anyone...

1259
00:52:11,289 --> 00:52:12,719
- from the Ki Line?
- Well...

1260
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,289
Because he cut me off too quickly
as I was saying my friends' names.

1261
00:52:15,690 --> 00:52:17,090
I'm really disappointed.

1262
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,230
(He feels awkward.)

1263
00:52:18,289 --> 00:52:21,199
Now repeat after me.

1264
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,360
(Om)

1265
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,400
(Repeat after me.)

1266
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,599
(That's it!)

1267
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:30,409
(Input, output)

1268
00:52:30,409 --> 00:52:32,809
- Your problem.
- Problem.

1269
00:52:32,809 --> 00:52:35,239
- Your problem.
- Problem. My problem.

1270
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,509
- Many problems.
- Body problem.

1271
00:52:37,509 --> 00:52:38,880
Body problem.

1272
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:42,650
(Kian84 is repeating after him
as if he's under a spell.)

1273
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:44,020
(Job hera bahm)

1274
00:52:44,020 --> 00:52:47,619
(What...)

1275
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:49,289
(is this?)

1276
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:51,659
(Maate)

1277
00:52:51,659 --> 00:52:52,730
(Dasi)

1278
00:52:54,429 --> 00:52:55,500
(Surprised)

1279
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,000
What?

1280
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:58,730
(Hello, Kian84.)

1281
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:01,469
(Asmathani)

1282
00:53:01,869 --> 00:53:03,409
This is a bit too long.

1283
00:53:03,409 --> 00:53:05,610
(Follow along even though it's long.)

1284
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,239
(A crowd of spectators has gathered.)

1285
00:53:09,409 --> 00:53:13,079
(You must focus until the end.)

1286
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:16,849
(This guy is interesting.)

1287
00:53:16,889 --> 00:53:19,719
(Saving this moment)

1288
00:53:19,789 --> 00:53:21,289
- Mother, father,
- Mother, father,

1289
00:53:21,289 --> 00:53:23,829
- sister, brother.
- sister, brother.

1290
00:53:25,829 --> 00:53:28,659
It's been verified that he did indeed
pray for the happiness of his...

1291
00:53:28,659 --> 00:53:31,099
- family, brothers, sisters, and friends.
- Yes.

1292
00:53:31,099 --> 00:53:33,099
- He did great.
- Right.

1293
00:53:33,239 --> 00:53:35,440
The man prayed with sincerity.

1294
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:38,639
(The last step of the ritual)

1295
00:53:38,809 --> 00:53:41,239
- Money.
- Money?

1296
00:53:41,239 --> 00:53:42,780
- What?
- How much?

1297
00:53:42,949 --> 00:53:45,480
- It'll be 5,000 rupees?
- It's 5,000 rupees?

1298
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:48,650
- He asked for 5,000 rupees?
- How much is that?

1299
00:53:48,650 --> 00:53:50,849
That's too expensive.

1300
00:53:50,849 --> 00:53:52,989
He can't just pay that much money.
He should bargain with him.

1301
00:53:55,489 --> 00:53:57,860
(He's going through his wallet.)

1302
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:01,860
- Here's 500 rupees.
- Gosh.

1303
00:54:02,130 --> 00:54:03,400
That's a tenth of what he asked for.

1304
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:07,139
(Why 500 rupees?)

1305
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:11,909
(I asked for 5,000 rupees.)

1306
00:54:12,170 --> 00:54:14,309
(Well then...)

1307
00:54:14,309 --> 00:54:15,780
- One.
- What?

1308
00:54:16,009 --> 00:54:17,250
It's 1,000 rupees?

1309
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:20,780
So that's what happened.

1310
00:54:21,679 --> 00:54:24,090
Okay.

1311
00:54:24,090 --> 00:54:25,250
- He was flustered.
- It's 1,000 rupees.

1312
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,059
But he didn't get upset.

1313
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:28,090
(Same money, different ideas)

1314
00:54:28,090 --> 00:54:29,159
This is 1,000 rupees.

1315
00:54:29,159 --> 00:54:31,389
(He paid him 1,000 rupees for the prayer.)

1316
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:34,300
(Thank you.)

1317
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:39,030
- Namaste.
- Yes.

1318
00:54:39,030 --> 00:54:40,170
Namaste.

1319
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:44,469
From what I heard, at first,

1320
00:54:45,340 --> 00:54:47,139
he asked for 500 rupees.

1321
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,550
But all of a sudden,
he asked for 1,000 rupees.

1322
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:52,710
So I gave him about 16 dollars...

1323
00:54:52,949 --> 00:54:54,480
as his commission.

1324
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,119
I blasphemously thought about
bargaining with him.

1325
00:54:57,349 --> 00:54:59,659
From what we know,
he asked for 5,000 rupees.

1326
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:00,789
He asked for 5,000 rupees?

1327
00:55:00,789 --> 00:55:03,730
I unintentionally lowered the price
because I don't understand English.

1328
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:05,889
Because I heard what he said as "500."

1329
00:55:05,889 --> 00:55:07,360
So when I gave him the 500 rupees,

1330
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,699
he said, "No."

1331
00:55:08,699 --> 00:55:11,000
I now realize that I had bargained.

1332
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,199
(He bargained without meaning to.)

1333
00:55:12,270 --> 00:55:14,840
I didn't understand what he said,
so it's not blasphemous.

1334
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,739
Being too good at English
might not be a good thing.

1335
00:55:17,739 --> 00:55:19,710
I heard bargaining is the norm in India,

1336
00:55:19,710 --> 00:55:21,679
so you should just ask for a bold price.

1337
00:55:21,679 --> 00:55:24,610
- Really?
- It's part of their culture.

1338
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:28,219
The man probably thought
you're a master of negotiation.

1339
00:55:28,219 --> 00:55:29,849
(Maybe I am a master.)

1340
00:55:30,090 --> 00:55:32,650
(Excuse me.)

1341
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:33,690
Money?

1342
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,059
No. Sorry.

1343
00:55:37,329 --> 00:55:38,460
(He's attacking Kian84 with a prayer.)

1344
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:39,530
Everyone is...

1345
00:55:39,699 --> 00:55:40,730
Why are you...

1346
00:55:40,730 --> 00:55:42,199
(Laughter)

1347
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:44,199
I already received a blessing.

1348
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:45,400
(Give me money too.)

1349
00:55:45,400 --> 00:55:49,170
He's blessing me too quickly.

1350
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:50,340
Gosh, sir.

1351
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,440
I'm sorry.

1352
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:54,409
(Blabbering)

1353
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,480
Namaste, sir. Boat, sir?

1354
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:58,349
- Boat?
- Yes, boat.

1355
00:55:58,409 --> 00:56:00,719
- Boat? Your boat?
- Yes.

1356
00:56:00,719 --> 00:56:02,250
(He doesn't plan on getting on a boat.)

1357
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,489
Very cheap, sir.

1358
00:56:03,489 --> 00:56:05,949
Wait.

1359
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,190
(He tries to send him away nicely.)

1360
00:56:09,259 --> 00:56:10,389
Very cheap.

1361
00:56:11,059 --> 00:56:13,300
(He keeps following Kian84.)

1362
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:16,329
I'll be back.

1363
00:56:16,699 --> 00:56:18,170
- Namaste.
- I will be back.

1364
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:22,139
- Namaste.
- Hello. Namaste.

1365
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:23,409
Namaste. Korea.

1366
00:56:23,409 --> 00:56:24,940
- Yes. My boat is here.
- Yes.

1367
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,110
- Boat?
- Yes.

1368
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,679
(Boatman 1, Boatman 2)

1369
00:56:27,679 --> 00:56:28,679
Boat?

1370
00:56:28,679 --> 00:56:30,550
Very cheap, sir. Just 1,000 rupees.

1371
00:56:30,550 --> 00:56:32,579
- It's 1,000 rupees?
- It's a very long ride.

1372
00:56:32,909 --> 00:56:34,579
Excuse me.

1373
00:56:35,179 --> 00:56:36,820
- It's 1,000 rupees.
- My boat.

1374
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,789
It's cheap.

1375
00:56:38,789 --> 00:56:40,860
- "It's cheap."
- "It's cheap."

1376
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:41,989
How much?

1377
00:56:41,989 --> 00:56:44,190
- Very cheap. It's cheap.
- It's cheap?

1378
00:56:44,489 --> 00:56:45,960
- "It's cheap."
- He won't tell him...

1379
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,759
- the price.
- Right. He won't tell him.

1380
00:56:47,759 --> 00:56:49,730
- That's his sales strategy.
- "It's cheap."

1381
00:56:49,829 --> 00:56:51,300
Okay. I know.

1382
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,500
"It's cheap." How much?

1383
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,840
- It's 500 rupees.
- Okay.

1384
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:58,369
(He decided to get on the boat
without really wanting to.)

1385
00:56:58,539 --> 00:57:00,809
You're getting on a water taxi.

1386
00:57:00,909 --> 00:57:02,880
The boats show you around too.

1387
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,909
It takes you on a tour.

1388
00:57:05,079 --> 00:57:07,250
- Your boat?
- Yes. Rowing boat.

1389
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,119
- Okay.
- Very hard working. Sit here.

1390
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,059
- Look here. There's a life vest too.
- Okay.

1391
00:57:16,659 --> 00:57:18,429
- You Hindu?
- Yes, Hindu.

1392
00:57:18,429 --> 00:57:19,489
- Hindu.
- Yes.

1393
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:21,230
- I'm Buddha.
- You're Buddha?

1394
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,030
(I'm Buddha.)

1395
00:57:24,030 --> 00:57:26,369
(His poor English turned
the history of religion upside down.)

1396
00:57:26,369 --> 00:57:28,570
- I wonder what he thought of that.
- I'm Buddhist.

1397
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:29,809
"I'm Buddha."

1398
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,639
- Buddha.
- Namaste, Buddha.

1399
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:33,980
He went along with it.

1400
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:37,409
(Together with today's passenger, Buddha,)

1401
00:57:37,849 --> 00:57:39,050
Let's go.

1402
00:57:39,050 --> 00:57:41,579
(let's go!)

1403
00:57:45,349 --> 00:57:48,190
(Since he came out for a walk anyway,)

1404
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:51,559
(let's begin a tour of the Ganges.)

1405
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:55,829
Look here. Its name, "Munshi Ghat."
Here, look.

1406
00:57:56,369 --> 00:57:58,500
- Munshi Ghat.
- Munshi Hart?

1407
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,539
No, no. Munshi Ghat.

1408
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,869
- Ghat. Ghat.
- Ghat? What mean?

1409
00:58:02,869 --> 00:58:04,009
- Ghat.
- Ghat?

1410
00:58:04,009 --> 00:58:05,110
Yes.

1411
00:58:05,739 --> 00:58:10,349
"Ghat" refers to a staircase or slope
that touches a river.

1412
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:13,320
It was created so that
those who visit Varanasi...

1413
00:58:13,320 --> 00:58:16,920
for religious reasons
can get to the riverside more easily.

1414
00:58:16,920 --> 00:58:18,119
(It was created so that religious people
can get to the Ganges more easily.)

1415
00:58:19,190 --> 00:58:21,320
(From a place where people pray
for the blessing of their lives)

1416
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,429
(and take care of
their minds and bodies...)

1417
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:27,030
- The Burning Ghat.
- Gosh.

1418
00:58:27,759 --> 00:58:29,000
They take care of dead bodies like that.

1419
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:30,869
(to the crematory where bodies are burned
as people pray for their eternal rest.)

1420
00:58:31,869 --> 00:58:35,500
(There are a total of 84 ghats.)

1421
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,110
- There are 84 ghats.
- There are 84?

1422
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:39,940
- Ghats. This palace.
- Right. They both have 84.

1423
00:58:39,940 --> 00:58:42,280
- You're right.
- There are 84 ghats.

1424
00:58:42,739 --> 00:58:44,780
- What's your name?
- My name is Vicky.

1425
00:58:44,780 --> 00:58:46,309
- Vicky.
- Yes.

1426
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:48,820
Your name?

1427
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:50,119
Your name, "Kim."

1428
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:51,449
- Kim?
- Kim.

1429
00:58:52,449 --> 00:58:55,090
My age is 40.

1430
00:58:55,259 --> 00:58:56,429
- Forty?
- Forty.

1431
00:58:56,829 --> 00:59:00,099
I was born in the year 1990.

1432
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,099
You were born in 1990?

1433
00:59:02,099 --> 00:59:03,800
- You were born in the 90s?
- Yes.

1434
00:59:04,070 --> 00:59:05,770
- You're younger than me.
- Yes.

1435
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:07,699
(Older brother, younger brother)

1436
00:59:07,699 --> 00:59:08,940
- You're younger than me.
- Yes.

1437
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:11,039
I liked that guy.

1438
00:59:11,170 --> 00:59:14,009
- Is your hometown Varanasi?
- You made a friend.

1439
00:59:14,009 --> 00:59:15,210
Yes. Varanasi.

1440
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,650
All your life?

1441
00:59:16,650 --> 00:59:18,550
For 500 years.

1442
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:19,820
- For 500 years?
- Yes.

1443
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:24,150
My mother, father, grandmother,
grandfather, and great-grandfather.

1444
00:59:24,150 --> 00:59:26,559
- Five generations?
- Yes.

1445
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:28,389
- Are you from Korea?
- Yes. Korea.

1446
00:59:28,889 --> 00:59:30,829
My hometown is...

1447
00:59:30,829 --> 00:59:31,960
Do you know Yeoju?

1448
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:33,460
- Yeoju?
- Yeoju.

1449
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:36,530
Varanasi is popular for the Ganges.

1450
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:37,530
The Ganges.

1451
00:59:37,530 --> 00:59:39,170
Yeoju is popular...

1452
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,170
- for its rice.
- Rice.

1453
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:42,599
(I see!)

1454
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:44,539
- It's amazing how they can communicate.
- Rice.

1455
00:59:45,570 --> 00:59:47,380
(Looking at the other side of the ghat)

1456
00:59:47,380 --> 00:59:49,280
- This here is sand.
- Yes.

1457
00:59:49,679 --> 00:59:50,710
Sand.

1458
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,250
- Really?
- Sand.

1459
00:59:52,250 --> 00:59:53,250
Sand?

1460
00:59:53,619 --> 00:59:55,119
How is your Korean so good?

1461
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:56,150
Sand.

1462
00:59:56,349 --> 00:59:58,489
I think I saw you on "Non Summit."

1463
00:59:58,849 --> 00:59:59,889
Sand.

1464
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:02,020
(The other side of the river
looks like a beach.)

1465
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:04,289
It's a sandy beach.

1466
01:00:04,289 --> 01:00:06,059
- He can speak Korean.
- He knows many Korean words.

1467
01:00:06,159 --> 01:00:07,960
- A sandy beach?
- Listen.

1468
01:00:07,960 --> 01:00:09,199
The water is very high...

1469
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,199
(Just listen to me.)

1470
01:00:10,199 --> 01:00:12,300
The water is very high
in August and September.

1471
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:13,639
"Agusi?"

1472
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:14,699
- No.
- "Agusi."

1473
01:00:14,699 --> 01:00:16,739
August and September.

1474
01:00:16,869 --> 01:00:18,570
- "Agast?"
- August.

1475
01:00:18,570 --> 01:00:21,880
August and September.
For two months, the water is very high.

1476
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,880
Look here.

1477
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,509
- It gets so high.
- It will sink like that.

1478
01:00:24,509 --> 01:00:25,650
- There will be no ghat.
- Very high.

1479
01:00:25,650 --> 01:00:28,520
All ghats here.

1480
01:00:28,679 --> 01:00:29,989
I don't understand.

1481
01:00:29,989 --> 01:00:31,889
- Why?
- I don't understand.

1482
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,460
I don't understand.
I don't know what you mean.

1483
01:00:35,059 --> 01:00:39,159
(He doesn't care
if he understands or not.)

1484
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,599
(He keeps telling him information.)

1485
01:00:44,869 --> 01:00:46,070
Okay.

1486
01:00:46,599 --> 01:00:48,000
Very dangerous, man.

1487
01:00:48,239 --> 01:00:51,309
He's also a little talkative.

1488
01:00:52,369 --> 01:00:54,610
(A motorboat approaches them
at that moment.)

1489
01:00:55,179 --> 01:00:56,710
Can you help me here?

1490
01:00:57,050 --> 01:00:58,150
- Yes.
- Okay?

1491
01:00:58,150 --> 01:00:59,150
Okay.

1492
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,650
(It's hard to row throughout the journey.)

1493
01:01:03,289 --> 01:01:05,789
The boatmen help each other.

1494
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,559
(Thanks to that,
boatman Bicky has nothing to do.)

1495
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:15,059
(He suddenly stands up.)

1496
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:16,259
Look, sir.

1497
01:01:17,099 --> 01:01:18,130
Look here.

1498
01:01:19,429 --> 01:01:22,570
(He starts explaining about the city
as he doesn't have to row.)

1499
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:24,809
They have many cars.

1500
01:01:24,809 --> 01:01:26,110
King Raja Palace.

1501
01:01:26,409 --> 01:01:28,239
- Look here.
- Yes.

1502
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:30,679
It's a famous house.

1503
01:01:30,679 --> 01:01:33,079
He found a good guide.

1504
01:01:33,079 --> 01:01:34,079
(He keeps telling him things
without taking a rest like a tutor.)

1505
01:01:34,579 --> 01:01:37,289
(It feels familiar.)

1506
01:01:37,889 --> 01:01:40,960
He's kind of like Porfi.

1507
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,259
He's talkative too.

1508
01:01:43,289 --> 01:01:44,530
They kind of look alike too.

1509
01:01:44,860 --> 01:01:46,429
Very wide and long.

1510
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,530
- Okay.
- A goddess named...

1511
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,670
Bicky, you talk a lot.

1512
01:01:51,900 --> 01:01:53,969
- You're talking.
- Yes, I'm talking.

1513
01:01:53,969 --> 01:01:55,099
You talk a lot.

1514
01:01:55,199 --> 01:01:56,840
(Laughing)

1515
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:01,280
Did you get your teeth laminated?

1516
01:02:02,009 --> 01:02:03,210
(Perfectly aligned)

1517
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,110
I had nothing to say.

1518
01:02:05,110 --> 01:02:07,150
- I had nothing to say.
- Why would you say that?

1519
01:02:07,150 --> 01:02:08,920
- His teeth are perfectly aligned.
- Did you get your teeth laminated?

1520
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,250
- He has healthy teeth.
- Did you get your teeth laminated?

1521
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:12,289
No lamination. I had them originally.

1522
01:02:12,289 --> 01:02:13,389
- Originally?
- Yes.

1523
01:02:13,389 --> 01:02:14,690
Gosh, you...

1524
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:16,590
I got them laminated.

1525
01:02:16,590 --> 01:02:18,289
- Laminated?
- Laminated.

1526
01:02:18,289 --> 01:02:19,860
- In Gangnam.
- In Gangnam?

1527
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:20,960
Gangnam.

1528
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:23,630
My teeth...

1529
01:02:24,300 --> 01:02:25,869
were made in Gangnam.

1530
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,070
- Do you know Gangnam?
- Gangnam.

1531
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,509
It's a Korean city.

1532
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:31,940
(Okay!)

1533
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,940
The god of teeth made these for me.

1534
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,009
They talked about various things.
They even talked about teeth.

1535
01:02:39,150 --> 01:02:40,219
Look here.

1536
01:02:40,679 --> 01:02:41,949
It's a water filter.

1537
01:02:42,119 --> 01:02:43,590
- A water filter.
- Yes.

1538
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,920
In the morning, local people come here...

1539
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,059
and pray to Mother Ganga.

1540
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,590
Respect. Do as the deity wills.

1541
01:02:53,929 --> 01:02:54,960
Yes.

1542
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:57,630
- Do as the deity wills.
- Hello.

1543
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,070
- Do as the deity wills.
- As the deity wills.

1544
01:03:01,199 --> 01:03:04,270
(It's a Hindu religious ritual
to bathe in the Ganges...)

1545
01:03:04,940 --> 01:03:07,309
(to wash away sins.)

1546
01:03:07,309 --> 01:03:08,639
They wash away their sins every day.

1547
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,880
The deity is a promise keeper.

1548
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:15,449
As the deity wills.

1549
01:03:15,449 --> 01:03:16,889
Kim Joon Ho.

1550
01:03:17,090 --> 01:03:20,190
- As the deity wills.
- Kim Joon Ho.

1551
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:22,420
You first. Second time.

1552
01:03:22,420 --> 01:03:23,960
Drink the water here.

1553
01:03:24,829 --> 01:03:27,900
(Drinking the river water)

1554
01:03:28,460 --> 01:03:29,500
What?

1555
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,699
(The Holy Ganges)

1556
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:35,300
(From the beginning of the world
to the present time,)

1557
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:37,809
(it's been flowing while embracing
the life of Indians...)

1558
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:40,340
(as a generous mother river.)

1559
01:03:40,679 --> 01:03:41,679
What?

1560
01:03:41,780 --> 01:03:42,780
Try it.

1561
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:43,980
(He reaches out to the river
without hesitation.)

1562
01:03:49,949 --> 01:03:53,020
(To become one with India,)

1563
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:55,759
(he drinks it.)

1564
01:03:59,190 --> 01:04:00,230
Did he drink it?

1565
01:04:00,230 --> 01:04:02,900
(He drank it for real!)

1566
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,270
- Bicky must've been touched.
- Yes.

1567
01:04:05,270 --> 01:04:07,340
Because it's holy water.

1568
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,409
Very clean water. No dirty water.

1569
01:04:10,409 --> 01:04:11,570
- Clean?
- Yes.

1570
01:04:11,570 --> 01:04:13,679
- No dirty water.
- It's a bit yellow.

1571
01:04:13,679 --> 01:04:15,980
No dirty water. Clean water.

1572
01:04:15,980 --> 01:04:17,009
Okay.

1573
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,409
- Okay.
- Okay.

1574
01:04:19,409 --> 01:04:20,719
The water tastes good.

1575
01:04:22,119 --> 01:04:23,949
(He won't forget the taste.)

1576
01:04:24,489 --> 01:04:26,520
Yes. Life and death are the same.

1577
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:30,360
- No problem.
- Life and death are the same.

1578
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,360
Yes.

1579
01:04:31,860 --> 01:04:32,860
Well...

1580
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:35,099
Bicky said,

1581
01:04:35,099 --> 01:04:37,329
"This is the mother river."

1582
01:04:37,329 --> 01:04:38,770
Then he drank it.

1583
01:04:39,570 --> 01:04:41,300
And I couldn't say...

1584
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,110
I couldn't say no to him.

1585
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:45,809
So I drank it.

1586
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:48,940
It's holy water.

1587
01:04:50,210 --> 01:04:54,079
I hope it washes away my sins inside.

1588
01:04:54,949 --> 01:04:57,320
For 8 dollars,
you got all the information...

1589
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,520
- and got a boat ride.
- Right. He kept you company.

1590
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:01,219
It's a good deal.

1591
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,489
A crematorium.

1592
01:05:04,489 --> 01:05:06,429
The crematorium? Go there at 4 p.m.

1593
01:05:06,429 --> 01:05:08,599
- At 4 p.m.?
- Yes.

1594
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:10,630
- They cremate a lot at 4 p.m.
- At 4 p.m.

1595
01:05:10,630 --> 01:05:11,630
Okay.

1596
01:05:11,630 --> 01:05:14,039
There are people
living in other areas in India, right?

1597
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:16,199
Even those people want to be cremated...

1598
01:05:16,199 --> 01:05:18,610
- at the Ganges.
- Really?

1599
01:05:18,610 --> 01:05:21,340
I heard they think
it's a blessing and an honor.

1600
01:05:21,340 --> 01:05:24,210
So they would leave in the morning...

1601
01:05:24,210 --> 01:05:26,380
and get to the Ganges around 4 p.m.

1602
01:05:26,380 --> 01:05:28,719
That's why there are a lot of cremations
around that hour.

1603
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,289
They depart in the morning.

1604
01:05:30,289 --> 01:05:33,119
- It takes time to travel.
- They come from all over the country.

1605
01:05:33,119 --> 01:05:35,460
- Yes.
- So they arrive around that time.

1606
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:36,929
- Okay?
- Okay.

1607
01:05:37,530 --> 01:05:40,030
(He decided to go to the crematorium
at 4 p.m.)

1608
01:05:40,460 --> 01:05:44,400
Look here. There are orange-colored
umbrellas and flags here.

1609
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,429
Yes.

1610
01:05:45,429 --> 01:05:48,869
From 6:30 p.m. to 7 p.m.,
they do the Ganga puja ceremony.

1611
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:51,369
- Ganga buja?
- Yes. Ganga puja.

1612
01:05:51,369 --> 01:05:53,469
("Buja" that means "rich" in Korean?)

1613
01:05:53,469 --> 01:05:56,949
Are people with orange umbrellas rich men?

1614
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:57,980
No.

1615
01:05:57,980 --> 01:05:59,909
It's a ceremony place. Ganga puja.

1616
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:02,320
Did he say the Korean word "buja?"

1617
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:04,190
It's a Ganga puja ceremony.

1618
01:06:04,590 --> 01:06:07,989
- He used Korean words sometimes.
- At seven o'clock in the evening.

1619
01:06:08,090 --> 01:06:09,360
- So I thought he said "buja" in Korean.
- Ganga puja.

1620
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:11,489
- Rich people live by the river in Korea.
- A ceremony place.

1621
01:06:11,489 --> 01:06:12,730
Ganga puja.

1622
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:14,360
So what's "puja?"

1623
01:06:15,059 --> 01:06:16,460
(Searching)

1624
01:06:17,030 --> 01:06:19,230
- So "puja" means...
- Puja.

1625
01:06:19,230 --> 01:06:20,369
Karma.

1626
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:23,239
- "Arti puja..."
- Arti puja.

1627
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:25,809
"is a Hindu ritual."

1628
01:06:26,309 --> 01:06:32,050
(Arti puja means a prayer with light.)

1629
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:33,650
(It's a Hindu ritual
for the goddess of the Ganges...)

1630
01:06:33,650 --> 01:06:34,949
(performed every morning and night.)

1631
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,219
That's amazing.

1632
01:06:37,349 --> 01:06:38,949
What time does arti puja take place?

1633
01:06:39,119 --> 01:06:40,590
- Six.
- Six?

1634
01:06:40,590 --> 01:06:41,619
(It's 6:30 p.m.)

1635
01:06:41,619 --> 01:06:42,920
- Thirty.
- Thirty?

1636
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,389
- Yes.
- At 6:30 p.m.

1637
01:06:44,389 --> 01:06:45,429
The evening time.

1638
01:06:45,429 --> 01:06:46,460
- Here?
- Yes.

1639
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,000
- Arti puja.
- The same place.

1640
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,059
- The same place.
- Yes.

1641
01:06:49,059 --> 01:06:51,000
- The main ghat.
- I should come later.

1642
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:52,300
I'll be here waiting.

1643
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,239
- I'll come here with the boat.
- Okay.

1644
01:06:54,239 --> 01:06:56,039
- Sit here.
- Okay.

1645
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:57,739
And see the ceremony on the boat.

1646
01:06:57,739 --> 01:06:58,869
Okay. I understand.

1647
01:06:58,869 --> 01:06:59,940
Understand?

1648
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:01,309
- We're friends.
- Friends.

1649
01:07:01,309 --> 01:07:02,940
- We're friends.
- Friends.

1650
01:07:03,110 --> 01:07:05,150
I made plans for the day...

1651
01:07:05,550 --> 01:07:07,550
with Bicky.

1652
01:07:08,619 --> 01:07:10,119
Six o'clock here.

1653
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:11,389
- Promise to meet me here.
- Yes.

1654
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:12,619
- Six at that place?
- Yes.

1655
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:13,920
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay?

1656
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:16,159
Let's meet at the same place.

1657
01:07:16,759 --> 01:07:18,159
- Bye.
- Bye.

1658
01:07:18,159 --> 01:07:19,329
- Okay?
- Okay.

1659
01:07:19,329 --> 01:07:21,329
(He understood somehow
and decided to meet him later.)

1660
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,230
I met Ricky, Porfi in India.

1661
01:07:24,230 --> 01:07:26,270
- He told me some information.
- He keeps getting his name wrong.

1662
01:07:26,270 --> 01:07:27,369
He said Ricky or Wicky.

1663
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:30,509
I will come back at 4 p.m.
to see the cremation.

1664
01:07:30,509 --> 01:07:32,440
I heard puja is like a religious ceremony.

1665
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,909
I'm going to see it.

1666
01:07:34,610 --> 01:07:36,840
- He has a lot of time left.
- He got seven hours.

1667
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:41,349
(Happy)

1668
01:07:43,889 --> 01:07:45,789
(The holy mother river)

1669
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:48,759
(The beliefs embraced
by the people of India...)

1670
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:51,590
(will shower blessings upon everyone.)

1671
01:07:52,960 --> 01:07:55,829
(Even swimming is allowed
in the benevolent river.)

1672
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,039
(He suddenly takes off his shoes...)

1673
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:02,869
(and socks.)

1674
01:08:03,170 --> 01:08:04,840
(Getting up)

1675
01:08:08,139 --> 01:08:11,380
(He stuffs his belongings in the shoes.)

1676
01:08:12,949 --> 01:08:14,320
He covered them with the cap at least.

1677
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,520
(Covered with the cap)

1678
01:08:17,150 --> 01:08:18,620
(Greetings to you, Mother.)

1679
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,690
Let's go.

1680
01:08:25,259 --> 01:08:28,559
(Falling)

1681
01:08:29,360 --> 01:08:31,030
I made a mistake.

1682
01:08:31,499 --> 01:08:33,070
- Did you not get hurt?
- Isn't it low?

1683
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:35,799
- Did you not get hurt?
- I thought it would be deep.

1684
01:08:35,799 --> 01:08:38,709
As soon as I dived, I felt the stair.

1685
01:08:39,740 --> 01:08:41,139
My feet touched it.

1686
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:44,280
- Did you not get hurt?
- I twisted my ankle.

1687
01:08:45,179 --> 01:08:46,450
- Oh, my gosh.
- My gosh.

1688
01:08:46,450 --> 01:08:47,719
(He jumped in vertically.)

1689
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,580
It's a stone.

1690
01:08:50,249 --> 01:08:51,889
(He's a funny guy.)

1691
01:08:52,589 --> 01:08:54,190
(Going underwater)

1692
01:08:55,389 --> 01:08:57,629
(Forgetting about the painful memory
for a moment,)

1693
01:08:59,559 --> 01:09:04,929
(he swims by accident.)

1694
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:06,299
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

1695
01:09:07,169 --> 01:09:08,639
(Feeling the Amazon River
with his entire body)

1696
01:09:08,639 --> 01:09:10,469
He swam in the Amazon.

1697
01:09:10,469 --> 01:09:13,509
And he swam in the Ganges too.
Not many people have done it.

1698
01:09:13,509 --> 01:09:14,709
- Yes.
- Right.

1699
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:19,980
(He's swimming while comfortably floating
on his back as if he's home.)

1700
01:09:21,749 --> 01:09:24,990
Many people on YouTube were talking
about India versus Kian84.

1701
01:09:25,849 --> 01:09:26,889
About which would win.

1702
01:09:26,889 --> 01:09:27,919
(Many people are curious.)

1703
01:09:27,959 --> 01:09:30,190
I'm not here to fight against India.

1704
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:31,490
Why "versus?"

1705
01:09:31,490 --> 01:09:32,730
It's not "versus."

1706
01:09:33,559 --> 01:09:34,730
We're becoming one.

1707
01:09:34,730 --> 01:09:39,499
(I'm becoming one with India.)

1708
01:09:43,099 --> 01:09:45,410
India and I are the same.

1709
01:09:45,410 --> 01:09:48,410
(India and I are the same.)

1710
01:09:50,009 --> 01:09:52,879
(A special moment
when he became one with the river)

1711
01:09:55,650 --> 01:09:56,650
(Tapping)

1712
01:09:58,219 --> 01:09:59,990
- Let's swim together.
- Together?

1713
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,219
- Swimming?
- Yes.

1714
01:10:01,219 --> 01:10:03,490
- I guess only extroverts live in India.
- Right.

1715
01:10:03,490 --> 01:10:06,030
- They always talk to you first.
- They're quite extroverted.

1716
01:10:06,030 --> 01:10:07,530
- They're like friends.
- They're all kind...

1717
01:10:07,530 --> 01:10:09,429
- to tourists.
- They always smile and are kind.

1718
01:10:09,429 --> 01:10:10,429
(They're kind to foreigners
without discriminating against them.)

1719
01:10:10,429 --> 01:10:12,499
(The swimming event
with young Indian guys)

1720
01:10:13,070 --> 01:10:16,400
(The one who gets there first wins.)

1721
01:10:16,469 --> 01:10:17,540
Okay. Start.

1722
01:10:17,540 --> 01:10:18,770
Three, two, one, go.

1723
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:22,580
He's good.

1724
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,249
- He can't lose.
- As expected.

1725
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:26,009
(As soon as they began,
Kian84 takes the lead!)

1726
01:10:26,679 --> 01:10:29,020
(The competition ended in an instant.)

1727
01:10:30,219 --> 01:10:31,990
I won.

1728
01:10:32,389 --> 01:10:34,059
- You're very nice.
- My win.

1729
01:10:34,419 --> 01:10:36,990
(The Indian guys are bright
even when they lose.)

1730
01:10:37,490 --> 01:10:39,089
- Where are you from?
- Korea.

1731
01:10:39,889 --> 01:10:41,759
I see cameras.

1732
01:10:41,759 --> 01:10:44,230
It's for a Korean TV show.

1733
01:10:44,230 --> 01:10:45,929
- A Korean TV show.
- Which channel?

1734
01:10:45,929 --> 01:10:48,339
Eleven. Do you know MBC?

1735
01:10:48,339 --> 01:10:49,799
- MBC, eleven?
- Yes.

1736
01:10:50,339 --> 01:10:53,669
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

1737
01:10:53,669 --> 01:10:54,879
Eleven.

1738
01:10:54,879 --> 01:10:57,879
Many people would watch MBC now.

1739
01:10:58,309 --> 01:11:00,349
"Your good friend."

1740
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,150
It's their slogan.

1741
01:11:02,150 --> 01:11:03,820
- Like a show?
- Yes.

1742
01:11:04,249 --> 01:11:06,749
- He promoted MBC in India like that.
- See you.

1743
01:11:07,049 --> 01:11:09,459
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you. See you.

1744
01:11:09,759 --> 01:11:11,160
Okay.

1745
01:11:11,230 --> 01:11:13,259
(It was nice to meet you, friend.)

1746
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:14,999
I feel holy.

1747
01:11:14,999 --> 01:11:17,929
(He met good people in the holy river.)

1748
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:22,240
I feel holy energy inside.

1749
01:11:24,209 --> 01:11:26,639
(Wet)

1750
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:29,309
Where is he going now?

1751
01:11:29,309 --> 01:11:31,749
(He's walking
like a rat drenched in rain.)

1752
01:11:32,749 --> 01:11:33,879
(Growling)

1753
01:11:34,150 --> 01:11:35,780
You get hungry after swimming.

1754
01:11:36,879 --> 01:11:37,990
Let's eat.

1755
01:11:37,990 --> 01:11:41,160
(Let's eat!)

1756
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:44,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

1757
01:11:44,190 --> 01:11:46,259
(Walking toward the downtown area
to find food)

1758
01:11:46,259 --> 01:11:47,660
I'm sorry.

1759
01:11:52,469 --> 01:11:54,969
(I got fruits.)

1760
01:11:56,870 --> 01:11:59,740
Let's see what they have on the street.

1761
01:12:00,169 --> 01:12:02,309
India is known for its street food.

1762
01:12:02,309 --> 01:12:04,049
(India is known for its street food.)

1763
01:12:06,709 --> 01:12:08,080
- Gosh.
- What's that?

1764
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,419
It looks good.

1765
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:14,559
(Everything about spices)

1766
01:12:16,389 --> 01:12:19,330
(It's a paradise of flavors
you can't imagine.)

1767
01:12:20,759 --> 01:12:22,999
(Approaching)

1768
01:12:24,070 --> 01:12:27,469
(The open kitchen made him stop.)

1769
01:12:27,599 --> 01:12:29,070
This one. How much is it?

1770
01:12:29,070 --> 01:12:30,669
It's 64 cents.

1771
01:12:30,669 --> 01:12:32,270
It's 64 cents? Give me one.

1772
01:12:33,309 --> 01:12:35,440
I was curious about the street food.

1773
01:12:36,509 --> 01:12:37,580
It's very cheap.

1774
01:12:37,580 --> 01:12:39,780
(The street food he's going to taste
for the first time)

1775
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:42,049
That is called dosa.

1776
01:12:42,049 --> 01:12:43,919
It's one of the most popular
street food in India...

1777
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:46,249
made from a batter of rice and beans.

1778
01:12:46,249 --> 01:12:47,490
(Dosa is made
from a batter of rice and beans.)

1779
01:12:54,929 --> 01:12:56,059
(As it's street food,
it's cooked quickly.)

1780
01:12:56,059 --> 01:12:57,999
It's 64 cents.

1781
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,730
(Dosa: About 64 cents)

1782
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:00,839
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1783
01:13:01,200 --> 01:13:02,870
(Looking around)

1784
01:13:04,009 --> 01:13:06,870
(He goes to a corner to find a nice spot.)

1785
01:13:07,379 --> 01:13:08,709
Can I eat here?

1786
01:13:09,679 --> 01:13:11,709
(Glancing)

1787
01:13:11,950 --> 01:13:13,679
Sit down.

1788
01:13:13,679 --> 01:13:14,980
(Command)

1789
01:13:15,280 --> 01:13:17,389
It's pretty much like a table here.

1790
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:20,889
(It seems the locals find it funny.)

1791
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:23,219
(Coming close)

1792
01:13:25,790 --> 01:13:28,299
Sit down.

1793
01:13:28,299 --> 01:13:30,160
Nice. He was natural with the locals.

1794
01:13:31,499 --> 01:13:33,999
(He looks like a local...)

1795
01:13:33,999 --> 01:13:36,870
(more than the local.)

1796
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:39,009
(Sniffing)

1797
01:13:39,509 --> 01:13:41,639
It kind of smells like the pancake...

1798
01:13:41,639 --> 01:13:43,309
I had during holidays.

1799
01:13:47,450 --> 01:13:50,620
(What's that?)

1800
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,249
What was the sound?

1801
01:13:52,950 --> 01:13:54,759
I was checking if it was hot or not.

1802
01:13:56,790 --> 01:13:59,360
(He takes a bite after checking
with his laminated teeth.)

1803
01:13:59,959 --> 01:14:02,030
(Savoring)

1804
01:14:02,599 --> 01:14:03,660
Peace.

1805
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:05,270
Delicious.

1806
01:14:05,629 --> 01:14:07,440
It looks good.

1807
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:09,400
- Mungbean curry.
- Mungbean curry?

1808
01:14:09,400 --> 01:14:10,540
Mungbean curry.

1809
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:16,139
You enjoyed it so much.

1810
01:14:16,139 --> 01:14:18,410
(He's gobbling like crazy.
It seems it suits his palate.)

1811
01:14:20,049 --> 01:14:22,719
(At that moment)

1812
01:14:23,379 --> 01:14:24,520
(A local sits next to Kian84.)

1813
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:25,790
They sat together.

1814
01:14:26,889 --> 01:14:28,160
What's your name?

1815
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:29,959
"What's your name?"

1816
01:14:30,120 --> 01:14:31,889
- Dose.
- Dose?

1817
01:14:31,889 --> 01:14:34,929
- Masal Dose.
- Masal Dose?

1818
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:37,999
It seems the spot next to Kian84
is popular.

1819
01:14:38,129 --> 01:14:39,129
Right.

1820
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:43,270
(He was lonely while eating on the floor
in Korea.)

1821
01:14:44,410 --> 01:14:47,070
(Kian84 who got used to the city
perfectly blends in.)

1822
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:48,780
- Right. He found the place he belongs to.
- I know.

1823
01:14:53,009 --> 01:14:54,650
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

1824
01:14:55,349 --> 01:14:57,280
What?

1825
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,849
Everyone shakes their heads like this.

1826
01:14:59,589 --> 01:15:01,990
Nodding doesn't mean "yes" there.

1827
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:04,059
- This is.
- They shake their heads.

1828
01:15:04,059 --> 01:15:05,990
I saw it in the movies a lot.

1829
01:15:05,990 --> 01:15:07,360
This means "yes."

1830
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:08,530
- Shake your head just a few times.
- Is that it?

1831
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:09,860
So...

1832
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:12,669
That's not it.

1833
01:15:12,669 --> 01:15:15,099
He looks like the toy dogs in cars...

1834
01:15:15,099 --> 01:15:17,839
- that shake their heads like this.
- The one that shakes its head.

1835
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:19,809
Peace.

1836
01:15:20,139 --> 01:15:22,179
(The dog plushie acts cute.)

1837
01:15:22,639 --> 01:15:23,780
Enjoy your food.

1838
01:15:23,780 --> 01:15:25,610
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1839
01:15:25,610 --> 01:15:27,249
(Okay)

1840
01:15:27,879 --> 01:15:30,179
(He's looking for the next food.)

1841
01:15:33,349 --> 01:15:37,190
(He's staring at one place only.)

1842
01:15:38,059 --> 01:15:39,129
What's this?

1843
01:15:40,629 --> 01:15:44,629
(He goes closer as he got curious.)

1844
01:15:44,969 --> 01:15:46,700
I don't know what this is.

1845
01:15:48,469 --> 01:15:50,169
- It looks like a perilla leaf.
- Yes.

1846
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:51,809
Is it a veggie wrap?

1847
01:15:52,209 --> 01:15:54,040
You must've never seen it.

1848
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,610
(What is that?)

1849
01:15:57,610 --> 01:15:58,709
- What is it?
- What is it?

1850
01:15:59,249 --> 01:16:00,280
Is it a veggie wrap place?

1851
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,379
What's this?

1852
01:16:04,049 --> 01:16:05,490
- Betel.
- Betel?

1853
01:16:05,490 --> 01:16:07,559
- Yes. It's paan.
- Paan?

1854
01:16:07,559 --> 01:16:08,719
- Paan.
- Yes.

1855
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:11,389
- Do you eat it?
- Yes.

1856
01:16:11,389 --> 01:16:13,389
After chewing, you spit it.

1857
01:16:13,389 --> 01:16:14,959
What is it?

1858
01:16:14,959 --> 01:16:16,830
- It's for the mouth.
- To clean it?

1859
01:16:16,830 --> 01:16:19,330
- I guess it rinses your mouth. Gargling.
- Like gargling?

1860
01:16:19,330 --> 01:16:21,240
- Really?
- Isn't it for your teeth?

1861
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:25,709
It's an Indian dessert called paan.

1862
01:16:25,839 --> 01:16:28,440
They put various ingredients
on a betel leaf...

1863
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,910
like crystallized fruits, raisins,
and peppermint essence.

1864
01:16:30,910 --> 01:16:33,809
And they fold it. It's the street food...

1865
01:16:33,879 --> 01:16:35,480
to clean your teeth.

1866
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,020
It's like a snack that cleans plaque.

1867
01:16:37,020 --> 01:16:38,190
(It's street food people chew
to keep their mouths clean.)

1868
01:16:38,520 --> 01:16:39,889
- Yes. Actually,
- It's like chewing gum.

1869
01:16:39,889 --> 01:16:42,320
the man who was in front of me...

1870
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:44,160
was so close when he was talking.

1871
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:45,860
So I worried he might have bad breath.

1872
01:16:45,860 --> 01:16:47,459
But he had nice breath.

1873
01:16:48,299 --> 01:16:51,169
- Was it refreshing?
- He had a really nice breath.

1874
01:16:51,169 --> 01:16:52,700
- Because of the peppermint?
- Yes.

1875
01:16:52,870 --> 01:16:54,669
- This is fire paan.
- What?

1876
01:16:54,669 --> 01:16:56,040
- Fire paan.
- Fire paan?

1877
01:16:56,040 --> 01:16:58,209
Just like there are different kinds
of toothpaste.

1878
01:16:58,209 --> 01:16:59,440
You're right.

1879
01:17:00,669 --> 01:17:02,209
Fire paan, please.

1880
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:04,610
- Okay.
- This is a one-time thing.

1881
01:17:04,610 --> 01:17:05,980
Take everything you need.

1882
01:17:07,879 --> 01:17:09,980
(On the chopped fruits)

1883
01:17:10,780 --> 01:17:11,790
Salt.

1884
01:17:12,589 --> 01:17:14,259
- It's coconut.
- Coconut?

1885
01:17:16,919 --> 01:17:19,360
(Lighting a fire)

1886
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:20,490
And he has to chew it?

1887
01:17:21,929 --> 01:17:23,830
- Is he putting it in his mouth?
- With the fire on?

1888
01:17:23,830 --> 01:17:25,870
Oh, my. Is that okay?

1889
01:17:26,030 --> 01:17:28,999
(Putting in)

1890
01:17:29,070 --> 01:17:30,400
Is that okay?

1891
01:17:33,740 --> 01:17:35,809
It must've reached his throat.

1892
01:17:36,009 --> 01:17:38,179
- It got me surprised.
- It reached his throat.

1893
01:17:38,249 --> 01:17:40,280
He put it as deep as here.

1894
01:17:40,809 --> 01:17:43,249
- Is that okay?
- He put the hot thing in his mouth.

1895
01:17:43,249 --> 01:17:45,719
- That's why it's called fire paan.
- Did you get the fire one?

1896
01:17:47,389 --> 01:17:49,820
(He lets out a big laugh as he's shocked.)

1897
01:17:49,820 --> 01:17:51,860
He's happy as it got
right into his mouth properly.

1898
01:17:52,059 --> 01:17:53,559
Isn't that foil?

1899
01:17:53,559 --> 01:17:55,759
He almost stuffed it in his mouth.

1900
01:17:56,259 --> 01:17:58,570
It's very nice.

1901
01:17:58,570 --> 01:17:59,599
Okay.

1902
01:18:01,370 --> 01:18:03,440
I think he burnt his tongue.

1903
01:18:04,740 --> 01:18:06,440
That must've hurt the roof of his mouth.

1904
01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,780
He must just be chewing, right?

1905
01:18:08,780 --> 01:18:09,879
Gosh. That's funny.

1906
01:18:10,080 --> 01:18:11,549
Try one.

1907
01:18:11,749 --> 01:18:13,480
- Okay. One.
- One.

1908
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:14,879
That's not foil, right?

1909
01:18:15,419 --> 01:18:17,020
- Okay.
- Oh, he's going to try it.

1910
01:18:18,650 --> 01:18:20,719
(Order's up.)

1911
01:18:22,690 --> 01:18:26,889
(Bravely sticking out his tongue)

1912
01:18:27,490 --> 01:18:30,530
(The locals are excited too.)

1913
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:33,870
(Open wide. Fire's coming in.)

1914
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:35,099
- Oh, my!
- Good.

1915
01:18:35,299 --> 01:18:37,639
(Docking it in the back of his throat)

1916
01:18:37,639 --> 01:18:38,740
Oh, my!

1917
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:41,009
He really stuck it in there.

1918
01:18:41,009 --> 01:18:43,379
(Oh, my)

1919
01:18:43,379 --> 01:18:44,879
He stuck it in there.

1920
01:18:46,549 --> 01:18:49,280
(He chews it since it's in his mouth.)

1921
01:18:49,280 --> 01:18:50,749
(Oh, no!)

1922
01:18:51,290 --> 01:18:54,559
(Enjoying the taste
with his facial muscles)

1923
01:18:54,559 --> 01:18:56,059
- Good!
- Yes. Good!

1924
01:18:56,860 --> 01:18:58,730
(Oh, no!)

1925
01:18:59,259 --> 01:19:01,099
- Oh, no! Good!
- What is that?

1926
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,230
- What...
- Oh, no!

1927
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:04,700
(Oh, yeah!)

1928
01:19:04,700 --> 01:19:05,830
How much?

1929
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,870
- It's 100 rupees.
- It's 500?

1930
01:19:08,700 --> 01:19:09,799
How much?

1931
01:19:10,469 --> 01:19:11,469
(Please take my money.)

1932
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:12,509
Look at him.

1933
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:13,839
I wanted to leave quickly. Okay.

1934
01:19:13,839 --> 01:19:14,940
Oh, my stomach hurts.

1935
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:16,280
Spit it out!

1936
01:19:19,650 --> 01:19:21,320
It's not a taste
that exists in this world.

1937
01:19:21,749 --> 01:19:24,179
This isn't food
from this world. Seriously.

1938
01:19:24,490 --> 01:19:25,549
I'm so curious.

1939
01:19:25,549 --> 01:19:28,559
It's not food. It's on another dimension.

1940
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:30,860
It's a taste from another world.

1941
01:19:32,190 --> 01:19:34,599
But when we think about it,
it's fruit crystallized in sugar,

1942
01:19:34,599 --> 01:19:35,599
- coconut...
- Exactly.

1943
01:19:35,599 --> 01:19:37,999
It's not a taste
that's within the food category.

1944
01:19:37,999 --> 01:19:39,770
- Yes.
- Wasn't it really hot?

1945
01:19:40,230 --> 01:19:41,799
- It wasn't hot.
- Oh, really?

1946
01:19:41,799 --> 01:19:44,040
That made it fresher.

1947
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,639
- That made it refreshing.
- Yes.

1948
01:19:46,339 --> 01:19:47,339
Good!

1949
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,940
Very interesting!

1950
01:19:49,179 --> 01:19:50,240
Oh, good!

1951
01:19:50,240 --> 01:19:51,650
- You're walking backwards.
- Walking backwards!

1952
01:19:51,650 --> 01:19:54,009
- Stepping backwards.
- Why are you walking backwards?

1953
01:19:54,009 --> 01:19:55,020
You lost there.

1954
01:19:55,020 --> 01:19:56,849
(Yes...)

1955
01:19:56,849 --> 01:19:58,049
Unbelievable!

1956
01:19:58,049 --> 01:19:59,520
(Oh, my! Unbelievable!)

1957
01:20:00,049 --> 01:20:02,160
(Glancing over)

1958
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:05,129
(Looking all around
in case they catch him)

1959
01:20:05,129 --> 01:20:07,929
It's like an anti-smoking medicine. Gosh.

1960
01:20:08,530 --> 01:20:09,900
I think I can quit smoking.

1961
01:20:10,799 --> 01:20:11,999
(Clearing his throat)

1962
01:20:12,669 --> 01:20:13,999
(At risk again)

1963
01:20:13,999 --> 01:20:15,770
Oh, no. There's still some left.

1964
01:20:16,070 --> 01:20:17,099
The aftermath.

1965
01:20:17,099 --> 01:20:18,370
Oh, no.

1966
01:20:18,370 --> 01:20:19,540
(Dry heaving with nothing coming out)

1967
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:23,379
(Oh, my)

1968
01:20:24,780 --> 01:20:26,209
(Delirious)

1969
01:20:26,209 --> 01:20:27,280
Delicious!

1970
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:29,749
- Oh, really.
- Your face got red.

1971
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:32,419
Out of all of the food
I've eaten in 40 years,

1972
01:20:33,450 --> 01:20:35,459
it's the most unfamiliar and most...

1973
01:20:35,459 --> 01:20:36,459
There's...

1974
01:20:37,160 --> 01:20:38,490
nothing to compare it to.

1975
01:20:40,459 --> 01:20:43,259
(The refreshing taste
left a deep impression on his throat.)

1976
01:20:43,259 --> 01:20:44,830
Oh, I want to go home.

1977
01:20:46,599 --> 01:20:49,040
(India and Kian84 grew apart a bit.)

1978
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,410
(Will India and Kian84
be able to grow closer again?)

1979
01:20:52,040 --> 01:20:55,540
(Every part of Varanasi is full of charm.)

1980
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,339
(I'm your fan.)

1981
01:20:58,009 --> 01:20:59,309
(Kian84)

1982
01:20:59,650 --> 01:21:01,419
(Full of extroverts
with Bollywood-level excitement)

1983
01:21:02,320 --> 01:21:03,679
(The area of joy)

1984
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,620
(And)

1985
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:09,059
(The area of sadness...)

1986
01:21:09,059 --> 01:21:10,919
(where you can meet death)

1987
01:21:11,830 --> 01:21:14,459
(He feels a growing emptiness
from the crossing of joy and sadness.)

1988
01:21:14,959 --> 01:21:16,530
(I'm here to fill...)

1989
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:21,540
(that feeling of emptiness, Kian84.)

1990
01:21:21,969 --> 01:21:23,969
(Attacking Kian84 with his charms
as soon as he arrives)

1991
01:21:23,969 --> 01:21:25,070
(Dizzy)

1992
01:21:25,540 --> 01:21:28,740
(Thanks to Dex's special care,)

1993
01:21:29,410 --> 01:21:32,480
(even the blankets feel nice and soft.)

1994
01:21:33,150 --> 01:21:37,349
(Their first trip gets a sweet start.)

1995
01:21:37,790 --> 01:21:39,349
(India's gym in the wilderness?)

1996
01:21:39,790 --> 01:21:42,219
(Throwing yesterday's foxiness off)

1997
01:21:43,020 --> 01:21:45,360
(Exploding with wild charms)

1998
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:46,429
(Heart pounding)

1999
01:21:46,559 --> 01:21:48,730
(My younger brother's amazing!)

2000
01:21:49,059 --> 01:21:51,999
(They grow closer
from working out together.)

2001
01:21:51,999 --> 01:21:53,299
(Strong)

2002
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:56,169
(The raw, unfiltered journey
of two naked, wild men...)

2003
01:21:56,169 --> 01:21:57,770
(getting used to India)

2004
01:21:58,410 --> 01:22:00,139
(Adventure by Accident 2)
